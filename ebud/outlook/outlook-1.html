        </font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>A. What led you to the study of the
        Buddha's teaching?</i>
        <p>B. When I first came to Thailand I was naturally interested in
        knowing more about the Thai people. I wanted to learn more about their
        customs and about their way of thinking. I found the study of Buddhism
        essential for the understanding of the Thai culture because the
        spiritual background of the Thai people is Buddhism.</p>
        <p>Therefore I started to study Buddhism and the more I studied, the
        more I found my interest growing. When one is in Thailand one should
        take the opportunity to study Buddhism and to understand the practice of
        Buddhism as well. Deep understanding will not come from books alone.
        Understanding is developed above all by the practice, by understanding
        Buddhism as it is lived in daily life!</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>A. Would you tell me what you mean by
        the practice of Buddhism in daily life?</i>
        <p>B. One is first confronted with the practice of Buddhism when one
        sees different customs of the Thais, such as giving food to the monks,
        paying respect to the Buddha image or reciting the 'precepts' on special
        occasions such as <i>Uposatha Day</i> [<i>Uposatha Day</i> is the day of
        'fasting' or 'vigil' which laypeople usually observe four times a month
        (the days of the new moon, full moon and the two days of the half moon)
        by undertaking moral precepts and by visiting the temple].</p>
        <p>In the beginning I thought that these customs were mixed with many
        things which are not essential for the practice of Buddhism. For
        example, I did not see how the presenting of eggs to the statue of the
        Emerald Buddha could have anything to do with the practice of Buddhism.
        However, even such popular beliefs can teach us something about the
        practice of Buddhism.</p>
        <p>There are many levels of understanding the Buddha's teachings. The
        people who present the eggs to the statue of the Buddha express their
        confidence in him. This is a wholesome act which will bear its fruit
        accordingly.However, the people who present the eggs may not realise
        that it is their respect to the Buddha which will bring them a good
        result and not the eggs presented to him. They may not clearly see which
        cause will bring them which result. They would receive greater benefit
        from their act of paying respect to the Buddha if this were done in a
        more meaningful way. They could, for example, pay respect to the Buddha
        in abstaining from ill deeds, in serving other people, in learning more
        about the teachings of the Buddha and in helping other people to
        understand the teachings as well.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>A. Could you tell me about the
        different degrees of understanding the Buddha's teaching ?</i></p>
        <p>B. As regards paying respect to Buddha image, people who have a
        higher level of understanding know that the Buddha has passed away
        completely. However, it still makes sense to pay respect to him. When
        one has studied the teachings more deeply and when one has tried to
        verify them in daily life, one understands that it is not important
        whether the Buddha still exists to receive people's homage or not. It is
        the wholesome mental state of the person who pays respect to the Buddha
        or who offers something to him, that will bring its result to the person
        who performs it. One reaps what one has sown.</p>
        <p>The person who pays respect to the Buddha with the right
        understanding does not have a confused idea of a Buddha in heaven who
        could see him or hear him. The image of the Buddha reminds him of the
        virtues of the Buddha. He thinks of the wisdom of the Buddha who found
        the path to complete freedom from sorrow all by himself and who able to
        help other people as well to find this path. He thinks of the purity in
        all his deeds, his speech and his thoughts. He thinks of compassion of
        the Buddha, who taught out of compassion for everybody.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>A. What is the meaning of giving food
        to the monks?</i>
        <p>B. As regards the giving of food to the monks, some people doubt
        whether that is of any use. They are inclined to think that monks want
        to have an easy life, and that they do not have to work at all. But they
        forget that the real meaning of being a monk is seeking the truth.
        <p>A monk's life is a hard life; he does not have a family life, he
        cannot choose his own food, and he does not take part in any
        entertainment such as going to movies or football matches. He renounces
        the luxuries of a home, choice of clothing and food, and entertainment
        in order to seek the truth and to help other people to find the truth as
        well.</p>
        <p>When people give food to the monks their act is one which will be
        fruitful for both parties. The giver will benefit from his act because
        he has a wholesome mental state at the time of giving: when there is
        generosity there is no greed or attachment. The receiver will benefit
        from the act of the giver because he is encouraged to study and practise
        the Buddhist teachings more earnestly and to help other people to know
        the teachings as well. He knows that the food he receives puts him under
        an obligation to be worthy of the gift, to work for the spiritual
        welfare of the whole world. Monks are continually reminded of their
        responsibility as monks, and twice a month they recite the rules of
        Patimokkha, in which their obligations are summed up. Further, when the
        receiver is aware of the wholesome mental state of the giver, he will
        rejoice in the good deeds of the giver and thus he will have a wholesome
        mental state as well; he will be inspired by the generosity of the
        giver.
        <p><i>A. Do you not find it difficult to think in terms of 'mental
        states'? And thinking of one's own mental state might seem an egocentric
        attitude.</i>
        <p>B. This way of thinking is very realistic, because it is the
        different mental states which make us act in this way or in that. Only
        if we study our mental states and the many factors which cause them to
        be like this or like that, will we be able to understand the deepest
        motives of our behavior. We have to start by being aware of our own
        mental states. This is not egocentric, because we have to understand
        ourselves first, before we can understand other people.</p>
        <p>Through the study of the <i>Abhidhamma</i> also, one can begin to
        have more understanding of one's mental states. The <i>Abhidhamma</i> is
        that part of the Buddhist teachings which analyses the different states
        of mind and which explains in detail about everything which is real. The
        study of the <i>Abhidhamma</i> helps us to understand which causes bring
        which effects in our life and in the lives of other people.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>A. Do you find that you can verify
        the Abhidhamma in your daily life?</i>
        <p>B. It was a great discovery for me to find that the <i>Abhidhamma</i>
        can be verified in daily life, although one can in the beginning
        experience only part of the realities the <i>Abhidhamma</i> explains.</p>
        <p>At first one might think that the <i>Abhidhamma</i> is too subtle and
        one might doubt whether it is useful to study the many different degrees
        of ignorance and wisdom, but one learns that each of these different
        degrees brings its corresponding result.</p>
        <p>In studying <i>Abhidhamma</i> one learns to understand more about
        other people as well. One learns that people are different because of
        different accumulations of experiences in the past. Because of these
        different accumulations people behave differently. At each moment one
        accumulates new experiences, and this conditions what one will be like
        and what one will experience in the future.</p>
        <p>When one understands more about the different accumulations of
        different people, one is less inclined to judge other people. When one
        sees people paying respect to the Buddha with apparently very little
        understanding one knows that their accumulations are thus and that they
        are performing a wholesome act according to their ability.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>A. Do you think that a person with
        very little understanding can ever reach a level of higher
        understanding? In other words, if one's accumulations have conditions
        one's character, is there anything that can be done about it?Is it
        possible to improve one's degree of understanding?</i></p>
        <p>B. Everything can be done about it: wisdom can be developed gradually
        and thus one's accumulations can be changed. Those who have a higher
        level of understanding can and should help other people to develop a
        higher level of understanding as well.</p>
        <p>I shall give an example. Children can become novices. They share the
        life of the monks in order to learn more about the Buddhist teachings
        and to make merit for their parents who can rejoice in their good deeds.
        Many people think that the person who makes merit can literally transfer
        his own good deeds to other people, dead or alive. This is not the right
        understanding. It is not possible to transfer merit to other people,
        because everyone will receive the result of his own deeds. Older monks
        who have reached a higher level of understanding can help the novices to
        have more understanding about the wholesome act they are performing. If
        they could understand correctly the meaning of the merit they make,
        their renunciation would be even more fruitful. The novices are
        performing a very wholesome act in renouncing the company of their
        relatives in order to study the Buddhist teachings and to train
        themselves in the precepts, which are moral rules. This gives them a
        good spiritual foundation for their whole life. They will receive the
        fruit of this wholesome act themselves. The merit they make cannot
        literally be transferred to other people. However, other people, no
        matter whether they are deceased or still alive, can have wholesome
        states of mind inspired by the good deeds of someone else. Their own
        wholesome mental states will bring them a wholesome result. So parents,
        even deceased parents, if they are in places of existence where they can
        rejoice in the good deeds of their child, may have wholesome states of
        mind and in this way experience a wholesome result in the future. The
        expression 'transfer of merit' is a misleading one, because it does not
        give us the understanding of the real cause and effect.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>A. You used the expression 'mental
        state'. Could you explain what it means? I would like to ask you in
        general whether you find the English language adequate to render the
        real meaning of the realities which are described in the Abhidhamma?</i></p>
        <p>B. The English language is nt at all adequate to render the meaning
        of the realities which are described in the <i>Abhidhamma</i>. The
        'Three Collections' of the teachings (<i>Tipitaka</i>) use the Pali
        terms, and therefore it is better to learn the Pali terms and their
        meaning. For instance, the word 'mental state' which is a translation of
        the Pali term '<i>citta</i>', is misleading. 'State' implies something
        which stays for some time, be it short or long. However, each mental
        state or <i>citta</i> falls away immediately, as soon as it has arisen,
        to be succeeded by the next <i>citta</i>. This happens more rapidly than
        a lightning flash. The different cittas succeed one another so rapidly
        that it seems that there is only one citta. That is the reason why
        people take a citta for 'self'.</p>
        <p>For the same reason the word 'mind' gives one a wrong idea of
        reality. One often hears the expression 'mastering one's mind' or
        'controlling one's mind'. Many people think that the mind is something
        static which can be grasped and controlled. There are many different
        mental states, none of which can be considered as 'self' or as belonging
        to a 'self'.</p>
        <p>In the 'Lesser Discourse to Saccaka' (<i>Culasaccaka-sutta, Majjhima
        Nikaya I, Mahayamaka-vagga</i>) we read that the Buddha asked Saccaka
        whether he could be master of his body or of his mind, just as a king
        rules over his subjects. The Buddha asked: 'When you speak thus:
        &quot;The body is myself,&quot; have you power over this body of yours
        (and can you say), &quot;Let my body be thus, let my body be not
        thus&quot;?' The Buddha asked the same question about the mind. Saccaka
        answered that it is not possible.</p>
        <p>In daily life we can find out that this is true. If we were masters
        of our bodies we would not grow older, there would not be sickness, and
        we would not die. However, old age, sickness and death are unavoidable.</p>
        <p>Neither can we be masters of our minds; the mental states which arise
        are beyond control. Like and dislike are beyond control, they arise when
        there are conditions. When we eat food which is prepared to our taste,
        we cannot help liking it. If someone insults us we cannot help feeling
        aversion; we may reason later and try to understand the other person,
        but we cannot help feeling aversion at first. Like, dislike, and even
        reasoning about our like and dislike are not 'self', they are different
        mental states which arise when there are the right conditions.</p>
        <p>We are all inclined to take mental states for 'self'; for example,
        when we like something we take the like for 'self'. However, the next
        moment there could be dislike, and we might wonder where the like which
        we took for 'self' has gone.</p>
        <p>It is very human to like the idea of a 'self' and to hold on to it.
        The Buddha knew this and therefore, after his enlightenment, felt
        inclined for a moment not to teach other people the Path he had found.
        However, the Buddha knew also that people have different levels of
        understanding. We read in the '<i>Samyutta Nikaya</i>' (Sagatha-vagga,
        Chapter VI, The Brahma Sutta, Chapter I, par.1, The Entreaty) that the
        Buddha surveyed the world with his 'Buddha-vision' and saw people with
        different levels of understanding, some of whom would be able to
        understand his teaching:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <font face="Times New Roman">As in a pool of blue or red or white
          lotus, some lotus plants born in the water, emerge not, but grow up
          and thrive sunken beneath the surface; and other lotus plants, born in
          the water and growing up in the water rise to the surface; and other
          lotus plants, born in the water and growing up in the water, stand
          thrusting themselves above the water and unwetted by it, even so did
          the Exalted One look down over the world with a Buddha's Eye, and see
          beings whose eyes were scarcely dimmed by dust, beings whose eyes were
          sorely dimmed by dust, beings sharp of sense and blunted of sense,
          beings of good and beings of evil disposition, beings docile and
          beings indocile, some among them living with a perception of the
          danger of other worlds (namely in rebirth)and of wrongdoing.</font>
        </blockquote>
        <font face="Times New Roman">Therefore the Buddha decided to make known
        the Path which he had discovered.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>A. People have different
        accumulations. They are conditioned in many ways. We have used the word
        'condition' several times already. Could you explain the meaning of this
        term?</i></p>
        <p>B. I will give an example from daily life. My husband comes home from
        his office, feeling tired and somewhat irritated. I tell him something
        amusing which has happened and he laughs and feels happy again. Thus one
        can notice that there are different cittas, and that each citta has its
        own conditions. The amount of work at the office is a condition for my
        husband's tiredness and irritation. Afterwards there is another
        condition which makes him feel happy again.</p>
        <p>Cittas are conditioned and each citta accumulates a new experience,
        which will condition cittas in the future.Everybody accumulates
        different tastes, abilities, likes and dislikes.One can not always know
        the conditions which make people behave on this or in that way, but
        sometimes it is possible to know.For instance, people are addicted to
        different things, some of which are very harmful, other less so.One's
        education and the surroundings in which one is living can be a condition
        for these addictions.In some countries or regions it is the custom to
        drink an enormous amount of coffee the whole day, and people even give
        coffee to one's youth.As regards attachment to alcoholic drinks, there
        must be a condition for that as well.One starts with a little drink
        every day, and gradually one's attachment increases.</p>
        <p>Everybody should find out for himself how much attachment he
        accumulates, and whether this brings him happiness or sorrow.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>A.There is not anything which one can
        control.Even each citta which arises because of conditions, falls away
        immediately, to be succeeded by the next citta.It seems as if the
        situation is hopeless.Could you tell me whether something can be done to
        walk the right way in life?</i></p>
        <p>B.The situation is not hopeless.Wisdom, the understanding of reality,
        can condition one to have more wholesome mental states and to do good
        deeds.</p>
        <p>There is no 'self' which can suppress our bad inclinations; there is
        no 'self' which can force us to do good deeds.Everybody can verify this
        in daily life.For example, if we tell ourselves: 'Today I will be very
        kind to everybody', can we prevent ourselves from suddenly saying an
        unkind word? Most of the time it has happened before we realize it.</p>
        <p>If we are able to suppress our anger for a while we are inclined to
        think that there is a 'self' which can suppress anger. In reality there
        are at that moment cites which are not conditioned by anger, but which
        arise from other conditions. Afterwards there will be anger again
        because anger is not really eradicated by suppression. Only wisdom,
        seeing things as they are, can very gradually eradicate everything which
        is unwholesome in us.</p>
        <p>We can develop this wisdom step by step. Even wisdom is not 'self';
        it can only arise when there are the right conditions. We can develop
        wisdom in knowing and experiencing all mental phenomena and physical
        phenomena in and around ourselves. When we have experienced that none of
        these mental and physical phenomena stays or is permanent, we understand
        that we cannot take any phenomenon for 'self'.</p>
        <p>The Buddha explained to his disciples that just 'comprehending',
        seeing things as they are, will eradicate unwholesomeness. When we are
        still learning to develop wisdom and we notice that we have unwholesome
        cites, we are troubled about it, we have aversion because of it.He whose
        wisdom is developed, has right understanding of his life. He knows that
        there is no 'self', and that everything arises because of conditions.
        Thus he is not troubled, he is simply aware of the present moment.</p>
        <p>The word 'comprehending' is used in the suttas many times. This
        should help us to see that we do not have to perform extraordinary
        deeds; we need only be aware of the present moment in order to see
        things as they are. Of course wisdom cannot be fully developed in one
        day.For a long time we have been used to the idea of 'self'.In
        conventional language we have to use the words 'I' and 'self'
        continually to make ourselves understood.</p>
        <p><i>A. So wisdom is wholesome, and not understanding things as they
        are is unwholesome and brings unhappiness. Do you find that you can
        prove this in daily life?</i></p>
        <p>B.Yes, I will give an example.We are constantly taking our body for
        'self', although we know that it does not last. Thus, when we suffer
        from sickness or pain, or when we become old, we attach so much
        importance to these facts that we feel quite oppressed by them. If one
        of our sense organs does not function or if we become an invalid, we
        feel we are the most unhappy person in the world. Attachment to our body
        only bring sorrow, whether as if we would see things as they are, there
        would be less sorrow for us.</p>
        <p>If one wants to see the body as it really is, one should distinguish
        the body from mentality. It is true that in this world body and
        mentality condition each other. However, one should know the different
        characteristics of each, so that one can experience them as they are.</p>
        <p>The same elements which constitute dead matter constitute the body as
        well. Both dead matter and the body are composed of the earth element or
        solidity, the element of water or cohesion, the element of fire or
        temperature and the element of wind or motion. One is inclined to think:
        'Is there not a soul which makes the body alive and is the body not
        therefore different from dead matter?' There is not a soul; there are
        only physical phenomena and mental phenomena which arise and fall away
        all the time. We are not used to distinguishing the body from the mind
        and analysing them as to what they really are. However, this is
        necessary if we want to know reality.</p>
        <p>The body itself does not know anything; in this respect it is the
        same as dead matter. If we can see that the body is only a composition
        of physical phenomena which arise and fall away completely, and not
        'self', and that the mind is a series of mental phenomena which arise
        and fall away and not 'self', the veil of ignorance will fall from our
        eyes.</p>
        <p>If one tries to develop this understanding one can see for oneself
        what the result is. One can find out whether this understanding brings
        one more freedom from attachment or not. Attachment brings sorrow.</p>
        <p>The Buddha taught people to see things as they are. One does not have
        to fast or to be an ascetic.It is one's duty to look after one's body
        and to feed it. The Buddha taught the 'Middle Way': one does not have to
        force oneself to undertake difficult practices, but on the other hand
        one should learn to be detached from the things in and around
        oneself.Just understanding, seeing things as they are, that is the
        'Middle Way'.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>A. So just seeing things as they are
        is the practice of vipassana. Most people think that it is a complicated
        form of meditation which one can learn only in a meditation centre. That
        is the reason why most people will not even try it. But from our
        conversation it appears that vipassana is only seeing the things of our
        daily life as they are. Do you find that one has to have much
        theoretical knowledge before one starts the practice of vipassana?</i></p>
        <p>B. The word 'meditation' frightens many people; they think that it
        must be something very complicated. But in reality one does not have to
        do anything special. Before one starts one needs some theoretical
        knowledge. One does not have to know about physical and mental elements
        in detail; one only has to know that the body is made up of physical
        elements and that the body is different from mental elements. There are
        many different physical elements and these elements are continually
        changing. There are many different mental elements: one citta arises and
        falls away, then the next citta arises and falls away. Cittas arise and
        fall away successively, one at a time. Seeing is one citta, hearing is
        another citta, thinking is another citta, they are all different cittas.</p>
        <p>Developing vipassana does not mean that one has to be aware of all
        those different elements at each moment; that would not be possible. Nor
        does one have to do anything special; one can perform all the activities
        of one's daily life. One gradually begins to understand that there are
        only physical phenomena and mental phenomena and one begins to be aware
        of these phenomena quite naturally, without having to force oneself,
        because they are there all the time.</p>
        <p>When one understands how important it is to be aware of these
        phenomena in order to know them, the awareness will arise by itself
        little by little. One will experience that awareness will arise when
        there are the right conditions. It does not matter if there is not a
        great deal of awareness in the beginning. It is important to understand
        that awareness is not 'self' either, but a mental phenomena which arises
        when there are the right conditions. One cannot force awareness to
        arise.</p>
        <p>In understanding more about physical phenomena and mental phenomena
        and in being aware of them in daily life one's wisdom will develop. Thus
        there will be more wholesomeness and less unwholesomeness.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>A. Do you find that awareness in this
        way bring you happiness?</i></p>
        <p>B.When there is understanding of what things really are, there will
        be more wholesomeness in one's life. There will be less the concept of
        'self' when one performs good deeds, and thus good deeds will be purer.
        One does not refrain from evil things because one has to follow certain
        rules, but because one has more understanding as to which causes bring
        which effects.</p>
        <p>The right understanding of what things are will very gradually
        eradicate unwholesomeness. When there is less unwholesomeness there will
        be more happiness in life.</p>
        <p>Everybody should verify this for himself!</p>
