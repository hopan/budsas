        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">W</font>hat is the effect
        of the Buddha's teachings on people's actions?&nbsp; In what way could
        the Buddha's teachings effectively help people to perform wholesome
        deeds?&nbsp; Is it possible to do good deeds because a person with
        authority tells us: 'Be detached and do good deeds'?</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">From experience we know that a good
        example might help to some extent, but the source of the good deeds is
        within ourselves: our mentality determines our actions.&nbsp; If someone
        wants to do his utmost to help other people he should understand himself
        first. He should understand the causes which make him act in this or in
        that way.&nbsp; If he develops the right understanding of these causes
        he will be able to lead a more wholesome life and to help other people
        in the most effective way.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mentality is the source from which deeds
        spring: it is therefore not possible to determine the degree of
        wholesomeness from the outward appearance of deeds alone.&nbsp; There
        are many gradations of wholesomeness depending on the mentality which
        motivates the good deed.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people give money to needy people,
        but that does not mean that there may not still be conceit or other
        selfish motives.&nbsp; Others give without conceit, but they may have
        attachment: they give only to people they like.&nbsp; There are people
        who give out of pure lovingkindness, without any thought of
        attachment.&nbsp; This is a more wholesome way of giving.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We may wonder whether the study of so
        many details is necessary.&nbsp; In daily life we will see that it is
        very helpful to know the different kinds of citta and to know which
        citta motivates which kinds of citta and to know which citta motivates
        which kind of action.&nbsp; When we are able to know the different kinds
        of citta which succeed one another very rapidly, we will see that even
        while we are performing a wholesome deed, unwholesome cittas can succeed
        the wholesome cittas very closely.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Wholesome' is the translation of
        the Pali term '<i>kusala</i>'.&nbsp; A wholesome deed in its widest
        sense means a deed which brings no harm to oneself or to other people at
        the moment the deed is done or later on.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the 'Discourse on the Foreign Cloth'
        (Middle Length Sayings II, No. 88) we read about wholesome deeds,
        wholesome speech and wholesome thoughts, 'skilled' bodily conduct:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>'But what, revered sir, is skilled bodily conduct?'<br>
          'Whatever the bodily conducts, sire, that has no blemish'</p>
          <p>'But what, revered sir, is the bodily conduct that has no blemish?'<br>
          'Whatever the bodily conduct, sire, that is non-injurious.'</p>
          <p>'And what, revered sir, is the bodily conduct that is
          non-injurious?'<br>
          'Whatever the bodily conduct, sire, that is joyous in result.'</p>
          <p>'And what, revered sir, is the bodily conduct that is joyous in
          result?'<br>
          'Whatever bodily conduct, sire, does not conduce to the torment of
          self and does not conduce to the torment of others and does not
          conduce to the torment of both, and by which the unskilled states
          dwindle away, the skilled states increase much….'</font>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The same is said about wholesome speech
        and wholesome thoughts.&nbsp; These words render the meaning of
        wholesome or 'kusala' in its widest sense.&nbsp; However, there are many
        intensities of kusala.&nbsp; There are higher degrees of wholesomeness
        than just abstaining from ill deeds which will harm oneself and
        others.&nbsp; IN developing 'Right Understanding' or wisdom, there can
        be kusala of a higher degree.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Wisdom'; is a translation of the Pali
        term '<i>panna</i>.'&nbsp; <i>Panna</i> does not only mean knowledge
        acquired from the study of books, <i>panna</i> is insight into the
        realities of daily life as well.&nbsp; <i>Panna</i> can be developed in
        daily life.&nbsp; The degree of wholesomeness depends on the degree of <i>panna</i>
        which accompanies the wholesome <i>citta</i>.&nbsp; There are many
        degrees of <i>panna</i>, and each degree brings its result accordingly.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is a typical Buddhist approach to
        life to study and to be aware of the different mental and physical
        phenomena which one can experience through eyes, ears, nose, tongue,
        body-sense and mind.&nbsp; If one is not used to this approach one might
        feel somewhat bewildered at first.&nbsp; However, after one has studied
        more these mental and physical phenomena, one will find out that only
        thus is it possible to understand the different ways in which oneself
        and other people behave, and to know which causes bring which effects in
        life.&nbsp; It makes no sense to speak in vague, general terms about
        realities, because the real understanding of our experiences in life can
        never be developed in that way.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Someone told me about a monk who was
        preaching in a way which was of great help to people in their daily
        lives.&nbsp; When I asked what the monk was preaching, the answer was
        that he was speaking about '<i>citcai</i>.'&nbsp; '<i>Citcai</i>' is the
        word in Thai for 'state of mind,' in Pali '<i>citta</i>.'&nbsp; This
        monk had the right approach to life.&nbsp; One should follow the example
        of the Buddha; one should not only tell people to do good deeds, but one
        should teach them as well how to do good deeds.&nbsp; In order to know
        how to do good deeds one should go back to the source of the good deeds;
        the mental states or 'cittas.'&nbsp; It is preferable to use the Pali
        term 'citta' rather than a translation from the Pali since translations
        do not render the meaning of the terms adequately.&nbsp; For example,
        the English translation of '<i>citta</i>' as 'state of mind' or 'mental
        state,' implies something which stays, which does not change.&nbsp; But
        that is not a characteristic of citta.&nbsp; When one has leaned more
        about '<i>cittas</i>' one will find out that there is no citta which
        stays even for a second.&nbsp; Each <i>citta</i> which arises falls away
        immediately, to be succeeded by the next citta.&nbsp; <i>Cittas</i>
        determine one's own life and the life of other people; they condition
        the actions one performs in life.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many people are not used to this
        approach; they are not used to looking at the outward appearance of
        things.&nbsp; Scientists are very advanced in the study of out space,
        but little is know about what goes on inwardly in man.&nbsp; People are
        used to paying attention to the things they see and hear, but they are
        not used to attending to seeing-consciousness and to
        hearing-consciousness.&nbsp; They do not think of the <i>cittas</i>
        which perform the functions of seeing and hearing.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Seeing-consciousness and
        hearing-consciousness are realities as well and it is therefore
        important to know more about them.&nbsp; That part of the Buddhist
        scriptures which analyses and explains mental phenomena and physical
        phenomena in detail is called the <i>Abhidhamma</i>.&nbsp; The <i>Abhidhamma</i>
        deals with everything which is real.&nbsp; Studying the <i>Abhidhamma</i>
        can change one's life.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many Thais listen to lectures about <i>Abhidhamma</i>,
        and not only those who have been educated at a college or university,
        but also those who have never received a higher education.&nbsp; I have
        heard of cases in which the study of different <i>cittas</i> has helped
        people to lead a more wholesome life.&nbsp; I heard of someone who was a
        first inclined to have feelings of revenge towards other people, and who
        was gradually able to overcome those feelings by understanding what
        those feelings were.&nbsp; Many Thais know about the realities taught in
        the <i>Abhidhamma</i>, and they know how to apply their knowledge in
        daily life.&nbsp; Foreigners do not usually hear about this because
        people do not often speak about <i>Abhidhamma</i> to foreigners.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Unwholesome mental states or '<i>Akusala
        cittas'</i> and wholesome mental states or '<i>kusala cittas</i>' are
        realities of daily life.&nbsp; In order to know more about these
        realities one should try to understand oneself first: if one does not
        understand oneself one cannot help other people.&nbsp; This does not
        mean however that we have to wait our whole life before we can start
        helping other people.&nbsp; Even those who are just beginning to
        understand things as they are can help other people to have right
        understanding too.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Panna</i> is the opposite of
        ignorance, which is the root of all defilement and sorrow.&nbsp; <i>Panna</i>
        is important for the development of kusala cittas.&nbsp; It is possible
        to do good deeds without <i>panna</i>, but if one wants to make progress
        in wholesomeness, <i>panna</i> should be developed.&nbsp; In
        understanding what is unwholesome and what is wholesome, and in
        understanding what is the result of unwholesome and of wholesome deeds,
        people are able to lead a more wholesome life.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are many degrees of <i>panna</i>.&nbsp;
        When a teacher explains to his pupils that wholesome <i>cittas</i> with
        gratitude or honesty will bring a wholesome result and that unwholesome
        deeds motivated by greed or anger will bring and unwholesome
        result.&nbsp; The explanation may be the condition for them to have some
        degrees of <i>panna</i>.&nbsp; With <i>panna</i> they may be able to
        cultivate <i>kusala cittas </i>and to perform more wholesome deeds.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a higher degree of panna when
        people realize the impermanence of all the things they enjoy in
        life.&nbsp; When people see how short human life is, they will try not
        to be attached too much to the pleasant things of life.&nbsp; This
        understanding will stimulate them to a greater generosity and to move
        readiness to help other people.&nbsp; They will be less selfish.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people who have this degree of <i>panna</i>
        might change their way of life and live contentedly without any
        luxury.&nbsp; Others might decide 'to go forth form home into
        homelessness;' they might decide to become monks.&nbsp; A monk's life is
        not an easy life.&nbsp; He lives without family and is 'one who is
        contented with little.'&nbsp; In the 'Discourse of the Sixfold
        Cleansing' (Middle Length Sayings III, No. 112) we read about a monk who
        tells of his renunciation of the world: '… I, your reverences, after a
        time, getting rid of my wealth, whether small or great, getting rid of
        my circle of relations, whether small or great, having cut off my hair
        and beard, having put on saffron robes, went forth from home into
        homelessness.'</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha explained that people are too
        much attached to the sense-impression, received through eyes, ears,
        nose, tongue and body.&nbsp; He speaks about the 'five strands of
        sense-pleasures.'&nbsp; We read in the 'Discourse With Subha' (Middle
        Length Saying II, No. 99) where the Buddha speaks with Subha about the
        five strands of sense-pleasures:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>… These five, brahman youth, are the strands of pleasures of the
          senses: What five?&nbsp; Material shapes cognizable by the eye,
          agreeable, pleasant, liked, enticing, connected with sensual
          pleasures, alluring.&nbsp; Sounds cognizable by the ear….. Smells
          cognizable by the nose …... Tastes cognizable by the tongue&nbsp;
          ….. Touches cognizable by the body, agreeable, pleasant, liked,
          enticing connected with sensual pleasures, alluring.&nbsp; These,
          brahman youth, are the five strands of sense-pleasures.&nbsp; Brahman
          youth, the brahman Pokkharasati or the Upamanna (clan) of the Subhaga
          forest glade, is enslaved and infatuated by these five strands of
          sense-pleasures, he is addicted to them, and enjoys them without
          seeing the peril (in them), without knowing the escape (from them)….</font>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Everyone would like to have pleasant
        sense-impressions and everyone is inclined to attach too much importance
        to them.&nbsp; One is so absorbed in what one sees and hears that one
        forgets that sense-impressions are not true happiness.&nbsp; In the
        'Discourse to Magandiya' (Middle Length Saying II, No. 75) the Buddha
        says to Magandiya:</font>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now I, Magandiya, when I was formerly
          a householder, endowed and provided with the five strands of
          sense-pleasures, revelled in them ….. But after a time, having known
          the coming to be and passing away of sense-pleasures and the
          satisfaction and the peril of them and the escape as it really is,
          getting rid of the craving for sense-pleasures, suppressing the fever
          for sense-pleasures, I dwelt devoid of thirst, my mind inwardly
          calmed.&nbsp; I saw other beings not yet devoid of attachment to
          sense-pleasures who were pursing sense-pleasures (although) they were
          being consumed by craving for sense-pleasures.&nbsp; I did not envy
          them: I had no delight therein…</font>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">People who understand that there is a
        higher happiness then the pleasures which one can enjoy through the five
        senses might apply themselves to the development of calm or '<i>samatha</i>.'&nbsp;
        The calm which is developed in <i>samatha</i> is temporary freedom from
        unwholesomeness, form attachment, anger and ignorance.&nbsp; There are
        several meditation subjects of <i>samatha</i>, such as recollection of
        the Buddha's virtue, mindfulness of breathing or lovingkindness.&nbsp;
        It depends on a person's accumulations which subject conditions calm for
        him. <i>Samatha</i> is not a matter of just trying to concentrate on an
        object.&nbsp; Most important is right understanding of the meditation
        subject and of the way to attain the calm which is wholesome by means of
        the meditation subject.&nbsp; If one does not know the difference
        between <i>kusala citta</i> and <i>akusala citta</i> one is likely to
        take attachment to silence for kusala and then samatha cannot be
        developed.&nbsp; One has to know the characteristic of calm which is
        wholesome, free from akusala.&nbsp; Then there can be conditions for
        more calm.&nbsp; Calm in <i>samatha</i> can reach such a high degree
        that one can becomes totally absorbed in the meditation subject.&nbsp;
        There are different stages of this calm absorption or '<i>jhana</i>.'&nbsp;
        During <i>jhana</i> one does not receive impressions through the five
        senses and thus one is at those moments not enslaved to them.&nbsp; One
        enjoys a higher happiness.&nbsp; In the higher stages of <i>jhana </i>one
        attains a greater tranquillity of mind until one no longer feels rapture
        or joy, one transcends happy feeling and there is equanimity
        instead.&nbsp; When, however, the <i>citta</i> is not <i>jhanacitta</i>,
        there are sense-impressions again.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Samatha</i> is a means for the
        cultivation of wholesomeness.&nbsp; People who apply themselves to <i>samatha</i>
        may become very peaceful and amiable.&nbsp; They can be of great comfort
        to people who are restless.&nbsp; However, in <i>samatha</i> defilements
        are not eradicated.&nbsp; Although one is not enslaved to
        sense-impressions during the time of <i>jhana</i>, one still clings to
        them when the citta is no longer <i>jhanacitta</i>.&nbsp; The <i>jhanas</i>
        do not last; they are impermanent.&nbsp; Moreover, there is a more
        subtle form of clinging, a clinging to the happiness of the <i>jhanas</i>.&nbsp;
        One might think that one is without clinging when one does not indulge
        in sense-pleasures.&nbsp; However, one might still cling to the joy of
        jhana which is not associated with sense-pleasures, or to pleasant
        feeling or equanimity which can accompany <i>jhanacitta.</i></font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">For the development of <i>samatha</i>,
        panna is necessary, but this kind of <i>panna</i> cannot eradicate
        defilements.&nbsp; There is a higher panna which can eradicate all
        defilements, even the most subtle forms of clinging.&nbsp; This <i>panna</i>
        is developed in 'insight medication' or '<i>vipassana</i>.'&nbsp; In <i>vipassana</i>,
        <i>panna</i> gradually eliminates ignorance, the root of all
        defilements.&nbsp; One leans more about the realities, which present
        themselves though eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind at any
        moment.&nbsp; We know so little about the most common things of daily
        life.&nbsp; How often are we aware of bodily movements during the
        day?&nbsp; How often are we aware of the stretching or bending of our
        arms, or of the movement of our lips when we are talking?&nbsp; We do
        not really know what sound is, what hearing is or what it is we take for
        'self' while hearing.&nbsp; We do not even know the phenomena which
        appear at the present moment.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As long as we are absorbed in the outer
        appearance and the details of things, we will not be able to observe the
        realities of the present moment.&nbsp; As long as we are carried away by
        like or dislike for what we see and hear, it is impossible to see things
        as they are.&nbsp; It is as if we are asleep; we are not yet awake to
        the truth.&nbsp; The Buddha was perfectly mindful and had complete
        knowledge of all the different kinds of mental and physical
        phenomena.&nbsp; Therefore he could call himself ' the Awakened One,' he
        was fully awake to the truth.&nbsp; We, too, should wake up to the
        truth.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In <i>vipassana</i>, <i>panna </i>will
        gradually develop and it will know things as they are. In being aware of
        the reality which appears at the present moment we lean that there are
        two kinds of reality: physical phenomena or '<i>rupa</i>' and mental
        phenomena or '<i>nama</i>.'&nbsp; <i>Rupa</i> does not know anything, <i>nama</i>
        experiences an object.&nbsp; Fore example visible object is <i>rupa</i>;
        it does not know anything.&nbsp; Seeing is a type of <i>nama;</i> it
        experiences an object; visible object.&nbsp; Hearing and thinking are
        other types of <i>nama</i>, different from seeing.&nbsp; There are many
        different types of <i>nama</i> and <i>rupa,</i> and in <i>vipassana</i>
        we learn to experience their characteristics.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the development of <i>vipassana</i>
        we gradually lean to experience that <i>namas</i> and <i>rupas </i>are
        impermanent.&nbsp; One may have reflected before on the impermanence of
        all things in life.&nbsp; Reflection on the truth is necessary, but it
        is not the same as directly experiencing the impermanence of all
        realities in and around oneself.&nbsp; In the beginning we cannot
        experience the arising and falling away of <i>nama</i> and <i>rupa</i>.&nbsp;
        However, if we can experience the different characteristics of <i>nama</i>
        and <i>rupa </i>which appear at different moments, and if we realize
        that each <i>nama</i> or <i>rupa</i> which appears now is different from
        preceding namas and rupas, we will be less inclined to think that nama
        and rupa last, and we will be less inclined to take them for 'self.'</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the 'Greater Discourse of a Full
        Moon' (Middle Length Saying III. No. 109) the Buddha asks a monk: '…is
        it right to regard that which is impermanent, suffering, liable to
        change, as &quot;This is mine, this am I, this is my self&quot;?'</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the 'Discourse on Mindfulness of the
        Body' (Middle Length Sayings III, No. 119) the Buddha said that the
        person who is mindful '…overcomes dislike (and liking), and dislike
        (and liking) do not overcome him.'&nbsp; We will give in less to
        attachment and to anger or ill-will, when we can experience that they
        are only different types of nama which arise and fall away again.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We should not wait to develop this panna
        in the practice of vipassana until we are old or have retired from our
        work.&nbsp; When we develop this wisdom we will know ourselves better,
        we will be aware more often of the moments of <i>akusala cittas</i>
        which arise, even when we do good deeds.&nbsp; Conceit about our good
        deeds may arise or we may expect something in return for our good deeds
        such as praise or a good name.&nbsp; When we gradually see more clearly
        that there are only <i>nama</i> and <i>rupa</i> which arise because of
        conditions, there will eventually be less clinging to a concept of self
        who performs <i>kusala</i> or <i>akusala.</i>&nbsp; When there is less
        clinging to the self good deeds will become purer.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The panna developed in vipassana is the
        'Right Understanding' of the eightfold Path which leads to
        nibbana.&nbsp; Everyone has to tread this Path by himself.&nbsp; One can
        only purify oneself.&nbsp; One cannot be purified by other people; other
        people can only help one to find the right Path.&nbsp; There will be no
        lasting world peace as long as there is craving, ill-will and
        ignorance.&nbsp; And although it is very necessary to take part in the
        world organizations which promote the peace and welfare of nations, and
        to give material aid to those who are in need, still we should realize
        that this is not enough, that it will only help to a certain
        degree.&nbsp; The real causes of war are craving, ill-will and
        ignorance.&nbsp; Only in developing <i>panna</i> can we eliminate
        craving, ill-will and ignorance.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The eightfold Path leads to <i>nibbana</i>.&nbsp;
        <i>Nibbana</i> is the end of all defilements.&nbsp; It can be realized
        here and now, in this life.&nbsp; When <i>panna</i> has not yet reached
        the degree necessary for the realization of nibbana, it is still
        'mundane' or '<i>lokiya panna</i>.'&nbsp; When <i>panna</i> is developed
        to such a degree that one can realize nibbana it is 'supra-mundane' or '<i>lokuttara
        panna</i>.'</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When one has realized <i>nibbana</i> one
        understands what it means to be 'awakened to the truth.'</p>
