<blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are numerous precious things
    in the world. Can you imagine what the most precious of them
    is? It is human rebirth. The 2nd Chiddala Sutta, a sermon
    preached by the Buddha over 2500 years ago, gives the simile
    of the yoke and the blind turtle to explain why a human
    rebirth is so valuable. Imagine a yoke with a hole in its
    center was dropped into the ocean, and that the wind blew
    from everywhere moving the yoke along. And also imagine that
    in the ocean there also lived a blind turtle that only once
    in a hundred years rose to the surface of the water. Could
    the turtle put its head through the center of the yoke? How
    long would it take for that to happen? Such a coincidence is
    almost impossible. Similarly, the Buddha says, becoming a
    human being is a very rare event indeed.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Everyone who is born must one day
    die; this is an inexorable fact. Death will arrive sooner or
    later whether we are old or young, black or white, rich or
    poor, since it is inherent in every living thing. At best,
    human life is brief; and as indicated by the simile, the
    chances of returning soon to the human state after we die is
    very remote. Another reason why human life is so precious is
    that it provides us with the best opportunity to practise the
    path and attain the fruits of liberation. Animals and lower
    beings are not so fortunate, and neither are the gods of the
    form and formless realms. Thus, human rebirth is precious
    (dullabha) in three ways; it is rare and hard to attain, it
    is short-lived once attained, and it represents the best
    vehicle by which to gain liberation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Having been reborn as a human
    being, how do we live properly in this life? The Buddha
    taught us the way to live, and it is applicable to all people
    regardless of their religious persuasion. The 'way' he taught
    is called the <em><strong>Eightfold Middle Path</strong></em>,
    and it comprises the training rules of the noble ones
    (ariyas).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In olden days, there were those who
    believed that the best way to live, and the best way to gain
    happiness, was to indulge in sensual pleasures, and to pass
    one's time in the enjoyment of luxuries and amusements. There
    were also those who believed quite the opposite; that the
    best way to live, and the best way to gain happiness was
    through self-mortification. But the Buddha came to realize
    through his own experience and enlightenment that both those
    ways were wrong; that they were unprofitable, unworthy, low
    and common.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Avoiding those two extremes, the
    Buddha discovered the Middle Path which consists of eight
    factors: 1) right understanding, or right view, 2) right
    thought, 3) right speech, 4) right action, 5) right
    livelihood, 6) right effort, 7) right mindful ness, and 8)
    right concentration. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Buddhism, this eightfold path
    leads to the ultimate goal of Nibbana, but it is also true
    that anyone, regardless of religion, can integrate these
    eight factors into his or her daily life and attain real
    happiness here and now.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1) The first thing that is required
    is to <strong>rightly understand</strong> the realities of
    existence, or we might say, the laws of nature. One of the
    laws that governs human life is the law of kamma; otherwise
    known as the law of cause and effect. The term 'kamma' refers
    to volition and volitional action. Demeritorious deeds
    motivated by greed, hatred and delusion result in suffering
    and pain for the doer. If actions are motivated by
    generosity, loving-kindness, and compassion, on the other
    hand, the effect for the doer will be happiness and peace.
    Another fact that must be understood is that there is no real
    soul, self or I of the individual. These are but conventional
    names applied to the two constituents of sentient existence;
    namely, mind and matter. If one can reduce one's habitual
    attachment to 'I and mine', it will result in wholesome
    states of mind devoid of selfishness, possessiveness and
    pride.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">2) Thoughts that are free from
    sense desire and cruelty are what is meant by<strong> right
    thought</strong>. Sense desire is something like salty water.
    The more one drinks of it, the thirstier one gets. And the
    thirstier one gets, the more one has to drink, leading on and
    on in an endless circle. What is needed in this case is that
    whenever sense desire arises, one must become aware of it and
    let it go. By doing this, the mind becomes lighter and free
    of tension and disturbance. The same is true for ill-will or
    anger. Thoughts of ill-will should be recognized when they
    arise, and then let go. In their place, one should think
    thoughts of loving-kindness and compassion. In this way, one
    should one think rightly and never cause harm to others out
    of selfish sense desire or hatred.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3) <strong>Right speech</strong>,
    which is born of right thought, means to abstain from
    speaking that which is false, slanderous or abusive, and
    abstaining from frivolous talk. It means to speak instead
    that which is pleasant, true, beneficial and accept able by
    others. It means to speak at the right occasion in a way that
    is suitable to the listeners. Such speech will promote peace
    and harmony, and has the power to persuade others.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">4) <strong>Right action</strong>
    means first to refrain from killing and causing pain to
    living beings. It also means to refrain from stealing or
    taking what is not given by others, and to refrain from
    sexual misconduct. Defined as having intercourse with someone
    else's wife, sexual misconduct actually refers to all sexual
    relationships outside of marriage. Right action comprises the
    basic moral principles that govern the social environment. By
    refraining from wrong action, a person's behavior will be
    pure and beyond reproach. In this way, such a person will
    also gain in social esteem and in self-confidence.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">5) <strong>Right livelihood</strong>
    means abstaining from occupations which cause harm to humans
    or animals, and conducting one's business in an honest way.
    Unwholesome occupations include: the manufacture and/or sale
    of weapons, as well as intoxicants such as alcohol and drugs,
    and poison. Included also is the slaughter of animals, and
    the purchase and sale of human beings in slavery. There are
    those among us who while poor, earn their living through
    proper means; and as such, they are honorable and have great
    integrity. In contrast, some wealthy people earn their
    livelihood through racketeering, theft and so on; and as
    such, have no integrity whatsoever. Wealth itself is no
    measure of honor or morality.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">6) <strong>Right effor</strong>t is
    the energetic will to fulfill a task. It means not to do
    evil, to eradicate evil that one has already done, to do the
    good not already done, and to cultivate the good already
    done. No one can gain success without effort; or as the old
    saying goes, 'No pain, no gain.&quot; The Buddha emphasized
    that one should exert the proper amount of effort, neither
    too strong or too feeble. In other words, along with strong
    determination, one should have patience and balance. With
    such right effort, one can solve all of life's problems.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">7 &amp; 8) <strong>Right
    mindfulness</strong> and <strong>right concentration</strong>
    apply to the practice of meditation; otherwise called the
    cultivation of the mind. Right mindfulness means becoming
    aware of one's mind and body as they exist at the present
    moment. Right mindfulness is the foundation of insight
    meditation which is the means by which one purifies the mind
    and gains wisdom in successive stages leading to the final
    supramundane goal of Buddhism, Nibbana. Right concentration
    is the basis of tranquillity meditation through which one can
    psychic powers and temporary peace of mind. Insight and
    tranquillity meditation together are what constitute the
    cultivation of mind according to Buddhism.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">By applying the Eightfold Path to
    his or her daily life, a person can live righteously and with
    propriety, and overcome the obstacles of human existence.</font></p>
