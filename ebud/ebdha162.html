    <td width="100%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">F</font>or me, monastic life
    is a model that the Buddha has offered of how we can all practise. Sometimes lay people
    ask: &quot;But how do I do it as a lay person?&quot; Lay life is so varied; life
    situations vary so much, some people have families, some don't. There are all kinds of
    lifestyles, so it's hard to set up any specific model. Certain general suggestions are
    given for lay practice: to keep the precepts, to live a moral life, to practise
    generosity; Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood are offered, but lay practice has
    to be creative in using life itself as a vehicle for freedom - and that's very individual.
    Monastic life has a more uniform quality because we live together according to rules; as
    lay practitioners you can contemplate how this model works for reflection and
    contemplation. </font><p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>N</b>ow the basic and fundamental
    prerequisite of monastic life is surrender, a giving up to a certain form and discipline.
    We take the precepts and accept this lifestyle: that's the choice we make. But then it
    becomes a situation where we no longer have that many choices. We live in a hierarchy, we
    have a prescribed way of relating between men and women. We have rules about taking care
    of our robes and the equipment of the monastery; we have rules that govern the sharing of
    things. We have various ways of admonishment and of ordination, legal processes. As a
    monastic order we give up to this training and form. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>S</b>ome people think that rules are an infringement on
    freedom, but actually what this surrender or commitment does is to give us the opportunity
    to watch - rather than a freedom to always do what we want. Before I became a bhikkhu I
    lived in India for some time, and had tremendous physical freedom. I managed to live on
    about ten dollars a month; I didn't have the constraints of my old culture, so there was
    tremendous freedom. But I became very confused. I got confused because at that time I
    still believed that if I did what I wanted, I'd reach some kind of fulfilment; but instead
    I found that doing what I wanted to do just made me more and more frustrated, because it
    did not put an end to wanting. It did not put an end to that fundamental restlessness
    which I kept trying to overcome by obtaining an experience: travel, a relationship or
    whatever. That kind of freedom actually was fun for a while, but it led to despair - the
    more I went out into the world of situations and events, the more I realised that this was
    not working. Then, through some stroke of good fortune I managed to become a bhikkhu. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>I</b> didn't find it easy, but of course that's not the
    point. The first year of monastic life was terribly frustrating, the second year was
    terribly frustrating, the third year was terribly frustrating! I couldn't shuffle the
    pieces of the chessboard around. I couldn't go to the monastery I wanted to go to. I'd go
    to Ajahn Chah, and I'd say: &quot;Luang Por, I'd like to go to such and such a
    monastery.&quot; He'd say: &quot;What's wrong with this one? Don't you like me?&quot;
    Ajahn Chah's way was very much one of frustrating desire - and he was fearless in that. He
    didn't mind if his disciples hated his guts! That's the kind of compassion he could
    exhibit: the compassion to frustrate. That takes a lot of courage, doesn't it? But I had
    decided that if I was going to get anywhere near the Truth that the Buddha was trying to
    point out, I just had to stop and look. I couldn't just keep rearranging things; I had
    already given that a good go and I knew it didn't work. The reason I took up this model,
    this vehicle, was not just to have fun; nor was it because I wanted to get something out
    of it - it was because I wanted to be able to observe. So this fundamental commitment to a
    structure allows for the freedom to watch. Can you translate that into your own life? For
    example, your family, your job, your social structure: these can be a vehicle for
    spiritual understanding if you begin to accept that within them there will be
    frustrations, rather than always trying to rearrange situations to fulfil personal desires
    and needs. Obviously, if the situation is harmful in some way, then you have to make a
    change; but the usual humdrum, boring, annoying stuff of life is actually the stuff of
    Enlightenment, if we are willing to observe how it is. So commitment is very important;
    and this is what the robe is - it's a symbol of commitment. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>R</b>esponsibility can be used as commitment, or it can
    be seen as a burden. I can take on the responsibility of being the senior monk and have
    kind of a martyr syndrome about it: &quot;Oh, poor me, I have to be the senior
    monk...&quot; or I can feel great about it: &quot;Wow! Look at me, I'm the senior
    monk...&quot; or I can just see it as a convention: &quot;I'm senior monk. I'd prefer to
    be a fly on the wall actually, but there I am: senior monk.&quot; Then I watch what it
    does to me - whether there's like or dislike, or feeling that I'm doing it well or that
    I'm hopeless - beginning to observe how the mind functions within that situation, rather
    than changing or rearranging it according to some personal opinion. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>S</b>o, applying this to your situation, ask:
    &quot;What happens to me at work?&quot; &quot;What happens to me at home?&quot; Work is
    just not always going to be fulfilling, it can be boring, interesting or annoying, but we
    can make use of this commitment. If we're always shifting according to personal desire, we
    can never really understand how it operates in the mind. So commitment is fundamental to
    understanding our human mind. Now within commitment there are three themes that I find
    very helpful in my own practice:- discovery, training and purification. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">D</b>iscovery (sometimes called vipassana) is
    fundamental, because the Buddhist way is the way of awakening. It's not the way of getting
    rid of, or attaining to something in the future; these are bound up with ego, aren't they,
    with what we call &quot;self-view&quot;. Awakening is always something immediate: we
    awaken... What do we awaken to? To things we haven't seen before; we discover things we
    haven't seen before. So the Buddha's teaching is pointing out things which are always
    there, but which perhaps we have not seen before. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>N</b>ow this is how Buddhist concepts can help us; they
    can awaken us to certain things about human experience which we need to understand in
    order to be free. They are not just ideas that we put away until our next exam in
    Buddhism, they are principles and concepts through which we look at life - like lenses. So
    you can take a conceptual structure, like the three characteristics of existence:
    impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and not-self (anicca, dukkha, anatta) - how do you apply
    that to your life? For example, anatta, `not-self': the teaching that this mind and body
    are not self... But if I'm not this body and I'm not this mind, then who am I?... The mind
    begins to question. The question directs the mind, it starts to awaken us. The beauty of
    the Buddha's teaching is that it allows for and uses doubt in a way to liberate the mind.
    Or take a teaching like anicca: `That which has a nature to arise has a nature to cease' -
    begin to look at life through that. Life's experiences are varied, so if I'm always
    involved in experiences it's very confusing but if I use this teaching as a lens to look
    through, I see that that which has the nature to arise also has the nature to cease, and
    is not personal. So I begin to discover the nature of my conscious experience, because I'm
    no longer attached to it - I begin to discover things about experience that I've never
    noticed before. An angry thought is not mine, it's a condition of nature; it arises and
    ceases. Perhaps I can then begin to let go of guilt, anger and things like that, seeing
    them as not personal - not-self. I have discovered something. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>T</b>hen dukkha: often we talk about dukkha,
    unsatisfactoriness, in terms of conflict. We all have conflict in our lives, but before I
    came across this teaching I was always just trying to get rid of conflict: trying to be a
    nice guy if I was angry; trying to get rid of greed if I was obsessed with greed; trying
    to distract my mind if I got bored, so there was this random attempt to get around it
    somehow. But when I heard the teaching that says conflict has a cause I began to question,
    and to discover the cause of suffering. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>N</b>ow the delusion of our life is that we tend to get
    fascinated by particular types of experience. If I get angry at the bus being late, I
    think it's the bus driver's problem, or it's my problem. I'm always looking outside to
    figure out what the problem is, but I'm not looking at the anger. The teaching that we use
    is one of being more objective: &quot;OK, this is an experience of anger, but that is
    something which arises and ceases. What's causing the suffering here?&quot; So we're
    detaching now from the seeming urgency and complexity and fascination of our experiences.
    In this process, it doesn't matter what we're angry at, what matters is that we look more
    deeply into these basic mental patterns in order to understand. If we are willing to look
    into our conflicts, to open our minds to conflict, then we can discover something, can't
    we? Whereas if we make a judgement that we should be someone who never has fear or anger -
    should always be bright and beautiful and charming - then, when the opposite comes, we
    tend to try to push it away. There is no reflection, there is just some kind of idea or
    expectation that we attach to, and then frustration when this can`t be met. But if we look
    at it differently we see that experience is just a process, and in that process there is
    something that we have to discover, something we have to look at. We have to understand
    what is the cause of conflict. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>S</b>o it's not the experience that is the problem:
    lust is not the problem; fear is not the problem; boredom is not the problem. The problem
    is the attachment to these. What does this word `attachment' mean? What is attachment?
    This moment is the way it is now. Why do I make it a problem, why does there have to be
    conflict? This isn't a judgement; it's not saying I shouldn't have conflict, it's saying
    awaken to the cause. When there is a welcoming attitude to the predicament we're in, we
    begin to see what attachment and letting go is. Attachment is always bound up with a sense
    of `I'; letting go is an open acceptance of this moment the way it is. This is something
    that we have to discover, we have to see it quite clearly. This is the path of insight. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>T</b>raining (bhavana in Pali): we have to make effort.
    Sometimes this teaching of letting go can sound like a sort of complacent acceptance. I
    might get angry and punch someone in the nose and say: &quot;It's all right, just let go.
    No problem!&quot; Then get angry again and punch you in the eye, and say: &quot;I'm an
    angry person. That's just the way it is!&quot; - but that's not it, is it? - There is
    training to be done. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">T</b>he two things that I find very helpful in training
    are: 1) to see cause and effect, and 2) intention. We can always reflect upon cause and
    effect, asking for example: &quot;What is the result of my practice? How long have I been
    practising and what's the result? Am I more at ease with life than I was ten years ago?
    Or, a year ago? Or am I more up-tight?&quot; If I'm more up-tight, then I need to consider
    my practice! If I'm more at ease, then also I should consider my practice. So we look at
    cause and effect asking: &quot;What is the result of my life, the way I live my
    life?&quot; Quite simply. Not as a judgement, saying: &quot;There I go, getting angry
    again.&quot; - that kind of attitude is not reflective. Instead notice: &quot;The way I
    speak - what's the result of that?&quot; &quot;The way I consume the objects of the
    sense-world, whether it's ideas in books or ham sandwiches: What is the result of
    that?&quot; &quot;What is the result of my sitting meditation? What's the effect on my
    mind and body, on the society around me?&quot; These are things we can contemplate. It's
    simple, but very important - to see what works and what doesn't work. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>I</b>t's because we don't understand that we make
    mistakes, so the trick is to make as few mistakes as possible - and not to make the same
    mistakes again and again. Yet sometimes we have this blindness, and we don't see why we
    have suffering in our lives. Ignorance blinds us. So then what can we do?... Wherever
    there is suffering, or confusion we can begin to look at that pattern of our lives. If we
    look at this whole pattern, we can discover the causes of suffering, and begin to make
    intentions to not allow those causes to come up all the time. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>L</b>et's say I'm a person who is always making
    wisecracks at people. I watch them cringe, I begin to notice that no one likes me, and I
    hate myself. So I reflect: &quot;This kind of speech brings me remorse and regret, and
    brings other people suffering.&quot; And I see: &quot;Ah, that's the result. So then what
    can I do?&quot; Now this is when it's important to know the difference between remorse and
    guilt. Remorse is a healthy response to inappropriate action or speech, or thought; it's a
    healthy response, because it's telling me: &quot;This is painful.&quot; But most of us
    probably make that into guilt: there is remorse, but also an inappropriate amount of
    self-flagellation; this is the unhealthy activity of guilt. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>F</b>or me, it seems that guilt is a kind of cover-up
    of the pain; I numb the pain, covering it over with these thoughts of guilt: &quot;Yes.
    You are rotten to the core, Viradhammo!&quot;. But this is self-view. What does it feel
    like when we just go to the pain? If I say something which is unkind to someone, and then
    see them get hurt, I think: &quot;Oh, I did it again!&quot; - and there's the jab. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>T</strong>his is why meditation is so important,
    because when we sit we get the results of our life. Sometimes it's difficult to sit when
    there is suffering, because we want to get away from that suffering. If we actually sit
    and feel the pain, without judgement - really feel the physical and emotional feeling of
    that - we can contemplate: &quot;This is the result of that; with this, there is
    that.&quot; We see dependent origination: that the origin of this feeling depends on a
    certain activity. If we really feel the pain, that registers in our minds in a way that is
    intuitive, in a way that is quite fundamental. We understand that when we do certain
    things we are going to suffer. We realise cause and effect. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>S</b>o then what can we do? Well, we can use skilful
    thinking rather than guilt thinking. We can say: &quot;From now on, I'm going to try not
    to speak in those ways.&quot; We can make that intention; and that intention makes us more
    mindful. So, five days later when I say the same thing again, instead of thinking:
    &quot;There you go again. You're no good, you're rotten to the core!&quot; I can go back
    and examine: &quot;What's the result?&quot; &quot;It hurts, it really hurts!&quot; I feel
    it. That pain can teach me: With the arising of this condition you get that condition, but
    when this condition isn't there you won't get that.&quot; If I go through that process
    again and again and again, with those habitual patterns of suffering, eventually I begin
    to see the arising of that unwholesome condition. Mindfulness is now established.
    Mindfulness is very powerful, it's like recollection or remembering. It sees: &quot;Ah,
    there it is...- but I'm not going to react to that, I'm not going to follow that
    one.&quot; I button my lip, I don't say it. Then there's the joy: &quot;I didn't do it! I
    didn't get sucked in.&quot; The heart is freed from that particular habit. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>N</b>ow in all of that there has been no hatred; there
    has been intention but it hasn't been bound up with self-view, there has been no activity
    of desire. I'm not trying to become a person who doesn't do that. There is no activity of
    aversion. There is mindfulness, awakeness. That's training, always working from awakeness
    and intention: I'm going to be awake - not become anything, just be awake and aware of the
    way things are. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>P</b>urification, the third consideration that I find
    helpful, is probably one of the most difficult parts, because it's so boring. Of course, I
    can only speak for monastic life because I never really developed the training as a
    lay-person. I know that monastic life is not fun, it's not meant to be. Though I love the
    brotherhood and find the monks inspiring, there are times when I don't like the people, or
    feel annoyed or intimidated or fed up. But I have the freedom to watch that, and this is
    the purification. This is where we have to have tremendous patience. The line is:
    `Infinite patience, boundless compassion.' This is the practice. When it all begins to
    surface - when you start to feel annoyed at the apartment and the marriage, or fed up with
    the kids - desire manifests as frustration. But then if we can bear with the frustration,
    not judge it, we go through a purification. So we have to allow this stuff to surface into
    the mind, we have to allow the rubbish to become conscious. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>T</b>his is why the teaching of anatta and anicca,
    non-personality and change, is so important - because if we didn't have that teaching, we
    would take it personally. But the more we contemplate this teaching and discover that it's
    true, the more courage we have to allow these things to come up into consciousness. The
    more courage we have to let them up into consciousness - the more patience we have to bear
    with them - the more we realise the underlying peace of the mind. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>T</b>hat peace is not something we get by becoming
    anything but by letting go, allowing things to cease. That's why we talk so much about
    cessation. Say, when I'm feeling grumpy, I remember the teaching: &quot;That's going to
    change. Don't make it a problem.&quot; So I allow myself to be grumpy, which isn't an
    indulgence in being grumpy or laying that mood onto the other monks but neither is it a
    denial of that grumpiness. It's just recognising that that which has a nature to arise has
    a nature to cease; I can awaken to that - and then it does cease. I realise that more and
    more, it becomes a path of courage and confidence. There is the confidence to allow these
    things to be there, to make them fully conscious - to allow fear, anger or whatever to be
    fully conscious. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>T</b>he tendency of repression is powerful. We are
    panicked by conditions and then they can become a threat; we try to push them away, but
    they come back. So if we find that conditions keep coming up in our lives, then we have to
    consider: &quot;Am I really allowing them to be conscious, or am I pushing them
    away?...&quot; This balance between indulgence and repression is hard to find, although
    actually it's very simple - it's just awakening to the way it is right now. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>I</b>t's a very moment to moment practice, so when the
    question comes up: &quot;Am I repressing or am I indulging?&quot; see that as doubt, just
    a condition in the mind: &quot;This is the way it is now,&quot; &quot;I feel this way
    now&quot; - awakening, making things conscious. Notice that there is no desire in that, no
    aversion, it's not bound up with the desire to become anything or to get rid of anything,
    or sensual desire. There is no movement away from this moment towards another moment. It's
    timeless. It's immediate. It's awakening here and now. </font></p>
