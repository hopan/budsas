        <p><b>This article is adapted from a one-day workshop
        offered by Sylvia Boorstein at the Barre Center for
        Buddhist Studies on April 5, 1997. Since that time,

    <p>We begin this day of practice in the traditional way of
    honoring the Buddha and all those others who have awakened to
    the possibility of living a fully wise and compassionate
    life. We take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the
    Sangha. </p>
    <p>When I reflect on what it means to take refuge in the
    Buddha, I often think that the Buddha was a human being, just
    like us, and we share with him and with all awakened beings
    that capacity to see clearly, to be fully awake, responding
    always with kindness and compassion. It's very thrilling for
    me to think about that capacity and to use awakened beings a
    role models. </p>
    <p>When I think about taking refuge in the Dharma, I think
    about what a relief it is to have had so many people practice
    before me. I don't have to reinvent the wheel. The fact that
    the path of practice has worked for so many others gives me
    confidence that it can work for me as well. </p>
    <p>In reflecting on taking refuge in the Sangha, I think
    about how fortunate I am, how fortunate we all are, to have
    friends and family and a community of people who are eager to
    support us in our practice. I am grateful to all my
    companions who share with me the sense of the inevitable
    challenge of being alive as well as seeing the possibility
    for living life with grace and appreciation. </p>
    <p>Let's sit quietly for a while together and use our
    reflection of gratitude for the possibility of practice to
    inspire our zeal to study together today. You can further
    inspire your dedication to practice by reflecting on your
    motivation for practice. Perhaps you'll feel inspired, as I
    do, by the verse from the <i>Dhammapada</i> which carries the
    triple imperative to turn away from all evil-doing, to do
    what is good, and to purify your heart. I am always inspired
    and motivated in my practice by my faith that this
    possibility exists. </p>
    <p>This is a day about cultivating the <i>paramis</i>, the
    fully cultivated mind and heart qualities of a bodhisattva,
    of a Buddha, of a fully awakened being. One of the roots of
    the word parami conveys the sense of &quot;supreme
    quality.&quot; <i>Paramita</i> means &quot;going toward&quot;
    something, going toward perfection. </p>
    <p>In traditional texts, the ten paramis are presented in a
    particular order, beginning with generosity and ending with
    equanimity. In preparing for our workshop today, I
    constructed this chart, listing the ten paramis, their
    characteristics, functions, manifestations, and proximal
    causes, using the text in <strong><i>A Treatise on the
    Paramis</i></strong> by Ac�riya Dhammap�la as my guide. </p>
    <p>I wondered, as I prepared the chart, whether it would work
    as a &quot;flow-sheet&quot; in chemistry, with one quality in
    fact conditioning the next in a way that seemed natural. My
    sense is that each of the paramis really includes all of the
    others and can be restated using the characteristics other
    paramis in their definition, that each parami is a hologram
    for the other nine. The Buddha taught that <strong>generosity</strong>
    was the first of the paramis because most people have
    something they can relinquish. In the largest sense,
    generosity is not giving away material things. It is
    non-clinging. As you can see in the chart, the proximal cause
    of generosity is seeing what can be relinquished. </p>
    <p>For myself, giving up attachment to ideas, attachment to
    views, has been a much more difficult challenge than giving
    away material things. When I have been able to give up my
    attachment to views, it has seemed like an act of generosity
    both to myself and to others. </p>
    <p>I've been able to give up views when I've recognized that
    I didn't need them to protect my sense of self. In fact, they
    are easier to give up when I see that attachment to views
    constructs a sense of separate self and adds to my suffering.
    Students of the Zen teacher Seung Sahn report that he often
    said, &quot;Only keep Don't-Know Mind.&quot; Another teacher
    of mine once said that a helpful mantra to be recited daily
    by anyone who teaches is &quot;I could be wrong.&quot; </p>
    <p>I think another manifestation of generosity is giving up
    destructive habits or lingering grudges. In moments of clear
    seeing, which come through practice and perhaps by grace, we
    understand that anything we hold on to, whether material or
    emotional, is a potential source of complication and of
    suffering. With that understanding, generosity becomes easy. </p>
    <p><strong>Morality</strong> is the second of the paramis.
    The commentarial tradition says morality has a composing
    effect. The practice of morality steadies and balances the
    mind and allows it to see clearly. Seeing clearly, we know
    that there's a tremendous amount of inevitable pain that is
    part of life experience, and the impulse to respond with
    impeccable morality, to not add further pain to the
    inevitable discomfort of life, becomes spontaneous. </p>
    <p>The parami of <strong>renunciation</strong> is often
    thought of as giving up something tangible in life. In
    Buddhist scripture it is usually to describe renouncing the
    world and joining the Order of monks and nuns. I find it more
    helpful to think of renouncing the habitual patterns of mind
    that keep me enslaved more than renouncing a particular
    lifestyle. Perhaps that's because at those times in my life
    when I have needed to make a choice in terms of a more
    skillful lifestyle or habit, my experience has been that my
    strong decision to make a change made the actual changing
    fairly easy. It's been much harder for me to change the
    habits of my heart. </p>
    <p>It's not easy to stay balanced. The mind's habitual
    response to pleasant stimulus is to grasp it; its habitual
    response to unpleasant experience is aversion. Neutral
    moments are not so interesting, and we tend to stop paying
    attention to them. </p>
    <p>I feared in the beginning of my practice that things
    wouldn't feel as good or taste as good or sound as good or
    anything else as good, because a lot of the practice stories
    I heard talked about extinguishing lust. I still experience
    lust. And, while renunciation means to me giving up outbursts
    of anger in favor of a more considered, helpful response, I
    still recognize when I am annoyed. </p>
    <p>I believe that renunciation is more a question of not
    being bound by or being a victim of the lusts and desires and
    angers that naturally arise as the result of having a body. I
    believe this is the difference between a compulsion or an
    addiction, which is always burdensome, and the possibility of
    making conscious choices, which is not burdensome. I don't
    see renunciation as the difference between monastic and
    non-monastic lifestyles, but between being a victim of mind
    states, driven by compulsions, and being free to make a
    choice. </p>
    <p>Restraint is a characteristic of renunciation. I remember
    Joseph Goldstein, one of my teachers and my friend, saying
    that restraint allowed for the verification of the empty
    nature of sense desire. In thinking about restraint, the most
    mundane example comes to mind. </p>
    <p>I receive lots of mail order catalogs. Probably you do,
    too. My first thought often is, &quot;No, I don't need
    anything.&quot; But the catalogs have interesting covers, and
    sometimes I think, &quot;Well, I'll just look inside.&quot;
    Not infrequently, when I look through a catalog, I find
    something in it that I didn't want or need two minutes
    before. In the moment of discovering it, and noticing that
    it's attractive, I suddenly feel that I want it. </p>
    <p>I think that it's the nature of the mind to move toward
    pleasant experience in a grasping way. It's not my hope for
    myself that my practice will lead me to a time that there is
    no movement of my mind toward things that are pleasant. What
    I hope will happen is that I will never be driven or
    compelled by wanting. In the matter of catalogs, my rule for
    myself is not to make a decision in the midst of a moment of
    lust. </p>
    <p><strong>Wisdom</strong> is the fourth of the paramis, and
    its characteristic is clarity. Clarity seems the naturally
    developing result of restraint. When the movements of the
    mind in greed, hatred and delusion are fueled by stories --
    &quot;I need this.&quot; &quot;I don't like this.&quot;
    &quot;This is boring.&quot; -- truly clear seeing is not
    possible. When the movements of the attention, fueled by
    stories, are attenuated by the capacity for restraint,
    clarity emerges. </p>
    <p>Validating for oneself the third noble truth of the
    Buddha, that peace is possible in this very life, requires
    only one moment of personal experience. If a moment is free,
    it's free; if there is suffering, there is suffering. The
    clarity to recognize freedom, even a moment of freedom, can
    lead to faith that becomes unshakable. Otherwise it's just
    hearsay. </p>
    <p>In a moment of clear awareness we recognize the pain in
    our life and realize that we have the capacity to manage it.
    It's a great liberation to know that you don't need to be
    pleased in order to be happy. I think this is what leads to
    energy. On the chart you'll notice that a characteristic of
    energy is indefatigability. I don't think that means that you
    never get tired -- I think it means resoluteness and
    dedication to practice. </p>
    <p>I once heard a story about Chogyam Trungpa, that he
    classically would say to students at the end of the first day
    of retreat practice, &quot;I'm sure that many of you would
    now like to go home.&quot; Then he would laugh, and he'd say,
    &quot;Too late.&quot; </p>
    <p>I think that there's a point at which each of us begins to
    intuit that there's a way to live life more gracefully and
    more peacefully. I think there's another point, very
    important in developing practice, when we experience that
    possibility for ourselves. </p>
    <p><strong>Patience</strong> is the next of the paramis. One
    way to think about patience is reflecting on the ability to
    wait when anger arises in the mind. Lots of things make us
    angry. Often we feel the victim of something, and, especially
    when we feel we're unjustly a victim, a lot of energy comes
    up around righteous indignation. Patience allows us to wait
    until the cloud of anger, which distorts the mind, subsides
    so we can decide on appropriate action. I once heard someone
    ask of the Dalai Lama, &quot;Do you ever get angry?&quot; He
    responded, &quot;Of course. Things happen. They're not what
    you wanted to have happen; anger arises. But it's not a
    problem.&quot; </p>
    <p>On another occasion, the Dalai Lama was teaching about
    patience, using as his text Shantideva's <i>Guide to the
    Bodhisattva's Way of Life</i>. He read each verse of Chapter
    6 (the chapter on Patience) -- 134 verses -- and commented on
    each one. Each verse proposed different situations in which
    anger arises in the mind and proposed appropriate responses.
    As the Dalai Lama read the last verse he leaned forward and
    held his head. Since my principal hindrance is worry, I
    thought, &quot;Oh dear, something has happened to him.&quot;
    Then he picked up his head, and I saw that he was crying.
    Since I know he's taught this chapter and verse many times, I
    was touched by how much it obviously moved him to say that
    any response to vexation other than patience is unwise. Just
    unwise. If we have the patience to wait, waiting leads to
    clarity, and clarity allows for the truth of the situation to
    emerge. </p>
    <p>The next parami is <strong>truthfulness</strong>. Every
    moment of mindfulness is a moment of truthfulness, of
    directed knowing. Direct and clear, true understanding is
    such a relief. It inspires determination in practice. And
    when we see the truth of how things are, our capacity for
    loving-kindness, for metta, increases. We see people just the
    way they are -- as people, like ourselves, struggling to be
    content, to be happy, to live gracefully -- not as people
    about whom we have substantive commentaries that put them in
    categories of friends or enemies. As we become less
    judgmental and more tolerant, more able to understand that
    things and people are the way they are as a result of complex
    and legitimate causes, our capacity for balanced equanimity
    increases. </p>
    <p>In choosing one story, in the service of creating an
    edited version of a whole day's teaching on the paramis, here
    is a story that combines the capacity for seeing the truth,
    the determination to tell the truth, a moment of genuine
    metta, and the joy of equanimity. </p>
    <p>About a year ago, I was fortunate to be part of a group of
    twenty-six Western teachers of Buddhism who went to
    Dharamsala to meet with the Dalai Lama. A trip to India is
    difficult under any circumstances and Dharamsala is harder
    than Delhi. Nevertheless, this was a trip I would not have
    missed. I was excited about meeting with the Dalai Lama and
    excited to meet the twenty-five other teachers. </p>
    <p>Our group of teachers gathered for several days before the
    meetings with the Dalai Lama to establish the agenda for our
    time with him. I knew perhaps half of the other teachers and
    only some of them well. At the start I noted that there were
    really three categories of people there: people I knew quite
    well and liked, people I didn't know at all, and a few people
    I knew but didn't have a good feeling about. For various
    reasons, all in the past, I had been negatively affected by
    these persons in some way. But, here we were far away, all of
    us with high alertness. </p>
    <p>On our first day of meeting together, my friend Jack
    Kornfield who was the facilitator, said, &quot;Let's go
    around the room and introduce ourselves. Each of us will say
    our names and what we see as our current and greatest
    spiritual challenge in our personal lives and in our teaching
    lives.&quot; I thought, &quot;This is a most intimate
    question to respond to in a group of twenty-six people, most
    of whom I don't know.&quot; But, I couldn't leave, I couldn't
    say, &quot;I've decided not to come to Dharamsala.&quot; I
    didn't even have to make a decision about when to talk be
    cause Jack said, &quot;I'll go first, I'll pass the
    microphone around and everyone will go in order.&quot; I had
    the same feeling that I have half-way down a ski slope, or in
    a dentist chair mid-way through a complicated procedure, or,
    indeed, in the middle of life: &quot;There's no place to go
    but forward.&quot; </p>
    <p>In the clarity of that realization, my mind relaxed, and I
    listened. Each person's story seemed touching to me --
    everyone told the truth about his or her current struggle. By
    and by, the people I had negative feelings about told their
    stories as well, and I discovered that I felt the same about
    them as about the people before and after them. My mind was
    clear and focused. I was relaxed. I wasn't adding to that
    experience all the stories I had in my memory bank. I was
    seeing everyone just as they were. It was a tremendous
    relief. My insight that we are all, after all, just doing our
    best with the circumstances of our lives to manage
    gracefully, authentically and with integrity had a
    transformative effect. Everyone became my friend. And I felt
    a friend to everyone. </p>
    <p>I think that <strong>equanimity</strong>, the last of the
    paramis, is the ability to feel and understand, in wisdom,
    that everyone and everything is different, legitimately, as a
    result of different causes. To live in a friendly,
    non-adversarial relationship with all things, with all
    people, and with our lives is the source of greatest
    equanimity. </p>
