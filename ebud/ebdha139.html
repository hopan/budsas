  <hr width="25%" align="center">
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">B</font>uddhism was founded by
  Siddhattha Gotama, the Buddha, in India in the sixth century B.C. The Buddha did not
  intend to found a new religion but he did point out the many injustices which prevailed
  and afflicted the society of his day, many of them which were done in the name of
  religion. One such injustice was the caste system which placed every human being in a
  fixed social order and was determined by birth. This caused Indian human society to be
  divided, unfairly into high and low stations. One consequence of this was that often those
  born into a low caste were from the moment they were born denied basic human rights, human
  justice and human dignity. Women and members of the lower castes were also deprived of an
  education and denied the chance to develop themselves spiritually. And many people
  indulged in ritual sacrifice which involved the killing of animals in the name of a god.
  In those days too, people of all castes used to spend a great deal of money and time in
  the name of religion in the hope that their efforts and expense would earn them salvation
  after death. People also used to dress in a special way, use ornaments and decorate their
  bodies in a prescribed way to demonstrate their affiliation and loyalty to a particular
  religion. These practises very often led them to think that they were pious and very
  highly developed spiritual people.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha's teaching, however went against
  many of the current beliefs of the day and sought to expose these injustices and the
  superficiality underlying many religious customs. What the Buddha taught was the <i>Dhamma.
  </i>Dhamma means among other things &quot;just&quot;, it is righteousness. To strive for
  righteousness in one's life depends on one's being moral. Morality itself, depends on mind
  and volition. Whether one is moral or immoral depends on the purity or impurity of his or
  her mind. Buddhism, therefore is not a religion in the sense the word 'religion' is most
  commonly understood. But, it is the path of purification of the mind.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">According to the Buddha morality is not only
  the foundation of our spiritual path but the axis upon which the whole of our spiritual
  development revolves and depends. Buddhism encourages people to develop their minds.
  External shows of piety and the use of religious objects are not what is important. What
  is important is that we develop our minds and purify them through the practice of
  morality, concentration and wisdom.</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;No water from any great river can
    purify,<br>
    or wash away the impurities of the mind&quot;. <br>
    &quot;But only the water of morality can wash<br>
    away the stains in living beings&quot;. <b>(Visuddhimagga)</b></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha emphasized morality or Sila as
  being the first step we need to take on the path to purification. The goal of our
  spiritual development aims at the attainment of Liberation. Liberation in Buddhism means
  freedom from bondages, such as greed, hatred and delusion. So it is that without moral
  development there can be no Liberation.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Right Livelihood figures prominently in the
  Buddha's moral teaching. Right Livelihood, traditionally, entails not dealing in arms and
  lethal weapons, animals for slaughter, human beings, intoxicating drinks, and poison.
  Though the Buddha mentioned only these five things, there are many other wrong ways of
  earning a living. We understand that the Buddha was addressing Indian society in the sixth
  century B.C. which consisted for the most part of farmers, herdsmen and traders. Poverty,
  in fact, is the main cause of crime. If people are deprived of the bare necessities, such
  as cloth, food, a lodging and medicine, they cannot and do not think of moral behaviour,
  or give a thought to righteous living. Owing to lack of economic security, and of money,
  people are led to commit theft and other crimes. The precept about Right Livelihood was
  designed to bring true happiness to the individual and society and to promote unity and
  proper relations among people.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha states in the Kutadanta Sutta, how
  in order to raise the social and economic conditions of a country, the farmers and traders
  should be given the necessary facilities to carry on their farming and business, and that
  the people should be paid adequate wages. Thus when they have enough for their subsistence
  and are economically secure, crime is lessened and peace and harmony prevail.
  (Dighanikaya) In another discourse the Buddha explains to Anathapaindika, the banker, the
  four kinds of happiness a layman ought to enjoy. The first is ownership or economic
  security, so that he has sufficient means acquired lawfully by his own effort; the second
  is the joy of wealth or happiness gained by the judicious expenditure of lawful wealth;
  the third is the bliss of not being in debt, the joy and satisfaction that comes with the
  thought: &quot;I owe nothing to anyone&quot;: the fourth is the bliss of being without
  blame, which is the satisfaction derived from the thought; &quot;I am blessed with
  blameless acts of body, speech and mind. (Anguttara Nikaya - ii 69)</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Here the word livelihood implies not only a
  pure means of earning one's living but it also means we have to be morally responsible
  towards all of society. If we do not take any responsibility for society then our minds
  are easily overwhelmed by self-interest and we become selfish and uncaring. If the mind is
  not pure then we cannot behave in a moral or just and righteous way in our day to day
  dealings with other people. Moreover, when our mind is dominated by greed then morality is
  lacking and our spiritual development is arrested, The Buddha never expected us to worship
  him blindly but he wanted us to be pure in mind and just in deed . For these reasons we
  regard the Buddha as a great teacher but not as a saviour of mankind. He was a guide and
  his Dhamma is a light to guide us on our spiritual path. The Buddha himself said again and
  again that the Dhamma, his teaching was to be used as a raft to ferry one across the river
  of samsara and suffering to the further shore of Nibbana. He meant for his teaching in all
  its parts to show people to help themselves and so successfully cross over from the
  mundane to the supramundane state.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">If we study the Buddha's teachings of
  Morality, concentration and Wisdom we will come to realize how we, ourselves, are
  responsible for our own liberation or purification of the mind. If we also investigate the
  Buddha's teachings on the Sublime States: i.e. Loving-kindness, Compassion, Sympathetic
  Joy and Equanimity towards living beings, then we will come to realize that we, ourselves,
  are responsible for our own well-being and that of society as well. Just as we want to
  enjoy prosperity and happiness in this life and the next, so we want the same for all
  living beings. This planet is our home and each of us has the right to live here as do all
  other beings, animals, trees, plants and every other kind of living organism. This is to
  say that the development of animate and inanimate things in this world are interconnected
  and interdependent, so that worldly and spiritual growth is dependent upon everyone and
  everything else in this world. Nothing exists or can develop independently. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">According to Buddhism whatever injustices,
  abuses and crimes occur in society are not only the product of poverty or economic decline
  but they are also conditioned by our own mind. The Buddha said all suffering in this world
  had three causes: human greed, human anger, and human delusion. These three things are the
  real root causes of all injustices. This being the case the whole of the Buddha's teaching
  is directed towards the uprooting and eradication of these three harmful mental
  defilements. If our minds are free from all these three mental defilements, then we are
  liberated and we can experience the bliss of Nibbana here and now, in this very life.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In conclusion I would like to say further
  that the teachings of the Buddha did not encourage us to engage only in religious rites
  and rituals but encouraged us to develop ethical and moral principles and to act on them
  in our daily lives. For without such ethical and moral principles there can be no
  Liberation, no happiness , no peace or no harmony among men.</font></p>
