<h2 align="center"><font color="#800000">Practical Buddhism:
Taking responsibility for our lives</font></h2>

<h3 align="center"><font color="#800000"><em>Ajahn Jayasaro</em></font></h3>

<hr width="30%">

<blockquote>
    <p align="left">The quality of our lives is conditioned by
    the quality of our actions. Buddhism teaches us to have a
    firm conviction in human potential. It says that we are
    creatures that possess the wonderful ability to take
    responsibility for what we think, do, and say, and to make
    our lives expressions of wisdom and compassion, rather than
    selfishness, fear, and greed. </p>
    <p align="left">We can develop the power and skill to refrain
    from acts of body, speech, and mind that cause ourselves and
    others pain. We can learn to perform those acts of body,
    speech, and mind that lead to happiness and peace. We can
    purify our minds. Thus Buddhism is concerned with the nature
    of our lives and the means by which we can eradicate the
    discontent and hollowness which so afflicts them.
    Consequently the teachings of Buddhism are not to be seen as
    dogmas to be adhered to, but tools to be used to develop our
    inherent potential. </p>
    <p align="left">Buddhism is a religion that considers wisdom,
    rather than faith, to be the single most important virtue.
    The Buddha said that if we look at ourselves very closely and
    honestly, we find a well of dis-ease and conflict within our
    mind. He said that the underlying root of that pain is our
    ignorance of and the fundamental misconceptions that we
    cherish about the true nature of our existence. The way to
    true happiness thus lies in remedying our wrong ideas about
    the way things are, and for this task we need a wisdom
    founded on generosity and morality and fortified by a calm
    clarity of mind. In Buddhist perspective our lives have
    dignity and meaning to the extent that they incline towards
    and testify to truth. </p>
    <h4 align="left">GIVING</h4>
    <p align="left">On its most basic level, our wrong
    understanding of life, characterised by a tenacious clinging
    to the sense of &quot;me&quot; and &quot;mine&quot;,
    manifests externally as selfishness and possessiveness. The
    first level of Buddhist practice entails undermining our
    foolishness by countering its expressions. We develop a
    generous heart. The Buddha encouraged us to give, wisely and
    selflessly, not seeking for any kind of reward. </p>
    <p align="left">He spoke of three kinds of giving: the giving
    of material things to those deserving of it, eg, food to
    mendicant monks, alms to the poor; the giving of forgiveness
    to those that have wronged us; and lastly and most
    excellently, the giving of truth, gladly sharing any worldly
    knowledge or spiritual understanding that we have acquired. </p>
    <p align="left">Generosity, apart from eroding selfish
    concern, gives a joy and lightness to the mind and creates
    bonds of love and friendship within a society. The less
    grasping at things we have, the more we can open up to the
    world around us and contribute positively to it. </p>
    <h4 align="left">MORALITY</h4>
    <p align="left">Morality, the second aspect of Buddhist
    training, is also deeply concerned with the things we do and
    the things we say. Action and speech that proceeds from
    unwholesome mental states harms both ourselves and others. In
    Buddhism, morality is defined as the will to refrain from all
    such words and deeds. By not reinforcing the power of
    negative emotions through internal repression or outward
    expression, but by simply observing and calmly enduring
    through them, the hold of the afflictions over us is
    weakened, and we begin to free ourselves from them. </p>
    <p align="left">The training in morality consists of a
    commitment to certain precepts as guiding principles in one's
    daily life. For lay Buddhists these precepts are five in
    number, namely: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p align="left">to refrain from taking life <br>
        to refrain from stealing <br>
        to refrain from sexual misconduct <br>
        to refrain from false speech <br>
        to refrain from use of intoxicants. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">These precepts are not commandments or to be
    blindly obeyed but are tools to be skilfully used to
    harmonise the way we live with spiritual truths. </p>
    <p align="left">Although framed negatively the precepts
    naturally engender virtues of kindness, honesty, contentment,
    truthfulness, and heedfulness. One who keeps the precepts
    purely finds feelings of guilt and self-reproach supplanted
    by those of well-being and self-respect. One's mind inclines
    toward peace and clarity. Morality is thus the firm basis for
    all spiritual endeavour and can be seen to provide the
    indispensable foundation for an intelligent and caring
    society. </p>
    <h4 align="left">MEDITATION</h4>
    <p align="left">The third aspect of Buddhism is meditation,
    the development of mental calm and insight. In their normal
    state, our minds are scattered and out of control. We find it
    hard to stop thinking even for a moment. The tremendous
    energy of the mind is thus never harnessed and put to good
    use. Meditation is a way to focus the mind, so as to enable
    it to withdraw from its usual preoccupations, and penetrate
    the truth of our existence. </p>
    <p align="left">Meditation is not merely a means of
    relaxation, nor is it a technique to escape from stressful
    responsibility into blissful trance. It is rather a precise
    means for sharpening, strengthening, and ultimately purifying
    the mental faculties. Initially one concentrates the mind on
    a particular object, just as to tame a wild animal, one might
    tie it to a post. There are many possible objects to use for
    this purpose. One that many people find useful is the
    sensation of the breath at the tip of the nostrils, but
    whatever object is employed, the important point is to
    maintain a close, alert, and continual awareness of it. </p>
    <p align="left">At first, of course, we can't. Concentration
    is difficult. It goes against the grain of our distraction.
    But with patience, perseverance, and good humour, it is not
    impossible. When the mind strays away from the object one
    gently but firmly brings it back again - again and again and
    again. </p>
    <p align="left">Eventually the concentration becomes more or
    less effortless and the mind bright and firm. Here, foregoing
    the initial object, one merely maintains a sharp, bare
    awareness of whatever is arising consciousness - be it a
    physical sensation, a feeling, a thought, a perception, or
    whatever - staying with the changing nature of each
    phenomenon rather than its content. </p>
    <p align="left">If the mind has been sufficiently stabilised
    by concentration one is able to maintain an equanimous gaze
    on the present reality and a direct non-conceptual
    appreciation of the true nature of our existence begins to
    grow. As we come to realise the changing, unstable, and
    inconsequential nature of all that goes to make up our lives,
    our wrong ideas and assumptions about ourselves fall away and
    our grasping attachment to things is completely undermined.
    It is here that true peace and liberation, the highest
    achievement of human beings and the goal of Buddhism, is
    finally achieved. </p>
