      the place, lighting a lamp, administering water and spreading seats.</P>
      <B>
      <P>The five functioning things</P>
      </B>
      <P>Interest, purity, the suitable time, the number of bhikkhunis and the 
      advice.</P>
      <B>
      <P>The four features to be suitable</P>
      </B>
      <P>The day of the full moon, all the defeated bhikkhunis, those excluded 
      from the Community are not present and the bhikkhunis defeated are at a 
      distance.</P>
      <P>The four preliminary functions, the five functions and the four 
      features of suitability completed, we invite the bhikkhunis who have got 
      the consent of the order of bhikkhunis to recite the rules of the higher 
      order.</P>
      <B>
      <P>The origin</P>
      </B>
      <P>Noble ladies listen, today is the fifteenth day of the full moon, as 
      suitable may the Community of bhikkhunis recite the rules of the 
      bhikkhunis</P>
      <P>What are the functions? Noble ladies inform your purity. I will recite 
      the rules of the higher order. All present, listen carefully and 
      attentively. Those that have ecclesiastical offences should voice them. 
      Those who haven&#39;t should be silent, by their silence I will know their 
      purity. In a gathering like this, it should be heard up to the third time. 
      When listening to it, up to the third time, if you recall any offences, 
      they should be declared. If a bhikkhuni listening to it, up to the third 
      time, were not to declare an offence that she recalls, it amounts to 
      telling a deliberate lie. The Blessed One has said that telling a 
      deliberate lie is an impediment. Therefore those recalling their offences 
      should declare them, it&#39;s for their mental health.</P>
      <P>Noble ladies, the origin is recited, how is your purity? For the second 
      and for the third time I ask how is your purity? The noble ladies are 
      pure, therefore they are silent, and I record it as such.</P>
      <P>End of the original story.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Offences which merit excommunication</P>
      </B>
      <P>Now the eight offences are recited.</P>

      <P>1. If a bhikkhuni interested in sexual things practice them in the form

      ex-communicated.</P>
      <P>The training precept, for depriving human life.</P>
      <P>3. If a bhikkhuni intentionally deprives human life by providing a 
      weapon or by praising death, or by inciting one to die, saying, &#39;Good man, 
      what is the use of this evil unpleasant life, dying is better than 
      living.&#39; Praising death in various ways makes one to think and ponder 
      about dying, that is an offence, fit to be ex-communicated.</P>
      <P>Training precept, for attainments above human.</P>
      <P>4. A bhikkhuni impressing others about attainments above human, without 
      attaining them, would say, &#39;I know and see noble attainments and visions 
      above human.&#39; Later, when cross questioned or even not cross questioned, 
      seeing her offence and seeking purity would say: &#39;Noble lady, not knowing 
      or seeing I said I know and see, I said those useless lies, out of 
      conceit&#39;. It&#39;s an offence fit to be ex-communicated.</P>
      <P>The training precept above the knee caps.</P>
      <P>5. If a bhikkhuni with desire consents to a male person&#39;s approach to 
      brush up or down, or massage, or take hold, or touch or press above the 
      knee caps, is an offence fit to be ex-communicated.</P>
      <P>The training precept for hiding an offence.</P>
      <P>6. A bhikkhuni knowing that another bhikkhuni had done an offence, 
      would not accuse her for it, nor inform the Community about it, while she 
      is present and alive Afterwards she would say: &#39;Even earlier, I knew that 
      sister is of such behavior&#39;. Not accusing the bhikkhuni herself, nor 
      informing the Community about it, is an offence fit to be ex-communicated.</P>
      <P>Training precept for associating an ex-communicated bhikkhu..</P>
      <P>7. A bhikkhuni associating a bhikkhu, rightfully ex communicated by the 
      Teacher&#39;s discipline as disrespectful and cannot be corrected, should be 
      advised by the bhikkhunis up to the third time: &#39;Noble lady, this bhikkhu 
      is rightfully ex-communicated by the Teacher&#39;s discipline as disrespectful 
      and cannot be corrected do not associate him.&#39; It&#39;s good if she gives up 
      the association, if not, it is an offence fit to be ex-communicated.</P>
      <P>Training precept, for eight fold misbehavior</P>
      <P>8. If a bhikkhuni with desires endures a male person&#39;s approaches in 
      the form of holding hands, touching the edge of the robe, standing close, 
      talking or exchanging ideas, or follow him to enclosures, or disclose the 
      body with such intentions, this wrong behavior is an offence fit to be 
      ex-communicated.</P>
      <P>The end of the offences, which merit excommunicating</P>
      <P>Noble ladies, the eight offences for excommunication are recited. A 
      bhikkhuni fallen for one or the other of these offences is fit to be 
      ex-communicated. Noble ladies, I ask how is your purity? For the second 
      and for the third time I ask how is your purity? The noble ladies are 
      pure, therefore they are silent, and I record it as such.</P>

      irrelevant category of offences, for a small reason and says she merits

      training. I&#39;m far behind the daughters of the Sakyas. There are other

      hiding each others&#39; faults. The Community of bhikkhunis said nothing to

      worry the Community of bhikkhunis hiding each others&#39; faults. Noble 
      ladies, the Community praises openness.&#39; That bhikkhuni should be

      an offence for not heeding admonition repeatedly, up to the third time and 
      becomes helpless with a serious offence.</P>
      <P>Precept for causing schism in the Community.</P>

      schism in the Community that is in concord, do not persist with a 
      litigation that needs settlement with a split. Noble lady, appreciate the 
      concord in the Community. A united pleasant Community that recites a 
      single recitation is good&#39; If she persists in her endeavor she should be 
      admonished up to the third time. Good if she gives it up, if not she falls 
      with an offence for not heeding admonition repeatedly up to the third time 
      and becomes helpless with a serious offence.. .</P>
      <P>Precept for associating schemers</P>
      <P>15. The same bhikkhuni is reckoned by one, or two, or three bhikkhunis 
      saying: &#39;Noble ladies, do not say anything to this bhikkhuni, she says the 
      rightful thing according to the discipline. I too agree with her interests 
      and liking. She knows what she says, I too agree with her words. The 
      bhikkhunis should admonish these bhikkhunis: &#39;Noble ladies, do not say so, 
      this bhikkhuni does not say the rightful, according to the discipline. You 
      should not give your vote for a schism in the Community. Noble ladies, 
      live in concord with the Community. A united pleasant Community that 
      recites a single recitation is good&#39; If they persist in their endeavor, 
      they should be admonished up to the third time. Good if they give it up, 
      if not they fall with an offence for not heeding admonition repeatedly up 
      to the third time and become helpless with a serious offence.</P>
      <P>The precept of training for unruliness.</P>
      <P>16. A bhikkhuni of unruly nature would not listen, when the bhikkhunis 
      admonish her rightfully. She would say, &#39;Noble ladies, do not admonish me 
      on what is good or bad. I too will refrain from admonishing the noble 
      ladies, on what is good or bad.&#39; The bhikkhunis should admonish her: 
      &#39;Noble lady, do not be beyond admonition. Make yourself available for 
      admonition and you too admonish the bhikkhunis rightfully. The gathering 
      of the Blessed One grows by mutual admonition and rehabilitation of each 
      other. Admonished thus if she is not amendable, should be admonished up to 
      the third time. Good if she gives up her unruly nature, if not she falls 
      with an offence for not heeding admonition repeatedly up to the third time 
      and becomes helpless with a serious offence.</P>
      <P>Precept for causing ill fame to a family.</P>
      <P>17. A certain bhikkhuni lives dependent on a village or hamlet. She is 
      seen and heard to be visiting a certain family. That family too sees and 
      knows of her evil behavior. The bhikkhunis should admonish her: &#39;Noble 
      lady, you are heard and seen to be always visiting a certain family. That 
      family too does not approve your evil behavior. Noble lady, leave this 
      dwelling, it is for your good.&#39; That bhikkhuni might retort: &#39;The 
      bhikkhunis are led by interest, by anger, by delusion and fear, on account 
      of such an offence a certain one would be sent away and another would not 
      be sent away.&#39; The bhikkhunis should admonish that bhikkhuni: &#39;Noble lady, 
      do not say the bhikkhunis are led by interest, anger, delusion and fear. 
      The noble lady is heard and seen to be visiting a certain family and that 
      family does not approve your behavior. You should leave this dwelling, 
      it&#39;s for your own good.&#39; Admonished up to the third time if she gives up 
      the wrong behavior, it&#39;s good, if not she falls with an offence for not 
      heeding admonition repeatedly up to the third time and becomes helpless 
      with a serious offence.</P>
      <P>Noble ladies, the seventeen serious offences consisting of the nine 
      primary offences and the eight offences for not heeding admonition given 
      up to the third time are recited. A bhikkhuni fallen for one or the other 
      of these offences has to beg pardon in the presence of both Communities. 
      To cut down her conceit the bhikkhuni should be rehabilitated in a place 
      where there is a Community of twenty bhikkhunis. If it happens that the 
      number is less than twenty, she is not rehabilitated and those bhikkhunis 
      are censurable. This is the proper course. Noble ladies, I ask how is your 
      purity? For the second and for the third time I ask how is your purity? 
      The noble ladies are pure, therefore they are silent, and I record it as 
      such.</P>
      <P>End of the offences pardoned by a major Community of bhikkhus and 
      bhikkhunis of more than twenty.</P>
