      <TD WIDTH="100%"><FONT SIZE="6">I</FONT>n Buddhism we use the words &quot;self&quot; 
      and &quot;no-self,&quot; and so it is important to understand just what this 
      &quot;no-self,&quot; anatta, is all about, even if it is first just an idea, because 
      the essence of the Buddha&#39;s teaching hinges on this concept. And in this 
      teaching Buddhism is unique. No one, no other spiritual teacher, has 
      formulated no-self in just this way. And because it has been formulated by 
      him in this way, there is also the possibility of speaking about it. Much 
      has been written about no-self, but in order to know it, one has to 
      experience it. And that is what the teaching aims at, the experience of 
      no-self.
      <P>Yet in order to experience no-self, one has first to fully know self. 
      Actually know it. But unless we do know what this self is, this self 
      called &quot;me,&quot; it is impossible to know what is meant by &quot;there is no self 
      there.&quot; In order to give something away, we have to first fully gave it in 
      hand. </P>
      <P>We are constantly trying to reaffirm self. Which already shows that 
      this &quot;self&quot; is a very fragile and rather wispy sort of affair, because if 
      it weren&#39;t why would we constantly have to reaffirm it? Why are we 
      constantly afraid of the &quot;self&quot; being threatened of its being insecure, of 
      its not getting what it needs for survival? If it were such a solid entity 
      as we believe it to be, we would not feel threatened so often. </P>
      <P>We affirm &quot;self&quot; again and again through identification. We identify 
      with a certain name, an age, a sex, an ability, an occupation. &quot;I am a 
      lawyer, I am a doctor. I am an accountant, I am a student.&quot; And we 
      identify with the people we are attached to. &quot;I am a husband, I am a wife, 
      I am a mother, I am a daughter, I am a son.&quot; Now, in the manner of speech, 
      we have to use &quot;self&quot; in that way -- but it isn&#39;t only in speech. We 
      really think that that &quot;self&quot; is who we are. We really believe it. There 
      is no doubt in our mind that that &quot;self&quot; is who we are. When any of these 
      factors is threatened, if being a wife is threatened, if being a mother is 
      threatened, if being a lawyer is threatened, if being a teacher is 
      threatened -- or if we lose the people who enable us to retain that &quot;self&quot; 
      -- what a tragedy! </P>
      <P>The self-identification becomes insecure, and &quot;me&quot; finds it hard to say 
      &quot;look at me,&quot; &quot;this is me.&quot; Praise and blame are included. Praise 
      reaffirms &quot;me.&quot; Blame threatens &quot;me.&quot; So we like the praise and we dislike 
      the blame. The ego is threatened. Fame and infamy -- same thing. Loss and 
      gain. If we gain, the ego gets bigger; if we lose, it gets a bit smaller. 
      So we are constantly in a quandary, and in constant fear. The ego might 
      lose a little bit of its grandeur. It might be made a bit smaller by 
      someone. And it happens to all of us. Somebody is undoubtedly going to 
      blame us for something eventually. Even the Buddha was blamed. </P>
      <P>Now the blame that is levied at us is not the problem. The problem is 
      our reaction. The problem is that we feel smaller. The ego has a hard time 
      reasserting itself. So what we usually do is we blame back, making the 
      other&#39;s ego a bit smaller too. </P>
      <P>Identification with whatever it is that we do and whatever it is that 
      we have, be it possessions or people, is, so we believe, needed for our 
      survival. &quot;Self&quot; survival. If we don&#39;t identify with this or that, we feel 
      as if we are in limbo. This is the reason why it is difficult to stop 
      thinking in meditation. Because without thinking there would be no 
      identification. If I don&#39;t think, what do I identify with? It is difficult 
      to come to a stage in meditation in which there is actually nothing to 
      identify with any more. </P>
      <P>Happiness, too, may be an identification. &quot;I am happy.&quot; &quot;I am unhappy.&quot; 
      Because we are so keen on survival, we have got to keep on identifying. 
      When this identification becomes a matter of the life or death of the ego, 
      which it usually is, then the fear of loss becomes so great that we can be 
      in a constant state of fear. Constantly afraid to lose either the 
      possessions that make us what we are, or the people that make us what we 
      are. If we have no children, or if they all die, we are no longer a 
      mother. So fear is paramount. The same goes for all other identifications. 
      Not a very peaceful state of living and what is it due to? Only one thing: 
      ego, the craving to be. </P>
      <P>This identification results, of course, in craving for possessing. And 
      this possessing results in attachment. What we have, what we identify 
      with, we are attached to. That attachment, that clinging, makes it 
      extremely difficult to have a free and open viewpoint. This kind of 
      clinging, whatever it may be that we cling to -- it may not be clinging to 
      motor cars and houses, it may not even be clinging to people -- but we 
      certainly cling to views and opinions. We cling to our world view. We 
      cling to the view of how we are going to be happy. Maybe we cling to a 
      view of who created this universe. Whatever it is we cling to, even how 
      the government should run the country, all of that makes it extremely 
      difficult to see things as they really are. To be open-minded. And it is 
      only an open mind which can take in new ideas and understanding. </P>
      <P>Lord Buddha compared listeners to four different kinds of clay vessels. 
      The first clay vessel is one that has holes at the bottom. If you pour 
      water into it, it runs right out. In other words, whatever you teach that 
      person is useless. The second clay vessel he compared to one that had 
      cracks in it. If you pour water into it, the water seeps out. These people 
      cannot remember. Cannot put two and two together. Cracks in the 
      understanding. The third listener he compared to a vessel that was 
      completely full. Water cannot be poured in for it&#39;s full to the brim. Such 
      a person, so full of views he can&#39;t learn anything new! But hopefully, we 
      are the fourth kind. The empty vessels without any holes or cracks. 
      Completely empty. </P>
      <P>I dare say we are not. But may be empty enough to take in enough. To be 
      empty like that, of views and opinions, means a lack of clinging. Even a 
      lack of clinging to what we think is reality. Whatever we think reality 
      is, it surely is not, because if it were, we would never be unhappy for a 
      single moment. We would never feel a lack of anything. We would never feel 
      a lack of companionship, of ownership. We would never feel frustrated, 
      bored. If we ever do, whatever we think is real, is not. What is truly 
      reality is completely fulfilling. If we aren&#39;t completely fulfilled, we 
      aren&#39;t seeing complete reality. So, any view that we may have is either 
      wrong or it is partial. </P>
      <P>Because it is wrong or partial, and bounded by the ego, we must look at 
      it with suspicion. Anything we cling to keeps us bound to it. If I cling 
      to a table-leg, I can&#39;t possibly get out the door. There is no way I can 
      move. I am stuck. Not until I let go will I have the opportunity to get 
      out. Any identification, any possession that is clung to, is what stops us 
      from reaching transcendental reality. Now we can easily see this clinging 
      when we cling to things and people, but we cannot easily see why the five 
      khandhas are called the five clung-to aggregates. That is their name, and 
      they are, in fact, what we cling to most. That is an entire clinging. We 
      don&#39;t even stop to consider when we look at our body, and when we look at 
      our mind, or when we look at feeling, perception, mental formations, and 
      consciousness -- vedana, sañña, sankhara, and viññana. We look at this 
      mind-and-body, nama-rupa, and we don&#39;t even doubt the fact that this is my 
      feeling, my perception, my memory, my thoughts, and my awareness of my 
      consciousness. And no one starts doubting until they start seeing. And for 
      that seeing we need a fair bit of empty space apart from views and 
      opinions. </P>
      <P>Clinging is the greatest possessiveness and attachment we have. As long 
      as we cling we cannot see reality. We cannot see reality because clinging 
      is in the way. Clinging colors whatever we believe to be true. Now it is 
      not possible to say &quot;all right, I&#39;ll stop clinging.&quot; We can&#39;t do that. The 
      process of taking the &quot;me&quot; apart, of not believing any more that this is 
      one whole, is a gradual one. But if meditation has any benefit and 
      success, it must show that first of all there is mind and there is body. 
      There isn&#39;t one single thing acting in accord all the time. There is mind 
      which is thinking and making the body act. Now that is the first step in 
      knowing oneself a little clearer. And then we can note &quot;this is a feeling&quot; 
      and &quot;I am giving this feeling a name&quot; which means memory and perception. 
      &quot;This is the thought that I am having about this feeling. The feeling has 
      come about because the mind-consciousness has connected with the feeling 
      that has arisen.&quot; </P>
      <P>Take the four parts of the khandhas that belong to the mind apart. When 
      we do that while it is happening -- not now when we are thinking about 
      at-but while it is happening, then we get an inkling that this isn&#39;t 
      really me, that these are phenomena that are arising, which stay a moment, 
      and then cease. How long does mind-consciousness stay on one object? And 
      how long do thoughts last? And have we really invited them? </P>
      <P>The clinging, the clung-to, are what make the ego arise. Because of 
      clinging the notion of &quot;me&quot; arises and then there is me, and me having all 
      the problems. Without me would there be problems? If there weren&#39;t anyone 
      sitting inside me -- as we think there is -- who is called I or me or 
      John, Claire, then who is having the problem? The khandhas do not have any 
      problems. The khandhas are just processes. They are phenomena, and that is 
      all. They are just going on and on and on. But because I am grasping at 
      them, and trying to hold on to them, and saying: &quot;it&#39;s me, it&#39;s me 
      feeling, it&#39;s me wanting,.&quot; then problems arise. </P>
      <P>If we really want to get rid of suffering, completely and totally, then 
      clinging has to go. The spiritual path is never one of achievement; it is 
      always one of letting go. The more we let go, the more there is empty and 
      open space for us to see reality. Because what we let go of is no longer 
      there, there is the possibility of just moving without clinging to the 
      results of the movement. As long as we cling to the results of what we do, 
      as long as we cling to the results of what we think, we are bound, we are 
      hemmed in. </P>
      <P>Now there is a third thing that we do: we are interested in becoming 
      something or somebody. Interested in becoming an excellent meditator. 
      Interested in becoming a graduate. Interested in becoming something which 
      we are not. And becoming something stops us from being. When we are 
      stopped from being, we cannot pay attention to what there really is. All 
      this becoming business is, of course, in the future. Since whatever there 
      is in the future is conjecture, it is a dream world we live in. The only 
      reality we can be sure of is this particular moment right now; and this 
      particular moment as you must be able to be aware of -- has already passed 
      and this one has passed and the next one has also passed. See how they are 
      all passing! That is the impermanence of it all. Each moment passes, but 
      we cling, trying to hold on to them. Trying to make them a reality. Trying 
      to make them a security. Trying to make them be something which they are 
      not. See how they are all passing. We cannot even say it as quickly as 
      they are doing it. </P>
      <P>There is nothing that is secure. Nothing to hold on to, nothing that is 
      stable. The whole universe is constantly falling apart and coming back 
      together. And that includes the mind and the body which we call &quot;I.&quot; You 
      may believe it or not, it makes no difference. In order to know it, you 
      must experience it; when you experience it, it&#39;s perfectly clear. What one 
      experiences is totally clear. No one can say it is not. They may try, but 
      their objections make no sense because you have experienced it. It&#39;s the 
      same thing as biting into the mango to know its taste. </P>
      <P>To experience it, one needs meditation. An ordinary mind can only know 
      ordinary concepts and ideas. If one wants to understand and experience 
      extraordinary experiences and ideas, one has to have an extraordinary 
      mind. An extraordinary mind comes about through concentration. Most 
      meditators have experienced some stage that is different then the one they 
      are use to. So it is not ordinary any more. But we have to fortify that 
      far more than just the beginning stage. To the point where the mind is 
      truly extraordinary. Extraordinary in the sense that it can direct itself 
      to where it wants to go. Extraordinary in the sense that it no longer gets 
      perturbed by everyday events. And when the mind can concentrate, then it 
      experiences states which it has never known before. To realize that your 
      universe constantly falls apart and comes back together again is a 
      meditative experience. It takes practice, perseverance and patience. And 
      when the mind is unperturbed and still, equanimity, evenmindedness, 
      peacefulness arise. </P>
      <P>At that time the mind understands the idea of impermanence to such an 
      extent that it sees itself as totally impermanent. And when one sees one&#39;s 
      own mind as being totally impermanent, there is a shift in one&#39;s 
      viewpoint. That shift I like to compare with a kaleidoscope that children 
      play with. A slight touch and you get a different picture. The whole thing 
      looks quite different with just a slight shift. </P>
      <P>Non-self is experienced through the aspect of impermanence, through the 
      aspect of unsatisfactoriness, and through the aspect of emptiness. Empty 
      of what? The word &quot;emptiness&quot; is so often misunderstood because when one 
      only thinks of it as a concept, one says &quot;what do you mean by empty?&quot; 
      Everything is there: there are the people, and there are their insides, 
      guts and their bones and blood and everything is full of stuff -- and the 
      mind is not empty either. It&#39;s got ideas, thoughts and feelings. And even 
      when it doesn&#39;t have those, what do you mean by emptiness? The only thing 
      that is empty is the emptiness of an entity. </P>
      <P>There is no specific entity in anything. That is emptiness. That is the 
      nothingness. That nothingness is also experienced in meditation. It is 
      empty, it is devoid of a specific person, devoid of a specific thing, 
      devoid of anything which makes it permanent, devoid of anything which even 
      makes it important. The whole thing is in flux. So the emptiness is that. 
      And the emptiness is to be seen everywhere; to be seen in oneself. And 
      that is what is called anatta, non-self. Empty of an entity. There is 
      nobody there. It is all imagination. At first that feels very insecure.
      </P>
      <P>That person that I&#39;ve been regarding with so much concern, that person 
      trying to do this or that, that person who will be my security, will be my 
      insurance for a happy life -- once I find that person -- that person does 
      not really exist. What a frightening and insecure idea that is! What a 
      feeling of fear arises! But as a matter of fact, it&#39;s just the reverse. If 
      one accepts and bears that fright and goes through it, one comes to 
      complete and utter relief and release. </P>
      <P>I&#39;ll give you a simile: Imagine you own a very valuable jewel which is 
      so valuable that you place your trust in it so that should you fall upon 
      hard times, it will look after you. It&#39;s so valuable that you can have it 
      as your security. You don&#39;t trust anybody. So you have a safe inside your 
      house and that is where you put your jewel. Now you have been working hard 
      for a number of years and you think you deserve a holiday. So now, what to 
      do with the jewel? Obviously you cannot take it with you on your seaside 
      holiday. So you buy new locks for the doors to your house and you bar your 
      windows and you alert your neighbors. You tell them about the proposed 
      holiday and ask them to look after you house -- and the safe in it. And 
      they say they will, of course. You should be quite at ease and so you go 
      off on your holiday. </P>
      <P>You go to the beach, and it&#39;s wonderful. Marvelous. The palm trees are 
      swaying in the wind, and the spot you&#39;ve chosen on the beach is nice and 
      clean. The waves are warm and it&#39;s all lovely. The first day you really 
      enjoy yourself. But on the second day you begin to wonder; the neighbors 
      are very nice people, but they do go and visit their children. They are 
      not always at home, and lately there has been a rash of burglaries in the 
      neighborhood. And on the third day you&#39;ve convinced yourself that 
      something dreadful is going to happen, and you go back home. You walk in 
      and open the safe. Everything is all right. You go over to the neighbors 
      and they ask, &quot;Why did you come back? We were looking after your place. 
      You didn&#39;t have to come back. Everything is fine.&quot; </P>
      <P>The next year, the same thing. Again you tell the neighbors, &quot;Now this 
      time I am really going to stay away for a month. I need this holiday as 
      I&#39;ve been working hard.&quot; So they say, &quot;Absolutely no need to worry, just 
      take off. Go to the beach.&quot; So once more you bar the windows, lock the 
      doors, get everything shipshape, and take off for the beach. Again, it&#39;s 
      wonderful, beautiful. This time you last for five days. On the fifth day 
      you are convinced that something dreadful must have happened. And you go 
      home. You go home, and by golly, it has. The jewel is gone. You are in a 
      state of complete collapse. Total desperation. Depressed. So you go to the 
      neighbors, but they have no idea what has happened. they&#39;ve been around 
      all the time. Then you sit and consider the matter and you realize that 
      since the jewel is gone, you might as well go back to the beach and enjoy 
      yourself! </P>
      <P>That jewel is self. Once it is gone, all the burden of looking after 
      it, all the fears about it, all the barring of doors and windows and heart 
      and mind is no longer necessary. You can just go and enjoy yourself while 
      you&#39;re still in this body. After proper investigation, the frightening 
      aspect of losing this thing that seemed so precious turns out to be the 
      only relief and release from worry that there is. </P>
      <P>There are three doors to liberation: <I>the signless, the desireless, 
      and emptiness</I>. If we understand impermanence, anicca, fully, it is 
      called the signless liberation. If we understand suffering, dukkha, fully, 
      it is the desireless liberation. If we understand no-self, anatta, fully, 
      then it is the emptiness liberation. Which means we can go through any of 
      these three doors. And to be liberated means never to have to experience 
      an unhappy moment again. It also means something else: it means we are no 
      longer creating kamma. A person who has been completely liberated still 
      acts, still thinks, still speaks and still looks to all intents and 
      purposes like anybody else, but that person has lost the idea that I am 
      thinking, I am speaking, I am acting. Kamma is no longer being made 
      because there is just the thought, just the speech, just the action. There 
      is the experience but no experiencer. And because no kamma is being made 
      any longer, there is no rebirth. That is full enlightenment. </P>
      <P>In this tradition, three stages of enlightenment have been classified 
      before one comes to the fourth stage, full enlightenment. The first stage, 
      the one we can concern ourselves with -- at least theoretically -- is 
      called sotapanna, stream-enterer. It means a person who has seen Nibbana 
      once and has thereby entered the stream. That person cannot be deterred 
      from the Path any more. If the insight is strong, there may be only one 
      more life-time. If the insight is weak, it can be seven more life-times. 
      Having seen Nibbana for oneself once, one loses some of the difficulties 
      one had before. The most drastic hindrance that one loses is the idea that 
      this person we call &quot;I&quot; is a separate entity. The wrong view of self is 
      lost. But that doesn&#39;t mean that a sotapanna is constantly aware of 
      no-self. The wrong view is lost. But the right view has to be reinforced 
      again and again and experienced again and again through that 
      reinforcement. </P>
      <P>Such a person no longer has any great interest, and certainly no 
      belief, in rites and rituals. They may still be performed because they are 
      traditional or that are customary, but such a person no longer believes 
      they can bring about any kind of liberation (if they ever believed that 
      before). And then a very interesting thing is lost: skeptical doubt. 
      Skeptical doubt is lost because one has seen for oneself that what the 
      Buddha taught was actually so. Until that time skeptical doubt will have 
      to arise again and again because one can easily think: &quot;Well, maybe. Maybe 
      it&#39;s so, but how can I be sure?&quot; One can only be sure through one&#39;s own 
      experience. Then, of course, there is no skeptical doubt left because one 
      has seen exactly that which has been described, and having seen it, one&#39;s 
      own heart and mind gives an understanding which makes it possible to see 
      everything else. </P>
      <P>Dhamma must have as its base the understanding that there is no special 
      entity. There is continuity, but there is no special entity. And that 
      continuity is what makes it so difficult for us to see that there really 
      isn&#39;t anybody inside the body making things happen. Things are happening 
      anyway. So the first instance of having seen a glimpse of freedom, called 
      stream-entry, makes changes within us. It certainly does not uproot greed 
      and hate -- in fact, they are not even mentioned. But through the greater 
      understanding such a person has, the greed and the hate lessen. They are 
      not as strong anymore, and they do not manifest in gross ways, but do 
      remain in subtle ways. </P>
      <P>The next stages are the once-returner, then the nonreturner, then the 
      arahant. Once-returner, one more life in the five-sense world. 
      Nonreturner, no human life necessary, and arahant, fully enlightened. 
      Sensual desire and hate only go with nonreturners, and complete conceit of 
      self, only with arahant. </P>
      <P>So we can be quite accepting of the fact that since we are not arahats, 
      we still have greed and hate. It isn&#39;t a matter of blaming oneself for 
      having them: it&#39;s a matter of understanding where these come from. They 
      come from the delusion of me. I want to protect this jewel which is me. 
      That is how they arise. But with the continued practice of meditation, the 
      mind can become clearer and clearer. It finally understands. And when it 
      does understand, it can see transcendental reality. Even if seen for one 
      thought-moment, the experience is of great impact and makes a marked 
      change in our lives. </P>
