        prediction; &quot; <I>When the iron eagle flies and horses run on wheels, the 
        Tibetan people will be scattered over the earth and the Dhamma will go 
        to the land of the red man&quot;</I> (the&nbsp; colour of Westerners or 
        Caucasians was considered to be reddish pink by Asians).&nbsp; We now 
        live in an era of iron eagle airplanes and fast paced cars that have 
        taken the place of horses on wheels while the Tibetan people are 
        scattered all over the world primarily because of the Chinese occupation 
        of Tibet. True to his prediction the Buddha Dhamma has spread from the 
        mountains of Tibet and the forest monasteries of Sri Lanka, Thailand and 
        Burma to the West. Buddhism is one of the fastest growing religions in 
        North America, Europe and Australia. Buddhism has taken root in the West 
        as ordained monks, nuns, and lay devotees from the West practice and 
        teach the Dhamma to both Western and Eastern audiences.</FONT></P>

        surge of interest in Buddhism from the Western World?&nbsp; While it 
        would not be prudent to list one single cause I would like to begin by 
        quoting some well known Western monks who have adopted the Buddha Dhamma 
        and dedicated their life to the practice and spread of the Teachings. 
        When Bhikkhu Bodhi of the Bodhi Monastery in USA. was questioned on his

        should appeal to Americans at this particular junction of our history. 
        Theistic religions have lost their hold on the minds of many educated 
        Americans and this has opened up a deep spiritual vacuum that needs to 
        be filled. For many, materialistic values are profoundly unsatisfying, 
        and Buddhism offers a spiritual teaching that fits the bill. It is 
        rational, experiential, practical, and personally verifiable. It brings 
        concrete benefits that can be realized in one's own life; it propounds 
        lofty ethics and an intellectually cogent philosophy.&nbsp; Also less 
        auspiciously, it has an exotic air that attracts those fascinated by the

        to have a full understanding of this phenomenon including why it is 
        happening at this point in time in our history we have to examine the

        she has termed Elite Buddhism. She claims that the American Buddhist is 
        upper-middle class, well educated, financially comfortable and 
        overwhelmingly of European-American constituency. Recent statistics and 
        information seems to confirm this assessment.&nbsp; While 2.5% of the 
        American population are of the Jewish faith 25% of the American Buddhist 
        population were formally of the Jewish faith.&nbsp; The concentration of 
        Jewish Buddhists then is 10 times more in the Buddhist population than 
        in the average American population. In general Jewish Americans are well 
        educated, financially comfortable and most definitely at the high end of 
        the socio-economic scale.</FONT></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the last decade the Western media has also 
        focused its attention on Buddhism.&nbsp; Several years ago the C.B.C. 
        radio program, <I>Tapestry</I>, announced that Buddhism was the fastest 
        growing religion in North America. By the middle of 1999 The Dharma Web 
        Ring was the largest religious web ring in the world with the highest 
        number of daily hits. America's fascination with Buddhism has spread to 
        Hollywood and been translated into such movies as <I>Little Buddha, 
        Seven Years in Tibet,</I> and <I>Kundun</I>.&nbsp; In October 1999, the
        <I>Times</I> magazine was titled, <I>America's Fascination with 
        Buddhism. </I>It focused on celebrities such as Steven Seagal, Tina 
        Turner, Richard Gere, Adam Yauchand. Phil Jackson etc. who had all 
        adopted the Buddha's Teaching and incorporated His teachings into their 
        daily lives.&nbsp; His Holiness the Dalai Lama who was a recipient of 
        the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 has through his talks, seminars and 
        publications brought the Buddha Dhamma to the forefront and made the 
        Dhamma synonymous with peace and compassion.</FONT></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What are the characteristics of the Buddhist 
        philosophy that attracts well-educated upper middle class Westerners and 
        celebrities? Bhikku Bodhi acknowledged a fundamental change in society 
        when he said, &quot;<I>Theistic religions have lost their hold on many 
        educated Americans</I>&quot;. With Western science's acceptance of Darwin's 
        Theory of Evolution and the archeological and geological evidence that 
        dates the earth as being many millions of years old many schools, 
        universities and museums have updated their curriculums. Acceptance of 
        creation in 6 days and an earth with a finite limited life span of a few 
        thousand years has waned. </FONT> </P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Events in the last decade like September 11, 2001 
        in USA have further eroded the belief of an omnipotent compassionate 
        creator God. More and more educated Westerners are questioning the cause 
        of physically and mentally challenged babies and the role of an 
        omnipotent God in a world filled with pain and suffering.&nbsp; Recent 
        statistics published by the World Hunger web site had significant impact 
        on the West. Current estimates state that one person dies of starvation 
        every 4 seconds, and ¾ of these deaths are children. How does one 
        reconcile these and other natural disasters which cause enormous 
        suffering with the role and example set by a compassionate omnipotent 
        God? </FONT> </P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The concept of a God that takes only his followers 
        to heaven and places those of all other religions (about 80% of the 
        world population), in eternal hell is losing appeal. Once such beliefs 
        brought fear into the minds of people, instilled obedience and resulted 
        in forced and coerced evangelizing by well meaning missionaries who 
        wanted to save the world. Now it brings embarrassment in countries that 
        are actively combating racism with recognition of multi-culturism and 
        religious freedom. In the past it was believed that questioning God was 
        a sacrilege, now many young Westerners have no qualms asking questions 
        and they expect reasonable answers.&nbsp; These individuals are seeking 
        a spiritual experience to fill the void left by the movement away from 
        theistic religions and are drawn to Buddhism. They are finding in 
        Buddhism, a religion that encourages questioning and experiential wisdom 
        before acceptance. This is seen as a fresh breath of air by those who 
        have analytical minds and see no merit in blind faith.&nbsp; Ajahn 
        Sumedo summarized the need of these educated Westerner when he said; <I>
        &quot;Religions that asks one to accept on faith were simply out.</I>&quot;
        </FONT> </P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Modern man likes to experience and see things for 
        himself. This has resulted in a great emphasis on meditation in the 
        Western practice of Buddhism.&nbsp; It is only through insight 
        mediation, <I>Vipassana,</I> that we can see for ourselves and 
        experience the Truth of the Buddha's teachings.&nbsp; Preferring to see 
        for themselves as opposed to gathering knowledge through learning, 
        Western Buddhists have emphasized the importance of meditation and the 
        development of the mind. Whilst Eastern devotees have concentrated on 
        developing spirituality through the practice of generosity and morality 
        (infinite compassion and loving kindness to all living beings) our 
        Western counterparts have surpassed us by using virtue as the foundation 
        for mental culture and incorporating meditation in their daily life.&nbsp; 
        As such the commitment of Western Buddhists is strong for they are 
        Buddhists by conviction and they have experiential wisdom.</FONT></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">While His Holiness the 
        Dalai Lama's charismatic personality and inspiring talks have made 
        Tibetan (Vajrayana) Buddhism popular in the West, students of Ajahn Chah 
        and Mahasi Sayadaw have introduced the Thai and Burmese Theravada Forest 
        Monastery tradition to the West. Theravada Buddhism with dutanga 
        practices in the forest monastery tradition has taken root in the West 
        as Western monks such as Ajahn Sumedho, Ajahn Geoff, Ajahn Passano and 
        Ajahn Amaro head monastery's for Western monks and nuns.&nbsp; Branch 
        monasteries are now appearing in UK, USA, New Zealand, Italy, 
        Switzerland, Australia and Canada. Ajahn Mun who reintroduced the forest 
        monastery tradition in Thailand is recognized as an Arahanth as are his 
        disciples Ajahn Chah, Ajahn Lee Dhammadaro and Ajahn Maha Boowa.&nbsp; 
        These great contemporary disciples of the Buddha have shared their 
        experiential wisdom with the West. This sharing has resulted in 
        providing many followers with the opportunity to experience the truth of 
        the Buddha's teaching through practice.</FONT></P>

        produced by Western Buddhists such as &quot;<I>Access to Insight,

        it possible for the interested Westerner to access quality books with 
        ease. Prolific writers such as Ajahn Geoff of the Metta Forest Monastery 
        in California have translated sections of the Vinaya Pitaka and the 
        Sutta Pitaka from Pali to English for free distribution. He has further 
        enriched the body of books available by translating the teachings of the 
        great Thai Arahanths into English. Lay disciples such as Jack Kornfield 
        and Gil Fionsdal have advanced the spread of the Buddha Dhamma with 
        their dynamic presence, writings and meditation classes.</FONT></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What is the cause of this 
        surge of interest in Buddhism from the Western World?&nbsp; In my 
        opinion, the reason for the increased Western interest in Buddhism is 
        the scientific approach of the Buddha, His infinite compassion to all 
        living beings, and His teaching by example.&nbsp; Buddhism addresses 
        both the intellect and the heart.&nbsp; In the Kalama Sutta the Buddha 
        asked his followers to examine the Teaching carefully and accept that 
        which is conducive to the moral benefit of self and others.&nbsp; As 
        Buddhist we should not accept the Teachings simply because of tradition, 
        because it is spoken and rumoured by many, because it is found written 
        in our religious books or even because we respect the teacher or elder 
        who teaches it.&nbsp; There is no blind faith in Buddhism.&nbsp; The 
        French philosopher Voltaire said, &quot;<I>Faith is to believe in something 
        which your reason tells you can not be true</I>.&quot; The Buddha asked us to 
        examine His teachings as the wise test gold and to accept what appeals 
        to our reason as being wholesome. Before acceptance the Buddha invited 
        us to come see and experience the truth. This scientific approach of 
        test and experience has through out history, attracted many an 
        intellectual to the Buddha's teachings.&nbsp; <SPAN LANG="EN-GB">Some 
        scholars from the past who are worthy of note are Professor Vincent 
        Fallsball of Copenhagen, Herman Oldenberg, Max Muller, Paul Dahlike and 
        Winternitz of Germany, Sylvan Levi and Poussin of France, H.C. Warren 
        and E. W. Burlingams of the USA, and Professor Stcherbatsky of Russia.

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>&quot;The religion of the future will be a cosmic 
        religion.&nbsp; It should transcend a personal God, avoid dogmas and 
        theology.&nbsp; Covering both the natural and spiritual, it should be 
        based on a religious sense arising from the experience of all things 
        natural and spiritual and a meaningful unity.&nbsp; Buddhism answers 
        this description.&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is any religion that would cope 
        with modern scientific needs it would be Buddhism.&quot;</I></FONT></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">However, people require more than just intellectual 
        stimulation from a religion.&nbsp; A religion must have truth, 
        compassion, tolerance, and be uplifting to help mankind reach their 
        highest potential.&nbsp; It should bring calm and inner peace to 
        individuals living in a world that is crumbling with greed, hatred and 
        materialism. The Buddha through example elevated man to his highest 
        potential by teaching a path of wisdom, infinite compassion and 
        loving-kindness.&nbsp; It is this combination of wisdom and compassion, 
        the benefits of which can be experienced in this very life, that has 
        attracted mankind to Buddhism throughout all ages.&nbsp; It is also this 
        that has led to the peaceful existence and spread of Buddhism without 
        bloodshed or evangelizing over two thousand five hundred years.&nbsp; 
        Possibly the greatest compliment that the West paid to Buddhism was when 
        the United Nations recognized the Buddha for his pioneering contribution 
        to the peace and welfare of mankind through the first official 
        celebration of Vesak (the day marking the birth, enlightenment and 
        passing away of the Lord Buddha). On May 15<SUP>th</SUP> 2000, New York

        <H1><SPAN STYLE="font-size:12.0pt">The 
        Stability of Buddhism</SPAN></H1>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">While the Western World's fascination with Buddhism 
        cannot be denied the question of whether this is a passing fad or a 
        permanent transformation for the Western Culture must be asked. &nbsp;The 
        Buddha's words tell us that for a religion to take root in a country and 
        stabilize it must have ordained monks who in turn have been ordained by 
        ordained monks from that country. While the first wave of Western monks 
        in the Theravada tradition were ordained in Thailand, Burma and Sri 
        Lanka we now have Western monks ordaining Western monks.&nbsp; At 
        present, the West is still experimenting with the various traditions of 
        Buddhism. They are sifting through the ethnic traditions that have been 
        imported by Asian immigrants, the textural material, which is now 
        readily available, and the direct experiences from meditation. There is 
        no doubt that over time Western Buddhism will incorporate the unique 
        characteristic of its people and their needs and stabilize.&nbsp; In 
        1938 a Japanese Shinto monk noted that it took three centuries for China 
        to adopt Buddhism from India. It would be unrealistic to expect a 
        miracle in the West!</FONT></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In my opinion, in order for Buddhism to stabilize 
        in the West they need to accomplish two things. First they need to move 
        beyond the concept of Buddhism as an individual religious preference and 
        incorporate it in everyday practice of families and larger social 
        networks.&nbsp; The heavy emphasis on meditation with experiential 
        wisdom attracts University students and upper-middle class educated 
        adults. Currently there does not seem to be a formal avenue open for the 
        children of these first generation Western Buddhists to adopt the Dhamma 
        and for families to incorporate the Dhamma in their daily life.&nbsp; 
        While the most effective method of sharing the Dhamma with Western 
        children is yet to be seen, in 1995 the Blackheath Primary School of New 
        South Wales adopted Buddhist instruction in addition to Catholic and 
        Protestant options at the request of a group of parents.</FONT></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Second they must build strong institutions to take 
        the place of the informal associations of those interested in the 
        Dhamma. With the ordination of Western monks and nuns and monasteries 
        for Western Sangha this may be just a question of time. However, the 
        assimilation may be slow as the Judo Christian clergy are financially 
        independent and the West is not accustomed to providing the requisites 
        of the Sangha who have renounced all possessions. May be it is at this 
        juncture that the Asian and Western Buddhists will merge.&nbsp; The 
        mutual learning between Western and Asian Buddhists would strengthen and 
        provide the foundation for Buddhism to flourish in the West. Each group 
        has much to learn from the other.&nbsp; Credit must be given to Asian 
        Buddhists for the stable system that has resulted in the preservation of 
        the Dhamma for over 2,500 years. Western Buddhists should examine and 
        adopt from the East that which would result in long-term stability and 
        social benefit to ensure that the&nbsp; &quot;Buddhism boom&quot; in the United 
        States, which occurred in the 1890's and faded in the 1920', does not 
        replicate.</FONT></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the meantime the response from mainstream 
        religions will greatly impact Buddhism's stability in the West. Father 
        Johnston, a Jesuit priest spoke of the value of Buddhist meditation when 
        he visited Sydney in January 1997.&nbsp; Addressing those gathered at 
        the Religion, Literature and Arts Conference at the Australian Catholic 
        University, Father Johnston spoke of the Christian churches need to 
        introduce aspects of Eastern Mysticism – such as meditation, yoga and 
        Zen - if they wanted to increase the current numbers attending weekly 
        services. </FONT> </P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">However, the response to the popularity of Buddhism 
        and its contribution to society has not been all positive. The Anglican 
        Bishop of Wollongong, (south of Sydney) the Reverend Reg Piper sees 
        Buddhism as a philosophy that is evil. He expressed his opposition to 
        the opening of a fifty million dollar Taiwan based temple just south of 
        Berkley. He directly opposed the Buddhist monks of the Nan Tien temple 
        plan to promote their style of humanistic Buddhism, which emphasizes the 
        oneness, and co-existence of the global village. The following extract 
        is from an interview given on Tuesday, June 18, 1996 when Bishop Piper 
        made an appearance on ABC's 7.30 report to express his opposition to the 
        opening of the Nan Tien temple. </FONT> </P>

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">While such extreme beliefs will deter some from 
        living the benefits of the Buddha Dhamma, it will also contribute to 
        some Westerners moving away from theistic religions. The Western 
        potential for the practice of the Dhamma with its educated and affluent 
        society is vast.&nbsp; As the Indian sage Padmasambhava foretold the 
        Buddha Dhamma has spread from the mountains of Tibet and the forest 
        monasteries of Sri Lanka, Thailand and Burma to the West. It will enrich 
        and awaken Western society as it has every other culture that it has 
        touched.</FONT></P>
