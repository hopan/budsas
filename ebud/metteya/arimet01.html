        most important aspiration for any individual is to aim for the true
        liberation of attaining Nibbana. When a person is able to make this
        resolve in the presence of a Teaching Buddha and get a sure prediction
        from him, he or she becomes one who is intent on Awakening, a
        Bodhisatta.[12] There are three types of Bodhisattas:</font><font size></font>

        </ol>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In this paper, we will
        concentrate on the last type of Bodhisatta, with particular reference to
        the next Buddha, Metteyya.[14]</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">It is natural that interest
        in the coming Buddha has grown as the years go by. When Buddha Gotama
        was available, most of the people's efforts went to practising his
        Teachings and attaining Awakening. Immediately after his demise, his
        Teachings were collected, and, since that time, great care has gone into
        maintaining their purity in order that they may remain effective.</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The number of those who
        attain Nibbana are less as time goes by, and so people began to think
        more in terms of meeting the next Buddha and achieving Awakening under
        him.[15] It is important that the practice of the Buddha's Teachings not
        be neglected, however. It is not wishful thinking that enables us to
        encounter a Buddha, but rather developing the ten perfections and
        advancing as far as possible in the practice of a Buddha's Teachings
        whenever possible. This is particularly important today as the Buddha's
        Teachings are on the decline and it becomes easier and easier to go down
        to the four lower planes of existence. If this should happen, it is very
        unlikely that a person would meet the next Buddha.</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">A Teaching Buddha is the
        greatest of all beings, and the preparation for achieving this state of
        being a Supreme Awakened One (Sammasambuddha) takes longer than the
        preparation to attain Awakening as a disciple or a Pacceka-Buddha.</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In the commentaries on the
        Pali canon, the preparation of a Maha-bodhisatta is given in detail.
        This Great Being <i>(Mahasatta) </i>will develop the ten perfections <i>(parami)</i>
        longer and to a higher degree than the lesser types of Bodhisattas. A
        person who becomes Awakened as an ordinary disciple of a Teaching Buddha
        must work on the ten perfections for ten to one hundred thousand
        aeons.[16] Leading disciples must prepare one hundred thousand aeons.
        Chief disciples work for one incalculable and one hundred thousand
        aeons. To become a Pacceka Buddha requires two incalculable aeons. But a
        man working to become a Teaching Buddha develops the perfections on
        three levels, making thirty perfections in all.[17] The three levels of
        perfections mean the sacrifice of external possessions for the ordinary
        level, the sacrifice of any of one's limbs for the middle level, and the
        sacrifice of one's life for the highest level.[18]</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Several other
        interpretations for the three levels are given,[19] and some of these
        are of interest for meditators today. The three levels can be understood
        to mean: (1) rejoicing in other people's merits, (2) encouraging other
        people to practise the Teachings, (3) practising one-self. Or, they can
        be taken to mean that acquiring merit and knowledge on the first level
        leads to life in happy states, on the second level it leads to attaining
        Nibbana oneself, and on the third level it leads to aiding others to
        attain both of these types of happiness.</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Great Bodhisatta
        achieves the three levels of the perfection of giving (dana) by giving
        (1) his belongings, children, and wife; (2) his limbs; and (3) his life.
        He will not transgress virtue (sila) on account of these three. He
        fulfils renunciation <i>(nekkhamma)</i> by giving up these three after
        cutting off all attachment to them. By rooting out all craving for these
        three, he is able to discriminate between what is beneficial or harmful
        to beings--thus perfecting wisdom <i>(panna).</i> The three levels of
        energy <i>(viriya)</i> are reached by striving to relinquish these
        three. Through patience <i>(khanti)</i> he endures obstacles to his
        belongings, limbs, and life. He will not abandon truthfulness <i>(sacca)</i>
        on account of these three. His resolution <i>(adhitthana)</i> is
        unshakeable even if these three are destroyed. He maintains loving
        kindness <i>(metta)</i> towards others even though they destroy these
        three. He perfects equanimity <i>(upekkha)</i> by remaining neutral
        whether others are helpful or harmful to any of these three.[20]</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Great Bodhisattas are of
        three types:[21] (1) those in whom wisdom <i>(panna)</i> is predominant,
        (2) those in whom faith <i>(saddha)</i> is predominant, and (3) those in
        whom energy <i>(viriya)</i> is predominant. For the first type, the
        preparation requires four incalculable and one hundred thousand aeons.
        The second type works for eight incalculable and one hundred thousand
        aeons. The Bodhisatta Metteyya is the third type, those who work for
        sixteen incalculable and one hundred thousand aeons.[22] These three
        types are also explained as being due to the degree of the quality of
        the energy they put forth, or again, as being determined by the degree
        they develop the mental factors which bring emancipation to maturity <i>(vimuttiparipacaniya
        dhamma).</i></font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">These three types of Great
        Bodhisattas are determined by how much they have developed the
        perfections when they make the aspiration to become a Teaching Buddha.
        At the time they aspire to become a Teaching Buddha, they will already
        have prepared to attain final Nibbana, Arahatship.[23] They will be at
        the point that they could become Arahats (1) through a condensed
        teaching of less than three lines <i>(ugghatitannu),</i> (2) through an
        elaborated teaching of less than four lines <i>(vipancitannu),</i> or
        (3) through further training amounting to hearing four lines <i>(neyya).</i>
        According to the commentary on the <i>Anagatavamsa,</i>[24] Those in
        whom wisdom is predominant, which was the case for the Bodhisatta who
        became Buddha Gotama, would be able to understand a condensed teaching
        of less than three lines. Those in whom faith is predominant would
        understand a teaching of less than four lines. Those in whom energy is
        predominant, as was the case for Bodhisatta Metteyya, would understand
        on hearing four lines. This might seem to suggest that the future Buddha
        Gotama was more advanced that the future Buddha Metteyya when he made
        his resolve to become a Buddha. But the difference may be related to the
        fact that a Bodhisatta for whom energy is predominant develops the
        perfections four times as long as a Bodhisatta for whom wisdom is
        predominant.</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">There are many conditions
        associated with making the resolve to become a Teaching Buddha.[25] The
        aspiration <i>(abhinihara)</i> is: &quot;Crossed over I would cause
        (others) to cross over, released I would cause (others) to be released,
        tamed I would cause (others) to be tamed, calmed I would cause (others)
        to be calmed, comforted I would cause (others) to be comforted,
        completely quenched I would cause (others) to be completely quenched,
        Awakened I would cause (others) to be Awakened, purified I would cause
        (others) to be purified.&quot;</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">There are eight
        qualifications for the man who is to become a Great Bodhisatta:[26]</font><font size="-1">

          <li>
            <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">He must be a human
            being <i>(manusatta),</i> as this is the plane in which Buddhas

            causes of being free of greed, hatred, and confusion.</font><font size>
            <p align="left">&nbsp;</font>
          <li>
            <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">He must be a male <i>(lingasampatti)</i>,

            <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">He must have achieved
            the necessary conditions supporting Buddha-hood, in other words, the
            cause <i>(hetu),</i> which means that at the time of the aspiration
            he was prepared to attain Arahatship.</font><font size>
            <p align="left">&nbsp;</font>
          <li>
            <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">He must see the Teacher
            <i>(sattharadassana),</i> as the aspiration can only be successful
            if made in the presence of a living Buddha. Only a Teaching Buddha
            can see the capability of the person making the aspiration and what
            will work out in the future.</font><font size="-1">
            <p align="left">&nbsp;</font>
          <li>
            <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">He must have gone forth
            <i>(pabbajja)</i> either as a <i>bhikkhu</i> or as an ascetic who

            effectiveness of action.</font><font size>
            <p align="left">&nbsp;</font>
          <li>
            <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">He must have achieved
            the noble qualities <i>(gunasampatti)</i> which come with highly
            developed control over the mind. Only then will he be able to
            investigate the ten perfections that he will need to develop.</font><font size="-1">
            <p align="left">&nbsp;</font>
          <li>
            <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">He must possess great
            dedication <i>(adhikara).</i> He will be so devoted he would give
            his life for a Buddha.</font><font size>
            <p align="left">&nbsp;</font>
          <li>
            <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">And he must have a
            strong desire <i>(chandata),</i> a wholesome desire, if he is to
            develop the mental factors which make for Buddhahood.</font>
        </ol>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The aspiration has one of
        four conditions <i>(paccaya):</i> the man is inspired because (1) he
        sees a Teaching Buddha, or (2) he hears of the great power of a Teaching
        Buddha, or (3) he hears the Doctrine of a Teaching Buddha being taught
        and the powers of a Buddha explained, or (4) he is a man of lofty
        temperament and noble disposition. Bodhisatta Metteyya comes under the
        second condition, as we shall see.</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The aspiration has four
        causes <i>(hetu):</i></font><font size="-1"></font>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Great Bodhisatta
            has already fulfilled his duties under former Buddhas and acquired
            the supporting conditions <i>(upanissaya) </i>for fulfilling his
            task. These supporting conditions create a clear distinction between
            the Great Bodhisatta and the beings intent on becoming Awakened as
            disciples or Pacceka Buddhas. Great Bodhisattas are endowed with
            lucid faculties and lucid knowledge, while the others do not. He
            practises for the welfare and happiness of many, out of compassion
            for the world, for the good, welfare, and happiness of Devas and
            men. The others practise mainly for their own welfare. He applies
            skilfulness to his practise through his ability to create
            opportunities to benefit others and through his skill in
            distinguishing what is and what is not possible.</font><font size>
            <p align="left">&nbsp;</font>
          <li>
            <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">He is by nature
            compassionate, ready to give his own body and life to alleviate the
            suffering of others.</font><font size="-1">
            <p align="left">&nbsp;</font>
          <li>
            <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">He is willing to
            struggle and strive for a long time, despite the great hardships he
            will encounter.</font><font size>
            <p align="left">&nbsp;</font>
          <li>
            <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">He relies on good
            friends who restrain him from evil and establish him in what is
            good.</font>
        </ol>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Finally, the aspiration is
        based on four powers <i>(Bala):</i> (1) internal power <i>(ajjhattika-bala),</i>
        (2) external power <i>(bahira-bala), </i>(3) the power of the supporting
        conditions (upanissaya-bala), and (4) the power of effort (payoga-bala).
        The internal power is the longing or undeviating inclination for supreme
        Awakening based on his personal ideals and reverence for the Dhamma. The
        external power is this same longing based on consideration of others.
        Through developing the supporting conditions, he has the power of this
        longing. And the power of effort means he is endowed with the
        appropriate effort for attaining supreme Awakening. His effort will be
        thorough and he will persevere in his work.</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Great Bodhisattas are
        confirmed in their aspiration by many Buddhas. A sixteenth-century Pali
        text from Thailand[27] says that Bodhisatta Metteyya received his
        prediction of future Buddhahood from Buddha Mahutta. This would
        presumably be the first prediction for him. This text also gives details
        of the period during which the Bodhisatta who became Buddha Gotama made
        a mental resolve to become a Teaching Buddha. This is shown to be his
        preparation for the life in which he received his first sure prediction.
        Bodhisatta Metteyya is mentioned as being associated with him in two of
        these lives: as his leading disciple when he was a religious teacher[28]
        and as his chaplain (named Sirigutta) when he was King Atideva.[29]</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The story of one occasion
        when Bodhisatta Metteyya made an aspiration and when the perfection
        which is strongest for him is illustrated is told in Pali texts which
        were written down after the compilation of the canon.[30] The story of
        Bodhisatta Metteyya's aspiration was told to the leading disciple Ven.
        Sariputta when he was residing near Savatthi in the Pubbarama, the
        monastery offered by the laywoman Visakha.</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Long ago, Bodhisatta
        Metteyya was the Wheelturning Monarch Sankha in the city of Indapatta in
        the Kuru country. This large city resembled a city of the Devas.
        Wheel-turning Monarchs reign over the whole earth and have seven great
        treasures: a great wheel, an elephant, horse, gem, wife, householder,
        and adviser. Sankha lived in a seven-storey palace made of the seven
        kinds of gems. This palace rose up out of the earth through the power of
        his merit. Sankha led others to follow the path leading to rebirth in
        the higher planes of existence, and he administered justice with
        impartiality.</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">After Sankha became a
        Wheel-turning Monarch, there arose the Buddha Sirimata. Whenever a
        Bodhisatta is to be born in his last life, there is a Buddha
        proclamation a thousand years before.[31] Brahmas of the Pure Abodes
        (Suddhavasa) travel throughout the world of men and proclaim: &quot;A
        thousand years from now, a Buddha will arise in the world.&quot; King
        Sankha must have heard of this proclamation, for one day, as he sat on
        his golden throne under the royal white umbrella, he said, &quot;A long
        time ago there was a proclamation that a Buddha would be born. I will
        turn over the place of Wheel-turning Monarch to whoever knows of the
        Triple Gem, to whoever points out to me the gems of the Buddha, the
        Dhamma, and the Sangha, as well as the Dispensation. I will go to see
        the Supreme Buddha.&quot;</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Buddha Sirimata was
        residing at that time only sixteen leagues from Sankha's capital city.
        Among the samaneras (novices) in the Sangha, there was a boy who came
        from a poor family. His mother was a slave, so the samanera went to the
        city to seek wealth in order to set his mother free. When the people saw
        him, they thought he was a Yakkha, or ogre, so they threw sticks at him.
        Afraid, he went to the palace and stood before the king. &quot;Who are
        you, young man?&quot; the king asked. &quot;I am called a samanera, O
        great king,&quot; the samanera answered.</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Why do you call
        yourself a samanera?&quot;</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Because, O great
        king, I do no evil, I have established myself in moral conduct, and thus
        I lead the holy life. Therefore I am called a samanera.&quot;</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Who gave you that
        name?&quot;</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;My teacher, O great
        king.&quot;</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;What is your teacher
        called, young man?&quot;</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;My teacher is called
        a bhikkhu, O great king.&quot;</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Who gave your teacher
        the name 'bhikkhu,' young man?&quot;</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;O great king, my
        teacher's name was given by the priceless gem of the Sangha.&quot;</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Full of joy, King Sankha
        rose from his throne and prostrated himself at the feet of the samanera.
        And he asked, &quot;Who gave the name to the Sangha?&quot; &quot;O great
        king, the Noble Supreme Buddha Sirimata gave the name to the
        Sangha.&quot;</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Hearing the word
        &quot;Buddha,&quot; which is so difficult to hear in many hundreds of
        thousands of aeons, King Sankha fainted from joy. When he regained
        consciousness, he asked, &quot;Venerable sir, where does the Noble
        Supreme Buddha Sirimata reside at present?&quot;</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">And the samanera told him
        the Buddha was in a monastery called Pubbarama, sixteen leagues away.
        King Sankha turned over the power of Wheel-turning Monarch to the
        samanera. He gave up his kingdom and a great number of relatives. Filled
        with joy at the thought of seeing the Buddha, he started walking to the
        north towards the Pubbarama. The first day, the soles of his feet split
        open, for they were very tender due to his luxurious upbringing. On the
        second day, his feet began to bleed. He was unable to walk on the third
        day, so he went on his hands and knees. On the fourth day, his hands and
        feet bled, so he determined to continue on his chest. The joy of the
        possibility of seeing the Buddha enabled him to overcome his great
        suffering and pain.</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Buddha Sirimata surveyed
        the world with his All-knowing Knowledge and seeing the power of the
        effort (viriya-bala) of the king, the Buddha thought, &quot;This
        Wheel-turning Monarch Sankha is surely a seed, a Buddha-sprout
        (Buddankura-bijo). He undertakes great pain because of me. Indeed, I
        should go to him.&quot; By his psychic powers, the Buddha hid his great
        splendour and went disguised as a young man in a chariot. He went to
        where Sankha was and blocked his path in order to test the power of his
        effort.</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;You there!&quot;
        Buddha Sirimata said to King Sankha, &quot;go back on your chest! I am
        going down this road in my chariot.&quot; But King Sankha refused,
        saying he was on his way to see the Buddha. The Buddha in disguise
        invited the king to get into his chariot, saying that is where he was
        going. On the way, the Deva maiden Sujata came down from the Tavatimsa
        heaven, and taking the form of a young girl, offered food. The Buddha
        had it given to Sankha. Then Sakka, in the form of a young man, came
        down from the Tavatimsa heaven and gave water. As a result of the divine
        food and water, all King Sankha's ailments disappeared.</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">When they arrived at
        Pubbarama, the Buddha sat on his seat in the monastery, assuming his
        true appearance with the rays of six colours shining forth. When the
        king went in and saw the Buddha, he again lost consciousness. After a
        while, he came to himself, approached the Buddha, and paid his respects.</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Venerable sir,&quot;
        he requested, &quot;protector of the world, refuge of the world, teach
        me one (point of the) doctrine which may calm me when I have heard
        it.&quot; &quot;Very well,&quot; the Buddha said, &quot;listen.&quot;
        The Buddha reviewed the Doctrine of Nibbana and taught the king a
        discourse concerning Nibbana. This aroused reverence for the Doctrine in
        the king, but after hearing only a little of the Doctrine, he requested
        the Buddha, &quot;Please stop, Blessed One. Do not teach me any
        more.&quot; He said this because he thought to himself that he would not
        have a gift worthy of what the Buddha taught him if he heard any more.</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Indeed, venerable
        sir,&quot; the king said, &quot;of all the doctrines taught, the Blessed
        One has pointed out Nibbana, which is the highest. So, of all the parts
        of my body, I will pay homage to your Doctrine with my head.&quot; He
        began to sever his neck with his fingernails and said, &quot;Venerable
        Buddha Sirimata, you go[32] to the deathless first; through the gift of
        my head, I will afterwards go to Nibbana. Having said just these few
        words, I pay homage to the doctrine of Nibbana. Now, may this be the
        means for (my attaining) omniscience.&quot; And saying this, he finished
        severing his head with his fingernails.</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">King Sankha's predominant
        characteristic was his great energy (viriya). This is shown through his
        overcoming the difficulties in going to see Buddha Sirimata. His effort
        was so strong, the Buddha realized that he was a Great Bodhisatta. Other
        perfections are also illustrated in this story. He gives away his
        position of Wheel-turning Monarch. Even before hearing of the Buddha, he
        set the example of leading a moral life leading to higher rebirths. As a
        just king, he would show his wisdom, patience, truthfulness, loving
        kindness, and equanimity. Once he hears of the Buddha, he renounces his
        kingdom and family, giving up the highest position that can be attained
        by a human being. And great resolution worked together with his energy.</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The final action of King
        Sankha is the gift of his head to the Buddha. This may seem strange, but
        it is explained in the text by the fact that the Buddha had taught him
        one aspect of the Doctrine concerning Nibbana, the highest goal. King
        Sankha cannot find any other gift worthy of Nibbana, so he resolves to
        offer his own head. In the Pali commentaries,[33] 23 it is said that
        only giving their own limbs or their life makes Great Bodhisattas exalt
        when they give. Joy arises when they give such gifts and they experience
        no contrariety of mind. So we can see that such gifts are beyond
        ordinary people, and we need not feel that we should make such
        sacrifices ourselves.</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">During the time of Buddha
        Gotama, the Great Bodhisatta who is to be the next Buddha was a bhikkhu
        named Ajita.[34] According to the commentary on the Anagatavamsa, Ajita
        was the son of King Ajatasattu and Queen Kancanadevi.[35] Prince Ajita
        had five hundred attendants, and when he reached the age of sixteen, the
        king asked his son to inherit the Buddha's heritage. The Prince agreed,
        so the king took him to the Veuvana Monastery in great pomp and
        splendour along with his five hundred attendants. Prince Ajita was
        ordained as a novice, and because of his serenity, calmness, and wisdom
        he was much respected. Later he was ordained as a bhikkhu. The Buddha
        took him when he went from Rajagaha to Kapilavatthu to reside in the
        Nirodharama Monastery.</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">While they were residing at
        that monastery, Maha-Pajapati-Gotami came one day with two special
        cloths to be presented to the Buddha for use as robes. She had planted
        the cotton seeds herself and did all the necessary work up to the time
        the robes were finished. The account of the gift of the cloths is found
        in the Majjhima-nikaya.[36] There, the Buddha refused three times to
        accept the robes offered by Maha-Pajapati-Gotami and suggested that she
        offer them to the Sangha with the Buddha at its head. Ven. Ananda
        approached the Buddha, suggesting he should accept the cloths. The
        Buddha then gave the discourse on the analysis of offerings.</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">No other details are given
        in the Pali canon or Ashin Buddhaghosa's commentary on this discourse.
        In the commentary on the Anagatavamsa, it is said that the Buddha
        accepted one robe for himself and instructed his step-mother to offer
        the second one to the Sangha. But not one of the eighty leading
        disciples came forward to accept that robe. Eventually, Ven. Ajita
        thought to himself that the Buddha had told his step-mother to give the
        robe to the Sangha for her benefit, so he bravely got up like a king of
        the lions in the midst of the Sangha and accepted the robe. There was
        some disappointment and much talk about how an unknown bhikkhu could
        accept the robe when none of the leading disciples had taken it.
        Realizing the situation and in order to dispel any doubts, the Buddha
        said, &quot;Do not say this bhikkhu is an ordinary bhikkhu. He is a
        Bodhisatta who will be the coming Buddha Metteyya.&quot; Then the Buddha
        took the bowl that had been given to him shortly after his Awakening by
        the world's four Guardian Devas and threw it into the air. None of the
        eighty leading disciples could retrieve it, but Ven. Ajita understood
        that the Buddha intended for him to show his psychic powers, so he
        brought back the bowl. Then Ven. Ajita took the cloth he had accepted
        and put it in the Buddha's Perfumed Chamber as a canopy under the
        ceiling, making the aspiration that this act of generosity might result
        in his having a canopy made of seven gems and with hangings made of
        gold, silver, coral, and pearls measuring twelve leagues when he becomes
        a Buddha.[37] The Buddha smiled after this and Ven. Ananda asked why he
        had smiled. The Buddha replied, &quot;Ananda, the bhikkhu Ajita will
        become the Buddha Ari Metteyya in this Auspicious Aeon.&quot; Then he
        remained silent, enjoying the fruits of Arahatship. The first chief
        disciple, Ven. Sariputta, who knew the assembled bhikkhus wished to hear
        more information, requested the Buddha give a discourse about the coming
        Buddha. And the Buddha gave the account in the Anagatavamsa.</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The prediction concerning
        Metteyya is found in the Pali canon,[38] but the details concerning the
        future Buddha will be given in a separate talk. The Dasavatthu goes on
        to say that from the time of the sure prediction, the Bodhisatta taught
        a large number of bhikkhus, explaining the whole canon and causing them
        to increase in insight and to attain the knowledge of adaptable
        patience. At the end of that life, he was reborn in a Deva world. But
        there is a reference to at least one other human life as he should have
        a life in which he is generous in the way the Bodhisatta Vessantara
        was.[39] After that life, he should be reborn in the Tusita Deva world,
        where all Great Bodhisattas reside before their final birth. According
        to the Culavamsa, the Bodhisatta would have other human births.[40]</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">When Ashin Buddhaghosa went
        from India to Ceylon to consult the commentaries on the Pali canon, he
        was given two verses to comment on as a test. The result was the
        Visuddhimagga (The Path of Purification). The Devas, in order to
        convince the people of his greatness, hid the text twice so that Ashin
        Buddhaghosa had to copy it twice. When the copies were compared with the
        original, no deviations were found. The Sangha then exclaimed,
        &quot;Without a doubt this is Metteyya!&quot; The Visuddhimagga is
        especially important for those practising the Buddha's Teachings.
        Sayagyi U Ba Khin considered this work the most important single work
        explaining true Buddhist meditation. In another Pali text that is not
        part of the canon, there is a description of Metteyya in the Tusita
        world.[41] He is said to go to the Culamani shrine in the Tavatimsa Deva
        world to pay respects to the hair cut off by the Bodhisatta Siddhattha
        when he made the great renunciation and to relics brought there by the
        Deva king Sakka after the death of Buddha Gotama. The Bodhisatta
        Metteyya is described as being surrounded by a host of Devas and Devis.
        Four Devi maidens in particular are described as having beautiful
        complexions, halos, ornaments, and clothes, one of a shining colour, one
        red, one dark gold, and the fourth, golden. The main point of this text
        is that beings who wish to encounter the coming Buddha and attain
        Awakening under him should act accordingly. Bhikkhus should not create a
        schism in the Sangha. The five heinous actions which inevitably lead to
        rebirth in the lower worlds should be avoided. In addition to not
        creating a schism, these include not killing one's father, one's mother,
        or an Arahat. The fifth point, not drawing the blood of a Buddha, of
        course, is no longer possible. Other actions to be avoided are
        destroying pagodas (thupas) or breaking Bodhi trees. Bodhisattas should
        not be killed. One should not be stingy or tell lies. In one of the
        texts about Buddha Gotama's description of the ten future Buddhas,[42]
        the following positive actions are said to be necessary if those who
        encounter this Buddha Dispensation wish to meet Buddha Metteyya: they
        must give gifts (dana), observe morality (sila), and develop mental
        control - that is to say, meditation (bhavana).</font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Those of us today who are
        practising the Teachings of the Buddha should try to advance as far as
        possible. Some people may be able to become Ariyas here and now. People
        who have not developed the perfections required for such attainments or
        who have made an aspiration under a former Buddha to meet Buddha
        Metteyya will need to make a maximum effort in order not to miss this
        opportunity or in order to gain the maximum benefits. We should not just
        assume that we are meant to defer Awakening until we meet the next
        Buddha. Ashin Buddhaghosa gives the example of Elder Maha-Sangharakkhita
        who needed a reminder in order not to miss his opportunity to attain
        Arahatship, for he had mistakenly thought he should wait until the next
        Buddha.[43] Meditators who become Ariyas aside from Arahats may
        eventually go to the Brahma worlds of the Pure Abodes <i>(Suddhavasa)</i>,
        and there they may live long enough to meet the coming Buddha.[44] So we
        should all make our best effort in this life.</font>

            <i>&quot;Une vie indochinoise du Bouddha: la Pathamasambodhi,&quot;</i>
            Melanges d'indianiste a la memoire de Louis Renou (1968), pp.
            217-227. According to Dvp, Chapter 31 (Pali, pp. 125-127, French,
            pp. 132-134), Ajita was from a prosperous family in Sankassa. This
            text says that Bodhisatta Metteyya had already fulfilled the
            perfections for sixteen incalculables and a hundred thousand aeons
            when he was born as a human during the time of Buddha Gotama. His
            family lived at the gate of the city Sankassa (Sankhassa in the
            French ed.). It was here that the Buddha descended from the
            Tavatimsa Deva world after teaching the Abhidhamma. On this occasion
            he asked Ven. Sariputta a question which none of the other disciples
            were able to answer in order to show that the chief disciple
            understood the Doctrine better than any of the other disciples (see <i>Buddhist
            Legends,</i> III, 54-56). When the Great Bodhisatta heard Ven.
            Sariputta's answer, he was very pleased. Seeing the pleasing
            appearance of the Buddha and hearing him teach the Doctrine, Ajita
            was drawn to become a bhikkhu. (The French translation of this
            passage is slightly inaccurate.)

            <p align="left">The account in the <i>Pathamasambodhi</i> differs
            somewhat (see Sylvain Levi, <i>&quot;Maitreya,&quot;</i> p. 366). In
            this account, Ajita is still a novice, the newest member of the
            Sangha. He is given both of the robes and uses the second one by
            tearing it up to make garlands to hang from the border of the
            canopy. After having done all this, Ajita makes a vow to become a
            Teaching Buddha and Buddha Gotama then gives his sure prediction.
            The details concerning the robe and the sure prediction are also
            found in Dvp (Pali, p. 126).

            (Suddhavasa) of the Brahma worlds long enough to encounter more than
            one Buddha. Buddha Gotama recounts meeting Brahmas in the Pure
            Abodes who confirm for him events that he recalls from the time of
            former Buddhas (see D, n . 14 [DB, II 4-41, especially pp. 39-41] ).
