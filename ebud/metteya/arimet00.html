        <p align="center"><i><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Namo Tassa
        Bhagavato Arahatto Sammasambuddhassa</b></font></i>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We have gathered here all the
        information we could find in the Theravada tradition concerning the
        coming Buddha.[1] In Burma and Sri Lanka, the coming Buddha is generally
        spoken of as Ariya Metteyya, the Noble Metteyya.[2] The term Ariya was
        already added to the name in some post-canonical Pali texts, and it
        shows the deep respect felt for the Bodhisatta who will attain Awakening
        in the best of conditions. Indeed, all aspects of his career as a Buddha
        rank among the highest achievements of Buddhas of the past as recorded
        in the <i>Buddhavamsa (The Chronicle of Buddhas).</i></font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is only natural that over the years
        many people have aspired to meet Buddha Ariya Metteyya-not only because
        it has become less common for people to attain Awakening, but also
        because of a natural desire to encounter such a rare occasion. In his
        introduction to his edition and translation of the <i>Dasabodhisatt-uppattikatha</i>
        <i>(The Birth Stories of the Ten Bodhisattas),</i> Ven. H. Saddhatissa
        has given several texts included in <i>Pali</i> commentaries and
        chronicles and in Sinhalese Buddhist texts in which the writers express
        the wish to meet the coming Buddha.[3]</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The commentary on the Jataka stories
        ends with a poem in which the writer aspires to be with the Bodhisatta
        Metteyya in the Tusita Deva world and to receive a sure prediction of
        future Buddhahood from him when he becomes a Buddha.[4] Sinhalese
        versions of the <i>Visuddhimagga </i>end with a poem in which the writer
        aspires to rebirth in the Tavatimsa Deva world and then to final
        liberation under Buddha Metteyya.[5] Ven. Sadhatissa attributes these
        verses to Ashin Buddhaghosa, but they seem to be written by a copyist.
        Another aspiration to encounter Buddha Metteyya is found at the end of
        Sinhalese manuscripts of Ashin Buddha- ghosa's <i>Atthasalini.</i>[6]</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ven. Saddhatissa also cites many
        instances from the Pali chronicles <i>(Mahavamsa and Culavamsa)</i> in
        which Sinhalese kings honoured Metteyya.[7] King Dutthagamani of the
        second century B.C. was considered to be destined to become the next
        Buddha's chief disciple.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Royalty and high-ranking officials in
        Burma often made similar aspirations. This seems to have led to building
        pagodas with five sides at Pagan. Paul Strachan points out that with the
        <i>Dhamma-Yazika (Dammrazik) Pagoda,</i> completed in 1196 by King Sithu
        II, &quot;The addition of a fifth side to temple and stupa ground plans
        in Burma is without precedent throughout the Buddhist world and the
        Burmese were possibly the first society throughout the world to attempt
        this pentagonal type of plan for a major architectural work. The origins
        of this movement lie in contemporary religious thought: the cults of
        Mettaya, the future buddha, and the present cycle of five
        buddhas.&quot;[8] Two thirteenth-century inscriptions at the temple in
        Buddha Gaya record that repairs on the temple were carried out through
        the generosity of King Kyawswa of Burma, and the concluding verse is an
        aspiration to become a disciple of Buddha Metteyya.[9] As in Sri Lanka,
        many Buddhist texts end with the aspira- tion to meet Buddha Ariya
        Metteyya.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Just as the future Buddha Metteyya
        became more important for Buddhists as the centuries went by, many of
        the texts giving infomation about him are fairly late. The <i>Anagatavamsa</i>
        is said to have been written by the author of the <i>Mohavicchedani,</i>
        Ashin Kassapa (1160-1230 A.D.)[10] It is very difficult to know how far
        back information goes when it is given in the Pali commentaries,
        sub-commentaries, chronicles, and other texts written down after the
        canon. We have given all the information available to us that is part of
        the Theravada tradition, but we must be careful to remember that texts
        such as the <i>Dasabodhisattuppattikatha</i> (The Birth Stories of the
        Ten Bodhisattas), the <i>Dasabodhisattauddesa,</i> the <i>Dasavatthuppakarana,</i>
        and the <i>Sihaavatthuppakarana</i> seem to contain information that was
        added at a relatively late date. This is especially evident in the many
        variants in various texts for names and numbers.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It takes more than just a wish if a
        person is to encounter a Buddha and attain Nibbana, however. Sayagyi U
        Ba Khin taught his meditation students that they must practise <i>Sila,
        Samadhi,</i> and <i>Panna</i> (virtue, concentration, and wisdom) as
        Buddha Gotama taught we should. Sayagyi U Ba Khin made every effort to
        make sure that his own practice and what he taught was consistent with
        what his teachers passed on to him and with the Teachings of the Buddha
        in the Pali canon and commentaries.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are many pressures in the world
        today to modify the Teachings of the Buddha. The Buddha foresaw that
        this would happen and warned his disciples to be careful to maintain the
        practice just as he had taught them. Ven. Maha-Kassapa convened the
        First Buddhist Council shortly after the Buddha's demise in order to
        rehearse the Teachings. The Sangha has kept these Teachings intact over
        the centuries, and the Sixth Buddhist Council, held in Burma in
        1954-1956, was the most recent effort to make sure the three collections
        of texts <i>(Tipitaka)</i> are kept pure.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sayagyi U Ba Khin repeated the Burmese
        tradition that those who live in accordance with these Teachings will
        meet Buddha Ari Metteyya. It is even believed that the coming Buddha's
        power will be such that he will be able to reach people who have lived
        up to the Teachings in this life but who have done deeds in the past
        which lead to their being born in lower realms before he comes. Some
        hints of this are found in Pali texts which show the power of sharing
        merits.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sayagyi also often repeated a saying of
        the Buddha's found in Dhammapada verse 354: <i>Sabbadanam dhammadanam
        jinati.</i> &quot;The gift of the Dhamma surpasses all other
        gifts.&quot; This, of course, does not mean that we should not give
        material gifts. Sayagyi himself was always very generous with gifts to
        the Sangha and others. But the gift of the Dhamma can only be given
        while the Teachings of a Buddha are available, and by laying emphasis on
        this quotation of the Buddha's, Sayagyi reminded us that we must never
        become so involved in material considerations that we neglect the most
        important gift of all. (See also paragraph 2, page 12 below. If we
        assume that Bodhisatta Metteyya's last human life before attaining
        Buddhahood is during a Buddha's Dispensation, he would be able to give
        the gift of the Dhamma, unlike Vessantara, who lived outside such a
        period.)</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">May all make the right effort here and
        now in this life so that they will attain Nibbana!</font>
