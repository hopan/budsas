        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">D</font>uring the period
        from the time of Buddha Gotama to the minimum life span, the Buddha's
        Dispensation <i>(Buddha-sasana)</i> will disappear. When the Buddha
        agreed to create the <i>Bhikkhuni Sangha,</i> he told Ven. Ananda that
        the <i>Sasana </i>would last only half as long because of this. Instead
        of lasting one thousand years, it would last five hundred years. The
        commentary on the Abhidhamma text, <i>Dhammasangani</i>, says that when
        the First Buddhist Council convened by Ven. Maha-Kassapa rehearsed the
        Pali Canon, this made it possible for the <i>Sasana</i> to endure for
        five thousand years.[48]</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The commentaries on the <i>Vinaya Pitaka</i>[49]
        and the<i> Anguttara-nikaya</i>[50] say that the eight important rules
        which the Buddha gave to the Bhikkhuni Sangha will make his Teachings
        last for five thousand years rather than five hundred. There will be one
        thousand years for Arahats who attain analytical insight, one thousand
        years for Arahats without those attainments, one thousand years for
        Non-returners, one thousand years for Once-returners, and one thousand
        years for Stream-winners. After these five thousand years of penetration
        of the true Doctrine (pativedha-sadhamma),[51] the accomplishment in the
        texts (pariyatti-dhamma) will remain. After the accomplishment in the
        texts disappears, the signs (linga) will continue for a long time.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the commentary to the <i>Theragatha</i>[52]
        the <i>Sasana </i>is said to consist of five periods: (1) the age of
        deliverance<i> (vimutti-yuga),</i> (2) the age of concentration<i>
        (samadhi-yuga),</i> (3) the age of morality <i>(sila-yuga),</i> (4) the
        age of learning [the texts]<i> (suta-yuga),</i> and (5) the age of
        generosity <i>(dana-yuga).</i> Ven. Dhammapala says, conerning the
        disappearance of learning, &quot;In a region where there is no purity of
        morality, accomplishment (in the texts) remains through taking up great
        learning, through the desire to acquire, etc. But when accomplishment in
        the summary [i.e., the<i> Patimokkha</i>] is completley ended, it
        disappears. From that time on, only the mere sign (linga) remains. Then,
        having accumu- lated riches in various ways, they give away gifts <i>(dana);</i>
        this, truly, is the last right practice. Then, [the period starting]
        after the disappearance of learning is the last time <i>(pacchima-kala).</i>
        Others say that it is from the time of the disappearance of
        morality.&quot; According to the tradition in Burma, the <i>Sasana</i>
        will last five thousand years. The five periods will occur twice. The
        first half of the <i>Sasana</i> has just passed, with each of the five
        periods lasting five hundred years. We are now in the second half, when
        these periods will be repeated, each lasting for another five hundred
        years.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Anagatavamsa commentary, the
        Buddha is said to preface the account of the future Buddha Ariya
        Metteyya by saying his own dispensation will disappear in five stages:
        (1) the disappearance of analytical insight <i>(patisambhida), </i>(2)
        the disappearance of the Paths and Fruition States, (3) the
        disappearance of the practice<i> (patipatti),</i> (4) the disappearance
        of the texts<i> (pariyatti),</i> and (5) the disappearance of the <i>Sangha.</i></font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Other commentaries also speak in terms
        of five stages of disappearance <i>(antaradhana)</i> of the <i>Sasana</i>:[53]
        (1) First, there will be the disappearance of attainment <i>(adhigama),</i>
        which would correspond to the age of deliverance. (2) The second
        disappearance is of the practice <i>(patipatti),</i> which corresponds
        to the ages of concentration and morality. (3) The disappearance of
        accomplishment in the texts <i>(pariyatti)</i> is third and corresponds
        to the age of learning. (4) The fourth disappearance is of the signs <i>(linga)</i>.
        During this period, the only good action left is making gifts to those
        who wear a yellow strip of cloth around their necks, so this would
        correspond to the age of generosity. When this disappearance occurs,
        five thousand years will have passed.[54] After this period there occurs
        (5) the disappearance of the relics <i>(dhatu). </i>When the relics no
        longer receive honour, they will assemble at the seat where the Buddha
        attained Awakening under the Great Bodhi tree. There, they will make an
        effigy of the Buddha and perform a marvel similar to the Twin Marvel and
        will teach the Doctrine. No human being will be present, only Devas from
        the ten thousand world systems will listen, and many of them will attain
        release. After that, the relics will be burned up without remainder.[55]</font>
