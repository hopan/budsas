        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">M</font>any details
        concerning the coming Buddha can be assembled by combining Buddha
        Gotama's prediction in the <i>Digha-nikaya,</i>[62] the <i>Anagatavamsa,</i>[63]
        the two versions of <i>The Ten Bodhisattas</i>,[64] and the <i>Dasavatthuppakarana.</i>[65]
        Further details can be added from the description by Buddha Gotama of
        the past Buddha Vipassi,[66] Ven. Ananda's praise of the Buddha,[67] and
        the commentary on <i>The Chronicle of Buddhas.</i>[68]</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Before his last rebirth, which is in the
        human world, each Bodhisatta resides in the Tusita Deva world. He is
        mindful and aware when he is reborn there and while he lives there. He
        lives there as long as his life span lasts. One thousand years before he
        is to be reborn as a human and become a Buddha, Devas or Brahmas go to
        the world of men and announce that a Buddha will arise. This is a Buddha
        tumult.[69]</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the time is right, he descends into
        his mother's womb,[70] mindful and aware. He is aware it is his last
        existence. At that time, there is an illimitable, splendid radiance
        throughout the universe. His mother is protected by four Devas during
        the gestation period. His mother does not break the five precepts during
        her pregnancy, and she is not attracted to any man. The mother is
        surrounded by all the pleasures of the five senses. She suffers from no
        illness, and she can see the Bodhisatta in her womb. He is seated
        cross-legged in the womb facing outward.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">His mother gives birth in a standing
        position and in a forest. The Bodhisatta Metteyya will be born in the
        deer park at Isipatana.[71] The feet of the baby are placed in a golden
        cloth. He is received first by Devas and afterwards by men. Before his
        feet touch the ground, four Devas present him to his mother, saying,
        &quot;Rejoice, lady, for mighty is the son that is born to you.&quot; He
        comes forth without any stain. Two showers of cool and warm water fall
        from the sky to bathe the mother and the Bodhisatta. He takes seven
        steps to the north, surveys the four quarters, and pronounces the lion's
        roar that he is supreme in the world. When he is born, an illimitable,
        splendid radiance is seen throughout the universe. Seven days after the
        birth of the Bodhisatta, his mother dies and is reborn in the Tusita
        Deva world.[72]</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Bodhisatta Metteyya is reborn in
        the human world, life on earth will be like life in a Deva world. Women
        will marry at the age of five hundred. There will only be three
        diseases: desire (to eat) <i>(iccha), </i>sluggishness after eating <i>(anasana),</i>
        and old age <i>(jara).</i>[73] India will have Ketumati (present-day
        Baranasi) as its capital city. In addition, there will be 84,000 cities
        with 90,000 crores of princes.[74] India[75] will extend for 100,000
        leagues. It will be without thorns, clear, with green grass. There will
        be grass which is four inches high and soft as cotton. The climate will
        always be good. The rains will be even, and the winds will be neither
        too hot nor too cold. The rivers and ponds will not lack water. There
        will be white sand that is not rough, the size of peas and beans. The
        country will be like an adorned garden. The villages will be close
        together, full of people, without interval.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The people will be tranquil, safe, and
        free from danger. They will be happy and joyful, enjoying festivals.
        They will have plenty to eat and drink. India will be delightful, like
        Alakamanda, the capital city of the Kurus. The capital city of
        lndia,[76] Ketumati, will be twelve leagues long and seven leagues
        wide.[77] The city will have beautiful lotus ponds, full of water that
        is fragrant, clear, clean, cool, and sweet. The ponds will be accessible
        to people at all times. There will be seven rows of palm trees and walls
        of seven colours, made of jewels, will surround the city.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In squares at the gates of the city,
        there will be shining wishing trees: one blue, one yellow, one red, and
        one white.[78] Divine adornments and ornaments as well as all sorts of
        wealth and possessions will be hanging on the trees.</font>
