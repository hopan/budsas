        Bhagavato Arahatto Sammasambuddhassa</font></b></i>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">A</font>t this time,
        there will be a Wheel-turning Monarch named Sankha.[79] In a past life,
        he and his father had made a hut for a Pacceka Buddha. They had him stay
        there for the three months of the rains retreat and then gave him three
        robes. In the same way, they had seven Pacceka Buddhas stay in the hut.
        The father and son[80] were reborn in the Tavatimsa Deva world, and
        Sakka requested that the father be reborn in the human world as Prince
        Maha-Panada. The architect for the Devas, Vissakamma, built a palace for
        Maha-Panada. During the time of Buddha Gotama, Maha-Panada was the Elder
        Bhaddaji, who, on one occasion, raised up the Maha-Panada palace from
        the bottom of the Ganges. The palace still waits there for the future
        Sanka, who was the son that gave to the Pacceka Buddhas in the past.[81]</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Sankha becomes the Wheel-turning
        Monarch, he will raise up the Maha-Panada palace which will serve as his
        palace in the centre of Ketumati. The palace is described as resplendent
        with many jewels, so bright it is hard to look at.[82] And he will
        possess the seven treasures of a Wheel-turning Monarch: the wheel,
        elephant, horse, gem, wife, householder, and adviser.[83]</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Through the merit of Sankha, there will
        be a square in the middle of the city with four halls facing the four
        directions with wishing trees. Hanging from the trees there will be all
        sorts of fine garments, drums, and jewellery.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Through the merit of the people at that
        time, there will be rice that grows without being cultivated. It will be
        pure, sweet-smelling, and the grains will be ready-husked. The residents
        of Ketumati will have whatever they want. They will be very rich. They
        will wake up to the sound of drums and lutes. They will be exceedingly
        happy in both body and mind.[84]</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">King Sankha's palace will have 84,000
        dancing girls.[85] He will have one thousand sons, valiant, of heroic
        forms, crushing enemy armies.[86] The eldest son[87] will be the king's
        adviser. The king will conquer the seagirt land (of India) without
        violence, without a sword, but rather by righteousness.</font>

          <li><font face="Times New Roman">Not to be confused with the
            Bodhisatta Sankha. According to Dbu, the future Sankha is a Deva
            named Maha-Nalakara (cf. D-t 43). Nalakara was the name of
            Maha-Panada in the Tavatimsa Deva world (Ja IV 318-323).</font>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman">The account in Ja No. 489 says the
            father became Maha-Panada. Sv III 856 says it was the son and that
            the father is still in the Deva worlds. D 43 gives his name as
            Nalakara (&quot;the basket maker&quot;) which would mean both father
            and son had this name in the Deva worlds. Dvp (119-127/126-134)
            gives their names as Nava-khuddhaka- Nalakara (or Cula-Nalakara),
            meaning &quot;the younger Nalakara,&quot; and Jetthaka-Nalakara (or
            Jettha-Nalakara), meaning &quot;the older Nalakara,&quot; so that
            here too it is the father who will be the future Sankha.</font>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman">Sv Ill 856f. says that the palace has
            not disappeared because of the meritorious act done by both the
            father and son in the past. Thus, it awaits the future king, Sankha,
            to be enjoyed by him.</font>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman">Anag vv 12-14. Cf. Th vv 163-164.</font>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman">In Dvp (125/132) his career as a
            Wheel-turning Monarch is described as following the pattern for
            other Monarchs (see DPPN II 1343ff.).</font>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman">Anag vv 27-32.</font>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman">Dbu 300/338. Th v 164: &quot;6000
            musicians danced there.&quot;</font>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman">D III 75 (DB III 73). This is a
            common feature to all Wheel-turning Monarchs, see Sn p. 106 (GD 96).</font>
