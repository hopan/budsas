        begins the discourse in which the Buddha describes the coming of the
        next Buddha, Metteyya.[45] The Buddha first describes the ideal
        conditions that existed on earth long ago when there were a succession
        of seven Wheel-turning Monarchs. Eventually, there was a king who
        neglected to provide for the poor. As a consequence, theft arose in the
        world. Gradually, people became more and more immoral and killed others.
        Because of this, their life span declined from eighty thousand years to
        forty thousand years. Then people began to tell lies, and the human life
        span declined to twenty thousand years. Next, malicious speech became
        prevalent, and the life span decreased to ten thousand years. Then
        sexual misconduct became prevalent, with the result that people lived
        for five thousand years. Harsh speech and frivolous talk became
        prevalent, and people lived for two and a half thousand years and two
        thousand years. With the advent of covetousness and ill will, the life
        span declined to one thousand years. When people began to entertain
        wrong beliefs, their life span decreased to five hundred years. Then
        three things became rampant: incest, unnatural greed, and
        homo-sexuality.[46] As a result, the human life span decreased to two
        hundred and fifty years and two hundred years. Then there was a lack of
        filial duty towards parents, failure to fulfil duties towards religious
        leaders (samanas and brahmanas), and failure to respect community
        leaders; and the life span decreased to one hundred years. This was the
        human life span at the time of Buddha Gotama. When the life span is
        shorter than a hundred years, there can be no Buddha in the world.[47]</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha explained that immorality
        will continue to increase and the human life span will continue to
        decrease until it is only ten years. Girls will be married at five years
        of age. At that time, people who have no respect for their parents, for
        religious leaders, or for community leaders will be honoured and
        praised. Promiscuity will be so common, human beings will be like
        animals. Animosity, ill will, and hatred will be so strong, people will
        want to kill the members of their own family. There will be a seven-day
        war with great slaughter. But some people will hide for the seven days,
        and afterwards they will rejoice to see those who have survived. They
        will determine to stop killing, and their life spans will increase to
        twenty years. Seeing this, they will undertake to keep other moral
        precepts, and gradually the human life span will increase again.</font><font size="-1">
