        Meet Buddha Metteyya</font></h3>
        <p align="center"><i><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Namo Tassa
        Bhagavato Arahatto Sammasambuddhassa</b></font></i>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he <i>Dasabodhisatta-uddesa</i>
        and <i>Anagatavamsa</i> both give instructions on what people must do if
        they are to meet Buddha Metteyya. This is very important for all those
        who do not attain at least the first stage of Awakening during this
        Buddha Dispensation, for, as we have seen, Buddha Metteyya will be the
        last Buddha to arise in this world cycle. If a person does not attain
        Awakening in this world cycle, it will be extremely difficult to get
        another opportunity.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the<i> Dasabodhisatta-uddesa,</i>[142]
        Buddha Gotama says to Ven. Sariputta, &quot;Not all men will see my
        physical body. If they encounter my Teachings (sasana), give gifts <i>(dana),</i>
        observe morality <i>(sila),</i> and cultivate development of the mind <i>(bhavana),</i>
        through the fruit of that, they will be reborn in the time of Buddha
        Ariya Metteyya.&quot;</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">These three actions are the basis of
        meritorious action <i>(punna).[</i>143] Through these actions a person
        can be assured of rebirth in the higher planes of existence. Developing
        the mind leads to the temporary purity attained through the Jhana
        states. But it can also lead to insight <i>(Vipassana)</i> and true
        liberation.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <i>Anagatavamsa</i>[144] gives more
        details. In order to meet Buddha Metteyya, people should put forth
        effort <i>(viriya)</i> and be firm <i>(dalha),</i> with agitated mind <i>(ubbigga-manasa).</i>
        We can surmise that &quot;agitated mind&quot; means the profound
        stirring of the mind or sense of urgency <i>(samvega) </i>that comes
        from realizing the urgent need to work for liberation. All those who do
        good deeds and who are vigilant - whether they are <i>bhikkhus,
        bhikkhunis,</i> laymen, or laywomen - will be able to encounter the next
        Buddha. All those who pay great honour to the Buddha will see the
        auspicious assembly of Buddha Metteyya. The holy life <i>(brahma-cariya)</i>
        should be practised. Gifts <i>(dana)</i> should be given. The Observance
        days <i>(Uposatha)</i> should be kept. Loving kindness <i>(metta)</i>
        should be carefully developed. By delighting in vigilance and
        meritorious actions, it will be possible to eventually make an end to
        misery <i>(dukkha).</i></font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ven. Ledi Sayadaw[145] points out that
        it is necessary to make balanced effort in terms of good conduct <i>(carana)</i>
        and right knowledge <i>(vijja) </i>if one is to meet the next Buddha.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Right conduct means developing morality <i>(sila)</i>
        and concentration <i>(samadhi). </i>Knowledge means developing wisdom <i>(panna).</i>
        Right conduct can be compared to having sound limbs. Right knowledge can
        be compared to being able to see. If one or the other is missing, a
        person will be unsuccessful. A person may be generous and keep the
        permanent moral rules of the five precepts and the eight precepts on
        Observance days, but if the seeds of knowledge are not planted, that
        person may meet Buddha Metteyya but not be able to be Awakened. If only
        knowledge is developed, wrong conduct will mean that the chances of
        encountering the next Buddha will be slight, due to the intervening
        period <i>(antara-kappa)</i> between this Buddha Dispensation and the
        next one.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Examples of wrong conduct mentioned by
        Ven. Ledi Sayadaw are: not being generous, being poorly guarded in
        physical actions, being unrestrained in speech, and unclean in thought.
        Such conduct will mean rebirth in the lower realms, either in the next
        life or in a future life. If people who act in this way do manage to be
        reborn in a higher world, their lack of generosity will mean they will
        encounter hardships, trials, and tribulations in making a living.
        Through not keeping the precepts, they are likely to meet with disputes,
        quarrels, anger, and hatred; and they will be susceptible to diseases
        and ailments. This will make it even harder to avoid actions leading to
        the lower worlds.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It may be possible, however, that a
        person today has already prepared in the past for attaining Awakening.
        If the right effort is made in this life, that person can reach at least
        the first stage of Awakening and become a Sotapanna. Then, it will be
        impossible to do any action that results in rebirth in the lower realms.
        This will not necessarily mean that such a person will miss the
        opportunity to see the next Buddha. Eventually, as a Non-returner, he or
        she can be reborn in the Suddhavasa Brahma worlds, and life in these
        worlds can span the careers of several Buddhas.[146]</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If a person who has enough perfections<i>
        (parami) </i>to reach Awakening in this lifetime does not make the
        necessary effort, it may be possible to become a <i>Sotapanna</i> in the
        next life in the Deva worlds. If such a person does not practise the
        factors leading to Awakening, he or she will miss out entirely during
        this Buddha's Dispensation and will only be able to attain release
        during the next Buddha's Dispensation.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ven. Ledi Sayadaw's instructions
        concerning the necessary work to be done in this life include what
        should be done by a person who practises bare insight meditation.[147]
        One should fulfil the first eleven of the fifteen good actions <i>(carana-dhamma),</i>[148]
        that is to say, all except the Jhana states. The first four actions are:
        (1) being moral,[149] (2) guarding the sense doors, (3) being moderate
        in eating, and (4) wakefulness.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next seven qualities are the seven
        good states <i>(saddhamma)</i> which the Buddha compared to the various
        protections for the citizens of a royal border town:[150]</font>
        <ol style="font-family: Times New Roman">
          <li><font face="Times New Roman">Faith <i>(saddha)</i> in the Buddha
            is like a deeply embedded pillar.</font>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman">Modesty <i>(hiri)</i> is like a deep,
            wide moat and means the disciple is ashamed of wrong conduct in
            body, speech, and mind.</font>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman">Shrinking from doing wrong <i>(ottappa)</i>
            is like a high, wide road surrounding the city and means the
            disciple is concerned with avoiding wrong conduct in body, speech,
            and mind.</font>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman">Being of great learning<i>
            (bahu-sacca)</i> is like a great armoury of spears and swords. A
            person who has heard much, who remembers what was heard, and who
            treasures it means a person who knows the Buddha's Doctrine.</font>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman">Energy <i>(viriya</i>) is like a
            large army protecting the city, for a person should rouse energy to
            get rid of unskilled mental states, to acquire skilled mental
            states, to be steadfast, firm in advance, and persevere with skilled
            mental states.</font>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman">Mindfulness<i> (sati)</i> is like a
            wise, intelligent gate keeper who refuses entrance to unknown people
            and only lets in those who are known. A person should have the
            highest degree of mindfulness and discrimination.</font>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman">Wisdom <i>(panna)</i> is like a high,
            wide rampart covered with plaster. A person should possess wisdom
            leading to (the cutting off of) rise and fall, with the noble
            penetration leading to the complete destruction of misery.</font>
        </ol>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">All seven of these good states enable a
        person to abandon wrong actions and cultivate good actions, to abandon
        what is blameworthy and develop blamelessness. Thus he develops purity.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We need not worry about whether we will
        be able to attain the goal of Nibbana in this life or whether we will
        only be able to do so under Buddha Ari Metteyya. If we make the best
        effort we can, such questions will take care of themselves. We must grow
        as much as possible in sila, samadhi, and panna, confident that in this
        way we will be able to come to the end of all suffering.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Truth Will Triumph!</font>
