        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he Bodhisatta
        will be the son of the Wheel-turning Monarch's head priest, Subrahma,
        and his wife, Brahmavati.[88] He will be named Ajita, and he will bear
        the thirty-two marks and eighty minor marks that are common to Buddhas
        and Wheel-turning Monarchs.[89] He will lead the household life for
        eight thousand years. He will have four palaces named:[90] Sirivaddha,
        Vaddhamana, Siddhattha, and Candaka. He will have 100,000 dancing
        girls.[91] His wife will be Candamukhi[92] and his son will be named
        Brahmavaddhana.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Bodhisattas decide to give up household
        life after they have seen the four signs (an old man, a sick man, a dead
        man, and a contented man who has gone forth from lay life) and after a
        son is born to them. They put on the yellow robe and engage in striving.
        The Bodhisatta Metteyya will go forth in one of his palaces. Accompanied
        by his followers, he will fly through the air in the palace and go to
        the Naga tree, which will be his Bodhi tree. He will engage in striving
        for seven days, which is the minimum period.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a detailed account of these
        events in the Dasabodhisattauddesa:[93]</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the age of eight thousand years, the
        Bodhisatta will mount a chariot that resembles a glorious celestial
        palace and when going to the royal park, he will see the four signs.
        They will produce the knowledge of a sense of urgency. And he will long
        for the state of going forth. Then he will return and go up to his
        palace. His mind will be bent on the state of going forth. At that
        moment, that jewel palace will fly up by a path in the sky, and he will
        leap up into the sky, like the king of the golden water fowl, together
        with his followers.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the Devas of the ten thousand world
        systems will take flowers and honour him. The eighty-four thousand kings
        (of India), the people from the cities and from the countryside will
        honour him with perfume and flowers. The king of the Asuras will guard
        the palace. The king of the Nagas will take (him) a precious gem, the
        king of the Supannas will take (him) a jewel necklace, the king of
        Gandhabbas will honour him with musical instruments and dancers. The
        Wheel-turning Monarch, together with his consorts and followers, will go
        to the Bodhisatta.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">By the power of the king and the power
        of the Great Being, all that crowd will be established in the state of
        going forth, and the people will rise into the sky with him and go [to
        the Bodhi tree]. Then, the Maha-Brahma will take a sixty-league parasol
        and hold it [over them]. The Deva king Sakka will blow the Vijayuttara
        conch shell. [The king of the Yama Devas,] Suyama, will take a yak's
        tail fan and honour him. [The king of the Tusita Devas,] Santusita, will
        hold a jewel fan. [The Gandhabba Deva,] Pancasikha, will take his
        celestial lute Velupanda,[94] and play it. The [four Great Deva] Kings,
        swords in hand, will surround them on all four sides. All those Devas,
        all those people and Gandhabbas, all those Yakkhas, Nagas, and Supannas,
        surrounding him in front, in back, and on both sides, will go with him.
        Surrounded by that crowd of Devas, women, etc., of great splendour and
        beauty, he [the Bodhisatta] will rise into the sky, [and then] descend
        near the Terrace of Awakening. At that moment, the Maha-Brahma will take
        the eight requisites [of an ascetic] created by his psychic powers and
        offer them to him. Then the Great Being will cut off the topknot of hair
        [on his head] and throw it up in the sky. He will take the eight
        requisites from the hands of the [Maha-]Brahma and go forth. For seven
        days he will make the Great Effort. And all that great crowd [of people]
        will follow the [example] of the Great Being in going forth.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Naga tree where the Bodhisatta will
        be Awakened is described[95] as being 120 cubits high with four (main)
        branches 120 or 130 cubits long. There will be 2,000 (minor)
        branches.[96] The tips of the branches will be bent, (constantly)
        moving, and will be continually in bloom with blossoms as big as wheels.
        They will have a heavenly smell, full of pollen.[97] The perfume will
        spread around for ten leagues, both with and against the wind. The
        leaves will be a deep green in all seasons and the flowers will scatter
        on the people all around.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <i>Anagatavamsa</i>[98] describes
        the people who go forth with the Buddha, including the names of the most
        important people among them: He will be accompanied by a large group of
        people, including friends, ministers, and members of his family. There
        will be a fourfold army and an assembly of the four castes to go forth
        with him. There will be 84,000 princesses and 84,000 Brahmas who are
        skilled in the <i>Vedas. </i>Among the 84,000 there will be the brothers
        Isidatta and Purana; the twins of unlimited wisdom, Jatimitta and
        Vijaya; the householder Suddhika and the female disciple Suddhana; the
        male disciple Sankha and the female disciple Sankha,[99] the householder
        Saddara and the famous man Sudatta; and the husband and wife Visakha and
        Yasavati. Many other citizens and people from the countryside of various
        social rank will go forth.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The spot on which the Bodhisattas attain
        Awakening is one of the four fixed places, so Metteyya will make his
        final bid for liberation on the same spot as all the past Buddhas - the
        present-day Bodha-gaya. On the day they attain Self-Awakening,
        Bodhisattas have a meal of milkrice. They are seated on a spreading of
        grass. They use mindfulness of breathing as their preparation for
        developing insight and shatter the forces of Mara. They attain the three
        knowledges and the special qualities not shared by others, etc., while
        still seated in the cross-legged position. And they spend seven weeks
        near the Tree of Awakening after becoming Self-Awakened. The
        Anagatavamsa commentary says that from the time he becomes Awakened,
        Ariya Metteyya will be known as the King of the Buddhas (Buddharaja).</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the Maha-Brahma will request that
        Buddha Metteyya teach others the path to Nibbana.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddha Metteyya will preach his first
        discourse, the Setting in Motion of the Wheel of the Doctrine, in
        Nagavana (&quot;The Elephant Grove&quot;).[100] The park is said to be
        in Isipatana near the city of Ketumati.[101] He will be surrounded by an
        assembly extending one hundred leagues. A great many Devas will approach
        him at that time, and he will set free one hundred crores from their
        bondage.[102] This will be the first occasion when a great number of
        beings attain penetration <i>(Abhisamaya)</i> into the Four Noble
        Truths.[103]</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then King Sankha will give his jewel
        palace to the <i>Sangha</i> with the Buddha at its head, and he will
        make a great donation to the poor, the needy, and beggars. Accompanied
        by his wife and 90,000 crores of people, the king will approach the
        Buddha. And all that 90,000 crores of people will be ordained with the
        words 'Come, bhikkhu'<i> (ehi bhikkhu).</i>[104] This will be the second
        penetration.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">After that, the third penetration of
        80,000 crores will take place when Devas and men approach the Buddha
        with a question concerning Arahatship.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There will be three assemblies <i>(Sannipata)</i>
        of Arahats.[105] The first will include 100,000 crores. This may be, as
        for many past Buddhas, at the time the Buddha recites the <i>Patimokkha</i>
        on the full-moon day of Magha to an assembly possessing four factors:
        (1) all the bhikkhus present are ordained with the &quot;Come,
        bhikkhu&quot; ordination, (2) all have the six types of higher
        knowledge, (3) all of them come without any previous announcement, and
        (4) the observance day <i>(Uposatha)</i> is on the fifteenth (day in the
        bright fortnight).[106] The second assembly will be at the time the
        Buddha proclaims the &quot;Invitation&quot; at the end of the rainy
        season and will include 90,000 crores. For the third assembly, 80,000
        crores of Arahats will accompany the Buddha when he goes in seclusion on
        the Gandhamadana slope of the Himavant mountain range. Otherwise, the
        Buddha Metteyya will continually be surrounded by 100,000 crores of
        those who have attained the six types of higher knowledge (abhinna) and
        great psychic power.[107]</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddha Gotama said[108] that just as he
        was accompanied by a <i>Sangha</i> of hundreds of <i>bhikkhus</i> when
        he wandered around,[109] Buddha Metteyya will be accompanied by
        thousands.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddha Metteyya will go through the
        countryside teaching the Doctrine, awakening many people.[110] Some will
        take the three refuges, some will be established in the five precepts,
        some will undertake the ten skilful actions. There will be some who
        become ordained, some who attain the four excellent Fruition States,
        some who will attain analytic insight into the Doctrine, some who will
        attain the eight excellent perfections, some the three knowledges, and
        some the six types of higher knowledge. The Teachings of Buddha Metteyya
        will be widespread. Seeing people who are ready to be Awakened, he will
        go 100,000 leagues in a moment to cause them to be Awakened.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is even said that Buddha Metteyya
        will quench the heat for beings reborn in the lower realms.[111] The
        first chief disciple will be the Wheel-turning Monarch Sankha who will
        have the bhikkhu name of Asoka.[112] The second chief disciple will be
        Brahmadeva. The Buddha's attendant will be named Siha. The chief women
        disciples among the <i>bhikkhunis</i> will be Paduma and Sumana. The
        chief lay attendants among the men will be <i>Sumano</i>[113] and <i>Sangha;</i>[114]
        among the women, Yasavati and Sangha.[115]</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Wherever he goes, Buddha Metteyya will
        be accompanied by a great company of Devas honouring him.[116] The
        Kamavacarika Devas will make necklaces which will be adorned by the
        kings of the Nagas and Supannas. There will be eight garlands each of
        gold, silver, jewels, and coral. There will be many hundreds of banners
        hanging down. Awnings adorned with jewels will resemble the moon. They
        will be surrounded by nets of bells and jewelled garlands. They will
        scatter sweet-smelling flowers and different sorts of (perfumed) powder,
        both divine and human. And there will be various types of cloth of many
        colours. Having faith in the Buddha, they will sport all around. And
        many marvels will take place through the power of Buddha Metteyya's
        merit. Seeing those marvels, many people will decide they would rather
        die than abandon him as their refuge. Many of them will attain
        Awakening, and those who do not will do good deeds which lead to
        heavenly worlds.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Several other details can be predicted
        for Buddha Metteyya as they are part of the list of thirty things that
        are true of all Buddhas:[117] He will live regularly at a monastery at
        Jetavana. His bed there will be on the same spot as those of past
        Buddhas. He will perform the Marvel of the Double at the gateway to the
        city of Savatthi. He will teach the <i>Abhidhamma</i> to his mother in
        the Tavatimsa Deva world. He will descend from that Deva world at the
        gateway to the city of Sankassa.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">He will lay down a rule of training
        whenever necessary. He will tell the story of one of his past lives
        (Jataka) whenever necessary, and he will teach the <i>Buddhavamsa</i>
        (The Chronicle of Buddhas) to a gathering of his relatives.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Several details have to do with his
        day-to-day habits: he will give a friendly welcome to <i>bhikkhus </i>when
        they arrive. He will spend the rains retreat where he is invited to and
        will not leave without asking permission. Each day, he will carry out
        the duties to be performed before and after meals and for the three
        watches in the night.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many details are given about the
        physical appearance of Buddha Metteyya.[118] He will be eighty-eight
        cubits[119] high. His chest will be twenty-five cubits in diameter.[120]
        There will be twenty-two cubits from the soles of his feet to the knees,
        from the knees to the navel, from the navel to the collar bone, and from
        the collar bone to the apex of his head. His arms will be twenty-five
        cubits long.[121] The collar bones will be five cubits.[122] Each finger
        will be four cubits. Each palm will be five cubits. The circumference of
        the neck will be five cubits. Each lip will be five cubits.[123] The
        length of his tongue will be ten cubits. His elevated nose will be seven
        cubits. Each eye socket will be seven cubits. The eyes themselves will
        be five cubits. The Anagatavamsa says[124] his eyelashes will be thick,
        that the eyes will be broad and pure, not winking day or night;[125] and
        that with his physical eye, he will be able to see large and small
        things all around for ten leagues without obstruction. The space between
        the eyebrows will be five cubits.[126] The eyebrows will be five cubits.
        Each ear will be seven cubits.[127] The circumference of his face will
        be twenty-five cubits.[128] The spiral of the protuberance on his
        head[129] will be twenty-five cubits.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Rays of six colours will radiate from
        his body and illumine the 10,000 world systems.[130] The major and minor
        marks will always be visible as countless hundreds of thousands of
        rays[131] which will shine in all directions for twenty-five
        leagues.[132] Through the merit acquired when the blood flowed from his
        head when he offered it to Buddha Sirimata, his radiance as a Buddha
        (Buddha-patha) will shine from the summit of the world to the lowest of
        the hells,<i> Avici,</i> and the offering of his head and the drops of
        blood will mean that the radiance from the hair between his eyebrows
        will be unlimited.[133]</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">People will not be able to distinguish
        night from day.[134] The only way they will know when it is night is
        through the sound of bird cries and the closing of the blossoms and
        leaves of lotuses and water lilies. They will know it is day by the
        cries of birds going to seek food and the opening of the flowers and
        leaves of lotuses and water lilies.[135]</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Wherever Buddha Metteyya walks, lotuses
        will spring up for him to step on.[136] This is said to be the result of
        his great effort in the past life when he was King Sankha and went to
        Buddha Sirimata.[137] The main petals of the lotuses will be thirty
        cubits, and the minor petals, twenty-five. The stamens will be twenty
        cubits,[138] the pistils will be sixteen cubits, and they will be full
        of red pollen.[139]</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">But even Buddhas are subject to the law
        of impermanence. Eventually, Buddha Metteyya will attain final Nibbana.
        All Buddhas have a meal with meat on the day of their final Nibbana.
        Before their final Nibbana, they will have accomplished 2,400,000 crores
        of attainments.[140] According to the <i>Anagatavamsa</i> commentary,
        when Ariya Metteyya attains final <i>Nibbana,</i> he will not leave
        behind his human body (<i>Vipaka-kammaja-rupa,</i> 'the body produced by
        the fruition [of volitional actions]'); he will enter the element of
        Nibbana <i>(Nibbana-dhatu) </i>and no relics will remain. Although the
        poem says his dispensation will last for 180,000 years,[141] the
        commentary says it will continue for 380,000 years.</font>
