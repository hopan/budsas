      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Sariputta of great wisdom,
      the leader Upatissa, the firm general of the Doctrine, approached the
      leader of the world and asked the Conqueror about his own doubts with
      reference to the future Buddha: &quot;What will the wise Buddha
      immediately after you be like? I wish to hear this in detail. Please tell
      me, o Seeing One.&quot; Hearing the Thera's words, the Blessed One said
      this:</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">It is not possible for anyone
      to describe at length Ajita's great accumulated merit which is not small,
      which is of great fame. I will tell (you about) it in part. Listen, o
      Sariputta. In this auspicious world cycle, in the future, in a crore of
      years, there will be an Awakened One named Metteyya, best of men, of great
      merit, great wisdom, great knowledge, great fame, great power, great
      steadfastness; he will be born, one who sees.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Having great rebirth, (great)
      mindfulness, full of wisdom, of great learning, he will be a preacher, a
      knower, one who sees well, who touches and plunges into the highest goal.
      He will be born, that Conqueror.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">At that time, there will be a
      royal city named Ketumati, twelve leagues long and seven leagues
      wide,&nbsp; full of men and women, adorned with palaces, frequented by men
      and women, incomparable, rightly protected.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">There will be a king named
      Sankha, of limitless strength and vehicles, possessing the seven jewels, a
      Wheel-turning Monarch of great power, having psychic powers, fame,
      enjoying all sensual pleasures; and he will preach the doctrine of
      quiescence that destroys all its opponents.&nbsp; A well-made palace
      there, like a divine palace, will arise through his merit. (It will be)
      resplendant with many jewels, surrounded by balustrades, well designed,
      delightful, resplendant, very tall, the best, hard to look at, harming the
      eyes. The jewel palace that came into existence for King Maha-Panadassa
      will rise up for him and King Sankha will live in it.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">And then, in that city, there
      will be various streets here and there, delightful lotus ponds, well
      built, with beautiful banks, 16 full to the brim of fragrant, clear,
      clean, cool, sweet water, (with banks) strewn with sand, (ponds) covered
      with red and blue lotuses, accessible to all people at all times. There
      will be seven rows of palm trees and walls of seven colours made of jewels
      encircling all the city. The royal city of Kusavati at that time will be
      Ketumati. In squares at the gate(s) of the city there will be shining
      wishing trees, (one) blue, (one) yellow, (one) red, and (one) white. There
      will have come into being divine clothes and divine ornaments hanging
      there, all sorts of wealth and possessions.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">At that time, in the middle
      of the city, there will be four halls, facing the four directions, and
      there will be (another) wishing tree produced by his merit. Hanging from
      those wishing trees there will be cotton cloth, sheaths, flaxen cloth of
      Kodum produced by his merit. Hanging from those wishing trees there will
      be tambourines, tambours, and small drums produced by his merit. Hanging
      from those wishing trees there will be encircling bracelets and necklaces
      made of jewels produced by his merit. Hanging from those wishing trees
      there will be &quot;high&quot; oranments, &quot;blooming-face&quot;
      ornaments, bracelets and girdles produced by his merit. And hanging from
      those wishing trees there will be many other ornaments and decorations of
      different sorts.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Through the action of beings'
      merits, men will enjoy self-generated rice that has no &quot;dust,&quot;
      no chaff, that is pure, sweet- smelling, with grains ready husked, ripened
      without cultivation. A sixteenth of (today's) ambana (measure) will be
      2,270 cartloads. And at that time one grain will produce two tumbas - they
      are called rice grains - produced by the action of beings' merits. The men
      who live in Ketumati in the kingdom of Sankha will wear armour and
      braclets. Whatever they want will be fulfilled. They will have happy
      faces. They will wear large earrings. Their bodies will be covered with
      yellow sandalwood paste. They will wear garments from Kasi. They will be
      of great wealth, rich; they will be waked by drums and lutes. They will
      constantly be exceedingly happy in body and mind.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Jambudipa will be ten
      thousand leagues, without thorns, clear, with green grass. There will be
      three diseases: desire, hunger, and old age. The women will marry at the
      age of five hundred. They will always be in unity, congenial, without
      disputes. The vines, trees, and bushes will be equipped with fruit and
      flowers. There will be a grass four-inches high that will be as soft as
      cotton. There will be even rains and gentle winds, neither too hot nor too
      cold. There will always be a beautiful climate. The rivers and ponds will
      not lack (in water). Here and there in the districts, the pure sand will
      not be rough. It will be scattered around like pearls the size of peas and
      beans. It will be delightful like an adorned garden.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Here and there, there will be
      villages and towns very close together and full of people.&nbsp; (The
      villages and towns) will be like a great forest of reeds and bamboo, full
      of people, I think, at a cockflight's (distance), without interval.
      Trading cities will be filled with men and women who will be prosperous,
      rich and tranquil, free from danger and in good health. They will wander
      about festivals, always joyful, always playing, extremely happy. They will
      rejoice, happy and pleased. There will be much food and water, much to
      eat, much meat, drink, and water. Jambudipa will be delightful, like the
      Alakamanda of the Devas or the broad capital of the Kurus.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">One named Ajita (will be
      born), Metteyya, the best of two-footed beings, with the thirty-two
      excellent marks and the minor characteristics, of golden complexion,
      without stain, very splendid, resplendent, of the highest fame, glorious,
      of perfect form, of good sight, of great power, incomparable. He will be
      born in a Brahman family, with great wealth and possessions, and of
      excellent family. There will be no dispute concerning his birth. (Four)
      palaces made of jewels will have come into being for Ajita: Sirivaddha,
      Vaddhamana, Siddhattha, and Candaka. Ajita's female attendants will be
      women perfect in all their limbs, adorned with (all kinds of) ornaments,
      small, medium, and large. There will be a complete (retinue of) one
      hundred thousand women fully adorned. Candamukhi will be his wife.
      Brahmavaddhana will be his son. He will delight in great happiness, be
      joyful, and endowed with pleasure. He will enjoy all fame like Nandana and
      Vasava.&nbsp; He will live in a household for eight thousand years.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">At some time, he will go to a
      park for pleasure to amuse himself. Seeing the danger in sensual pleasures
      and being wise in accordance with the nature of Bodhisattas, he will see
      the four signs which destroy sensual pleasures: an old man, a sick man, a
      dead man, and a happy wanderer. He will go forth. Having sympathy for all
      beings, he will become averse to sensual pleasures. Not looking for the
      unsurpassed, great happiness and bliss in seeking honour, he will go
      forth. He will undertake the practice of exertion for seven days. That
      Conqueror will go forth, leaping up (into the air) with his palace. Ajita
      will go forth, honoured by a great group of people, friends and
      companions, blood relatives, a fourfold army, an assembly of the four
      castes, and 84,000 princesses.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">When Metteyya has gone forth,
      at that time, 84,000 Brahmans who are skilled in the Vedas will go forth.
      At that time, both of the brothers, Isidatta and Purana will go forth
      (with) 84,000 (other people). The twins, Jatimitta and Vijaya, of
      unlimited wisdom, will approach that Perfect Buddha from the 84,000. The
      householder named Suddhika and the lay woman Sudhana will approach the
      perfect Buddha from that 84,000. The lay disciple named Sangha and the lay
      woman named Sangha will approach that perfect Buddha from the 84,000. The
      householder named Saddhara and the renowned Sudatta will approach that
      perfect Buddha out of the 84,000. The woman named Yasavati and the
      renowned Visakha will be honoured by men and women. They will go forth in
      renunciation on the admonition of Metteyya. Other citizens and many people
      from the country, and no few nobles, Brahmans, merchants, and workers,
      inclined to renunciation, a great crowd of all sorts of birth, will then
      go forth, following the going forth of Metteyya.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">On the day that Wise One goes
      forth in renunciation, on that very day of renouncing, he will approach
      the dais of the tree of awakening. In the place of the unconquered Bulls
      Among Men, on that supreme seat of awakening, seated in a cross-legged
      position, the One of Great Fame will be awakenend. The Conqueror will go
      to the excellent garden Nagavana in full flower, and there he will set in
      motion the incomparable Wheel of the Doctrine: misery, the arising of
      misery, the overcoming of misery, and the Noble Eightfold Path leading to
      the cessation of misery. Then, there will be a gathering of men all around
      for one hundred leagues when that protector of the world sets in motion
      the Wheel of the Doctrine. Then, very many Devas will approach the
      Conqueror there, and he will free 100,000 crores from their bondage. Then,
      that king Sankha, having given his jewel palace to the Sangha with the
      Conqueror at its head, having given another great gift to the poor, the
      needy, and to beggars, hurrying along with this queen, he will approach
      the Perfect Buddha. Through the power of the great king and his limitless
      force of charriots, he will approach the Conqueror accompanied by 90,000
      crores (of people). Then the Perfect Buddha will beat the drum of the
      Doctrine, the excellent and highest sound of the kettle drum of the
      undying, making known the Four Truths. The company of people accompanying
      the king, all 90,000 crores without exception, will become &quot;Come
      Bhikkhu&quot; monks.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Then Devas and men will
      approach the Leader of the World and ask the Conqueror a question
      concerning Arahatship. That Conqueror will answer them and 80,000 crores
      will attain Arahatship. That will be the third penetration. The first
      assembly will be of 100,000 crores of those whose taints are destroyed,
      who are spotless, of peaceful minds, venerable ones. When the Blessed One
      proclaims the Invitation (to declare purity) at the end of the rainy
      season, that Conqueror will be surrounded by 90,000 crores. And when the
      Sage has gone in seclusion to the golden and silver Gandhamadana slope of
      the Himavanta mountain range, he will enjoy the sport of meditation
      (accompanied by) 80,000 crores of those whose taints are destroyed, who
      are spotless, of peaceful minds, venerable ones. 100,000 crores of those
      who possess the six higher knowledges, who possess great psychic power,
      will constantly surround that Protector of the World, Metteyya.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Skilled in discriminating
      knowledge, knowing the words and the explanation (of the Doctrine), very
      learned, expert in the Doctrine, knowledgeable, adorning the Sangha, well
      tamed, gentle, firm, they will surround that Conqueror. That Naga (the
      Buddha) will be honoured by those monks who will be Nagas like him. He who
      will have crossed over, together with those who have crossed over, who are
      at peace, who assemble in peace. Together with an order of disciples
      surrounding that Great Sage, the Compassionate One, the Sympathetic One,
      Metteyya, greatest of two-footed beings,&nbsp; raising up many individuals
      and Devas, will bring them to Nibbana. That Conqueror will wander around
      the towns and villages and capitals. He will beat the drum of the
      Doctrine. He will sound the conch shell of the Doctrine. He will proclaim
      the spiritual sacrifice. He will raise the banner of the Doctrine. He will
      roar the lion's roar, set in motion the excellent wheel (of the Doctrine),
      and cause men and women to drink the drink of truth with its excellent
      taste. That Conqueror will wander for the sake of all beings, both rich
      and poor, causing many people who are capable of being awakened to be
      awakened.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Seeing One will cause
      some to take refuge (in the Triple Gem), some to take the five moral
      precepts, and some to undertake the ten skilful (actions). He will give
      some the state of being a novice and the four excellent Fruition States.
      He will give some discriminating knowledge into the incomparable Doctrine.
      The Seeing One will give some the eight excellent attainments. He will
      give some the three knowledges and the six higher knowledges. That
      Conqueror will admonish (a large) group of people (to undertake) that
      practice. Then the Teaching of the Conqueror Metteyya will be wide spread.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Seeing people capable of
      being awakened, that Sage will go 100,000 leagues in a moment and will
      cause them to be awakened. At that time, Metteyya's mother will be named
      Brahmavati, his father will be named Subrahma and will be the priest of
      King Sankha. His foremost lay disciples will be Asoka and Brahmadeva. The
      (lay) attendant Siha will attend on that Conqueror. Paduma and Sumana will
      be his foremost female disciples. Sumana and Sangha will be his foremost
      personal attendants. Yasavati and Sangha will be his foremost female
      attendants. The Naga tree will be the awakening (place) for that Blessed
      One. Its trunk will be two thousand cubits. It will have 20,000 branches
      with curved tips (always) moving. It will shine like the outspread tail of
      a peacock. The tips (of the branches) will be continually in flower and
      fragrant with a heavenly smell. The blossoms will be the size of wheels,
      with enough pollen to fill a nali measure. (The tree) will send its
      perfume in all directions for ten leagues, both with and against the wind.
      It will scatter its flowers all around the throne of awakening. People
      from the country, coming together there, will smell the excellent odour
      and pour forth words (of admiration), rejoicing in its odour. There will
      be a happy fruition of meritorious deeds for that venerable one, the Best
      of Buddhas, whose unimaginable radiance will spread out (like the smell
      of) the flowers.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">That Conqueror will be
      eighty-eight cubits tall. That Teacher's chest will be twenty- five cubits
      in diameter. The Seer will have broad eyes with thick eyelashes. His eyes
      will be pure, not blinking day or night. His physical eye will see small
      or large things in all directions for ten leagues without obstruction. His
      radiance will stream forth as far as twenty-five leagues. That Conqueror
      will shine like a streak of lightening or a candlestick. He will shine
      like the sun, resembling a garland of jewels.&nbsp; His (thirty-two major)
      marks and (eighty) secondary marks will at all times be seen as rays. Many
      hundreds of thousands of different sorts of rays will fall down. At every
      footstep (he takes) a beautiful flowering lotus will grow. (The lotuses
      will be) thirty cubits (across) with even petals and twenty-five minor
      petals. The stamens will be twenty cubits long and the pericaps will be
      sixteen cubits long. Inside the red lotuses (the flowers) will be filled
      with very red pollen. The Kamavacarika Devas will make columns of honour
      and Naga kings and Supanna (Devas) will decorate them.&nbsp; There will be
      eight columns of gold, eight of silver, eight of jewels, and eight made of
      coral. There will be many hundreds of flags hanging there disporting
      themselves adorned garlands of flags ornamented with many precious things.
      There will be awnings adorned with jewels and resembling the moon. There
      will be many jewelled head ornaments with nets of small bells surrounding
      them.&nbsp; They will scatter fragrant, sweet-smelling, perfumed flowers,
      and different sorts of powder, both human and divine, and a variety of
      cloths of diverse colours, beautiful, of the five colours. They will all
      sport around, having faith in the Buddha. There will be gateways there
      with strings of jewels, a thousand (cubits) high, delightful, beautiful,
      unobstructed and well-formed. They will be seen to be shining, with their
      radiance widespread all around.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha, at the head of
      the Order of Monks, will go in their midst, like Brahma in his assembly or
      lnda in his palace. When the Buddha goes (anywhere), they will go; when he
      stays (in a place), they will stay; when the Teacher sits or lies down
      together with his assembly, they will always practise the (same) four
      postures. There will be these honours as well as others, both human and
      divine. There will constantly be many sorts of marvels to honour Metteyya
      through the power of his endless merit.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Having seen that marvel, many
      people of various births, (many) men with their families, will only
      abandon the Teacher as their refuge at the cost of their lives. Whoever
      practices the holy life after hearing the word of the Sage, that person
      will go beyond journeying-on, which is subject to death and difficult to
      escape from. Many householders will purify the eye of the Doctrine by
      means of the ten meritorious acts and the three types of right action.
      Many will be destined for heaven through being accomplished in the
      traditional learning and texts, having purified (themselves) through
      respect for him, and through following the true Doctrine. It would not be
      possible to describe in every detail their fame which will be so great.
      They will be continually very happy. When they reach the end of their time
      (in that life), those men will have great fame as well as happiness. Life,
      beauty, and strength, and heavenly bliss (in a heavenly world) will be
      theirs. They will experience the happiness of sensual pleasures for as
      long as they wish. Then afterwards, at the end of their lives, they will
      enter into (true) happiness.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">(The Buddha's) lifetime there
      will be 80,000 years. Remaining there that long, he will bring many people
      to the other shore. He will cause beings whose minds are ripe to be
      completely awakened and he will instruct others who have not perceived the
      (four) truths concerning which is the right path and which is the wrong
      path. He will carefully establish the torch of the Doctrine, the boat of
      the Doctrine, the mirror of the Doctrine, the medicine (of the Doctrine)
      for beings (at that time and) in the future. Then, in the midst of the
      venerable order of lay disciples who will have done what should be done,
      that Conqueror will blaze out like a mass of fire, and he will be
      extinguished. When the Perfect Buddha has been completely extinguished,
      his Teaching will remain for 180,000 years. After that, there will be a
      terrible disappearance in the world.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, the constituent
      elements are impermanent, not firm, temporary, transitory, liable to
      destruction and old age, and empty. The constituent elements are like an
      empty fist, they are empty, they are the talk of fools. There is no power
      for anyone there, not even for one who has the psychic powers.&nbsp; Thus,
      knowing this as it really is, one should be disillusioned with all
      compounded things. A Thoroughbred Among Men is hard to find. He is not
      born everywhere. Wherever that Hero is born, that happy family prospers.
      Therefore, in order to see Buddha Metteyya here, act rightly, firmly,
      energetically, with agitated mind. Whoever does good things here and
      dwells vigilent, whether a monk, nun, lay disciple, or laywoman disciple,
      whoever esteems the great Buddha, pays great honour to the Great One, that
      person together with the Devas will see the auspicious assembly at that
      time. Practise the holy life. Give suitable gifts. Keep the observance
      days. Practise loving kindness carefully. Be one who delights in being
      vigilent, always performing meritorious actions. Having acted skilfully
      here, you will make an end of misery.</font></p>
