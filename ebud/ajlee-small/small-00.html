    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is a work in progress. Eventually, I hope to make
    available in English a much larger collection of Ajaan Lee's talks to add to the
    collections already available: <i>Lessons in Samadhi, Food for Thought, Inner Strength,</i>
    and <i>The Skill of Release.</i> But for the moment, in keeping with the title of the
    collection, I'd like to start out small. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The passages translated here had their beginnings in talks
    that Ajaan Lee gave to groups of people while they were meditating. In some cases, the
    people were his followers; in others, total strangers. In every case, Ajaan Lee found it
    necessary to cover the sorts of questions that occur to people new to meditation -- Why
    meditate? How should I meditate? And why in that particular way? -- and in his own style
    he provided not only straightforward answers to these questions but also vivid analogies,
    to help his listeners relate their meditation to familiar activities so that they would
    feel less intimidated by the uncharted areas of the minds they were trying to tame. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One aspect of Ajaan Lee's teachings that might strike you
    as foreign is his analysis of the body into four properties: earth, fire, water, and wind.
    This mode of analysis dates back to the time of the Buddha, although Ajaan Lee develops it
    in a distinctive way. Think of this analysis, not as an attempt at biology or chemistry --
    the sciences we use to analyze the body from the outside -- but as a way of analyzing how
    the body feels from the inside. This is an aspect of awareness that we often overlook and
    that, in English at least, we have a poor vocabulary for describing. As you gain through
    meditation a greater familiarity with this aspect of your awareness, you'll come to see
    how useful Ajaan Lee's method of analysis is. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The passages included here have taken a fairly circuitous
    route from Ajaan Lee's mouth to your eyes. One of his followers -- a nun, Mae Chii Arun
    Abhivanna -- took notes during the talks, from which she later worked up reconstructed
    versions of what Ajaan Lee had said. Ajaan Lee had a chance to review and revise the
    reconstructions of the talks dated prior to 1957. As for the talks made after that year,
    Mae Chii Arun didn't get around to making reconstructions until after Ajaan Lee's death in
    1961, and so these were printed without his input. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although the talks make for great reading, they make for
    even better listening. If you meditate with a group of friends, try arranging for one
    member of the group to read a passage while the others are meditating. In that way, you
    can best recreate the context for which the talks were originally intended. </font></p>
