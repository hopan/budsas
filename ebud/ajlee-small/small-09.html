    <h3 align="right"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>August 4, 1956</i></font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">W</font>hen we sit and meditate, there are
    three things we have to work with: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1) The breath: make it the object of the mind. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">2) Mindfulness: think of the meditation word <i>bud-</i>
      with the in-breath and <i>dho</i> with the out. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">3) The mind: keep the mind both with the breath and with
      the meditation word. Let the breath flow comfortably. Let the mind be at ease. Don't force
      the breath or try to put the mind into a trance. Keep the mind firm and upright, and don't
      let it slip off here or there. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These are the things we have to study -- not just so that
    we'll know them. We study them so that we can put them into practice, i.e., we practice
    them so that we'll come to the knowledge we really want. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In keeping the mind pure, we have to cut away perceptions
    so that they don't stick in the heart. It's like looking after a white sheet spread on our
    bed. We have to watch out for any dust that will blow in on the wind and land on the
    sheet, and for any insects -- such as ants or bed bugs -- that will come to live there. If
    we see any dust, we have to take the sheet and shake it out. Wherever there are any
    stains, we have to launder it immediately. Don't let them stay long on the sheet or else
    they'll be hard to wash out. If there are any insects, we have to remove them, for they
    may bite us and give us a rash or keep us from sleeping soundly. When we keep looking
    after our sheet in this way, it will have to stay clean and white and be a comfortable
    place for us to sleep. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The dust and insects here are the Hindrances that are the
    enemies of the heart. We have to look after our heart in just the same way we look after
    our bedding. We can't let any outside perceptions come in and stick to the heart or nibble
    at it. We have to brush them all away. That way the mind will become calm, free from
    distractions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we meditate, we're giving rise to skill in three
    ways: we aren't harming anyone with our body; we aren't bad-mouthing anyone with our
    speech; and we're getting the mind to stay with good intentions. In other words, we're
    staying with <i>buddho</i> with every in-and-out breath, so we're not thinking of doing
    anything evil, and we don't think thoughts of anger or hatred about anyone. This way our
    body, speech, and mind are pure. This is what gives rise to merit and skill, for we're not
    doing any evil at all. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we think of the breath in this way, it's as if we're
    painting a picture on a piece of white cloth. Our mind in its ordinary state is like a
    plain piece of cloth, with no patterns or designs. When we raise the mind to a higher
    level and think of the factors of meditation, it's like drawing a mental picture on it.
    For example, the word <i>buddho</i> is a mental picture, inasmuch as we can't see it with
    our eyes, but we can see it through our thinking. If we think of it constantly, it's as if
    our ink or paint seeps deep into the cloth. If we don't think <i>buddho,</i> or think of
    it in only a superficial way, it's like drawing with a pencil. The picture won't stick and
    seep into the heart. It might get smeared or entirely erased. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then we add details to our picture: this is what's meant
    by evaluation <i>(vicara).</i> If we keep at it, our picture will become more and more
    elaborate. As the picture becomes more and more elaborate, we'll notice whether the
    in-and-out breath has become comfortable or not. If it's easy and comfortable, keep it
    that way. Sometimes you'll notice that the mind is comfortable but the body isn't;
    sometimes the body is comfortable but the mind is irritable and distracted; sometimes the
    body is reasonably comfortable and at ease, and the mind has settled down and isn't
    jumping about. So when you see any aspect that isn't comfortable, you should fix it, in
    the same way that a rice farmer has to keep careful watch over the sluice gates in his
    field, clearing out any branches or stumps that will cut off the flow of the water. When
    you see anything that isn't good, you should get rid of it. You have to stay observant of
    the breath, to see if it's too slow or too fast, or if it's making you tired. If it is,
    change it. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is like plowing or harrowing your field. When the big
    clods of earth get broken up and spread around, the field will be level. When the body
    gets level and smooth, keep it going that way. The mind will then become level and smooth
    as well -- for it lives with the body, and now it gets to stay in a place of comfort.
    Whether it's good in every part, or only in some parts, you'll know. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we give rise to skill in the mind like this, it's as
    if we've gained wealth. And when we gain wealth, things are bound to come and disturb us,
    just as a tree with beautiful, fragrant flowers tends to have caterpillars or insects
    disturbing its flowers. When the virtues of the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha arise in the
    heart, there are bound to be things that will disturb or destroy them, such as visions or
    Hindrances, just as when a flower is pestered by insects, it may fall away from the tree.
    When it falls off the tree, it won't be able to bear fruit. The same with your mind: Don't
    let your goodness fall away under the influence of the Hindrances. You have to keep after
    it, to make sure that it stays still and established in the body until there's no sense of
    anything disturbing it or trying to destroy it. The mind will then be like a spray of
    mango flowers nourished with drops of mist. In no long time it will bear fruit, and you'll
    be able to harvest the fruit and eat it in comfort. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Dhammapada, the Buddha says that a person who is
    forgetful or heedless is like a dead person. In other words, if mindfulness lapses for a
    moment, you've passed out for a moment. If it lapses for a long time, you've passed out
    for a long time. So if you realize that it's lapsed, you have to correct things
    immediately. In other words, you re-establish mindfulness right away. If you've realized
    it's lapsed, there's at least some hope for you. Some people don't even know that it's
    lapsed: those are the ones who are hopeless. As the Buddha said, <i>pamado maccuno padam:</i>
    heedlessness is the path of death. This is because heedlessness is delusion, the root of
    unskillfulness. When delusion arises, it opens the way for all kinds of evil and
    unskillful things. So we should try to uproot it immediately before it starts growing and
    spreading its branches far and wide. When mindfulness lapses, it opens the way for us to
    think of all kinds of things, making it hard for us to finish our work. To say nothing of
    keeping track of the breath, if mindfulness keeps lapsing we couldn't even finish writing
    a single letter. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So we have to be especially careful to maintain
    mindfulness. Don't let yourself forget or lose track of what you're doing. </font></p>
