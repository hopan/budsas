    Guardian Meditations</font></h2>
    <h3 align="right"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>August 11, 1956</i></font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">W</font>hen you sit and meditate, keep
    observing two important factors: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">1)</b> the body, which is where the mind dwells; and </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>2)</b> the mind, which is the factor responsible for
      good and evil. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The mind is a factor that's extremely fickle and fast. It
    likes to slip off looking for all sorts of nonsense, for things that bring us nothing but
    trouble. It doesn't like to stay in place. Now it goes running here, now it goes running
    there, bringing back different kinds of suffering. That's why we say that it's fickle and
    fast: easily diverted, hard to look after. Now, since our mind is so fickle and fast, the
    Buddha had to search for a method by which we can take this weak point and turn it around
    into something good. He teaches us to develop concentration by focusing on the body. In
    other words, he has us fix our attention on one of the really important factors of the
    body, the breath. The breath is what helps us find comfort and ease in all the parts of
    the body. It's what keeps the body alive. All of our sense doors -- the eyes, the ears,
    the nose, the tongue, the body, and the mind -- depend on the breath to create the
    sensations by which they receive impressions of outside things and bring them in to have
    an effect on the body. For instance, the function of the eyes is to receive impressions of
    forms for us to see. The function of the ears is to receive impressions of sounds for us
    to hear. The function of the nose is to receive impressions of aromas for us to smell. The
    function of the tongue is to receive impressions of flavors for us to taste. The function
    of the body is to receive impressions of tactile sensations for us to touch. The function
    of the mind is to receive impressions of the various things that come in via these other
    five senses. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So when we meditate, we have to close all of these sense
    doors off tight. We close our eyes: we don't have to look at pretty sights or ugly ones.
    We close our ears, so that we don't listen to anything that isn't necessary -- i.e.,
    anything that isn't beneficial to listen to. Only the words that advise us to do good
    should we listen to. As for the nose, it's necessary for life. If we don't have the nose
    as our breathing passage, we start having problems in the other parts of the body, so we
    keep it open. As for the mouth, we keep it closed. And as for the body, we keep it in one
    position, as when we sit with our legs crossed, like we're doing right now. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We have to try to keep these sense doors closed off, so
    that we don't use our eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, or mind in any other activity aside
    from practicing concentration. We herd the mind into one preoccupation, so that it stays
    in its home, the body, with the windows and doors all shut. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The mind is the heart-property or heart-element. The
    nature of the mind is that it's faster than the wind in the air, which flows to and fro,
    up and down, and never stays in place. So we have to bring our mindfulness into the mind
    so that we can take this weak point and turn it around into something good. This is called
    <i>bhavana, </i>or mental development through meditation. We focus on the breath and
    recollect the qualities of the Buddha. When we start off recollecting the Buddha in this
    way, we simply think of the word, <i>buddho.</i> We don't yet have to analyze what it
    means. <i>Buddho</i> is a name for mindfulness. It means being aware, being awake. But if
    we simply think of the word <i>buddho,</i> it doesn't fulfill all the factors for mental
    development through meditation. When we think the word, we have to steady and adjust it so
    that it stays in rhythm with the breath. When we breathe, we have to breathe just right,
    not too slow, not too fast, whatever feels natural. Then we think <i>buddho</i> back and
    forth with the breath, adjusting our thinking so that it merges with the breathing. That's
    when we can say that we're fulfilling the factors of meditation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is called recollection of the Buddha, in which we
    think of the qualities of the Buddha in an abbreviated way, depending on the breath as our
    focal point and keeping our mindfulness in charge of the thinking. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When mindfulness becomes one with the breath and with our
    awareness in this way, our various senses will grow even and calm. The mind will gradually
    grow more and more quiet, bit by bit. This is called getting established in the first
    &quot;guardian meditation&quot; -- recollection of the Buddha -- in which we use our
    thinking as a path of practice. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This kind of thinking gives results for Buddhists of all
    sorts. At the same time, it brings us into the factors that are helpful for the mind --
    mindfulness and alertness -- the factors that support the mind in getting established in
    goodness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second guardian meditation is good will. The word good
    will -- <i>metta</i> -- comes from <i>mitta, </i>or friend. As a quality, it means love,
    benevolence, familiarity, intimacy. When we imbue our mind with good will, we escape from
    animosity and hostility. In other words, we should remind ourselves that we're going to
    stay with our friend at all times. We won't go wandering off. We won't leave our friend in
    a lurch. Our friend, here, is the body, because the body and mind have to depend on each
    other at all times. The body has to depend on the mind. The mind has to depend on the
    body. When people are friends they have to love each other, wish each other well, stick
    with each other, be intent on helping each other at all times. They don't abandon each
    other. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So tell yourself that when the body breathes in, you're
    going to stick with the breath. In Pali, the breath is called <i>kaya-sankhara,</i> or
    bodily fabrication, because it's what fixes the body to keep it alive. It's like the cook
    who fixes food in a home so that the people in the family can eat their fill and be happy.
    If there's something wrong with the cook, then there's going to be turmoil and chaos in
    the house. If the cook of the body -- the breath -- gets weird, everyone else in the body
    -- the properties of earth, water, wind, and fire -- will all have to suffer and get
    thrown into a turmoil as well. So we can say that the breath is the property that looks
    after all the properties in the body. For example, we inhale the breath into the lungs.
    There it cleanses the blood in the lungs, which gets sent to the heart. The function of
    the heart is to send the blood out to nourish all the parts of the body, so that the blood
    and the breath energy flow normally. If the breath isn't as good as it should be, the
    lungs won't be as good as they should be. The heart won't be good, the blood it pumps out
    won't be good, so all the various parts of the body will have to suffer as a result. This
    is when the properties of the body are said to be defiled. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If the mind really has good will for the body, then it has
    to look after the breath in the body to keep it functioning properly. So we have to keep
    after our &quot;cook&quot; to make sure that she isn't filthy, lazy, or apathetic.
    Otherwise, she'll put poison in our food to kill us, or filth in our food to make us sick.
    So we have to make sure that our cook is clean and pure in her habits, as when we breathe
    the qualities of the Buddha in with the breath. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The breath accompanied by <i>buddho</i> is called the <i>sukka</i>
    breath, or the clean, clear breath. When the master of the house is clean and circumspect
    like this, the cook will have to be clean and circumspect, too. All the employees in the
    house will have to be clean. In other words, when we're mindful, the breath that goes into
    the body will be a pure breath. When it reaches the heart, it will cleanse the blood in
    the heart so that it's pure as well. When the heart pumps this pure blood, sending it to
    nourish the body, the body will be purified, too. And then the mind will have to feel
    well. In other words, the heart is good, the nourishment in the blood is good. When the
    mind is in good shape like this, the blood won't become abnormal. And when this good blood
    is sent to nourish the nerves throughout the body, the body will have to function well. It
    won't feel tired or aching. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is because we've adjusted our breath well, so that we
    can treat all kinds of diseases and pains. When the purity of the breath spreads
    throughout every blood vessel, the bad things already there in the body will have to
    scatter. Those that haven't yet appeared won't be able to appear. This will help the body
    to be balanced and normal. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the breath is in good shape and the heart is in good
    shape, then the fire property in the body won't be too strong. If the breath isn't right,
    or if it's too hot, then the fire property gets thrown out of balance. When it grows too
    hot, the blood thickens and gets stuck in the capillaries, making us sleepy or giving us a
    headache. If it grows too cold, it gives us the shivers or makes us feverish. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So the breath is more important than any of the other the
    properties in the body. It assists the fire property, which in turn distills the liquid
    property. The liquid property in the body falls into two sorts: the part that hardens and
    turns into earth, and the part that stays liquid by its nature. When the breath functions
    properly, all the other properties function properly, and the body will feel rested and at
    ease. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is called showing good will for yourself. The mind
    sticks with the breath, the breath sticks with the body, the body sticks with the mind.
    They don't abandon one another. They're affectionate, intimate, harmonious -- they're good
    friends. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When people stay together they become intimate and
    familiar with one another. If they don't stay with one another, they can't become familiar
    with one another. And when they're not on familiar terms, they don't really know one
    another. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When people are friends and on familiar terms, they trust
    one another. They tell one another their secrets. They don't hide what's going on. In the
    same way, when we become close friends with the body and on familiar terms, we're going to
    learn all the body's secrets. For instance, we may learn what kamma in the past led to the
    birth of the body the way it is -- what our previous lifetimes were like, what good and
    bad things we did, that led to the body's being like this or that. We'll learn how the
    four properties of the body function. We'll learn how things arise and pass away at the
    properties of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and intellect. We'll get to know the
    secrets of the various affairs connected with the body, because it will have to reveal its
    true nature to us in every way -- just as when we open the cover on a serving dish,
    enabling us to see what's there in the dish. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we come to know how things function in the body this
    way, that's called <i>vijja, </i>or clear knowing. This sort of clear knowing arises from
    the stillness of the mind. When the body and mind are both quiet together, they give
    knowledge to each other. Just as with people: if we're friendly with them, they're bound
    to be friendly with us. If we're antagonistic with them, they're bound to be antagonistic
    with us. In the same way, when the body is friendly with the mind, the mind is bound to be
    friendly with the body. In other words, it can help the various parts of the body. It can
    help make the body act in line with its thoughts. If, for instance, there's a feeling of
    pain or weariness, we can gather the power of the mind at full strength to think of the
    feeling going away, and that feeling of pain or weariness may completely vanish, simply
    through the power of a single mental moment. People who have helped each other in the past
    have to help each other all the time. If we can help them, they're bound to be able to
    help us. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The ability to do this comes from the power of the mind
    that's capable of giving orders in line with its aspirations. When we can make our friend
    good through the power of our thought, then all our friends can become good. For example,
    when we think of purifying the breath, the breath will help improve the fire property. The
    fire property will help improve the liquid property. The liquid property will help improve
    the earth property. When all the properties help one another in this way, they become
    balanced and a help to the body, so that the body can be healthy. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As for the mind, it grows cool and calm. Anyone who comes
    near will pick up some of that calmness as well. Just like a mountain cool in its depths:
    whoever walks past will be cooled as well, even though the mountain didn't make a point of
    splashing water on them to cool them off. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here we've been speaking about the body. As for the mind,
    when it's pure it gives even greater results. When we think using the power of the pure
    mind, the currents go faster than lightning through the sky, and they can go all around
    the world. If anyone wants to come and harm us, they can't get near, because the current
    of a pure, strong mind has the power to ward off all kinds of danger. Take the Buddha as
    an example: No one could kill him. People who thought of killing him, as soon as they got
    near him, saw him as their loving father. Those who were subject to the current of the
    Buddha's purity let go of their evil habits and turned into good people; they let go of
    their violence and viciousness, becoming gentle and mild. Angulimala, for instance: If he
    hadn't been willing to listen to the Buddha, he would have been swallowed up by the earth.
    But he was able to think, &quot;The Buddha won't kill me. I won't kill anyone.&quot; He
    immediately put down his weapons, gave up killing once and for all, ordained, and became
    one of the Buddha's noble disciples. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So in the same way, we should think of the qualities of
    the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha with every in-and-out breath. When we stay within the
    territory of the Dhamma in this way, it's as if we were having an audience with the Buddha
    himself. Even though -- when we keep thinking of the qualities of the Buddha, Dhamma, and
    Sangha -- we keep going over the same old territory over and over again, what's wrong with
    that? Actually, when we use our powers of directed thought <i>(vitakka)</i> and evaluation
    <i>(vicara)</i> back and forth this way, the results we end up with are positive: a sense
    of fullness that spreads throughout every part of the body. The mind will feel full and
    bright. The heart will feel blossoming, established in the sense of fullness, or rapture <i>(piti),</i>
    that comes with thoughts of good will. When the heart is full in this way, it's at ease,
    just as when we've eaten our fill of food. And when the heart is full, its friend the body
    is sure to feel full and rested as well. We'll be at our ease both in body and in mind,
    just as when we see our children and grandchildren well-fed and sleeping soundly. This is
    called pleasure <i>(sukha).</i> And when we see that something gives pleasure to our
    children and grandchildren, we have to focus our efforts on it continually. This is how
    the mind reaches singleness of preoccupation <i>(ekaggatarammana), </i>entering into a
    state of peace, free from every sort of disturbance and danger. </font></p>
