    <td width="100%"><h2 align="center"><font color="#800000" face="Times New Roman">An Image
    of the Buddha</font></h2>
    <h3 align="right"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>August 31, 1958</i></font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">O</font>ur goodness: what can we do to make
    it really good? For today's goodness I want each of us to set our minds on casting a
    Buddha within the mind to protect ourselves, because Buddhas are things that are more
    sacred and numinous that any other object in the world. They can protect us and help us
    survive all sorts of danger and suffering. As we're told in the Pali chant, <i>&quot;Sabba-dukkha
    sabba-bhaya sabba-roga vinassantu,&quot;</i> which means, &quot;All sufferings, all
    dangers, all diseases can be destroyed through the power of the Buddha, Dhamma, and
    Sangha.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Whoever has an inner Buddha is protected from all three
    major fears. The first kind is the fear of suffering, i.e., birth, aging, illness, and
    death. The Buddha isn't afraid of these things at all, for he has warded them off in all
    their forms .... (2) The various kinds of danger, such as danger from criminals: Whoever
    might try to come and steal his valuables, the Buddha isn't the least bit afraid, for his
    valuables aren't the kind that anyone can steal. The danger of fire: Don't mention house
    fires or being bombed by nuclear weapons. Even if the fires of the end of the aeon were to
    burn up the entire world, he wouldn't be startled or fearful. The danger of floods: even
    if water were to flood from the earth up to the sky, he wouldn't be concerned. The danger
    of famine, drought, and pestilence wouldn't make him suffer or put him to any hardship.
    (3) The various diseases that arise in the body don't cause him any fear. Just look at the
    Buddha image in front of you: What dangers is he afraid of? From where? No matter what
    anyone does to him, he just sits there perfectly still, not afraid of anything at all.
    This is why we should cast a Buddha within ourselves so that we can wear it around our
    neck and protect ourselves from fear wherever we go. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, when they cast a Buddha image, what do they do? The
    first thing is to make a mold that's beautiful and well-proportioned. Then they heat it
    until it's hot through and through. Then they pour molten metal into the mold. Then they
    let it cool. When it's thoroughly cooled, they pull off the pieces of the mold, leaving
    only the Buddha image, but even then the image is still rough and unattractive. They have
    to polish it until it gives off clear reflections, or else paint it with lacquer and cover
    it with gold leaf. Only then will they have a finished Buddha image in line with their
    aims. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So now that we're casting a Buddha within ourselves, we
    have to heat our mold before we can pour the metal into it. Pretend that the body here is
    your mold; your mind is the expert craftsman. I want us all to set our minds on casting a
    Buddha within ourselves. Who's going to have the most beautiful Buddha will depend on how
    skillful and capable each craftsman is at smelting. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">How do we heat our mold? We heat the mold by sitting in
    concentration: your right leg on top of the left, your hands placed palm-up in your lap,
    your right hand on top of your left. Sit up straight. Don't lean forward or back, or tilt
    to either side. If the mold is off-center, your Buddha will have to be off-center, too.
    The next step is to fix your mindfulness on the breath, thinking <i>bud-</i> with the
    in-breath and <i>dho</i> with the out. Stay focused exclusively on the breath. You don't
    have to think of anything else -- just as if you were pumping air into your furnace to
    heat up the mold. If your mindfulness doesn't stay with the breath -- if you forget or
    absent-mindedly think of other things -- it's as if your air pump breaks down. The fire
    won't grow strong, and the mold won't get heated through. If the mold isn't heated
    through, then when you pour your molten metal into it, the mold will crack and the metal
    will leak out all over the place. So you have to be careful that your mold doesn't crack,
    and make sure that your air pump doesn't wear out, either. In other words, keep watch over
    your mindfulness so that it isn't absent-minded or forgetful. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now let's talk about how you melt your metal -- the
    bronze, gold, silver, or whatever kind of metal you're going to use to cast your Buddha
    image. When they cast an image, they have to melt the metal and remove all the specks and
    impurities, leaving nothing but the metal in its pure form. Only then do they use it to
    cast the image. In the same way, we have to cut away from the heart all the concepts and
    preoccupations that act as Hindrances. The five Hindrances are like impurities mixed in
    with gold. If we don't melt them away or remove them from the heart, our Buddha image
    won't turn out as perfect and powerful as we'd like it. It'll be blemished and full of
    holes. If you were to put it on an altar, it wouldn't look inspiring. If you were to give
    it away, no one would want to receive it. Therefore it's necessary -- crucial -- that your
    expert craftsman be meticulous, circumspect, and not careless; that he make a concerted
    effort to purify the metal he's using. In other words, you have to brush away all concepts
    of past and future, leaving only the present: the breath. Be aware only of the breath.
    When your mold is thoroughly heated (i.e., you're alert to the whole body), your air pump
    is working well (i.e., mindfulness is steady and strong), and your metal is pure and free
    from specks (i.e., there are no Hindrances in the heart), then the Buddha image you're
    casting will be beautiful to your satisfaction. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Casting a Buddha image within you means sitting in
    concentration, giving rise to peace and calm in the mind. When the mind is at peace, the
    body is at peace. Rapture -- a sense of fullness in body and mind -- will arise within you
    (i.e., when mindfulness fills the body, your awareness fills the body, too). When rapture
    arises in full force, it gives way to pleasure. When there's a lot of pleasure, the mind
    grows clear and bright. The brightness of the mind is the knowledge of liberating insight.
    You come to see the truth of the body, that it's simply the four properties of earth,
    water, fire, and wind -- not yours or anyone else's. It's inconstant. Stressful. This
    gives rise to a sense of weariness and disenchantment, so that you let go of the process
    of mental and physical fabrication, seeing that there's no real substance to it. You can
    separate the body from the mind. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The mind will then be free of its burden in having to haul
    the physical body around. It turns into a mind that's free, light, and at ease. Whichever
    way you look is wide open -- as if you were to remove the floors, walls, and roof of your
    home: if you look down, you see the ground. If you look up, you'll see the stars. Look
    around in all four directions and you'll see that there's nothing to obstruct your line of
    sight. You can see everything clearly. If you look to the west you'll see the noble truth
    of stress. Look south and you'll see the cause of stress. Look east and you'll see the
    cessation of stress. Look north and you'll see the path. If you can see in this way you're
    said to be a full dollar, i.e., worth four full quarters. And if you get four full
    quarters many times over, you'll grow more and more valuable all the time. You'll turn
    into a rich person with lots of wealth -- i.e., noble treasures. You'll be released from
    poverty. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Whoever has noble treasures is said to be a noble person.
    Noble people are those who have seen the four noble truths. Whoever sees the four noble
    truths is said to see the Buddha within. The Buddha likes to stay with people of that sort
    -- and when the Buddha is staying with us, we'll be blessed and won't fall into hardship.
    We'll simply keep heading higher and higher. This is why we should all cast a Buddha
    within ourselves by practicing concentration whenever we have the opportunity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another way of casting a Buddha within ourselves is to
    meditate constantly on the foulness of the body, as when we chant: <i>Ayam kho me kayo:</i>
    this body of mine. <i>Uddham padatala:</i> from the tip of our big toe up to the head --
    what is it like? <i>Addho kesamatthaka:</i> from the crown of the head down to the big
    toe, what is it like? <i>Tacapariyanto:</i> inside this burlap bag, what valuables do we
    have? The skin covering the body is like a burlap bag full of all kinds of things, so
    let's see what fantastic valuables we have here in this bag. Starting with the ribs,
    heart, liver, lungs, intestines, food in the stomach and intestines, blood, gall, lymph,
    urine. What kind of lovely valuables are these things? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you look carefully at your body, you'll see that what
    you have here is the four states of deprivation, nothing wonderful at all. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first state of deprivation is the animal kingdom: all
    the worms and germs that live in our stomach and intestines, in our blood vessels, and in
    our pores. As long as there's food for these things to eat in there, they're always going
    to be with us, multiplying like crazy, making us ill. On the outside of the body there are
    fleas and lice. They like staying with those who don't keep themselves clean, making their
    skin red and sore. As for the animals living in the blood vessels and pores, they give us
    rashes and infections. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second state of deprivation is the kingdom of hungry
    ghosts, i.e., the properties of earth, water, fire, and wind in the body. First they feel
    too cold, then too warm, then they feel ill, then they want to eat this or that. We have
    to keep pandering to them, running around to find things for them to eat with never any
    chance to stop and rest. And they never have enough -- like the hungry ghosts who starve
    after they die, with no one to feed them. These properties keep pestering us, and no
    matter what you do, you can never please them. First the food is too hot, so you have to
    put ice in it. Then it's too cold, so you have to put it back on the stove. All of this
    comes down to an imbalance in the properties, sometimes good, sometimes bad, never coming
    to a stable state of normalcy at all, making us suffer in various ways. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third state of deprivation is the land of angry
    demons. Sometimes, when we get ill or lose our senses, we run around naked without a
    stitch of clothing, as if we were possessed by angry demons. Some people have to undergo
    operations, getting this removed or cutting out that or sucking out this, waving their
    arms and moaning in a way that's really pitiful. Some people get so poor that they have
    nothing to eat; they get so thin that they have nothing left but ribs and eyeballs,
    suffering like the angry demons who can't see the brightness of the world. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fourth state of deprivation is purgatory. Purgatory is
    the home of all the spirits with a lot of bad karma who have to suffer being roasted,
    speared with red-hot iron spikes, and pierced with thorns. All the animals whose flesh
    we've eaten, after they've been killed and cooked, gather together in our stomach and then
    disappear into our body in huge numbers. If you were to count them, you'd have whole coops
    of chickens, herds of cattle, and half a sea's worth of fish. Our stomach is such a tiny
    thing, and yet no matter how much you eat you can never keep it full. And you have to feed
    it hot things, too, like the denizens of purgatory who have to live with fire and flame.
    If there's no fire, they can't live. So there's a big copper frying pan for them. All the
    various spirits we've eaten gather in the big copper frying pan of our stomach, where
    they're consumed by the fires of digestion, and then they haunt us: Their powers penetrate
    throughout our flesh and blood, giving rise to passion, aversion, and delusion, making us
    squirm as if we were burned by the fires of purgatory, too. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So look at the body. Is it really yours? Where did it come
    from? Whose is it? No matter how much you care for it, it's not going to stay with you.
    It'll have to go back to where it came from: the properties of earth, water, fire, and
    wind. The fact that it's able to stay for a while depends entirely on the breath. When
    there's no more breath to it, it starts to decay, and no one wants it then. You won't be
    able to take it with you when you go. There's no one who can take his arms, legs, feet, or
    hands along with him. This is why we say that the body is not-self. It belongs to the
    world. As for the mind, it's the one that does good and evil, and will be reborn in line
    with its karma. The mind is what doesn't die. It's the one that experiences all pleasure
    and pain. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So when you realize this, you should do as much good as
    you can for your own sake. The Buddha felt compassion for us and taught us in this way,
    but we don't feel much compassion for ourselves. We prefer to fill ourselves with
    suffering. When other people teach us, it's no match for our teaching ourselves, for other
    people will teach us only once in a while. The possibility of being a common animal, a
    human being, a heavenly being, or of entering nibbana all lie within us, so we have to
    choose which one we want. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The good you do is what will go with you in the future.
    This is why the Buddha taught us to meditate, to contemplate the body to give rise to
    dispassion. It's inconstant, stressful, and nothing of ours. You borrow it for a while and
    then have to return it. The body doesn't belong to the mind, and the mind doesn't belong
    to the body. They're separate things that depend on each other. When you can see this, you
    have no more worries or attachments. You can let go of the body, and three hunks of rust
    -- self-identity views, attachments to precepts and practices, and uncertainty in the Path
    -- will fall away from your heart. You'll see that all good and evil come from the heart.
    If the heart is pure, that's the highest good in the world. </font></p>
