    <h3 align="right"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>May 26, 1958</i></font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>hose of us who are training our
    hearts and minds in hopes of the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana, if we don't study
    to understand the fundamental principles of the world, are likely to wander off the path.
    Or else we'll keeping circling around without ever reaching our goal. So if we really want
    to put an end to suffering, we should ask ourselves: what do we have within us that can
    act as a true refuge for ourselves? This is the sort of question we should keep reflecting
    on all the time. As we chant every day: <i>&quot;Svakkhato bhagavata dhammo, sanditthiko
    akaliko</i> -- The Dhamma well-expounded by the Blessed One, to be seen here &amp; now, is
    timeless.&quot; In other words, if we want to reach it, we'll be able to reach it. If we
    don't want to reach it, we won't. But whether or not we'll reach it depends on underlying
    causes, which come in two sorts: an enduring principle and supporting principles. The
    enduring principle, called <i>dhamma-thiti,</i> is what stays unmoving by its nature. The
    supporting principles are our training and education, which can be either good or bad.
    This is why our practice sways back and forth, like a tree in the middle of an open field,
    swaying back and forth in the wind. If we don't discover the enduring principle within us,
    we won't be able to find anything to act as a true refuge -- for our training and
    education are simply supporting factors. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is why we should keep asking ourselves: &quot;Have we
    found any principle within ourselves that can act as our refuge?&quot; As long as we're
    still depending on other people, other things, we don't have a true refuge. Our training
    and education are nothing more than supporting factors -- like the fertilizer we give to
    plants. When the fertilizer runs out, the plant will have to fall to the ground and
    decompose. The same holds true for the Buddha: when his body ran out of strength, it
    turned into the four elements. The Dhamma, when it no longer has any power, turns into
    nothing but letters on paper or palm leaves, which then disintegrate. As for the Sangha,
    when they run out of strength, they die. So the refuge we take in these things is nothing
    more than a snack or finger food, but people for the most part misunderstand them to be
    our true refuge. They think that the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha will carry or drag them to
    heaven or nibbana. From one angle this is right, but from another it's wrong. It's right
    in the sense that the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha keep alive the tradition of goodness that
    we can hold onto and follow. It's wrong, though, in the sense that they aren't the things
    that will make us reach the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana. Reaching nibbana
    depends on our own actions: our practice. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So we have to ask ourselves: &quot;What do we want in
    life?&quot; If we really want something, we're sure to succeed at it in every way. But the
    fact that we don't succeed comes from ourselves. If we want to be millionaires, we'll have
    to become millionaires. If we want to be beggars, we'll have to become beggars. Success
    and lack of success come from within ourselves -- in other words, from the causal factors
    lying within the limits of our own goodness. If we practice correctly, we're sure to
    succeed. It all depends on the enduring principles in the world, together with the
    supporting factors that point us in the right direction. The supporting factors are the
    teachings formulated by wise people and sages. The enduring principles -- <i>dhamma-thiti</i>
    -- come from the principles of nature. To reach the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana
    requires dhamma-thiti. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Take our Buddha or the Private Buddhas as an example: when
    they were born, there was no Buddha to teach them. But they had met up with sages and
    Buddhas in previous lives, so they were born with character traits that spurred them on to
    be high-minded, to see the drawbacks of the world so crowded with defilement and craving,
    with birth, aging, illness, and death. Disenchanted, they aspired to gain release from all
    this suffering -- for as long as we human beings are subject to birth and death, then even
    if we had wings to fly, we still wouldn't escape from our suffering. But if we're free
    from birth and death, then even if we have to crawl on all fours in the dirt, we won't
    feel any suffering. This is why the Buddha left the householder life and went off into the
    wilderness to be alone, developing virtue, concentration, and discernment until he
    attained full Buddhahood. Once he had attained his goal, he had another character trait --
    his great compassion -- that inspired him to teach the Dhamma to his relatives and to
    living beings in general so that they could gain release from suffering as well. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Practicing virtue is called compassion in terms of one's
    actions. This is followed by compassion in terms of one's speech and thoughts. When the
    Buddha expressed this sort of compassion, people responded to him in kind: they loved him,
    respected him, and were willing to grant him power. The Buddha's compassion expressed
    itself in two ways: for the well being of the world <i>(lokattha-cariya)</i> and the well
    being of his relatives <i>(natattha-cariya).</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In terms of the world, the Buddha spread his good will and
    compassion to beings all over the world, without showing any partiality for any group or
    individual at all. As for the well being of his relatives, like everyone else he had
    parents, grandparents, and siblings, and these people in turn had children, grandchildren,
    and in-laws. The Buddha's compassion spread out along all of these connections, expressed
    in terms of compassionate actions, compassionate words, and compassionate thoughts. This
    compassion spread out from a heart that had found its own dependable refuge within. This
    was why he was able to spread his compassion so that others could depend on him as well.
    It's the nature of the heart that when it can depend on itself, its goodness gradually
    spreads out of its own accord. If there's any kind of connection -- whether people are
    relatives or not -- it spreads out along those connections. It spreads out in terms of
    words, when you can teach and instruct others. In terms of thoughts, there's no anger,
    hatred, or jealousy. There's simply the willingness to sacrifice for others. When there
    were ways the Buddha could help others with his thoughts, he spread those thoughts at all
    times. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He had seen that the lay life wasn't convenient for
    spreading goodness so far and wide, which was why he became a monk. He had seen that being
    a member of the noble warrior class involved both good and evil, for it's the nature of
    the world that people are proud of their birth, their race, their class, which divides us
    into factions and creates inequalities. When divisions like this arise in the world, it's
    difficult to spread goodness. That was why he left his relatives, cutting himself off from
    his class and race. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And this is why, when a new monk is being ordained, the
    announcing teacher asks him, &quot;Have your mother and father given their
    permission?&quot; and the candidate answers, &quot;Yes.&quot; He has left the limitations
    of the worldly life and now doesn't belong to any family at all. Then, once he's ordained,
    he's taught not to go hanging around with his old family. So when the Buddha left home, he
    went off on his own to find the truth of the Dhamma. Regardless of whether he was to get
    teachings from others, he explored within himself without depending on his old wealth or
    family connections. He gave himself totally to the practice. At first he had studied with
    the Six Teachers, but they were unable to convince him of their teachings. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first teacher was Teacher Eye. This teacher fools us
    in all sorts of ways. It tells us that this sight is beautiful, that sight is ugly, this
    sight is good, that sight is bad. It whispers to the heart, causing us to trip and fall,
    because we don't see things in terms of their basic principles -- that all sights are the
    same. Whether they're birds, rats, people, animals, trees, wines, whatever, they differ
    only in terms of their features. Their basic condition is the same: they arise, decay, and
    then disappear in line with the principles of nature. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second teacher was Teacher Ear. At first there are two
    of these teachers, but then they turn into four, which gets things even more confusing. In
    other words, the left ear hears good sounds and bad sounds, the right ear hears good
    sounds and bad sounds, all of which gives rise to distorted perceptions. We imagine good
    things to be bad, and bad things to be good; true things to be false, and false things to
    be true. So Teacher Ear is another teacher who fools us. The Buddha thus left both Teacher
    Eye and Teacher Ear to study with: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Teacher Nose. At first this teacher has two nostrils, but
    then they split into four. Sometimes it likes good smells, sometimes it doesn't like good
    smells and likes bad smells instead. Then it goes whispering to the heart to make it
    misunderstand things. If we could take a photo of the mind, we'd see that the eyes are big
    and bulging, the ears are set out like huge sails, while the nose is wide, wide open. When
    the Buddha saw that he had no use for these three teachers, he went on to study with: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Teacher Tongue. This teacher -- the mouth -- is even more
    of a turmoil. If it were part of the army, it'd be called a multi-task force. On the one
    hand, it eats food; on the other, it says all kinds of things. Sometimes it likes to say
    good things, sometimes bad things. Sometimes it doesn't like to say good things, and
    prefers to say bad things instead. One little tongue, but it too splits into four. When
    it's not speaking, it eats. Sometimes that person gets to eat, this person doesn't get to
    eat. This person has only a little to eat, that person starves, while that person over
    there has more than enough to eat. The dangers that come from these affairs block the
    paths and fruitions leading to nibbana. So the Buddha moved on to study with the fifth
    teacher: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Teacher Body. This teacher is made up of the six elements,
    but as soon as the elements get unbalanced it gets feverish or chilled, weak or stiff. As
    it meets up with friction, it wears out. As for the sixth teacher, that's: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Teacher Mind. This teacher thinks and worries, deluding
    itself in all sorts of ways. Suppose, for instance, that we're leaving the house to come
    to the monastery. As soon as we've left the door it starts deceiving us: &quot;What a
    pain. It's so far to walk. A waste of time. The sun is hot.&quot; When we get to the
    monastery and start sitting in meditation, it starts deceiving us again: &quot;We've been
    sitting too long. I'm tired. My legs hurt. They're numb. My back is stiff.&quot; Then it
    squeezes our legs, squeezes our arms, beats our back, pokes our stomach, giving us
    heartburn or a stomachache. When we're whipped and beaten like this, we eventually give
    in. Sometimes it comes whispering, &quot;Why don't you stop? Time's almost up. Open your
    eyes.&quot; So we leave meditation, raise our hands in respect, and bow down to the
    Buddha. And that's it. If we're weak by nature, we fall for it. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is why the Buddha left all of these six teachers,
    closed his eyes, closed his ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind, not letting his heart go
    running after sights, sounds, smells, tastes, tactile sensations, or ideas. He closed off
    his senses to escape from these things, leaving only the door of the mind, which he
    focused on goodness. When this was the case, he didn't concern himself with any of the
    senses. We went to sit cross-legged under the Bodhi tree on the full moon day in May and
    gave rise to discernment within himself. He gathered all his thoughts so that they were
    right, and didn't let them associate with anything outside of the Dhamma. He began
    meditating, cutting off all connection to the past and future, cutting all connection to
    the nerves of the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind. He focused on the breath,
    making it more and more refined, to the point where the condition of the body disappeared,
    leaving just the qualities of the six elements: seeing, for example, how the breath
    actually moves, how it stops. This is called <i>buddha-vijja,</i> the skill of the
    awakened ones. This skill sees things in terms, not of their characteristics, but in terms
    of their basic qualities. Inconstancy is a characteristic. Stress and not-self --
    burdensomeness, what can't be controlled -- are all characteristics. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Basic qualities, though, are neutral and constant.
    Inconstancy is on the level of characteristics. To make an analogy: the mouth can't turn
    into the nose. That's an affair of basic qualities. If things could change like that, we
    wouldn't be able to live. For example, if tonight our ears changed into eyes, or our leg
    became an arm, or our nose became a mouth: if this happened, everything would break out
    into chaos. If we see things only in terms of their characteristics, that's the knowledge
    of the six teachers. Change-of-lineage knowledge, though, sees from both sides, both as
    characteristics and as basic qualities. To make another analogy: our leg, ever since we
    were two, has been a leg. It'll still be a leg when we're 80, in line with it's basic
    quality. This is constancy. Whatever it's been, that's what it'll continue to be until we
    die. Whoever doesn't see through to basic qualities like this will get dragged off by the
    six teachers. This is why the Buddha left the six teachers to study the skill of the
    awakened ones, to see both what it is that changes and what it is that doesn't. Whoever
    sees both sides -- the side of inconstancy and the side of constancy -- without getting
    stuck on either side, that's change-of-lineage knowledge: knowing the principles of the
    world and the basic quality of the Dhamma. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is why the Buddha taught, <i>&quot;Sabbe sankhara
    anicca, sabbe dhamma anatta:</i> All conditioned things are inconstant; all phenomena are
    not-self.&quot; Regardless of whether people might say, &quot;constant&quot; or
    &quot;inconstant,&quot; &quot;stress&quot; or &quot;bliss,&quot; &quot;There is a
    self&quot; or &quot;There is no self,&quot; the Buddha could remain unswayed. This is
    called, <i>&quot;Attahi attano natho&quot;:</i> those who can give rise to this knowledge
    and skill within themselves can truly depend on themselves. They're not attached to
    knowledge of the past, knowledge of the future, knowledge of the present. They're not
    stuck on any dimension of time at all. They can let go of conventions, formulated
    teachings, formulated ultimate truths. They can let go within themselves alone, know
    within themselves alone. This is called truly depending on yourself. When you reach this
    point, your training for the sake of the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana will have
    to succeed in line with your aims. There won't be any wandering astray. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And that's enough for now. </font></p>
