    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he power of the Buddha is more
    tremendous than that of all other beings, human and divine. His body is enormous, in that
    we've been making representations of it from ancient times up to the present and yet still
    haven't finished the job. His mouth is enormously wide. Many are the things that he said
    only once but that other people have repeated without ceasing: here I'm talking about his
    teachings, which members of the Sangha have copied down into texts and delivered as
    sermons for us to hear up to the present. The Buddha's physical mouth was small, but his
    words are amazingly great, which is why we say that his mouth is wide. His eyes are wide
    as well: they've seen the true nature of the entire cosmos. This is the way it is with
    people who are really good: they tend to have this kind of enormous greatness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Big things like this have to come from small things.
    Before the Buddha could become enormous in this way, he first had to make himself small.
    In other words, he cut himself off from his royal family and went alone into the forest to
    sit under the branches of the Bodhi tree on the banks of the Neranjara River. He let his
    in-and-out breathing grow smaller and smaller until it was extremely subtle, and there the
    fire of his defilements and mental fermentations went totally out without trace. He
    awakened to the foremost right self-awakening, becoming a Buddha. His heart, which he had
    let grow so extremely subtle and small, exploded outward in goodness in a way that is
    still blatant to us even today. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So I ask that we all set our minds on really practicing
    concentration. Don't worry about the past or the future or anything else. When the mind is
    firmly set in concentration, knowledge and discernment will arise without our having to
    worry about them. Don't let yourself think that you want to know this or see that. These
    things will come on their own. As the proverb says, &quot;Those with a lot of greed get
    only a little to feed on; those content with only a pinkie's worth will get a whole
    thumb.&quot; Keep bearing this point in mind. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For the mind to range far and wide, wandering after
    outside concepts and preoccupations, saps the strength it needs to deal with its various
    affairs. Whatever it then thinks of doing will succeed only with difficulty. It's like a
    gun with a broad-gauged barrel. If you put tiny bullets into it, they rattle around inside
    and don't come out with much force. The narrower the gauge of the barrel, the more force
    the bullets will have when you shoot them out. It's the same with the breath: The more you
    narrow its focus, the more refined the breath will become, until eventually you can
    breathe through your pores. The mind at this stage has more strength than an atomic bomb. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Intelligent orchard owners get their bananas to help them
    plant their orchard, get their mangoes to help them plant their orchard. They don't have
    to invest a lot of capital. In other words, they clear the land bit by bit, plant it bit
    by bit, harvest bit by bit, sell bit by bit, until the orchard grows larger and larger all
    the time. This way they don't need to invest much in terms of labor or capital, but the
    results they get are large and lasting. As for stupid people, when they start an orchard,
    no matter how large, they pour all their money into it, hiring people to clear the land,
    plow it, and plant it all at once. If they run into a drought for three days or seven days
    running, their plants all wither and die. Grass and weeds spring up and overrun the place.
    At that point, there's nothing the owners can do, because the orchard is way too big for
    them. They don't have the money to hire the workers again, because they used up all their
    funds right at the beginning. All they can do is sit with their arms around their knees,
    blinking back the tears. They've lost all their capital and have no profits to show.
    That's the way it is with people who are greedy. As for those who keep at their work
    steadily, bit by bit, the results keep growing bigger and bigger all the time. </font></p>
