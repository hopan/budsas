    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">W</font>hen meditators &quot;get into
    position,&quot; exactly what are they doing? &quot;Getting into position&quot; means
    making the mind stay in place, making it stay with the body, not letting it go stay with
    other people or think about anything else at all. If the mind stays outside of the body,
    it's like a battery without any current. You can't get any use out of it. You can't use it
    to produce heat or give off light. So this is why we're taught to keep the mind inside. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When trees are withered and dry, it's because they don't
    have any water to nourish them. The same holds true with us. If the mind doesn't stay
    inside the body, the body won't flourish. It'll have to wither and wear out, grow ill in
    one way or another, and eventually die because of this disease or that. So the mind is
    like water that permeates the body to give it nourishment. If the mind focuses its
    attention outside of the body, then the body won't be able to gain any sense of freshness,
    fullness, or ease. This is because the mind is the most important factor influencing the
    body. It's our most valuable resource. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, when the mind is a valuable resource in this way, we
    should learn how to look after it. We have to hand it over to someone we can trust. In
    other words, we entrust it to somebody venerable. But the word venerable here doesn't mean
    the external venerables, like monks, because not all monks are trustworthy. Some of them
    are good monks, some of them aren't. If we let them cheat us out of our valuables, we end
    up even worse off than before. No, venerable here means internal venerables: the venerable
    qualities of the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha within the mind. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we meditate, we're handing our minds over to these
    venerable qualities. They're qualities that are kind and considerate. They won't abuse us
    or cause anyone any harm. This is why we can wholeheartedly entrust our valuables -- our
    mind -- to them. For example, when we meditate <i>buddho, buddho, </i>we have to be
    sincere to these qualities. We really have to think about them. We don't just think about
    them in jest. &quot;Thinking in jest&quot; means that we think without really being
    intent. We have to be really intent on keeping <i>buddho</i> with the mind, and the mind
    with <i>buddho</i> each and every time we breathe in and out. This is what it means to be
    sincere in our thinking. It's the kind of thinking that serves a purpose. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The purpose here is to develop something of real and
    abundant essence within ourselves -- to create results that will be lasting. Things that
    don't serve any real purpose are those giving results that don't last. When we talk about
    lasting results: for example, when you sit here and meditate, you'll find that the results
    will continue appearing even after you die. But if you aren't really meditating, if you
    let your mind think about other things, you'll find that the results will vanish at death,
    because the things you think about aren't certain or sure. They're not lasting. They'll
    have to change, deteriorate, and end up disappearing and dying in the same way that you
    will. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we make ourselves quiet and still -- when we put the
    mind into concentration -- it's as if we're charging our battery. Once our battery is
    charged, we can put it to use whenever we want. When our battery is fully charged -- full
    of discernment -- we can use it for any sort of purpose at all. We can hook it up to a
    wire and use it to cook our food or light our home. If we simply charge it, without
    connecting it up to anything, the current will stay there, cool in the battery, without
    causing danger of any sort, like the current in a flashlight cell. If a battery is just
    sitting there, we can touch it with our hands and see that it feels cool, not the least
    bit hot -- and yet there's still the fire of electricity in there. If we need light or
    want to cook our food, all we have to do is hook up a wire and turn on the switch, and the
    electricity will come out of the battery to achieve whatever aims we have in mind. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Our &quot;battery&quot; is the mind in concentration. If
    we hook up the wire of ardency to roast our defilements, the power of our current, or
    discernment, will burn them to ashes. As when we cook food to get rid of its rawness: the
    food will be saved from going spoiled and will benefit the body. In the same way, people
    who have discernment within themselves can eliminate all the defilements that present a
    danger and cause suffering to the body and mind. This is why we're taught to develop
    concentration: so as to accumulate the discernment that will benefit us both in this
    present lifetime and on into the next. </font></p>
