    <h3 align="right"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>May 18, 1958</i></font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">F</font>or people to be happy or sad, good
    or bad, all depends on the heart. The heart is what's in charge, the most important thing
    to be found in our body. That's because it's lasting and responsible for all the good and
    evil we do. As for the body, it knows nothing of pleasure or pain, happiness or sadness,
    and it's not at all responsible for anyone's good or evil actions. Why is that? Because
    the body isn't lasting. It's empty. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To say that it's empty means that as soon as it's deprived
    of breath, its four properties of earth, water, wind, and fire separate from one another
    and return to their original nature. The parts coming from the earth property return to be
    earth as they originally were. The parts coming from the water property return to be water
    as they originally were. The parts coming from the wind and fire properties return to be
    wind and fire as they originally were. There's nothing about them that's &quot;woman&quot;
    or &quot;man,&quot; &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad.&quot; This is why we're taught, <i>rupam
    aniccam,</i> physical form is inconstant. <i>Rupam dukkham,</i> it's hard to bear. <i>Rupam
    anatta,</i> it's not-self, empty, and doesn't stay under anyone's control. Even if we try
    to forbid it from growing old, growing sick, and dying, it won't behave in line with our
    wishes. It has to fall in line with the processes of arising and wasting away in
    accordance with the nature of natural fabrications. This applies to everyone. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But you can't say that the body is entirely <i>anatta,</i>
    for some parts of it are <i>atta.</i> In other words, they lie somewhat under our control.
    For instance, if you want the body to walk, it'll walk. If you want it to lie down, it'll
    lie down. If you want it to eat, it'll eat. If you want it to take a bath, it'll take a
    bath. This shows that it lies somewhat under your control. So the body is both <i>anatta</i>
    and <i>atta.</i> But even so, both aspects are equal in the sense that they're empty and
    not responsible for the good or evil things we do. No matter how much good or evil you do,
    the body doesn't have any part in the rewards. When it dies, it gets cremated and turns
    into ashes either way. It's not responsible for anyone's happiness or sadness at all. When
    people do good or evil, the results of their good and evil all fall to their own minds.
    The mind is what's responsible for all our actions, and it's the one that experiences the
    results of its actions as well. This is why the Buddha taught us to cleanse our hearts and
    minds, to make them pure as a way of leading us to future happiness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What do we use to cleanse the heart and mind? We cleanse
    the heart and mind with skillfulness -- in other words by developing skillful qualities
    within it through practicing concentration. We cut away all the thoughts of greed, anger,
    and delusion within the mind, such as the Hindrances of sensual desire, ill will, torpor
    &amp; lethargy, restlessness &amp; anxiety, and doubt. All of these qualities are things
    that soil the mind. When the mind is soiled in this way, it's bound to suffer. It's headed
    for darkness because of its own actions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Our unskillful actions can be divided into the different
    ways they're dark. Some are dark like the darkness of night, i.e., totally devoid of any
    brightness. Some are dark like clouds, i.e., they alternate between being dark and bright,
    just as when the moon is bright at some times and covered by clouds at others. Some of our
    unskillfulness is dark like haze, obscuring all our vision whether by day or by night.
    This third kind of unskillfulness is ignorance, or <i>avijja.</i> It obscures the mind at
    all times so that we can't recognize which of the mind's objects are past, which are
    future, and which are present. This is why the mind concerns itself with past, present,
    and future so that it can't stay firmly in any one place. It has no certainty about
    anything. This is ignorance. From ignorance comes craving, the cause of all stress and
    suffering. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To get rid of this haze we have to meditate, getting rid
    of thoughts and concepts of past and future by seeing them as inconstant, stressful, and
    not-self; seeing all the aggregates of form, feeling, perception, thought-fabrication, and
    consciousness as inconstant, stressful, and not-self, to the point where there is no past,
    no future, no present. That's when the mind is released from the clouds and haze of its
    Hindrances and enters into brightness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are two kinds of people in the world. Some are like
    those with good eyes. They're the ones who develop skillful qualities within themselves,
    and so they see the brightness of the world both by day and by night. Then there are those
    who don't develop skillful mental qualities. They're like people born blind: even though
    the light of the sun and moon may be shining, these people are in the darkness -- in this
    case, the darkness of their own minds. This is why the Buddha taught us to remove the
    darkness from our minds, to remove our minds from darkness, as in the Pali verse, </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">Kanham dhammam vippahaya &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sukkam
      bhavetha pandito, </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">which means, &quot;Having abandoned dark qualities, the
    wise person develops the bright.&quot; When people develop brightness within themselves,
    they can use that brightness to illuminate all their activities. This will bring them
    success in all they do. But if they're in the dark, it's as if they were blind, so that
    the things they do won't succeed in full measure. For example, they may listen to the
    Dhamma, but if their minds are still wandering out all over the place, it's as if they
    were obscured by the clouds and haze of their Hindrances. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is why we're taught to practice tranquility
    meditation, fixing the mind on a single preoccupation. Tell yourself that the qualities of
    the Buddha aren't separate from the qualities of the Dhamma, which aren't separate from
    the qualities of the Sangha. They're actually one and the same, as the Pali verse tells
    us: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddho dhammo sangho cati &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      nanahontampi vatthuto</i><br>
      <i>Annamannaviyoga va &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ekibhutamapanatthato</i> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Although the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha may be
      different as objects, seemingly separate from one another, they are actually one in
      meaning.&quot; </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus when we make the mind firm in its awakened awareness,
    it contains the qualities of the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha all in one. That's when our
    concentration will develop in the proper way. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So I ask that you abandon unskillful mental qualities and
    cleanse the mind so that it's clean and pure. Brightness will then arise within your
    heart. This way you'll experience ease and happiness without a doubt, as the Pali passage
    guarantees: <i>Citte sankilitthe duggati patikankha. Citte asankilitthe sugati patikankha.
    </i>&quot;When the mind is defiled, a bad destination can be expected. When the mind is
    undefiled, a happy destination can be expected.&quot; </font></p>
