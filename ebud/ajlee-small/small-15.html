    <h3 align="right"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>August 20, 1956</i></font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">W</font>hen you meditate, you have to be
    mindful of three things at once. In other words, as you breathe in and out, three things
    -- (1) the breath, (2) the meditation word, and (3) the mind -- have to stay together with
    every moment. At the same time, alertness always has to be in charge. Only then can you
    say that you're established in the factors of meditation lying at the essence of what's
    meritorious and skillful. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Mindfulness&quot; -- heedfulness -- counts as what's
    meritorious here. Forgetfulness -- heedlessness -- counts as evil. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Alertness is what surveys the results of our activities --
    seeing what we do that gives good results, what we do that gives bad -- and then makes
    adjustments. For example, if the breath isn't yet comfortable, we move the mind to a new
    spot or change the way we're breathing. It's like changing the place where we sit. If
    where we're sitting isn't comfortable, we have to get up and find a new place to sit down.
    Once we've found a comfortable place to sit, we have to keep it going as long as we can.
    We don't have to change seats any more. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When mindfulness stays with the breath, it's called<i>
    anapanasati. </i>When it's immersed in the body, it's called <i>kayagatasati.</i> When
    mindfulness stays with the body and mind at all times, it's called developing our
    meditation theme <i>(kammatthana)</i> -- as when we sit here meditating: we're doing our
    work, i.e., our work on our meditation theme. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mindfulness is the cause. If we focus our attention on
    working with the mind, we'll get lots of results on the level of the mind. If we focus on
    working with the body, we'll get lots of results on the level of the body. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The results that come from developing our meditation theme
    are (1) we calm down the evil qualities of the mind; and (2) we calm down the physical
    properties of the body. The mind will be wide open and free, like the ocean when it's free
    of waves: the wind is still, the water smooth, and the air is clear. When this is the
    case, we can see all kinds of far distant things. This way we get to know the affairs of
    the body. On the lowest level, we come to know the body in the present: we understand
    what's going on with the properties of earth, water, fire, and wind, both in their
    important parts and in their unimportant parts. The important parts are the ones that stay
    in the body; the unimportant parts are the ones that come and go, forming a bridge between
    the properties inside the body and those outside. In terms of the wind property, we'll see
    how many types of breath energy stay in the body, and how many types of breath come in and
    out. We'll see which parts of the earth, water, fire, and space properties stay in the
    body, and which parts come and go. The same holds true with the property of consciousness.
    For instance, when our eyes don't see clearly, what's wrong with the property of
    eye-consciousness? We'll be able to see all the ways in which it changes, as well as all
    the changes in the properties of ear-, nose-, tongue-, body-, and intellect-consciousness.
    We'll have mindfulness and alertness constantly in charge. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mindfulness and alertness are like binoculars for seeing
    great distances. The mind is like the binoculars' owner. If the properties in the body
    aren't at normalcy, if they aren't smooth and calm, then no matter how fantastic our
    binoculars, we won't be able to see anything. For example, when the Buddha surveyed the
    beings of the world, he'd wait until the world was quiet and still -- the last watch of
    the night before dawn, when the minds of human beings were quiet, still, and asleep.
    That's when he'd use his special binoculars to survey all that was going on in the world. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the mind is calm it's like an ocean that's calm: the
    wind is still, the boat isn't rocking, the water is clear, and the air wide open. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As we keep training the mind, it keeps getting more and
    more mature, more tempered and sharp, able to cut right through anything at all. Like a
    knife that we always keep sharpening: there's no way it <i>can't</i> become sharp. So we
    should keep at the practice in the same way we sharpen a knife. If any part of the body or
    mind isn't in good shape, we keep adjusting it until we get good results. When good
    results arise, we'll be in a state of Right Concentration. The mind will be firmly
    established in the present, in a state of singleness of preoccupation. We'll gain power
    both in body and in mind. Power in body means that wherever there are pains, we can adjust
    the properties of earth, water, fire, and wind to give rise to a sense of comfort, in the
    same way we trim a tree. If any branches are broken or rotten, we cut them away and graft
    on new branches. If the new ones break, we graft on more new ones. We keep doing this
    until the tree is healthy and strong. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we work at the mind in this way, the four bases for
    success arise in full strength. And as the Buddha said, whoever develops the bases for
    success will live long. In other words, </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">chanda:</i> we're content with our work; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>viriya:</i> we stick with our work and don't get
      discouraged or give up; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>citta:</i> we focus our full attention on nothing but
      our work; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>vimansa:</i> we're circumspect in the mind, circumspect
      in the causes and results of what we're doing. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All four of these qualities are bases or steps to the
    Path. They're the cause for developing power in body and power in mind, all the way to the
    knowledge of the ending of mental fermentations and on into nibbana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What I've said so far is meant to give us all a sense of
    how to develop mindfulness and alertness as our own special binoculars for surveying
    events in terms of the world and of the Dhamma. So you should train your mind to stay firm
    and upright in the factors of our meditation, riding herd on it so that it will stay with
    the body in the present. Regardless of how much you can remember of what I've said, you
    should set your mind on practicing at all times. Don't abandon the practice, or do it in
    fits and starts, for that will prevent you from reaching any kind of success. Think of
    yourself as a supervisor, constantly keeping an eye on the body and mind. When you do
    this, your workers -- the properties of earth, water, fire, and wind -- won't dare shirk
    their jobs or be slack in their work. Each will have to fulfil its responsibilities to the
    full. In this way, you'll come to succeed in your work in every way. At the same time,
    once you've developed your special binoculars, your eyesight will go further than that of
    ordinary people. In this way, you'll be able to keep yourself protected on all sides.
    You'll escape from dangers and meet with happiness and fulfillment in every way. </font></p>
