    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">R</font>estraint of the senses means making
    sure they're in harmony with their objects. In other words: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Cakkhu-samvaro:</i> Exercise restraint over the eyes.
    Don't let your eyes be bigger than their visual objects, and don't let the visual objects
    be bigger than your eyes. An example of small eyes and big objects is when you see
    something and the heart latches onto it for days on end. This is called not being
    straightforward in your practice, because you've let the visual object get bigger than
    your eyes. As for big eyes and small objects, that's when you can't see enough of an
    object. When it disappears, you want to see it again and again. You can't let go of it.
    This is called eyes bigger than their objects. This is what gives rise to greed. When
    objects are bigger than your eyes, that also gives rise to greed and delusion. Anyone who
    doesn't know how to exercise restraint over the eyes gives rise to the three fires of
    passion, aversion, and delusion, which burn the eyes and give rise to suffering. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Sota-samvaro:</i> Exercise restraint over your ears and
    their sounds so that they're the right size for each other. Sometimes your ears are bigger
    than the sounds they hear, sometimes the sounds are bigger than the ears. For example,
    someone says something and you take it to think about for many days. That's a case of the
    sound being bigger than the ears. This gives rise to liking or disliking. The fires of
    passion, aversion, and delusion burn the ears of people like this, for they haven't
    watched out for evil, and so evil can come flowing into their hearts. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Ghana-samvaro:</i> Exercise restraint over the nose and
    smells. If a smell smells good, don't fall for it. If it smells bad and you can't stand
    it, get away from it. Don't hate it. If you contemplate the nose and its smells, you'll
    see that sometimes a smell is bigger than the nose, i.e., one whiff and it gets stuck in
    the heart for many days, months, and years. The smell may have been over and gone for many
    days, months, and years, but the nose hasn't gotten over it. Passion and aversion get
    provoked, and then delusion goes running after the smell. This is called not exercising
    restraint over the nose. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Jivha-samvaro</i> means restraint over the tongue and
    flavors. If the food you get is edible, don't go struggling to look for things to make it
    more special than it already is. If you like it, eat your fill. If you don't like it, eat
    just a little. Choose foods that benefit the body. Otherwise, you'll suffer. Don't follow
    your taste buds. Sometimes the flavors are bigger than the tongue. You sit thinking about
    eating chicken or duck, pork or fish, and so you go looking for them. When you get them,
    your tongue shrivels up and you can hardly eat them at all. This is called not having a
    sense of enough, not exercising restraint. In addition to eating, the tongue plays a role
    in speaking. Sometimes the tongue grows large: what you say goes way beyond the truth. You
    speak without stopping and it's all nonsense. Other times, the topic is big but the tongue
    grows small: there's a lot to be explained, but you hem and haw so that no one can
    understand the truth. This is called not exercising restraint so that the tongue is the
    same size as its topics, and it's one way of bringing on suffering. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Kaya-samvaro</i> means restraint over the body and
    tactile sensations. Sometimes they feel comfortable together, sometimes they don't. In
    other words, the place where you're staying may be big, but the body is small. Sometimes
    the place is small, but the body feels big. They don't go together. The tactile sensations
    that touch the body don't fit. Sometimes the body is small but the sensations are big. For
    example, you come across a sensation you like. Then, even when it's vanished for many
    days, you still miss it. Sometimes the body is big but the sensations are small. For
    example, you don't feel comfortable wherever you sit or lie down, for the whole world
    seems narrow and confining. That's called not exercising restraint to keep the body and
    its tactile sensations in line with each other. And that gives rise to suffering. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Mano-samvaro:</i> Exercise restraint over the heart to
    keep it on the right path in line with things as they arise. Sometimes your thoughts are
    bigger than the mind: you worry and stew about something, going way beyond the truth of
    the situation. This leads to misunderstandings, making the mind restless and anxious.
    Sometimes the mind is bigger than your thoughts: you take a minor problem and turn it into
    four or five big ones. In other words, you don't exercise restraint over the heart to keep
    it in line with your situation -- what they call &quot;harvesting grass to roof the
    field.&quot; This leads to useless distraction, which opens the way for greed, anger, and
    delusion. This is why we're taught to exercise careful restraint over the heart to bring
    it to peace and calm. That's what's meant by restraint of the senses. </font></p>
