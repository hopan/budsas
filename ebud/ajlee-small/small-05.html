    Principles </font></h2>
    <h3 align="right"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>July 6, 1956</i></font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">I</font>n brief, there are three principles
    that are really basic to meditation: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>1) The right intention:</i> You have to make up your
    mind that you're going to let go of all thoughts and preoccupations dealing with the
    world. You aren't going to keep them to think about. Every thought and concept dealing
    with the past or future is an affair of the world, and not of the Dhamma. Make up your
    mind that you're going to do one thing right now: the work of the religion, and nothing
    else. In other words, you're going to work on the immediate present. This is called the
    right intention. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>2) The right object:</i> This means the right theme or
    focal point for the mind. The theme here is <i>dhatuvavatthana,</i> or resolution into the
    properties, one of the themes in taking the body as a frame of reference <i>(kayanupassana-satipatthana).</i>
    In short, we're going to look at the four properties that make up the body: the properties
    of earth, water, wind, and fire. The earth property covers the hard parts of the body,
    such as the bones. The water property covers the liquid parts, such as urine, saliva,
    blood, and pus. The fire property covers the heat and warmth in the body. The wind
    property covers the feelings of energy that flow in the body, such as the breath. Of all
    these properties, the most important one is the wind property, or the breath. If other
    parts of the body get damaged -- say, if our eyes go blind, our ears go deaf, our arms and
    legs get broken -- it can still survive. But if it doesn't have any breath, it can't last.
    It'll have to die. So the breath is an important object because it forms a basis for our
    awareness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>3) The right quality: </i>This means the feelings of
    comfort or discomfort that arise in the body. When you take care of the in-and-out breath
    so that it flows freely through the various parts of the body, it'll give rise to results.
    Take good note of whether the results that the body and mind reap from the breath are good
    or bad. Does the body feel open and at ease, or does it feel tight and constricted? Does
    the mind feel calm, quiet, and pleasant, or is it irritable, distracted, and chaotic? If
    the body and mind feel at ease, that counts as good results. If the opposite is true, then
    that counts as bad results. So you have to gain a sense of how to adjust the breath so
    that it becomes comfortable. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As for the right qualities of the mind, those are
    mindfulness and alertness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Try to keep following these three basic principles every
    time you practice concentration. Only then will you get results that are full and correct.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As for the rewards of concentration, there are lots of
    them. They arise in line with the power of the mind of the person meditating, as I'll
    explain at a later date. </font></p>
