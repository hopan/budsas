    <h3 align="right"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>August 23, 1959</i></font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">I'</font><font face="Times New Roman">d like to
    recommend the basic principles of sitting in meditation for newcomers who've never done it
    before. </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">1.</b> Make up your mind that you're not going gather
      up anything else to think about, that you're going to think about only one thing: the
      qualities of the Buddha, or the word <i>buddho.</i> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>2.</b> Be firmly mindful of the breath, thinking<i>
      bud-</i> with the in-breath, and <i>dho</i> with the out. Or if you want, you can simply
      think <i>buddho, buddho</i> in the mind. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>3.</b> Make the mind still and then drop the word <i>buddho</i>
      so that you can simply observe nothing but the in-and-out breath. It's like standing at
      the gate of a cattle-pen and keeping watch over the cattle to see their characteristics as
      they come in and out of the pen. What color are they -- black? red? white? spotted? Are
      they old or young? Are they calves or fully grown? Make sure you don't go walking in with
      the cattle yet, for they might kick you and break your shins, or gore you to death with
      their horns. Stay right at the gate. What this means is that you keep your mind still in
      one point. You don't have to make it go in and out with the breath. Observing the
      characteristics of the cattle means learning how to observe the breath: Does breathing in
      short and out short feel good, or does in long and out long feel good? How about in long
      and out short, or in short and out long? Learn to recognize which type of breathing is
      most comfortable, and then stick with it. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So there are three steps you have to follow: the first
    step is to stay mindful of the word <i>buddho.</i> The second is to be mindful of the
    breath, thinking <i>bud-</i> with the in breath and <i>dho</i> with the out. Don't forget.
    Don't get distracted. The third step, when the mind is still, is to drop the word <i>buddho</i>
    and to be observant of nothing but the in-and-out breath. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you can do this, the mind will grow still. The breath
    will be still, too, like a dipper floating in a barrel of water: the water is still, the
    dipper is still, because no one is pressing on it, tipping it, or hitting against it. The
    dipper will keep floating in perfect stillness on the surface of the water. Or you can say
    that it's like climbing up to the top of a very tall mountain, or like floating up above
    the clouds. The mind will feel nothing but a cool sense of pleasure and ease. This is the
    root, the heartwood, the apex of all that is skillful. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's called the root because it's a good quality that runs
    deep and tenacious right down the middle of the heart. It's called the heartwood because
    it's solid and resilient, like the heartwood of a tree that insects can't burrow into and
    destroy. Even though insects may be able to nibble away at the tree, they can go only as
    far as the bark or the sapwood. In other words, even though distractions may come and
    bother us, they can reach only as far as the sense doors: our eyes, ears, nose, tongue,
    and body. For example, when sights strike against the eye, they go only as far as the eye.
    They don't get into the heart. When sounds strike the ear, they go only as far as the ear,
    and not into the heart. When smells strike the nose, they go only as far as the nose. They
    don't enter the heart. This is why we say that the goodness of meditation is the heartwood
    of what's skillful, because the various forms of evil can't easily destroy the goodness of
    the heart when it's solid and stable, in the same way that insects can't bore into
    heartwood. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The skillfulness of a mind in concentration is called the
    apex of all that's skillful because it's high in quality. It can pull all other forms of
    goodness into the mind as well. When the mind is still, its goodness spreads out to cover
    the entire body, so that we stop doing unskillful things with the body. It will cover our
    speech, so that we stop saying unskillful things with our mouth. The unskillful things
    we've done with our eyes, ears, hands, will all get washed away. In this way, the goodness
    that comes from meditating will wash out our eyes and ears, will wash our hands and all
    the various parts of our body so that they all become clean. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we have cleanliness in charge of our body, it's a
    goodness that's high in quality -- just as rain falling from high up in the sky spreads to
    cover everything. The higher it comes from, the more territory it covers. When the mind is
    high in quality, its goodness spreads to cover our eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and body. It
    spreads to cover sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile sensations. It spreads to
    cover our thoughts of past and future. In this way, this goodness spreads out until
    eventually it covers the entire cosmos. These, in short, are a few of the rewards that
    come from meditation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The high-quality goodness coming from meditation is like
    rain falling from high in the sky. Not only does it wash away the dirty things on the
    ground, but it also nourishes the plants so that human beings can depend on them. In
    addition, it refreshes people with its coolness. The Buddha showered his goodness on the
    world beginning from the very day of his Awakening, and his goodness is still raining on
    us 2,500 years later. The Buddha was a Great Being because of the high-quality goodness he
    developed through his meditation -- the same meditation we're doing right now. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To put it simply: every aspect of meditation is good. No
    matter how much you do, even if you don't seem to be getting any results, it's all good
    regardless. Even when you simply repeat the word <i>buddho,</i> it's good for the mind.
    When you're mindful of the breath, it's good for the mind. When you can make the mind
    still with the breath, it's good for the mind. For this reason, meditation is something
    you should do at all times. Don't let the time and opportunity to meditate pass you by. </font></p>
