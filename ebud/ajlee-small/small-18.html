    Fires, &amp; Thieves</font></h2>
    <h3 align="right"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>April 12, 1959</i></font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he dangers faced by the mind are
    like poisonous snakes, fires, and great thieves -- things that are always lying in wait to
    lay us to waste: robbing us, killing us, and stripping us of our valuables, our human
    goodness, every day and night. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Poisonous snakes&quot; here stand for passion,
    aversion, and delusion, which have a painful poison that seeps into the minds of
    run-of-the-mill people. When it reaches the heart, this poison can kill you. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As for &quot;fires,&quot; there are two kinds: forest
    fires and house fires. A forest fire doesn't have any one owner. It arises of its own
    accord, by its nature, and spreads its destruction far and wide, without bounds, until it
    dies out on its own. This stands for the fires of birth, aging, illness, and death, forms
    of suffering that arise in the bodies of all living beings. This fire can burn up both our
    worldly treasures and our noble treasures (i.e., the goodness of the mind that we
    otherwise would be able to develop). As for house fires, those are the fires that arise
    from within the heart -- defilements, ignorance, craving, and clinging -- the hindrances
    that get in the way of the goodness that comes from training the heart and mind. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The &quot;great thieves&quot; or &quot;500 most wanted
    criminals&quot; stand for our five aggregates: form, feeling, perception,
    thought-constructs, and consciousness, which are constantly robbing us, killing us, and
    oppressing us, destroying both our worldly treasures and our noble ones. In addition,
    there are the underground criminals that keep sneaking up on us without our realizing it:
    material gain, status, praise, and pleasure from external things. Whoever gets duped by
    these criminals finds it hard to work free. This is why they can destroy the goodness that
    we'd otherwise be able to attain in the area of the heart and mind. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All of these poisonous snakes, fires, and criminals pose a
    tremendous danger to the heart. They keep destroying our goodness every moment. If we're
    not wise to them, we'll have trouble gaining release from them. The only way to prevent
    these dangers is through the power of the Dhamma: in other words, the practice of
    meditation, using our powers of directed thought and evaluation within ourselves to the
    point where we give rise to the discernment that clearly knows and sees the truth of all
    fabricated things. When we can see the dangers on all sides, we'll learn to be careful and
    on our guard, to look for ways of destroying them or of escaping from them. When we can do
    this, our lives will be happy. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we practice the Dhamma it's as if we were going
    through a lonely, desolate forest on the way to a goal that's the highest form of
    happiness and safety. To get through the forest, we have to depend on the practice of
    concentration, with our mindfulness circumspect on all sides. We can't be heedless or
    complacent. We must make the effort to cut away all the concepts and preoccupations that
    come in to destroy the goodness of the mind. When we know that there are poisonous snakes,
    fires, and the 500 most wanted criminals lying in wait for us along our way, we have to be
    mindful, alert, and wakeful at all times, and to get good weapons ready so that we can
    fight them off. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the same time, we need provisions to help us on our way
    -- in other words the factors of <i>jhana.</i> Directed thought is what focuses the mind
    on what it wants to know. Evaluation is what kills off the Hindrances. These two qualities
    are like fixing dinner. But if we have only these two qualities, it's as if we've prepared
    our dinner but don't yet know the flavor of the different kinds of food we have. If we can
    still the mind until it's one with its object, that's like eating and swallowing our food.
    That's when we'll know its flavor and be able to gain a sense of fullness and nourishment
    from it: in other words, a sense of rapture, pleasure, and singleness of preoccupation.
    The heart will then be able to gain full strength, just like the body when it's had a
    nourishing meal. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Outer food is what nourishes the body and gives it
    strength. When the body has strength, we can walk or run anywhere we want. Whatever we
    want to do, we'll have the strength to succeed. As for inner food -- the Dhamma -- that's
    what nourishes the heart and mind. When the heart and mind are well nourished, the power
    of the heart is made resilient and strong. Whatever we set our mind on will succeed in
    line with our thoughts. If the mind is deprived of the food of the Dhamma, it gets feeble
    and weak. Its </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">thoughts meet with no success, or at best with success in
    some things and not in others, not fully in line with our hopes. That's why we have to
    shore up the strength of our own minds as much as we can, for the strength of the mind is
    the most important thing within us that will take us to our goal of the highest happiness.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As long as you're still alive and breathing, don't let
    yourself be heedless or complacent. Don't let time pass you by to no purpose. Hurry up and
    accelerate your efforts at developing goodness -- for when there's no more breath for you
    to breathe, you'll have no more opportunity to do good ... </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">You should focus exclusively on whatever thoughts help
    make the mind firm so that it can give rise to goodness. Don't dally with any other kinds
    of thinking, regardless of whether they seem more sophisticated or less. Shake them all
    off. Don't bring them into the mind to think about. Keep the mind firmly set in a single
    preoccupation: that's your true heart, the true heart of the Buddha's teachings. </font></p>
