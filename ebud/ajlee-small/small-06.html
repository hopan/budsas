    Strands of a Rope</font></h2>
    <h3 align="right"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>August 19, 1959</i></font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">I</font>f you've never meditated, these two
    easy principles are all you have to understand: (1) Think of the qualities of the Buddha;
    and (2) think of bringing them into your mind. What this means is, be mindful to make the
    mind firmly established solely in the breath, without forgetting it or letting yourself
    get distracted. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Not forgetting the breath means being mindful of the
    in-and-out breath at all times. Not getting distracted means that you don't grab hold of
    anything else to think about. If the mind is focused but you're thinking about something
    else, it's not called Right Concentration. Your mindfulness has to keep within the bounds
    of the work you're doing, in other words, staying with the breath. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Don't put pressure on the breath, tense it up, or hold it.
    Let it flow easily and comfortably, as when you put a fresh egg in cotton batting. If you
    don't throw it or push it down, the egg won't get dented or cracked. This way your
    meditation will progress smoothly. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The breath is one thing, mindfulness is another, and your
    awareness, still another. You have to twist these three strands together so that they
    don't break away from one another. In other words, your awareness has to stay with the act
    of mindfulness, thinking about the breath. And both your awareness and mindfulness have to
    stay with the breath. Only then can you say that these things are factors of meditation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you can twist these three strands into a single rope,
    focus your awareness on observing the in-and-out breath to see whether it's comfortable or
    not, expansive or confined, broad or narrow. Whichever way of breathing feels comfortable,
    keep breathing in that way. If the breath isn't comfortable, keep changing it until it is.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you force the mind too much, it's bound to pop away. If
    you loosen your grip too much, it's going to get lost. So try to tend to it in a way
    that's just right. The important point is that your mindfulness and alertness be
    circumspect, making adjustments throughout the breath. Don't let the mind go flowing out
    after other preoccupations. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mindfulness is like a person who's awake and alive. If the
    mind lacks mindfulness, it's like we're sleeping with dead bodies in a cemetery. There's
    nothing but foul smells and fear. This is why we're taught to be mindful of ourselves in
    the present moment at all times. Cut away all thoughts of past and future without grabbing
    onto them to think about, for these things are deceitful and illusory, like spirits and
    demons. They waste your time and pull you down. So be aware simply of the breath, for the
    breath is what gives life and leads you to higher happiness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mindfulness is like a magic soap that scrubs the breath.
    Alertness is another bar of magic soap for scrubbing the mind. If you constantly have
    mindfulness and alertness in conjunction with the breath and the mind, your body and mind
    will be valuable and pure, so that as long as you live in the world you'll be at your
    ease; when you die, you won't be put to difficulties. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If the mind is focused but forgets the breath and goes
    thinking about other things, that's called Wrong Concentration. If the mind drops some of
    its Hindrances, such as sensual desire, by falling asleep, that's called Wrong Release.
    Only if the mind is firmly focused on mindfulness and the breath is it in Right
    Concentration. Only if it drops its Hindrances by being wise to their tricks is it called
    Right Release. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If mindfulness and alertness are constantly established in
    the mind, our views will become straight, our concentration will become right, just as
    when two beams of light meet: they give rise to the bright light of discernment. There are
    times when discernment arises for only a tiny moment in the mind, and yet it can kill off
    enormous defilements. For example, it can let go of all the aggregates of clinging. It can
    abandon self-identity views by letting go of the body; it can abandon attachment to
    practices and precepts by letting go of feeling; and it can abandon uncertainty by letting
    go of perception, mental fabrications, and consciousness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We're taught to develop this sort of discernment by
    practicing Right Concentration. Even if it arises only for the flash of an eye, it can
    bring us many, many benefits. Just like an atomic bomb: even though it's only a tiny
    thing, it can bring destruction to the world in an awesome way. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The discernment arising from within the mind is something
    that can't be described. It's a tiny, little thing, not like the knowledge that comes from
    studying and memorizing in school. That's why we can't talk about it. The Buddha even laid
    down training rules for the monks, forbidding them from talking about their spiritual
    attainments. This is why we can't know if other people are noble disciples. It's something
    that each noble disciple can know only for him or herself alone. </font></p>
