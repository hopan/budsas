    of Discernment</font></h2>
    <h3 align="right"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>August 23, 1958</i></font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">O</font><font face="Times New Roman">ur
    discernment is like light, and there are three levels to it: low-level discernment, which
    is like the light of a torch; intermediate discernment, which is like the light of a
    candle or a kerosene lantern; and high-level discernment, which is like electric light. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To get light from a torch, you need to use a lot of fuel.
    And even though it's bright, it creates smoke. This is like the discernment that comes
    from being generous: it requires a lot of financial resources, and you sometimes have to
    contend with resistance from people outside. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The light of a candle or gas lantern is like the
    discernment that comes from observing the precepts. You have to exercise a lot of care and
    use your powers of endurance to keep them pure. Lantern-light requires fuel and a wick. As
    for candlelight, it requires a wick and some wax. If you have wax but no wick, you can't
    get any light. And both lantern-light and candlelight create smoke and soot, so neither of
    them counts as being entirely good. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As for electric discernment, there's no need for fuel, and
    it doesn't create smoke or soot. It's easy to use: whenever you want it, by day or by
    night, just flip on the switch. This refers to the discernment that comes from developing
    concentration. The power of the mind, when it's pure and firmly established, gives rise to
    the light of knowledge -- liberating insight -- enabling us to see events clearly, both in
    the area of the world and of the Dhamma. When we can make the mind clean and pure, it
    gives rise to concentration and to the light of discernment -- <i>panna-pajjoto</i> --
    which is like electric light, or the light of the sun, which shines all twelve hours of
    the day. This kind of discernment is the discernment of the noble ones. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All three forms of merit -- generosity, virtue, and
    meditation -- depend on discernment. When we develop discernment, we'll know how to look
    for merit on our own. And what kind of light will we want -- torch light, candlelight,
    lantern-light, or electric light? Death is like darkness. When the time comes to die,
    outside light won't be of any use to us. Our speech, hands, feet, arms, and legs won't be
    of any use to us. They won't be able to help us at all. Our eyes won't be able to see any
    light. No one will hear what we have to say. Our hands and feet won't be able to move. Our
    possessions won't be able to help us. The only resource that will be able to help us is
    our discernment, making sure that greed, aversion, and delusion don't get provoked,
    maintaining the mind in a state free from greed, free from aversion, free from delusion.
    We'll be able to separate these three things -- body, mind, and defilement -- out from one
    another, in the same way that we separate the wick of a candle from its wax. The fire of
    defilement will then have to go out, because the wick and the wax lie in separate places
    and don't make contact. In the same way, if we can separate the body from the mind, our
    normal awareness will have to go out. But when it goes out, that doesn't mean that
    awareness is annihilated. It's still there, but as a special form of awareness that
    doesn't depend on the body or mind and yet can still be aware. It's just like fire going
    out from a candle: it's not annihilated. There's still plenty of fire potential left in
    the world. It's there by its nature, simply that it isn't involved with any fuel. This
    kind of fire is better than the kind that requires fuel, because it doesn't wear anything
    out. It's simply there by its nature. This kind of merit is more wonderful than anything
    else. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we can separate the body, the mind, and defilement from
    one another, there'll be no more heat. The mind won't be hot, and instead will be cool at
    all times. The light of fire arises from the spinning of waves. If there are no waves,
    there'll be no spinning. The waves are like defilement. If we can cut through the waves,
    the spinning will stop. There will be no more birth. Greed, aversion, and delusion are
    like waves -- or like the wick of a candle. If we cut out the wick, leaving only the wax,
    fire will have no place to catch hold and so will have to go out. When the candle goes
    out, it's like the death of human beings: the fire leaves the candle, but the fire
    potential isn't annihilated. In the same way, the mind that goes out from the body isn't
    annihilated. If it can remain on its own, without having to depend on a body, it doesn't
    appear in any way, shape, or form anywhere at all. That's the awareness of nibbana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the kind of awareness that's really like electric
    light. Whenever we want it, it's there for us to know. Sometimes even if we don't want to
    know, we still end up knowing. As for ordinary people, even if they want to know things,
    they often don't know; they often don't see even when they want to see. That's like torch
    light or candlelight: if there's no fuel, there's no way it can be bright. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is why we're taught to train our minds to be firmly
    established in concentration -- for the mind well-trained is what gives rise to the light
    of discernment that doesn't get deluded: the discernment that knows for sure. </font></p>
