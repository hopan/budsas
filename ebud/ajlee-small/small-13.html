    <h3 align="right"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>September 27, 1956</i></font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">W</font>hen you sit and meditate, tell
    yourself that your body is like your home. When you repeat the word <i>buddho</i> in with
    the breath, it's like inviting a monk into your home. When people invite a monk into their
    home, what do they do in order to qualify as having good manners? 1) They have to prepare
    a place for him to sit down. 2) They provide him with good food or drinking water. 3) They
    have to converse with him. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we meditate, &quot;preparing a place to sit
    down&quot; means thinking <i>bud- </i>in with the in-breath, and <i>dho</i> out with the
    out. If we're mindful to think in this way, the word <i>buddho</i> will always stay snug
    with the breath. Whenever our thinking slips away from the breath, it's as if we put a rip
    in the seat we're preparing for our guest. And don't forget that before you prepare a
    seat, you first have to sweep the place clean. In other words, when you first start out,
    you should breathe in long and deep and then let the breath come all the way out, two or
    three times. Then you gradually allow the breath to grow lighter, bit by bit, until it's
    just enough for you to follow comfortably. Don't let it grow any weaker or stay any
    stronger than just right. Then you start combining <i>buddho</i> with the in-and-out
    breath. When you do this, your visiting monk will come into your home. Now make sure that
    you stay with him. Don't go running off anywhere else. If your mind runs off to hang
    around with external concepts of past or future, it's as if you've run away from the monk
    you've invited into your home -- which is really bad manners. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once the monk has sat down in the seat you've prepared for
    him, you have to give him some good food or water, and then find good things to converse
    with him. The good food here is the food of intentions, the food of sensory contact, and
    the food of consciousness. The food of intentions stands for the way you adjust the breath
    so as to make it comfortable both for the body and for the mind. For instance, you're
    observant to see which kind of breathing is good for the body, and which kind is bad. What
    kind of in-breathing feels easy? What kind of out-breathing feels easy? Does it feel good
    to breathe in fast and out fast? How about in slow and out slow? You have to experiment
    and then taste the food you've prepared. This is one kind of food for the mind. This is
    why being intent to stay with the breath is called the food of intention. When you adjust
    the breath to the point where it feels comfortable and in good order, it'll give rise to a
    sense of fullness and ease. That's when you can say that you've provided your visiting
    monk with good, nourishing food. When he's finished his meal, he's going to chant
    blessings for the sake of your well-being and happiness, so that you'll be free from pain
    and suffering. Or, as the saying goes, the power of the Buddha gets rid of suffering. In
    other words, when you've adjusted the breath properly, the pains in the body will
    disappear. Even though there may be some that don't disappear, they don't impinge on the
    mind. As for pain and suffering in the heart, that will all disappear. The mind will cool
    down. When it cools down, it'll be at its ease -- quiet, blooming, and bright. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And as for the saying, the power of the Dhamma gets rid of
    dangers: the various forms of Mara coming to disturb the body, such as the pains of the
    aggregates, will all vanish. The mind will be free from dangers and animosities. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And as for the saying, the power of the Sangha gets rid of
    disease: all the various diseases in the mind -- sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and
    despair -- will disappear. This way, once you've invited this monk into your home and
    provided him with good food, he's going to give you three kinds of blessing: you escape
    for pain, from danger, and from disease. This is part of the blessing that your visiting
    monk will give you. But if, when you've invited a monk into your home, you go running off
    outside -- in other words, if you forget the breath or go hanging around with external
    thoughts -- it's really impolite, and the monk is going to be put to difficulties. It's as
    if you had invited him into your home but had forgotten to prepare his meal. So if you
    aren't really intent on the breath and don't really welcome your monk into your home, you
    won't get this kind of blessing. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The last part of inviting your monk into your home is to
    converse with him. Once he's eaten his fill, you talk with him. This stands for the
    qualities of directed thought, evaluation, rapture, pleasure, and singleness of
    preoccupation. You connect all six types of breath energy in the body so that they all
    flow into one another -- as when you put up a telephone line. If the line stays in good
    shape, you can hear what they say all over the world. But if the line is cut, you can't
    get word of what they're saying even in Bangkok just down the road. So when you keep your
    line in good shape, you can hear anything being said anywhere at all. When the mind stays
    in the first jhana this way, it's as if your visiting monk is talking with you, and you're
    talking with him. And the things you're talking about are all Dhamma. This puts you in a
    good mood. As time passes, you feel so good that you don't even want to eat. This is
    rapture: the body feels full. At the same time, the mind is free from disturbances and so
    feels pleasure. Wherever you get a sense of pleasure, you keep staying interested in that
    point: this is singleness of preoccupation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you welcome your visiting monk in this way, he's
    going to keep coming to visit you. No matter where you go, he'll be able to reach you.
    Even if you're staying in the mountains or forest wilderness, he'll be able to give you
    whatever help you need. </font></p>
