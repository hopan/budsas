      of rationality laid down in the methods of modern science and the 
      materialist outlook associated with it, are the most dominant influences 
      on the intellectual life of modern man. A large section of modern 
      intellectuals subjected to these influences have rejected metaphysics and 
      dogmatic religion along with a host of traditional moral values. 
      Scientific rationality has undoubtedly resulted in tremendous material 
      progress. It cannot, however, be claimed that human beings in the modern 
      world live more contented lives, feeling safe and secure, and that their 
      interests will not be unjustly harmed by fellow human beings. Armed 
      conflicts are rampant in the modern world. Acts of terrorism, violation of 
      human rights, racial and other types of discrimination, violence against 
      innocent human beings are some of the horrendous moral crimes that we 
      frequently witness in many parts of the world. Poverty and destitution are 
      not uncommon. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In Buddhist terms, scientific and 
      technological progress has in no way resulted in the reduction of the 
      unwholesome roots of human behaviour, namely, greed, hatred and delusion. 
      As long as these roots of unwholesome behaviour are not drastically 
      reduced or are kept within reasonable limits, it would not be possible to 
      think of peace, harmony, happiness and contentment in society. The 
      relevance of Buddhism to the modern social context lies in the fact that 
      it offers a philosophical middle way that recognizes in principle the 
      norms of scientific rationality, while rejecting both the extreme 
      materialist world-view of modern science and the metaphysical and dogmatic 
      fundamentalism of traditional religion. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Modern science does not provide us with 
      the knowledge of what is morally right or wrong, good or bad. When human 
      beings are not concerned with such knowledge, and do not care to pursue 
      the principles of a morally good life, social interaction among humans is 
      not likely to become very different from that among brutes. One of the 
      most important features that distinguishes life among humans from life 
      among brutes is that human beings desire not only to live, but also to 
      live well. They search for meaning in life, and seek to attain rationally 
      justifiable moral ideals and goals. In this respect Buddhist morality has 
      much to offer to modern man. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Buddhism can be considered as a path of 
      moral perfection. The entire path is comprised of gradual stages of 
      ethical purification. This is the reason why it was traditionally 
      described as a <I>visuddhimagga</I>. The goal of Buddhism is a 
      modification of a person’s behaviour and a transformation of a person’s 
      emotive and cognitive constitution. The consequence of this modification 
      and transformation is that the person concerned overcomes the ills of 
      existence and ceases to produce suffering to others. The goal of Buddhism 
      is defined purely in psychological terms. It is not merging with God or 
      Brahman or surviving to eternity in some incomprehensible realm of Being, 
      but becoming free from greed, hatred and delusion. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The ethical teaching of Buddhism advocates 
      an ideal of moral perfection as its ultimate goal. Moral perfection is 
      attained when the unwholesome psychological roots of human behaviour, 
      namely, greed, hatred and delusion are eradicated. They are described as 
      unwholesome roots (<I>akusalamula</I>) because it is through their 
      influence that people are motivated to commit unethical acts such as 
      destruction of life, causing harm or injury to other living beings, 
      misappropriation of the belongings of others, indulgence in sexual 
      misconduct and the wrongful enjoyment of sense pleasures, the use of 
      false, harsh, frivolous and slanderous speech, etc. Buddhism recognizes a 
      valid basis for the distinctions people make between what is morally right 
      or wrong and good or bad. According to the Buddhist teachings, a valid 
      basis for making moral judgements has to be discovered with reference to 
      human experience, but not with reference to any metaphysical reality. The 
      conditions under which human beings become happy and contented and the 
      conditions under which they find life miserable are generally the same. 
      Factual information about those conditions are directly relevant to our 
      moral life. They are to be discovered by means of observation and 
      experience. To live morally is to live paying due regard to the moral 
      point of view, which involves the avoidance of the creation of misery to 
      oneself and others as well as the alleviation of the suffering of others. 
      As long as people pay attention to human experience itself they need not 
      lose faith in the importance of morality. To be concerned with morality is 
      to be concerned with human good and harm, happiness and unhappiness, ill 
      and well-being. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The significance of Buddhism to modern 
      society is that it does not seek to determine the issue of what is right 
      and wrong by tying the moral life to a set of metaphysical dogmas from 
      which moral precepts are derived, or to the moral commandments of a 
      sectarian God. People who have given up metaphysics and religious dogma in 
      preference to the modern scientific, materialist and deterministic view of 
      existence have moved towards a sceptical stance on the nature of moral 
      values. They tend to associate morality with metaphysics and religion. The 
      consequence of this attitude is the creation of a moral vacuum in their 
      lives. Under such circumstances greed, hatred and delusion become the 
      motivating forces of their behaviour. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The materialist and determinist ideology 
      associated with modern science, which is seeking to displace metaphysics 
      and religious dogma, attempts to transform society by effecting changes in 
      the material conditions of living. The scientific world-view attaches no 
      significance to the importance of morality. Morality is considered as a 
      matter of attitudes and emotions. Moral values are considered to be 
      relative and subjective. According to this view, only empirical facts have 
      objectivity. Man is considered merely as a stimulus-response mechanism. 
      Man’s capacity to understand and control the inner motivational roots of 
      behaviour appears to gain little recognition in terms of the mechanistic 
      world view of material science. Human behaviour is explained in terms of 
      the external conditions that determine it. If external factors alone 
      determine human behaviour, people cannot be responsible for their moral 
      failings. They cannot be blamed for what they do. Such a view of the 
      nature of human action encourages the renunciation of personal 
      responsibility for what people do. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The problems of modern society may be 
      explained from the Buddhist standpoint as a consequence of the separation 
      of scientific knowledge and technological skill from moral wisdom. There 
      is ample evidence of the proliferation of greed and hatred at all levels 
      of social interaction in modern society. It has created economic 
      disparity, poverty and destitution. The lack of concern for the 
      cultivation of sympathetic concern for the well-being of others is leading 
      to increased social conflict and tension. The ultimate goal of the 
      Buddhist way of life is the eradication of greed, hatred and delusion. If 
      much of the psychological insanity that produces moral crises in modern 
      society is the consequence of the proliferation of greed, hatred and 
      delusion, then the Buddhist ideal of moral perfection can be said to be 
      directly relevant to the social life of modern man. </FONT></P>
