        Bhikkhuni Kusuma. Thank you for joining us on the Buddhist Hour.
        Welcome. We enjoyed your visit to our Centre on Wednesday. Thank you.</em></font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Venerable Kusuma</b>: Thank you also,
        it's my good luck.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><b>Pennie</b>: Your teaching on how
        we can strengthen our practice has inspired this week's radio broadcast
        script.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Venerable Kusuma</b>: I think I enjoy
        being with you. It's a great blessing for me too.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><b>Pennie</b>: Thank you. This
        Teaching has been written down, and is online at <a href="http://www.bddronline.net.au/bddr11no2/bhikkuni.html">http://www.bddronline.net.au/bddr11no2/bhikkuni.html</a>
        </em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Venerable Kusuma</b>: Thank you,
        Pennie.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><b>Pennie</b>: During your visit on
        Wednesday, we requested that you teach us about svakattho, so that this
        high Teaching may be recorded. We request that you share this Teaching
        with us today.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Venerable Kusuma</b>: Okay. It is the
        six attributes of the Dhamma. <strong><em>Svakattho bhagavata dhammo
        sanditthiko akaliko ehipassiko opaneyyiko paccattam veditabbo vinnuhi</em></strong>.
        There is a little story which is very interesting. It seems when the
        Buddha was there living in Savatthi a certain Monk by the name of
        Upavana, who was very young and beautiful to look at, came up to the
        Buddha and told him, Venerable Sir, I don't understand what is the
        meaning of svakatto bhagavata dhammo. What is the meaning of <em>sanditthiko
        akaliko ehipassiko opaneyyiko paccattam veditabbo vinnuhi</em>? So I
        like to explain to you a little bit of what the Buddha's reply was.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><b>Pennie</b>: Please do.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Venerable Kusuma</b>: Then the Buddha
        said &quot;he's a young man, beautiful, and a Monk, Upavana he said
        &quot;Well, Upavana, suppose you saw a beautiful figure, and then there
        arose lust in your mind, and then you became aware of the lust in your
        mind. At that time, all these six attributes of the Dhamma are
        established in your mind.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now I'll try to explain to you how it
        comes to be established. Now, all that Upavana did was, becoming aware
        of the lust in his own mind. That means he's seeing the truth, because
        it's a reality in his mind which only he can see from first-hand
        experience. Nobody else can see that. He himself has discovered an
        empirical truth, an absolute truth. It's not something read in books,
        it's not something taught to him by his teachers, he himself has
        experienced this truth, that he himself has understood by observing his
        mind. And then he understood, there is in me, lust in my mind.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then, this is right view, this is <strong><em>sanditthiko</em></strong>,
        <em>ditthi</em> means <em>rushti, rushti</em> means view. He has seen a
        truth. In his mind he has seen a reality, so this is the establishment
        of <em>sanditthiko</em>. Then as soon as he sees his own lust, he comes
        out of it, because his observation of lust is by a different thought
        moment, arising out of wisdom. So as soon as wisdom arises in his mind,
        the lust already is suppressed momentarily, and now it is wisdom that is
        in his mind. So no two thoughts arise at the same time, so the lust has
        already subsided, and now wisdom has taken over, and wisdom is there.
        The time lapse for the lust to subside, and for wisdom to arise is one
        thought moment, which is an extremely short period of time.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><em>Akaliko</em></strong> means
        that there is no time lapse between <em>akaliko</em>, and here is one
        moment in lust and one moment in wisdom. There is no time difference.
        That is <em>akaliko</em>. Immediate result. <em><strong>Ehipassiko</strong></em>
        is &quot;come and see&quot;. Now he is the winner. He has come to a
        point of inviting anyone to &quot;come and see&quot;. All this life I
        was under temptation of lust and here I have been restored. I have
        resurrected myself from the lust. I am no more a victim of it. I have
        come out of it. And he can, with confidence, call someone and say
        &quot;Look at this. I have something very valuable. I am the master of
        my mind. I am with wisdom. You too can, if you want, come out of your
        unwholesomeness, by merely seeing it&quot;. So now he is inviting
        &quot;come and see&quot; (<em>ehipassiko</em>).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>Opaneyikko</strong></em>
        means onward-leading, that is to say, I have no more unwholesomeness in
        my mind. I am in wisdom and in wholesomeness, and that is
        onward-leading, towards divinity, towards a divine life, and also
        towards nibbana, the final cessation of all greed. So that is <em>opaneyyikko</em>;
        onward-leading.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Ehipassiko, opaneyyikko, paccattam
        veditabbo</em> means <strong><em>pratyaksha</em></strong>, experiencable
        by the wise. <em><strong>Vinnuhi</strong></em> means wise, so now he is
        a wise person who has experienced his own lust and also experienced with
        wisdom how he overcame lust. So these are the six attributes of the
        Dhamma which are established in your mind on seeing your own defilement.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><b>Pennie</b>: Sadhu, sadhu, sadhu.
        Thank you.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Venerable Kusuma</b>: I'm also happy.
        I'm so happy that you are asking me such deep questions, and it will be
        an experience for you to practise this Dhamma.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><b>Pennie</b>: Thank you. Could you
        please give us a brief history of the Bhikkuni order?</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Venerable Kusuma</b>: The Bhikkuni
        order was established in the 3<sup>rd</sup> century B.C. in Sri Lanka,
        and we have an unbroken lineage from the time of the Buddha, when
        Mahapajapati first became a Bhikkuni under the Buddha, and this lineage,
        the unbroken lineage, the robe order, was preserved in Sri Lanka when
        Bhikkuni Sanghamitta, that is the daughter of Emperor Asoka of India,
        visited Sri Lanka with a retinue of Bhikkunis in the 3<sup>rd</sup>
        century B.C. and there established a Bhikkuni order in Sri Lanka.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is history, ancient chronicles
        have reported this, and it is in the history of all the Buddhist
        countries also, that in Sri Lanka the Bhikkuni order flourished with
        many, many Arhant Bhikkunis, who had gained stages of sainthood, even in
        Sri Lanka, and for thirteen centuries, Sri Lanka had this Bhikkuni
        order, and this is another historical fact, that in the 6<sup>th</sup>
        century A.D., that is, nearly 900 years after, the Sri Lankan Bhikkunis
        took an arduous trip by ships, sailing ships, in quite a dangerous
        crossing, to go over to China, along the Silk Road. A trade ship took
        them to China, and they established the Bhikkuni order in China. That
        was 900 years after.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">But then Sri Lanka lost the order, and
        then for the last 1,000 years, we didn't have any Bhikkunis in Sri
        Lanka, but our lineage is still preserved. From China it went to Japan,
        Korea, Taiwan, and now all those countries have the Bhikkuni lineage.
        There are many thousands of Bhikkunis. All are descendants of the Sri
        Lankan Bhikkunis. No other Bhikkunis ever travelled to any of these
        countries, apart from this Sri Lankan lineage, and now recently, maybe
        six years ago, we made a very big effort to get back our lineage, and I
        am very happy to say that I was invited to lead this first Sri Lankan
        Bhikkunis in the recent past. And then we received the lineage and
        became ordained as Bhikkunis in India, in Sarnath, the place where the
        Buddha preached the first sermon to the five ascetics, and we became
        ordained under the Korean Sangha.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So now in Sri Lanka we have about 400
        Bhikkunis, and we are practising the Theravada Pali vinaya, the Rules of
        Discipline that were originally handed over by the Buddha himself, and
        we don't know Mahayana, we don't know Korean language, but we merely
        took the robe order, the bowl and the robe, and now we practise
        according to the Pali tradition, the Theravada vinaya, the Bhikkuni
        vinaya.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><b>Pennie</b>: Sadhu, sadhu, sadhu.
        We are most privileged to have you with us today, Venerable Bhikkhuni
        Kusuma.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Venerable Kusuma</b>: Thank you.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><b>Pennie</b>: I understand that you
        will head the Ayya Khema International Buddha Mandir once building is
        complete in Sri Lanka. Can you please tell us about this noble project?</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Venerable Kusuma</b>: Yes. I've been
        very close to Ayya Khema. In fact, she once came to my house before she
        became ordained. It was my luck that somebody in Thailand gave her my
        address, and she wanted to visit Sri Lanka. She first came to my house.
        I was so happy. We became very close, and then she became ordained as a
        ten-precept Nun in Sri Lanka. Very soon she became very popular, and
        went around Sri Lanka giving lectures, talks, on Dhamma and meditation,
        and I was the fortunate person to be her interpreter, often into
        Singhala.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Later, very recently, she died in
        Germany, and I was invited to Germany to conduct a lecture tour, and it
        was a tremendous success, from Berlin, Stuttgart, Hamburg, and down to
        Munich, I gave many, many lectures, and at the end of it some of them
        wanted to visit me in Sri Lanka, and I said &quot;Don't come, I don't
        even have a proper place&quot;. Most of them gave me gifts, and we
        started this Buddha Mandir. And now the roof, it has come to roof level,
        and I think after I return to Sri Lanka, I should be able to complete
        this. Also I take this opportunity to invite you to come and see this
        little place. It's only a small one, a five-roomed small place.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><b>Pennie</b>: Thank you very much.

        leave Australia this time.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Venerable Kusuma</b>: Yes, thank you.</font></p>
