        <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">There are two groups of scholars 
        writing on the two main types of Buddhist meditation: one group that

        to be inessential in the pursuit of nirvana, and a second group that 
        views both <EM>samatha</EM> and <EM>vipassanā</EM> to be essential. I 
        approach an answer to the question of which group is correct in two

        relationship between <EM>samatha</EM> and <EM>vipassanā</EM>, but rather 
        I show that by making Keown&#39;s theory of the cultivation of moral concern

      <H5><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3" COLOR="#800000">1. Introduction: 
      Meditations in Tension?</FONT></H5>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">There are two main branches of Buddhist 
      meditation techniques: insight meditation (<EM>vipassanā-bhāvanā</EM>) and 
      tranquility meditation (<EM>samatha-bhāvanā</EM>). <A NAME="a1"></A>(<A HREF="#n1">1</A>) 
      Insight meditation is aimed at cultivating <EM>paññā</EM> (most often 
      translated as &quot;wisdom&quot;); tranquility meditation is aimed a cultivating <EM>
      samatha</EM> (&quot;calmness, tranquility&quot;). Tradition generally considers the 
      first to have been a new form of meditation invented by the historical 
      Buddha and the second to have been highly developed by Indian 
      practitioners by the time of the Buddha&#39;s life. The most common story is 
      that the Buddha learned all that his meditation teachers had to offer and, 
      still unsatisfied, developed his own type of meditation: <EM>
      vipassanā-bhāvanā</EM>. After he developed this insight meditation, he 
      achieved nirvana and transcended suffering (<EM>dukkha</EM>).</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">I find it useful to categorize scholars 
      who have written on the relationship between <EM>vipassanā</EM> and <EM>
      samatha </EM>into two groups: one group that considers <EM>vipassanā</EM> 
      to be essential and <EM>samatha</EM> to be inessential in the pursuit of 
      nirvana, and a second group that views both <EM>samatha</EM> and <EM>
      vipassanā</EM> to be essential for Buddhist soteriology. For the sake of 
      perspicuity, I will refer to the first group as &quot;<EM>samatha-</EM>inessentialists&quot; 
      and the second group as <EM>&quot;samatha-</EM>essentialists.&quot; My goal in this 
      essay is to approach an answer to the question of which group is correct.</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">I will make this approach in two steps: 
      (1), I will outline the disagreement between Paul Griffiths (as a 
      representative of the <EM>samatha-</EM>inessentialists) and Damien Keown 
      (as a representative of the <EM>samatha</EM>-essentialists) on the issue; 
      and (2), in order to come closer to deciding which of the two has the 
      better answer, I shall augment a small part of Keown&#39;s theory, namely his 
      assertion that <EM>samatha</EM> can cultivate moral concern, with some 
      ideas of my own. I will not definitively solve the general problem of the 
      relationship between <EM>samatha</EM> and <EM>vipassanā</EM>, but rather I 
      hope to show that by making Keown&#39;s theory of the cultivation of moral 
      concern more plausible we have more reasons to accept his larger theory of 
      the importance of both <EM>samatha</EM> and <EM>vipassanā</EM>. As 
      Griffiths and Keown concentrate on Theravāda sources in this context, I 
      will limit the scope of my essay to such sources, predominantly the <EM>
      Nikāyas</EM> and Buddhaghosa&#39;s <EM>Visuddhimagga</EM> (<EM>Path of 
      Purification</EM>).<A NAME="a2"></A>(<A HREF="#n2">2</A>) I am making no 
      claims about Mahāyāna or other Buddhist meditation traditions; however, I 
      suspect that there will be much overlapping in the form and content of the 
      problem within other Buddhist traditions.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">Most scholars have considered insight 
      meditation to be the more important of the two (for instance, Bodhi, 
      Gunaratna, King, Rahula, and Solé-Leris). Walpola Rahula has written that 
      the states created by <EM>samatha</EM> meditation are &quot;...mind-created, 
      mind-produced, conditioned.... They have nothing to do with Reality, 
      Truth, Nirvana&quot; (Rahula, p. 68). These sentiments are shared by Bhikkhu 
      Bodhi: &quot;The role of serenity is subordinated to that of insight because 
      the latter is the crucial instrument needed to uproot the ignorance at the 
      bottom of the samsaric bondage&quot; (Bodhi, p. 38). To reach nirvana, one must 
      have the insight into the true nature of reality created by <EM>
      vipassanā-bhāvanā</EM>. Thus, <EM>samatha</EM> is considered to be 
      inessential for nirvana.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">If <EM>samatha</EM> is inessential, why 
      is it included in Buddhist meditation traditions? The answer, for Rahula 
      and most scholars of this group, is that <EM>samatha</EM> techniques can 
      sometimes help develop qualities useful in <EM>vipassanā</EM> meditation. 
      Nonetheless, <EM>samatha</EM> techniques are not as inherently valuable as
      <EM>vipassanā</EM> techniques. Of course I am not claiming that these 
      scholars have the <EM>same</EM> theory. My claim is simply that they share 
      the basic similarity of considering <EM>vipassanā</EM> the superior form 
      of meditation and <EM>samatha</EM> to be ultimately unnecessary—however 
      helpful it might be—in the pursuit of nirvana. The work of Paul Griffiths, 
      which falls into this category of <EM>vipassanā </EM>enthusiasts, will be 
      discussed in section 1.1.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">Another smaller group of scholars has 
      sought to portray <EM>samatha</EM> and <EM>vipassanā</EM> in more equal 
      terms; Edward Conze<A NAME="a3"></A>(<A HREF="#n3">3</A>) and Robert M. 
      Gimello are two examples. Conze does not claim that <EM>samatha</EM> can 
      lead one to nirvana without <EM>vipassanā</EM>, but neither does he claim 
      that <EM>vipassanā</EM> can lead one to nirvana without <EM>samatha</EM>.
      <EM>Samatha</EM> creates a one-pointedness of mind and &quot;A mind of single 
      intent is capable of doing more effectively whatever it does, be it good 
      or bad&quot; (Conze, p. 19). He still considers the wisdom gained by <EM>
      vipassanā</EM> to be the highest good because even when the greatest 
      concentration is developed, insight is needed to reach nirvana. However, 
      we can never gain this wisdom without <EM>samatha</EM> either. He sums up 
      this idea as follows:</FONT> </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">Trance, as it is developed, approaches 
        a condition of rapt attention to an objectless inwardness (<EM>anarambana</EM>); 
        the more wisdom develops, the clearer the intuition of emptiness (<EM>śunyatā</EM>). 
        These are the two terminal points at which the world is on the verge of 
        extinction. <EM>The combination of the two leads to final emancipation
        </EM>(Conze, p. 17, emphasis added).</FONT> </P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">Gimello very much agrees: &quot;While it is 
      true that discernment is not to be attained without some degree of calming 
      as a precondition, it is no less true that calming itself, without 
      discernment, is of no soteric avail whatsoever&quot; (Gimello, p. 185).</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">Both <EM>vipassanā</EM> and <EM>samatha</EM> 
      are <EM>necessary</EM> parts of the path toward Buddhism&#39;s soteriological 
      goal. Although he explicitly affirms that both are necessary in a quest 
      for nirvana, Conze admits that there &quot;is even some tension between the two 
      modes of approach&quot; (Conze, p. 17). Griffiths develops this tension and 
      Damien Keown offers an interesting solution to it, as I will discuss in 
      section 1.2.</FONT> </P>
      <H5><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">1.1. Griffiths: problematic yoking</FONT></H5>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">In context of the treatment of the state 
      of cessation (<EM>nirodhasamāpatti</EM>) in his book <EM>On Being Mindless</EM>, 
      Griffiths specifically addresses the relationship between <EM>samatha</EM> 
      and <EM>vipassanā</EM>. He characterizes <EM>samatha</EM> as enstatic and
      <EM>vipassanā</EM> as analytic:</FONT> </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">Such analytical meditations are 
        designed, then, to remove standard cognitive and perceptual 
        habit-patterns and to replace them with new ones. Furthermore, these 
        techniques are designed to teach the practitioner something new about 
        the way things are, to inculcate in his consciousness a whole series of 
        knowledges that such-and-such is the case. In contrast, the enstatic 
        meditations are designed to reduce the contents of consciousness, to 
        focus awareness upon a single point and ultimately to bring all mental 
        activity to a halt (Griffiths, p. 13).</FONT> </P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">This characterization of the different 
      methods leads Griffiths to an understanding of different soteriological 
      goals for each method. As he says, &quot;Those who follow and advocate the 
      analytic techniques tend to perceive the basic human problem as one of 
      ignorance, and inaccurate understanding of the way things are&quot; (Griffiths, 
      p. 14). This makes sense. If the disease is ignorance, the cure must be 
      knowledge. Compare this with what he says about those who engage in <EM>
      samatha</EM>: &quot;In drastic contrast, the practitioners of the enstatic 
      techniques aimed at tranquility tend to perceive the basic human error as 
      one of attitude rather than cognition; the key Buddhist term here is 
      &#39;thirst&#39; (<EM>taṇhā</EM>), a term that denotes all types of passionate 
      desire and attachment&quot; (Griffiths, p. 14). This also makes sense—if a 
      certain attitude causes suffering, then we must change that attitude to 
      one that does not cause suffering.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">It is not difficult to see the tension 
      here. It would seem that there are two completely separate goals with 
      accompanying differing methods all jostling about within the same 
      tradition. This has created a great many philosophical problems according 
      to Griffiths: &quot;Throughout Buddhist history, intellectuals have attempted 
      to reconcile thought-systems which are on the face of it, irreconcilable&quot; 
      (Griffiths, p. 16). Specifically, Griffiths attributes many of the 
      problems surrounding the attainment of cessation to the tension between
      <EM>samatha</EM> and <EM>vipassanā</EM>. The attainment of cessation is 
      the stage of enstatic meditation following the attainment of the four <EM>
      jhānas </EM>of form and the four formless <EM>jhānas</EM>.<A NAME="a4"></A>(<A HREF="#n4">4</A>) 
      However, according to Griffiths, Buddhist theorists have attempted to 
      describe the attainment of cessation using the soteriological framework of 
      analytic meditation, some even going so far as to identify the attainment 
      of cessation with the eradication of ignorance and even as nirvana itself.</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">If each kind of meditation has different 
      soteriological goals, trying to piece them together is a confusing 
      business at best. Griffiths explains this uneasy alliance with a 
      historical hypothesis: &quot;it quickly became orthodoxy for Indian Buddhist 
      intellectuals that salvation must involve some degree of intellectual 
      appropriation of doctrine, and any canonical material which appeared to 
      present a self-consistent and coherent set of soteriological practices 
      which involved no such intellectual activity therefore needed to be 
      amended to accord with such orthodoxy&quot; (Griffiths, p. 23). The examples 
      given are of Buddhaghosa and Dhammaphala&#39;s insistence that insight must be 
      present to reach the attainment of cessation. Buddhaghosa talks about 
      &quot;yoking together&quot; insight and tranquility in order to achieve successively 
      higher <EM>jhānas </EM>up to the attainment of cessation (<EM>Vism</EM>. 
      23.43). Griffiths finds this yoking process insufficiently explained and 
      confusing given his ideas about the relations between method and 
      soteriology.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">This is his main point: it is difficult 
      at best and impossible at worst to try to yoke together two methods into 
      the service of one goal when the two methods are themselves designed to 
      reach radically different goals.</FONT> </P>
      <H5><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">1.2. Keown: Let the yoking commence</FONT></H5>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">Keown&#39;s treatment of the relation 
      between <EM>samatha</EM> and <EM>vipassanā</EM> comes in the context of a 
      chapter on ethics and psychology in his book, <EM>The Nature of Buddhist 
      Ethics</EM>. It is important to note that the overarching thesis of the 
      chapter is that <EM>sīla </EM>(morality) and <EM>paññā</EM> (insight, 
      knowledge) are two complimentary and equally necessary strands of Buddhist 
      soteriology. It is also helpful to note that the other subtheses of the 
      chapter can be characterized as follows:</FONT> </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">1. <EM>Citta</EM> (mind, psyche) is an 
        aggregate of both rational and emotional elements (<EM>dharmas</EM>).</FONT>
        </P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">2. The moral and the rational are 
        fundamentally interconnected as shown in the linking of the intellectual 
        vice of <EM>moha</EM> (delusion) and the moral vices of <EM>lobha</EM> 
        (greed) and <EM>dosa</EM> (hatred) in a &quot;triangle of <EM>taṇhā</EM> 
        (clinging).&quot;</FONT> </P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">3. The Buddha&#39;s compassion was based 
        on and his enlightenment was preceded and followed by noncognitive, 
        nonrational moral sentiment; the Buddha provides the paradigm case of 
        ethical motivation.</FONT> </P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">His thesis about <EM>samatha</EM> and
      <EM>vipassanā</EM> can be stated briefly as follows:</FONT> </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3"><EM>Samatha-bhāvanā </EM>(calming 
        meditation) and <EM>vipassanā-bhāvanā</EM> (insight meditation) are 
        equally necessary, interdependent methods of attaining enlightenment by 
        purging one&#39;s self of both moral and intellectual vices.</FONT> </P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">Thus, Keown&#39;s theory about the 
      relationship between <EM>samatha</EM> and <EM>vipassanā</EM> is meant to 
      supplement his larger theory on the equal importance of morality (<EM>sīla)</EM> 
      and knowledge (<EM>paññā)</EM>, which in turn is deployed to support the 
      main argument of his book that Buddhist ethics can be best characterized 
      as a type of virtue ethics. This context is important because it shows us 
      that Keown means for his theory about <EM>samatha</EM> and <EM>vipassanā</EM> 
      to solve the tension of Griffiths and at the same time advance his theory 
      that <EM>sīla </EM>(morality) is important throughout Buddhist 
      soteriological practices.<A NAME="a5"></A>(<A HREF="#n5">5</A>)</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">Keown agrees with Griffiths that <EM>
      samatha</EM> and <EM>vipassanā</EM> aim at different outcomes. However, he 
      disagrees about the nature of these outcomes:</FONT> </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">Since progress in the religious life 
        is made on two fronts, there exist two kinds of meditation techniques. I 
        wish to suggest that &quot;calming meditation&quot; (<EM>samatha-bhāvanā</EM>) 
        cultivates moral virtue and &quot;insight meditation&quot; (<EM>vipassanā-bhāvanā</EM>) 
        develops knowledge or insight (Keown, p. 77).</FONT> </P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">So far this is not substantially 
      different than Griffiths&#39;s claim that <EM>samatha</EM> cultivates an 
      attitude and <EM>vipassanā</EM> cultivates knowledge or wisdom. This is 
      more or less unambiguous in the tradition.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">Keown&#39;s shift in interpretation of the 
      facts of the different goals of <EM>samatha</EM> and <EM>vipassanā</EM> is 
      subtle yet extremely important:</FONT> </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">For Griffiths these facts are 
        problematic but in terms of the thesis set out here they are not. 
        Indeed, they are exactly as we should expect. Griffiths&#39;s difficulty 
        arises from the suppressed premise of his argument that the unique 
        soteriological objective of Buddhism is knowledge (<EM>paññā</EM>). Any 
        soteriological technique which does not issue in <EM>paññā </EM>is 
        therefore redundant and its experience puzzling. If <EM>nibbana</EM> is 
        defined exclusively in terms of <EM>paññā </EM>then <EM>vipassanā</EM> 
        will quite naturally appear to be essential while <EM>samatha</EM> 
        remains a curious anomaly (Keown, p. 77).</FONT></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">For Keown, reaching the soteriological 
      goal of Buddhism <EM>requires </EM>both knowledge and moral virtue, so it 
      makes sense there exist meditation techniques to address each of these 
      needs. Griffiths and those like him who view <EM>paññā </EM>as the unique 
      goal of Buddhist meditation techniques will of course be confused by the 
      presence of a technique that cultivates anything else.<A NAME="a6"></A>(<A HREF="#n6">6</A>)</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">Keown explains that a mistranslation of
      <EM>paññā </EM>has encouraged this misinterpretation. He says, &quot;<EM>Paññā
      </EM>is essentially the knowledge of facts, but wisdom means something 
      more than just knowledge&quot; (Keown, p. 80). <EM>Paññā </EM>is knowledge in 
      the sense of knowing <EM>that</EM> 7 + 5 = 12, all <EM>dharmas</EM> are 
      momentary, etc. It is the knowledge of facts about the universe. This type 
      of knowledge is vitally important for Buddhism; the lack of it is 
      ignorance, which is one cause of suffering. However, it is not the <EM>
      only</EM> cause, and neither is <EM>paññā </EM>the only cure:</FONT> </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">The goal of the Eightfold Path is 
        indeed wisdom, but wisdom is much more than <EM>paññā</EM>. This is why 
        two meditative techniques are required for the eradication of the roots

        which is <EM>nibbana</EM> (Keown, p. 80).</FONT> </P>

      enlightenment are themselves twofold, both moral <EM>and</EM> 
      intellectual&quot; (Keown, p. 79). It is the twofold nature of the causes of 
      the disease and the complimentary twofold cure that Griffiths does not see 
      in his interpretation.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">How does this relate to Keown&#39;s first 
      subthesis in this chapter that <EM>citta</EM> (mind, psyche) includes both 
      rational (<EM>saññā</EM>) and emotional (<EM>vedanā</EM>) elements? The 
      rational and emotional aspects of the psyche &quot;may be logically 
      distinguished but do not correspond to any real division in the structure 
      of the human subject&quot; (Keown, p. 67). Although the rational and emotional 
      elements are both part of the psyche, they are different processes and 
      each has its own virtue:</FONT> </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">The virtue of the cognitive aspect (<EM>saññā</EM>) 
        is to understand and discriminate correctly; its vice is delusion and 
        error. The virtue of the nonrational part of the psyche is to sense, 
        feel, and respond affectively in an appropriate manner; its vice is to 
        swing to the extremes of craving (<EM>rāga</EM>) and aversion (<EM>dosa</EM>) 
        (Keown, p. 67).</FONT> </P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">This makes it clear that if the psyche 
      consists of two elements with their own virtues, and if the goal of 
      meditation is to cultivate virtues of the psyche, then there must be 
      techniques capable of cultivating these different kinds of virtues. 
      Whereas Griffiths and other <EM>samatha</EM>-inessentialist scholars seem 
      to feel that the development of <EM>paññā </EM>automatically leads to the 
      development of morality, Keown feels that morality requires its own 
      cultivation separate from the cultivation of <EM>paññā</EM>.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">Keown stresses the moral aspects of <EM>
      samatha</EM> more than the strictly enstatic aspects and in fact 
      conscripts the enstatic into moral cultivation. He says that the 
      &quot;technique of <EM>samatha</EM> meditation exists to enrich and deepen the 
      capacity for human sympathy which exists in all to some degree and which 
      reached its perfection in the personality of the Buddha&quot; (Keown, p. 77).</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">In his third subtheses of the chapter, 
      Keown argues that the Buddha is portrayed as displaying a noncognitive, 
      nonrational moral sentiment that becomes the example for all Buddhists. 
      Keown explains it succinctly: &quot;The Buddha&#39;s moral concern is found in his 
      sympathy (<EM>anukampā</EM>)<A NAME="a7"></A>(<A HREF="#n7">7</A>) for all 
      beings&quot; (Keown, p. 73). Since this moral sentiment is noncognitive, <EM>
      vipassanā</EM> meditation (being the realm of the cognitive) is ill suited 
      to the task of its development. We must turn to a kind of meditation that 
      deals with the noncognitive: <EM>samatha-bhāvanā</EM>.</FONT> </P>

        deeper layers of consciousness and restructuring them in accordance with 
        virtue rather than vice&quot; (Keown, p. 78).</FONT> </P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">On this reading, <EM>samatha</EM> 
      techniques are the means by which the psyche is restructured to have the 
      proper affective state, namely the kind of noncognitive moral concern 
      epitomized by the Buddha. But <EM>how</EM> is this done? Keown cites De 
      Silva as saying that this restructuring can take place by entering the 
      third <EM>jhāna</EM>. De Silva himself is not extremely helpful here 
      either: &quot;Knowledge of this stream of consciousness with a conscious and 
      unconscious component is only within the reach of those who develop the 
      practice of meditation ... when a person enters into the third stage of 
      meditation such knowledge is accessible&quot; (De Silva, p. 76). Keown says 
      that a practitioner in the first <EM>jhāna</EM> can suppress and dissolve 
      the negative tendencies of <EM>rāga </EM>and <EM>dosa</EM>—a process that 
      not only frees the practitioner from the negative qualities but also

        perfect illumination; both techniques are slow and gradual but each is

      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">Whatever it is that meditators must do 
      to cultivate moral concern, it will take some time—perhaps even many

      by the majority of Theravādins.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">The cultivation of moral concern is 
      important because &quot;the fundamental inspiration for the Buddhist moral life 
      is concern for others ... it is a non-rational sentiment which <EM>
      precedes</EM> the formulation of moral objectives&quot; (Keown, p. 74). Without 
      this concern there can be no morality, and without morality there can be 
      no nirvana. The link between moral perfection and nirvana is vital to 
      Keown&#39;s thesis because it is the fact that moral perfection can only be 
      realized through <EM>samatha</EM> meditation that gives us a reason to 
      assign an essential importance to <EM>samatha</EM> within Buddhist 
      soteriology.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">As Keown&#39;s theory stands, its greatest 
      merit is a tremendous explanatory power about how it is that there are two 
      seemingly independent and contradictory meditation techniques within one 
      tradition. It provides us with a resolution to Griffiths&#39;s tension and 
      gives us a reason to think that the Buddhist philosophers and 
      practitioners throughout the ages had good reason to incorporate both <EM>
      samatha</EM> and <EM>vipassanā</EM> techniques into their work.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">Given these merits we still must ask 
      whether Keown&#39;s brief suggestions about how it is that <EM>samatha</EM> 
      cultivates moral concern give us enough reasons to endorse his thesis and 
      discount that of Griffiths. It is my feeling that they do not. We are 
      still left with unanswered questions. For instance, if this picture is 
      accurate, why is there so much tension and confusion among scholars of 
      Buddhism? Keown seems to have an internalist theory of motivation, meaning 
      that reasons for moral action are dependent—at least in part—on the moral 
      agent&#39;s affective states. However, others—particularly <EM>samatha</EM>-inessentialist 
      scholars of the first group above—might maintain that Buddhism generally 
      espouses an externalist theory of motivation, by which I mean that reasons 
      for moral action lie entirely outside the affective states of moral 
      agents.<A NAME="a8"></A>(<A HREF="#n8">8</A>) If Buddhist ethical 
      theorists do in fact generally support an externalist theory, how can 
      Keown be right? Is there enough textual evidence for Keown&#39;s claim to 
      warrant making it a pan-Buddhist (or at least pan-Theravāda) theory? <EM>
      How</EM> exactly do <EM>samatha</EM> techniques cultivate moral concern?</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">It seems to me that the last question is 
      the most preliminary in the sense that we need it to fully understand 
      precisely what Keown&#39;s theory is. If Keown&#39;s thesis about the cultivation 
      of moral concern via <EM>samatha</EM> techniques can be made more 
      plausible, then we have more reason to agree with his picture of the 
      relationship between <EM>vipassanā</EM> and <EM>samatha</EM> in general. 
      At the very least, we shall be in a better position to evaluate the theory 
      by asking the other questions listed above. In section 2, I offer two 
      possible answers to the question: how could <EM>samatha</EM> techniques 
      cultivate moral concern? If one of these answers can be shown to be 
      exegetically responsible and philosophically compelling, then Keown&#39;s 
      theory will be more complete and can be more easily evaluated as a 
      response to the alleged tension of <EM>vipassanā</EM> and <EM>samatha</EM> 
      techniques within the Theravāda tradition.</FONT> </P>
      <H5><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3" COLOR="#800000">2. How Could <EM>
      Samatha</EM> Cultivate Moral Concern? Two Answers</FONT></H5>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">Both of the arguments discussed below 
      are attempts to answer the question of how <EM>samatha</EM> techniques 
      cultivate the type of moral concern Keown has described above. I will 
      evaluate each on two points: exegetical responsibility and philosophical 
      merit. By saying an argument exhibits &quot;exegetical responsibility,&quot; I mean 
      that it represents the Buddhist texts in a more or less accurate way. This 
      is an incredibly complex notion because the Buddhist texts themselves have 
      been taken to contain a great number of meanings. Even the most respectful 
      scholar can become confused in a maze of what often appear to be 
      contradictory ideas between separate texts and even within one text. 
      Rather than enter this embattled hermeneutical arena, I will simply (and a 
      bit arbitrarily) say that exegetical responsibility means the following 
      things:</FONT> </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">1. The argument is grounded somehow in 
        one or more Buddhist texts either verbatim or via analysis,.</FONT> </P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">2. The argument does not patently 
        distort or go against the core ideas of Buddhist philosophy such as the 
        Four Noble Truths, Dependent Origination, etc.</FONT> </P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">In this specific context, by saying an 
      argument has &quot;philosophical merit,&quot; I mean, (1), that it does some work 
      toward solving a philosophical problem; (2), that it is consistent with 
      Keown&#39;s other claims; and (3), that there are compelling philosophical 
      reasons for us to believe it is true. For example, Keown&#39;s thesis as it 
      stands has a great deal of philosophical merit in the first sense in that 
      it could solve the puzzle of how <EM>samatha</EM> and <EM>vipassanā</EM> 
      are related soteriologically. The second sense follows from my overall 
      goal in the essay. If I am presenting this argument as an augmentation of 
      Keown&#39;s general theory in the hope of making one complete and unified 
      theory, it ought to cohere with what he says elsewhere. Whether Keown&#39;s 
      general argument about the place of <EM>samatha</EM> has philosophical 
      merit in the third sense is the question I am attempting to answer in this 
      essay by making it more complete. Whether Keown&#39;s general theory has <EM>
      more</EM> philosophical merit than Griffiths&#39;s thesis is a question I 
      cannot answer here, but I hope the work here will make such a task more 
      profitable in the future.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">In the course of the following sections, 
      I have tried as much as possible to explicitly keep separate the issues of 
      exegesis and philosophy. However, these two areas support and interact 
      with each other in much the same way that Keown argues for the interaction 
      of <EM>samatha</EM> and <EM>vipassanā</EM>. I see no shame in this; in 
      fact, the interaction of exegesis and philosophy is something I take to be 
      the proper method of Buddhist philosophy.</FONT> </P>

        samatha</EM> meditation, then humans will increasingly exist in their 
        natural state, i.e., they will exhibit noncognitive moral concern. (by 
        3, 4)</FONT> </P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">First, I should make a note on the use 
      of the word &quot;increasingly&quot; in premises three and four. This is meant to 
      capture the gradual developmental nature of meditation techniques. 
      Presumably, when one masters the techniques completely, one will enjoy the 
      full fruit of the technique. In this case, to master <EM>samatha</EM> 
      techniques would mean that one exists totally within human nature and 
      completely exhibits noncognitive moral concern.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">The most important exegetical question 
      here is this: Do Buddhist texts explain what human nature is, and if so, 
      what is it? Many texts say that human beings exist in a soteriologically 
      profitable middle state between the gods and animals. Humans both know 
      enough suffering to be motivated to practice Buddhism (unlike the gods) 
      and are capable of making the changes prescribed by the Buddha (unlike 
      animals). In the <EM>Sakkapanha Sutta</EM>, for instance, a god tells the 
      Buddha that he will happily seek a human existence in the next life so 
      that he can practice the Buddha&#39;s teachings (DN, 21.2.8). Given this 
      conception we could perhaps say that human nature is to be able to 
      practice Buddhism. This is not particularly helpful to the human nature 
      argument. At best, it simply tells us that human nature is to be able to 
      practice <EM>samatha</EM>. It does not give us premise one.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">It seems even more doubtful that the 
      No-Self (<EM>anatta</EM>) doctrine can help here. Does the theory of the 
      five aggregates or the lack of a substantial self tell us whether humans 
      have a natural propensity toward moral concern? <EM>Anatta</EM> might 
      allow us to say that the grasping for self is what obscures our true 
      nature. But does this indicate that our nature is one that includes moral 
      concern? The five aggregates <EM>(khandhas</EM>) do not help us determine 
      whether humans are naturally disposed to soteriologically profitable moral 
      concern any more than the axles and wheels of King Milinda&#39;s chariot help 
      him determine what is the essence of the chariot (<EM>Miln. </EM>2.1.1).</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">My own understanding of Buddhist texts 
      does not seem to indicate any theory of human nature that can address the 
      exegetical responsibility of this argument. Perhaps such evidence can be 
      found, but for now I must leave the matter undetermined.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">Moving to the first sense of 
      philosophical merit, the human nature argument seems incredibly useful, on 
      first glance, in explaining how it is that <EM>samatha </EM>techniques 
      cultivate moral concern. However, the argument does not make clear exactly 
      what it is that the meditator does to remove vices; it is only slightly 
      more specific than Keown&#39;s original description. If I am looking for 
      something to make Keown&#39;s argument more complete, then this argument is 
      not satisfying.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">In my second sense of philosophical 
      merit, the human nature argument is attractive as a supplement to what 
      Keown says because he writes about human nature on a number of occasions 
      in his chapter on ethics and psychology. There is even a section entitled 
      &quot;The Buddhist View of Human Nature&quot; in the section of the chapter on moral 
      and intellectual virtue (Keown, p. 66-68). The statement that most evokes 
      premise one of this argument is: &quot;The malfunction of <EM>vedanā</EM> 
      [feeling] and <EM>saññā </EM>[cognition], which is <EM>taṇhā</EM> 
      [craving], is the basic soteriological problem of Buddhism&quot; (Keown, p. 
      67). It would seem that if feeling and cognition are malfunctioning, then 
      they are aberrant from their natural state. For instance, if I say my car 
      is malfunctioning, I mean that it is not in its natural working state. The 
      natural working state of feeling and cognition is exemplified by the 
      enlightened Buddha.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">Moving to my third sense of 
      philosophical merit we might ask this question: Just what do we <EM>mean</EM> 
      by &quot;natural state&quot;? Can &quot;natural state&quot; be taken to mean &quot;the usual, 
      normal state&quot;? Nyanamoli&#39;s translation of Buddhaghosa seems to hint at 
      this definition: &quot;But in the world the nature of such and such beings is 
      called their &#39;habit (<EM>sīla</EM>)&#39;, of which they say &#39;This one is of 
      happy habit (<EM>sukkha-sīla</EM>), this one is of unhappy habit, this one 
      is of quarrelsome habit, this one is of dandified habit&#39;&quot; (<EM>Vism.</EM>, 
      1.38).<A NAME="a9"></A>(<A HREF="#n9">9</A>) There seems to be something 
      extremely odd about describing a state instantiated only by fully 
      enlightened beings as &quot;natural&quot; in the sense of &quot;natural&quot; as &quot;usual&quot; or 
      &quot;habitual.&quot; There are a great many more unenlightened beings than 
      enlightened ones—that is the problem.<A NAME="a10"></A>(<A HREF="#n10">10</A>)</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">Perhaps by &quot;natural state,&quot; we mean 
      something like &quot;working properly,&quot; or &quot;working with least resistance.&quot; 
      Certainly it is the case that the Buddha provides a model of working both 
      properly and with the least resistance. After all, could we not describe
      <EM>dukkha</EM> as a kind of resistance? Given this definition, premise 
      two above makes sense as well. It is unwholesome vices such as greed and 
      hatred that obscure our natural state. By removing these vices, we will no 
      longer face resistance to working properly.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">The problem here is that it is unclear 
      whether the simple removing of vices will automatically lead to the 
      cultivation of virtues. If moral virtues are affective states, we can 
      assume that they have something to do with feeling (<EM>vedanā</EM>). 
      Could there simply be neutral feelings after the removal of resistance to 
      virtues? Buddhist texts indicate that there are neutral feelings: &quot;There 
      are three kinds of feeling: pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and 
      neither-painful-nor-pleasant-feeling&quot; (MN, 44.22). Just because the 
      resistance to virtues is gone does not necessarily mean that virtues will 
      arise.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">The proponent of the human nature 
      argument might simply say that virtues will arise because they are what 
      happen in our natural state. But then there is another problem that speaks 
      to my second sense of exegetical responsibility, namely, the problem of 
      causation. In Buddhism, causality is often formulated in the form of 
      Dependent Origination (<EM>paṭicca-samuppāda</EM>): &quot;When this exists, 
      that comes to be; with the arising of this, that arises. When this does 
      not exist, that does not come to be; with the cessation of this, that 
      ceases&quot; (MN, 79.7). The human nature argument is mixing the two halves of 
      Dependent Origination. The cause of vice may cease, leading to the 
      cessation of vice; but for virtue to arise, the cause of virtue must 
      arise. Keown argues that the cause of virtue is moral concern.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">The human nature argument seems to say 
      that the cessation of vice will bring the arising of virtue. Of course, 
      there could be another step here. Our natural moral concern is always 
      trying to shine through the artifice of vice, but it is only when the 
      blinds are opened that we can see through the window. Perhaps there is a 
      latent moral concern waiting for the chance to escape. But where are the 
      causes of these latent causes? Perhaps these causes could be considered as 
      the ripening of karma from past lives.<A NAME="a11"></A>(<A HREF="#n11">11</A>) 
      In that case, some people would presumably have more moral concern coming 
      to them than others. This may be true to some extent; however, the 
      Buddhist texts explicitly discuss the cultivation of virtue as something 
      available to any human willing to undergo the practices. Karma could 
      explain why the practice is easier for some than others: some of us have 
      progressed toward a more natural state in previous lives and thus find it 
      easier to remove the vices that cover our natural virtues.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">I believe this shows that the human 
      nature argument is not incompatible with Buddhist causality. However, for 
      the sake of philosophical elegance, it would be better to subscribe to an 
      argument that does not require so much theoretical work to be in tune with 
      Dependent Origination.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">I have not been able to show that the 
      human nature argument is satisfactory in the first sense of exegetical 
      responsibility and it is problematic in the second. I found no textual 
      basis for premise one, and the argument has some initial, but not 
      insoluble, problems in aligning itself with Dependent Origination.</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">Philosophically, the human nature 
      argument offers a solution with enough explanatory power to solve our 
      problem (sense one). It seems to be consistent on its own terms and can be 
      seen to fit with Keown&#39;s statements on human nature (sense two). However,

      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">Beginning with the first sense of 
      exegesis, there is no difficulty finding the Divine Abidings (<EM>brahma-vihāra</EM>) 
      in Buddhist texts. These practices are explicitly mentioned many times in 
      the <EM>Nikāyas</EM> (for instance, MN, 55.6 and 83.6, and DN, 13.76). 
      Chapter nine of the <EM>Visuddhimagga</EM> is devoted exclusively to the 
      practice of the Divine Abidings. Buddhaghosa says that the Divine Abidings 
      are &quot;loving kindness, compassion, gladness and equanimity&quot; (<EM>Vism.</EM>, 
      9.1). In Pali, these are respectively, <EM>mettā</EM>, <EM>karuṇā</EM>,
      <EM>muditā</EM>, and <EM>upekkha</EM>. They are called <EM>brahma-vihāra</EM> 
      because &quot;these abidings are the best in being the right attitude towards 
      beings. And just as <EM>Brahma</EM> Gods abide with immaculate minds, so 
      the meditators who associate themselves with these abidings abide on an 
      equal footing with <EM>Brahma </EM>Gods&quot; (<EM>Vism.</EM> 9.106).</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">Chapter nine of <EM>Visuddhimagga</EM> 
      consists entirely of Buddhaghosa&#39;s intricate meditation instructions for 
      the Divine Abidings. I will only briefly summarize them here. As all four 
      Divine Abidings follow a similar basic model, I will mainly discuss the 
      process of <EM>mettā </EM>cultivation. The four Divine Abidings are meant 
      to be practiced in the order in which they have been listed, e.g., after 
      one has sufficiently developed loving kindness, one moves on to compassion 
      and so forth.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">The meditator should begin with loving 
      kindness, concentrating on a human subject. The proper choice for the 
      first subject is explained: &quot;loving kindness should not be developed at 
      first towards the following four kinds of persons: an antipathetic person, 
      a very dearly loved friend, a neutral person, and a hostile person. Also 
      it should not be developed specifically toward the opposite sex, or toward 
      a dead person&quot; (<EM>Vism.</EM> 9.4).<A NAME="a12"></A>(<A HREF="#n12">12</A>)</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">The proper first subject is one&#39;s self, 
      as Buddhaghosa explains: &quot;First of all is should be developed only towards 
      oneself, doing it repeatedly thus: &#39;May I be happy and free from 
      suffering&#39; or &#39;May I keep myself free from enmity, affliction and anxiety 
      and live happily&#39;&quot; (<EM>Vism.</EM> 9.8).</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">After this process causes practitioners 
      to fill themselves with loving kindness, they should move on to a teacher 
      or similar relation. After that they should develop loving kindness in the 
      following sequence:</FONT> </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">He should next after that, develop 
        loving kindness towards a very dearly loved friend, then towards a 
        neutral person as a very dearly loved friend, then towards a hostile 
        person as neutral. And while he does so, he should make his mind 
        malleable and wieldy in each instance before passing on to the next (<EM>Vism.</EM> 
        9.12).</FONT> </P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">If these techniques are not successful 
      at filling the mind with <EM>mettā </EM>toward all of these subjects, 
      there is advice for several further practices. For example,</FONT> </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">If resentment arises in him when he 
        applies his mind to a hostile person because he remembers wrongs done by 
        that person, he should get rid of the resentment by entering repeatedly 
        into loving kindness (<EM>jhāna</EM>) towards any of the first-mentioned 
        persons and then, after he has emerged each time, directing loving 
        kindness towards that person (<EM>Vism.</EM> 9.14).</FONT> </P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">There are other techniques toward the 
      full cultivation of loving kindness as well, such as use of the Buddha&#39;s
      <EM>Jataka</EM> stories as moral examples (<EM>Vism.</EM> 9.26-35). Also, 
      there is the realization that, due to the infinity of previous rebirths, 
      everyone has been everyone&#39;s mother, brother, sister, etc. in the past (<EM>Vism.

      immeasurable, without hostility and without ill will&quot; (DN, 40.9). These 
      quotes show that premise one has textual basis by establishing that the

      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">Keown indicates that the main vices are 
      hatred and greed (Keown, p. 64-65). Greed is specifically mentioned as 
      wholly incompatible with the Divine Abiding of equanimity. Hatred, as 
      either the same or a close relative of anger and cruelty, can be done away 
      with probably either with loving kindness, compassion, or both.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">Is there any evidence for premise five? 
      Perhaps the same passage from the <EM>Dīgha Nikāya</EM> used above will 
      work: &quot;he abides with loving-kindness, abundant, exalted, immeasurable, 
      without hostility and without ill will&quot; (DN, 40.9). If one is &quot;abundant&quot; 
      and &quot;immeasurable&quot; in one&#39;s abiding in loving kindness, it would seem to 
      be the case that one would also have at least a tendency toward sympathy 
      or moral concern. Perhaps this can work. However, the texts are not 
      particularly helpful here so I will address this question as a matter of 
      philosophical concern later in this section.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">Before moving on to philosophical 
      considerations, I should say a word about the second sense of exegetical 
      responsibility in regard to Dependent Origination. The Divine Abidings 
      argument gives us an account of the arising of virtue (premise one), 
      passing away of vice (premise two), and the arising of moral concern 
      (premise five). In this way it is superior to the human nature argument 
      because it is a better expression of Dependent Origination and requires 
      none of the theoretical work needed to reconcile the human nature argument 
      with Buddhist causality.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">In terms of my first sense of 
      philosophical merit, the Divine Abidings argument presents us with a 
      theory that gives us a detailed account of how moral concern can be 
      cultivated by <EM>samatha</EM> meditation. Not only does it have more 
      explanatory power than the human nature thesis, but it does this 
      explaining in greater detail.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">The Divine Abidings argument is superior 
      in the second sense as well. In fact, Keown specifically mentions the 
      Divine Abidings in the context of his subthesis on the Buddha&#39;s moral 
      concern. It appears, conveniently enough, in a section entitled &quot;The 
      Cultivation of Moral Concern&quot;:</FONT> </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">The states or dispositions cultivated 
        through the Divine Abidings in <EM>samatha</EM> meditation also occur in 
        waking consciousness in the course of daily life—they are not exclusive 
        to meditation or to the meditator. The technique of transic meditation (<EM>jhāna</EM>), 
        however, is a powerful device for accelerating their cultivation and 
        pervasion of the psyche (Keown, p. 76).</FONT> </P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">It may be objected here that, because 
      Keown already connected the Divine Abidings with the cultivation of moral 
      concern, that the Divine Abidings argument is neither original, nor 
      particularly illuminating. My response is that Keown may have mentioned 
      the Divine Abidings as an example of the cultivation of moral concern, but 
      he did not take this connection far enough. He certainly did not make an 
      argument as precise as the Divine Abidings argument, nor did he argue for 
      it as thoroughly. He also did not mention the Divine Abidings in the 
      context of his disagreement with Griffiths. The Divine Abidings argument 
      is what I would like to think Keown <EM>should</EM> have said in this 
      context.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">The most substantive philosophical issue 
      for the Divine Abidings argument is whether the cultivation of <EM>mettā
      </EM>can be said to bring about <EM>anukampā</EM> (sympathy, moral 
      concern) when <EM>anukampā</EM> is supposed to be the fundamental level of
      <EM>mettā</EM>. This would seem to be circular—how can <EM>anukampā</EM> 
      both cause <EM>mettā </EM>and be caused by it?</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">Let me begin with an examination of the 
      word &quot;<EM>anukampā</EM>&quot;:</FONT> </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">Etymologically, &quot;sympathy&quot; (<EM>anukampā</EM>) 
        can be understood as the condition of &quot;being moved&quot; (<EM>kampa</EM>) &quot;in 
        accordance with [others],&quot; or &quot;in response to [others]&quot; (<EM>anu</EM>)... 
        there are definitions in the commentaries—&quot;the preliminary level of 
        love&quot; (<EM>mettāyapubbabhāga</EM>)... Similarly it is said to be 
        synonymous with &quot;tender care&quot; (<EM>anuddaya</EM>) ... and &quot;simple 
        compassion&quot; (<EM>kāruñña</EM>) (Aronson in Keown, p. 73).</FONT> </P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">Strictly on the basis of this etymology, 
      it would seem that there is no reason to wonder how sympathy can be 
      cultivated by <EM>mettā</EM> and <EM>karuṇā</EM>. Buddhaghosa gives an 
      etymology of <EM>mettā </EM>as being related to the word &quot;<EM>mitta</EM>&quot; 
      (friend) as in &quot;with respect to a friend&quot; or &quot;behavior towards a friend&quot; (<EM>Vism.
      </EM>9.92). Of <EM>karuṇā </EM>the following etymology is given: &quot;When 
      there is suffering in others it causes (<EM>karoti</EM>) good people&#39;s 
      hearts to be moved (<EM>kampana</EM>), thus it is compassion (<EM>karuṇā</EM>)&quot; 
      (<EM>Vism.</EM> 9.92).<A NAME="a13"></A>(<A HREF="#n13">13</A>) If the 
      mind is filled with loving kindness and compassion, for instance, loving 
      kindness would seem to cause one to be moved in accordance with others (as 
      in friendship) and compassion would seem to cause one to be moved in 
      response to others (particularly if they are suffering). Similarly, 
      &quot;tender care&quot; could be taken as an instance of friendliness brought about 
      by <EM>mettā</EM>. This covers the first two parts and the last part of 
      the above etymology of </FONT><EM><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">anukampā.</FONT>
      </P>
      <P></EM><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">The problematic parts are &quot;the 
      preliminary level of love&quot; (<EM>mettāyapubbabhāga</EM>) and &quot;simple 
      compassion&quot; (<EM>kāruñña</EM>). It seems that the preliminary level or 
      simple state of something must come before that thing. In the Divine 
      Abidings argument, however, the presence of the Divine Abidings in the 
      psyche is supposed to bring about the &quot;preliminary level of love&quot; and 
      &quot;simple compassion.&quot;</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">The solution is related to two more Pali 
      words: <EM>sīla </EM>and <EM>anusaya</EM>. <EM>Sīla </EM>is usually 
      translated as &quot;morality.&quot; Nyanamoli, however, has translated it as &quot;habit&quot; 
      in <EM>Vism.</EM> 1.38, as quoted in the section on the human nature 
      argument. If the Divine Abidings techniques cause <EM>mettā </EM>to become 
      an entrenched habit of a person, then that person will have the tendency 
      to treat everyone in a friendly manner. The consequent of the previous 
      conditional is indicative of the dispositional nature of <EM>anukampā</EM>. 
      To have sympathy and moral concern is to be disposed to treat beings with 
      a certain correct attitude—an attitude that having a mind filled with <EM>
      mettā </EM>promotes. This same basic strategy can be applied to habits 
      created by <EM>karuṇā </EM>meditation for fostering the habits that bring 
      about simple compassion.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">It may be objected that this move relies 
      too closely on etymology. Because some translators occasionally see fit to 
      translate <EM>sīla,</EM> as &quot;habit&quot; does not necessarily make it the case 
      that morality and habit are somehow related in terms of Buddhist 
      meditation practices. Secondly, it does not give us a specific enough 
      account of this process. These objections can be answered by giving 
      another account with enough specific meditation connections to satisfy 
      both objections.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3"><EM>Anusaya</EM> means &quot;dormant or 
      latent disposition,&quot; according to Padmasiri De Silva.<A NAME="a14"></A>(<A HREF="#n14">14</A>) 
      Of these he says, &quot;They are basically dormant passions which become 
      excited into activity by suitable stimuli&quot; (De Silva, p. 73). It could be 
      that the Divine Abiding of <EM>mettā </EM>creates a disposition (<EM>anusaya</EM>) 
      to act with <EM>anukampā</EM> when the appropriate stimuli arise outside 
      of the meditation. Then, <EM>anukampā</EM> gives rise to <EM>mettā </EM>in 
      nonmeditative contexts. For example, say I practice a <EM>mettā </EM>
      Divine Abiding on Tuesday afternoon. This creates a latent disposition for 
      moral concern to give rise to <EM>mettā</EM>, say when my sister needs my 
      help with painting her house on Friday.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">But where is this disposition? Perhaps 
      it is a causal continuum in my consciousness. Surely, if there can be 
      causal continuums across lifetimes, there can be causal continuums from my 
      meditation on Tuesday to the house painting on Friday.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">This analysis of the psychological 
      disposition also helps solve another problem: the problem of how it is 
      that absorptions within the Divine Abidings can break through to our 
      normal daily lives—the parts of our lives where morality really matters. 
      By practicing the Divine Abidings, I can change my habits and dispositions 
      in my nonmeditative life. Perhaps this is what Robert M. Gimello means 
      when he says: &quot;The mystical experience affects the moral life, Buddhists 
      believe, and they therefore take the greatest pains in their meditative 
      disciplines to see to it that its effect is the proper, just, and 
      compassionate one&quot; (Gimello, p. 194).</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">As should be obvious at this point, I 
      find the Divine Abidings argument eminently preferable to the human nature 
      argument. It is more exegetically responsible, both in being close to the 
      texts and agreeing easily with Dependent Origination. It has more 
      philosophical merit in these ways: (1), It offers more explanatory power 
      and more details; (2), it agrees with Keown and is what, in my opinion, he
      <EM>should </EM>have said; and (3), the initially problematic premise five 
      can be shown to be philosophically plausible given the notions of moral 
      habits and of latent dispositions.</FONT> </P>

      Abidings argument gives us any reason to accept Keown&#39;s larger thesis that 
      Buddhist ethics can be characterized as virtue ethics. Now that a fuller 
      version of Keown&#39;s theory can be established with the help of the Divine 
      Abidings argument, I would imagine these questions can more easily be 
      answered by scholars advocating the equal importance of <EM>samatha</EM> 
      and <EM>vipassanā</EM>.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3">My hope is that the Divine Abidings 
      argument will make Keown&#39;s thesis more complete and more plausible. It now 
      has the ability (or at least the latent tendencies) it needs to be 
      evaluated in context of the larger debate on the role of <EM>
      samatha-bhāvanā</EM> in Buddhist soteriology. To anyone willing to take up 
      this task, I offer this essay as an embodiment of my <EM>mettā </EM>and
      <EM>karuṇā</EM>.</FONT> </P>

      extensively with Mahāyāna in addition to Theravāda, but his respect for 
      Theravāda can be seen in the following quote about Buddhaghosa&#39;s <EM>
      Visuddhimagga:</EM> &quot;he has composed one of the great spiritual classics 
      of mankind. If I had to choose just one book to take with me on a desert 
      island, this would be my choice,—with perhaps a Horace tucked away out of 
      sight in my pocket&quot; (Conze, p. 25). <A HREF="#a3">Return to text.</A>

      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3"><A NAME="n5"></A>(5) Whether the 
      establishment of this level of importance for Buddhist morality would 
      indeed point to the success of Keown&#39;s contention that Buddhist ethics can 
      be characterized as a virtue ethic is an issue I will not address in this

      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3"><A NAME="n6"></A>(6) Gunaratna seems to

      ignorance (<EM>avijja</EM>) the key to liberation, for Buddhism, is found 
      in wisdom (<EM>paññā</EM>)&quot; (Gunaratna, p. 3). <A HREF="#a6">Return to

      is the term Keown uses for &quot;moral concern&quot; as well. It will receive more

      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3"><A NAME="n8"></A>(8) In mapping these 
      debates onto Western philosophy, Keown is closer to philosophers such as 
      Aristotle or Hume and the externalists are more akin to Plato or Kant.

      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3"><A NAME="n9"></A>(9) It would seem that 
      his translation of <EM>sīla</EM> as &quot;habit&quot; is taken in a different sense 
      than the other rendering as &quot;morality.&quot; Interestingly, the relationship 
      between morality and habits would probably please Keown greatly given his 
      characterization of Buddhist ethics as related more closely to Aristotle&#39;s 
      Virtue Ethic than to other Western theories. <A HREF="#a9">Return to text.</A>
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3"><A NAME="n10"></A>(10) Of course, some 
      Mahāyāna schools could perhaps answer this objection by saying that all 
      beings have Buddha Nature and already are enlightened in some sense. This 
      option, unfortunately, is not available in Theravāda. <A HREF="#a10">

      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3"><A NAME="n11"></A>(11) De Silva says 
      that the word <EM>anusaya</EM> can be translated as &quot;dormant or latent 
      disposition&quot; and &quot;The Buddha would consider dormant learnings as 
      persistent traits coming down innumerable lives&quot; (De Silva, p. 74).

      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3"><A NAME="n12"></A>(12) There are various 
      reasons for these exclusions. For instance, development toward a neutral 
      person is &quot;fatiguing,&quot; toward a hostile person it causes anger, and toward 
      the opposite sex it causes lust (<EM>Vism.</EM> 9.5-6). <A HREF="#a12">

      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3"><A NAME="n13"></A>(13) On the basis of 
      this etymology it would also seem that <EM>anukampā</EM> and <EM>karuṇā</EM> 
      are etymologically related. <A HREF="#a13">Return to text.</A> </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3"><A NAME="n14"></A>(14) De Silva intends

      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3"><A NAME="n15"></A>(15) I imagine the

      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="3"><A NAME="n16"></A>(16) My wild

      moral concern, the formless <EM>jhānas</EM> come in to root out the 
      affective causes of <EM>saṃkhāras</EM> (complexes) that are responsible
