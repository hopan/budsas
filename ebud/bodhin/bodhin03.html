      the Rains Retreat 1977)</p>

      <p>S</font>ometimes, when a fruit tree is in bloom, a breeze stirs and 
      scatters blossoms to the ground. Some buds remain and grow into small 
      green fruit. A wind blows and some of them, too, fall! Still others may 
      become fruit nearly ripe, or some even fully ripe, before they fall.</p>
      <p>And so it is with people. Like flowers and fruit in the wind they, too,
      <i>fall </i>in different stages of life. Some people die while still in 
      the womb, others within only a few days after birth. Some people live for 
      a few years then die, never having reached maturity. Men and women die in 
      their youth. Still others reach a ripe old age before they die.</p>
      <p>When reflecting upon people, consider the nature of fruit in the wind: 
      both are very uncertain.</p>
      <p>This uncertain nature of things can also be seen in the monastic life. 
      Some people come to the monastery intending to ordain but change their 
      minds and leave, some with heads already shaved. Others are already 
      novices, then they decide to leave. Some ordain for only one Rains Retreat 
      then disrobe. Just like fruit in the wind -- all very uncertain!</p>
      <p>Our minds are also similar. A mental impression arises, draws and pulls 
      at the mind, then the mind <i>falls -- </i>just like<i> </i>fruit.</p>
      <p>The Buddha understood this uncertain nature of things, He observed the 
      phenomenon of fruit in the wind and reflected upon the monks and novices 
      who were his disciples. He found that they, too, were essentially of the 
      same nature -- uncertain! </p>
      <p>How could it be otherwise? This is just the way of all things. </p>
      <p>Thus, for one who is practising with awareness it isn’t necessary to 
      have someone to advise and teach all that much to be able to see and 
      understand. An example is the case of the Buddha who, in a previous life, 
      was King Chanokomun. He didn't need to study very much. All he had to do 
      was observe a mango tree.</p>
      <p>One day, while visiting a park with his retinue of ministers, from atop 
      his elephant, he spied some mango trees heavily laden with ripe fruit. Not 
      being able to stop at that time, he determined in his mind to return later 
      to partake of some. Little did he know, however, that his ministers, 
      coming along behind, would greedily gather them all up; that they would 
      use poles to knock them down, beating and breaking the branches and 
      tearing and scattering the leaves.</p>
      <p>Returning in the evening to the mango grove, the king, already 
      imagining in his mind the delicious taste of the mangoes suddenly 
      discovered that they were all gone, completely finished! And not only 
      that, but the branches and leaves had been thoroughly thrashed and 
      scattered.</p>
      <p>The king, quite disappointed and upset, then notice another mango tree 
      nearby with its leaves and branches still intact. He wondered why. He then 
      realized it was because that tree had no fruit. If a tree has no fruit 
      nobody disturbs it and so its leaves and branches are not damaged. This 
      lesson kept him absorbed in thought all the way back to the palace: &quot;It is 
      unpleasant, troublesome and difficult to be a king. It requires constant 
      concern for all his subjects. What if there are attempts to attack, 
      plunder and seize parts of his kingdom?&quot; He could not rest peacefully; 
      even in his sleep he was disturbed by dreams.</p>
      <p>He saw in his mind, once again, the mango tree without fruit and its 
      undamaged leaves and branches. &quot;If we become similar to that mango tree,&quot; 
      he though, &quot;our leaves and branches, too, would not be damaged.&quot;</p>
      <p>In his chamber he sat and meditated. Finally, he decided to ordain as a 
      monk, having been inspired by this lesson of the mango tree. He compared 
      himself to that mango tree and concluded that if one didn't become 
      involved in the ways of the world, one would be truly independent, free 
      from worries or difficulties. The mind would be untroubled. Reflecting 
      thus, he ordained.</p>
      <p>From then on, wherever he went, when asked who his teacher was, he 
      would answer, &quot;A mango tree.&quot; He didn't need to receive teaching all that 
      much. A mango tree was the cause of his awakening to the Opanayiko-Dhamma, 
      the teaching leading inwards. And with this awakening, he became a monk, 
      one who has few concerns, is content with little, and who delights in 
      solitude. His royal status given up, his mind was finally at peace.</p>
      <p>In this story the Buddha was a Bodhisatta who developed his practice in 
      this way continuously. Like the Buddha as King Chanokomun, we, too, should 
      look around us and be observant because everything in the world<i> </i>is 
      ready to teach us.</p>
      <p>With even a little intuitive wisdom, we will then be able to see 
      clearly through the ways of the world. We will come to understand that 
      everything in the world is a teacher. Trees and vines, for example, can 
      all reveal the true nature of reality. With wisdom there is no need to 
      question anyone, no need to study. We can learn from Nature enough to be 
      enlightened, as in the story of King Chanokomun, because everything 
      follows the way of Truth. It does not diverge from Truth.</p>
      <p>Associated with wisdom are self-composure and restraint which, in turn, 
      can lead to further insight into the way of Nature. In this way, we will 
      come to know the ultimate truth of everything being <b><i>
      &quot;Anicca-Dukkha-Anattà&quot;</i></b> [*]. Take trees, for example; all trees 
      upon the earth are equal, are <i>One </i>, when seen through the reality 
      of &quot;Anicca-Dukkha-Anattà&quot;. First they come into being then grow and 
      mature, constantly changing, until they finally die as every tree must.</p>
      <dir>
        <i>
        <p>[*] Anicca-Dukkha-Anattà: the three characteristics of existence, 
        namely impermanence/unstability, suffering/unsatisfactory and not-self/ 
        impersonnality.</p>
      </dir>
      </i>
      <p>In the same way, people and animals are born, grow and change during 
      their life-times until they eventually die. The multitudinous changes 
      which occur during this transition from birth to death show the Way of 
      Dhamma. That is to say, all things are impermanent, having decay and 
      dissolution as their natural condition.</p>
      <p>If we have awareness and understanding, if we study with wisdom and 
      mindfulness, we will see Dhamma as reality. Thus, we will see people as 
      constantly being born, changing and finally passing away. Everyone is 
      subject to the cycle of birth and death, and because of this, everyone in 
      the universe is as <i>One </i>being. Thus, seeing one person clearly and 
      distinctly is the same as seeing every person in the world.</p>
      <p>In the same way, everything is Dhamma. Not only the things we see with 
      our physical eye, but also the things we see in our minds. A thought 
      arises, then changes and passes away. It is &quot;Nàma Dhamma&quot;, simply a mental 
      impression that arises and passes away. This is the real nature of the 
      mind. Altogether, this is the Noble Truth of Dhamma. If one doesn't look 
      and observe in this way, one doesn't really <i>see! </i>If one does see, 
      one will have the wisdom to listen to the Dhamma as proclaimed by the 
      Buddha.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Where is the Buddha?<br>
        The Buddha is in the Dhamma.<br>
        Where is the Dhamma?<br>
        The Dhamma is in the Buddha.<br>
        Right here, now!<br>
        Where is the Sangha?<br>
        The Sangha is in the Dhamma.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha exist in our minds, but we have 
      to see it clearly. Some people just pick this up casualty saying, &quot;Oh! The 
      Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha exist in my mind.&quot; Yet their own 
      practice is not suitable or appropriate. It is thus not befitting that the 
      Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha should be found in their minds, namely, 
      because the &quot;mind&quot; must first be that mind which knows the Dhamma.</p>
      <p>Bringing everything back to this point of Dhamma, we will come to know 
      that, in the world, Truth does exist, and thus it is possible for us to 
      practise to realize it.</p>
      <p>For instance, &quot;Nàma Dhamma&quot;, feelings, thoughts, imagination, etc.. are 
      all uncertain. When anger arises, it grows and changes and finally 
      disappears. Happiness, too, arises, grows and finally disappears. They are 
      empty. They are not really any &quot;thing&quot;. This is always the way of all 
      things, both mentally and materially. Internally, there are this body and 
      mind. Externally, there are trees, vines and all manner of things which 
      display this universal law of uncertainty.</p>
      <p>Whether a tree, a mountain or an animal, it's all Dhamma, everything is 
      Dhamma. Where is this Dhamma? Speaking simply, that which is not Dhamma 
      doesn't exist. Dhamma is Nature. This is called the &quot;Sacca-Dhamma&quot;, the 
      True Dharnma. If one sees Nature, one sees Dhamma; If one sees Dhamma, one 
      sees Nature. Seeing Nature, one knows the Dhamma.</p>
      <p>And<i> </i>so, what is the use of a lot of study when the ultimate 
      reality of life, in its every moment, in its every act, is just an endless 
      cycle of births and deaths? If we are mindful and clearly aware when in 
      all postures (sitting, standing, walking, lying), then self-knowledge is 
      ready to be born; that is, knowing the truth of Dharnrna already in 
      existence right here and now. At present, the Buddha, the <i>real </i>
      Buddha, is still living for He is the Dharnma itself, the &quot;Sacca-Dharnma&quot;. 
      And &quot;Sacca-Dhamma&quot;, that which enables one to become Buddha, still exists. 
      It hasn't fled anywhere! It gives rise to two Buddhas: one in body and the 
      other in mind.</p>
      <p>&quot;The real Dhamma&quot;, the Buddha told Ànanda, &quot;can only be realized 
      through practice!&quot; Whoever sees Dhamma, sees the Buddha. Whoever sees the 
      Buddha, sees the Dhamma. And how is this? Previously, no Buddha existed; 
      it was only when Siddartha Gotama [*] realized the Dhamrna that he became 
      the Buddha. If we explain it in this way, then He is the same as us. If we 
      realize the Dhamma, then we will likewise be the Buddha. This is called 
      the Buddha in mind or &quot;Nàma-Dhamma&quot;.</p>
      <dir>
        <i>
        <p>[*] Siddartha Gotama: the original name of the historical Buddha. 
        (Buddha, the &quot;one-who-knows', also represents the state of enlightenment 
        or awakening)</p>
      </dir>
      </i>
      <p>We must be mindful of everything we do, for we become the inheritors of 
      our own good or evil actions. In doing good, we reap good. In doing evil, 
      we reap evil. All you have to do is look into your everyday lives to know 
      that this is so. Siddartha Gotama was enlightened to the realization of 
      this Truth, and this gave rise to the appearance of a Buddha in the world. 
      Likewise, if each and every person practises to attain to this Truth, then 
      they, too, will change to be Buddha.</p>
      <p>Thus, the Buddha still exists. Some people are very happy saying, &quot;If 
      the Buddha still exists, then I can practise Dhamma!&quot; That is how you 
      should see it.</p>
      <p>The Dhamma that the Buddha realized is the Dhamma which exists 
      permanently in the world. It can be compared to ground water which 
      permanently exists in the ground. When a person wishes to dig a well, he 
      must dig down deep enough to reach the ground water. The ground water is 
      already there. He does not create the water, he just discovers it. 
      Similarly, the Buddha did not invent the Dhamma, did not decree the 
      Dhamma. He merely revealed what was already there. Through contemplation, 
      the Buddha <i>saw </i>the Dhamma. Therefore, it is said that the Buddha 
      was Enlightened, for Enlightenment is knowing the Dhamma. The Dhamma is 
      the Truth of this world. Seeing this, Siddartha Gotama is called &quot;The 
      Buddha&quot;. And the Dhamma is that which allows other people to become a 
      Buddha, &quot;One-who-knows&quot;, one who knows Dhamma.</p>
      <p>If beings have good conduct and are loyal to the Buddha-Dhamma, then 
      those beings will never be short of virtue and goodness. With 
      understanding, we will see that we are really not far from the Buddha, but 
      sitting face to face with Him. When we understand the Dhamma, then at that 
      moment we will see the Buddha.</p>
      <p>If one really practises, one will hear the Buddha-Dhamma whether 
      sitting at the root of a tree, lying down or in whatever posture. This is 
      not something to merely think about. It arises from the pure mind. Just 
      remembering these words is not enough, because this depends upon <i>seeing
      </i>the Dhamma itself, nothing other than this. Thus we must be determined 
      to practise to be able to see this, and then our practice will really be 
      complete. Wherever we sit, stand, walk or lie, we will hear the Buddha’s 
      Dhamma.</p>
      <p>In order to practise His Teaching, the Buddha taught us to live in a 
      quiet place so that we can learn to collect and restrain the senses of 
      eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind. This is the foundation for our 
      practice since these are the places where all things arise, and only in 
      these places. Thus we collect and restrain these six senses in order to 
      know the conditions that arise there. All good and evil arise through 
      these six senses. They are the predominant faculties in the body. The eye 
      is predominant in seeing, the ear in hearing, the nose in smelling, the 
      tongue in tasting, the body in contacting hot, cold, hard and soft, and 
      the mind in the arising of mental impressions. All that remains for us to 
      do is to build our practice around these points.</p>
      <p>This practice is easy because all that is necessary has already been 
      set down by the Buddha. This is comparable to the Buddha planting an 
      orchard and inviting us to partake of its fruit. We, ourselves, do not 
      need to plant one.</p>
      <p>Whether concerning morality, meditation or wisdom, there is no need to 
      create, decree or speculate, because all that we need to do is follow the 
      things which already exist in the Buddha's Teaching.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we are beings who have much merit and good fortune in having 
      heard the Teachings of the Buddha. The orchard already exists, the fruit 
      is already ripe. Everything is already complete and perfect. All that is 
      lacking is someone to partake of the fruit, someone with faith enough to 
      practise!</p>
      <p>We should consider that our merit and good fortune are very valuable. 
      All we need to do is look around to see how much other creatures are 
      possessed of ill-fortune; take dogs, pigs, snakes and other creatures for 
      instance. They have no chance to study Dhamma, no chance to know Dhamma, 
      no chance to practise Dhamma. These are beings possessed of ill-fortune 
      who are receiving karmic retribution. When one has no chance to study, to 
      know, to practise Dhamma, then one has no chance to be free from 
      Suffering.</p>
      <p>As human beings we should not allow ourselves to become victims of 
      ill-fortune, deprived of proper manners and discipline. Do not become a 
      victim of ill-fortune! That is to say, one without hope of attaining the 
      Path of Freedom to Nibbàna, without hope of developing virtue. Do not 
      think that we are already without hope! By thinking in that way, we would 
      then become possessed of ill-fortune the same as other creatures.</p>
      <p>We are beings who have come within the sphere of influence of the 
      Buddha. Thus we human beings are already of sufficient merit and 
      resources. If we correct and develop our understanding, opinions and 
      knowledge in the present, then it will lead us to behave and practise in 
      such a way as to see and know Dhamma in this present life as human beings.</p>
      <p>We are thus different from other creatures, beings that should be 
      enlightened to the Dhamma. The Buddha taught that at this present moment, 
      the Dhamma exists here in front of us. The Buddha sits facing us right 
      here and now! At what other time or place are you going to look?</p>
      <p>If we don't think rightly, if we don't practise rightly, we will fall 
      back to being animals or creatures in Hell or hungry ghost or demons.[*] 
      How is this? Just look in your mind. When anger arises, what is it? There 
      it is, just look! When delusion arises, what is it? That's it, right 
      there! When greed arises, what is it? Look at it right there!</p>
      <dir>
        <i>
        <p>[*] According to Buddhist thought beings are born in anv of eight 
        states of existence depending on their Kamma. These include three 
        Heavenlv States (where happiness is predominant), the Human State, and 
        the four above-mentioned Woeful or Hell States (where suffering is 
        predominant). The Venerable Ajahn always stresses that we should see 
        these states in our own minds in the present moment. So that depending 
        on the condition of the mind, we can sav that we are continually being 
        born in these different states. For instance, when the mind is on fire 
        with anger then we have fallen from the Human State and have been born 
        in Hell right here and now.</p>
      </dir>
      </i>
      <p>By not recognizing and clearly understanding these mental states, the 
      mind changes from being that of a human being. All conditions are in the 
      state of becoming. Becoming gives rise to birth or existence as determined 
      by the present conditions. Thus we become and exist as our minds condition 
      us.</p>
