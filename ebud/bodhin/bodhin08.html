      <p>(A lively talk, in Lao dialect, given to the Assembly of newly-ordained 
      monks at Wat Pah Pong on the day of entering the Rains Retreat, July 1978)
      </p>
      <p>(Translators' Note: One must imagine Ajahn<b> </b>Chah sitting on his 
      Abbot's cushion, surrounded by the Assembly of newly-ordained Monks and 
      Novices, chuckling, teasing and spontaneously picking objects near him to 
      illustrate his points more simply. Trying to keep the bounce of his words, 
      his humour, and his joy on paper is difficult. However, the conversational 
      tone has been kept and Lao slang replaced by American slang in most 
      places.)</p>
      </i><font SIZE="6">
      <p>B</font>reathe in... breathe out... just like that. Even if others are 
      &quot;standing on their heads&quot; [1] that's their business. Don't bother your 
      head over it. Just concentrate on breathing in and out, just know your 
      breath, that's enough. Nothing else. Just know when the air comes in and 
      goes out, or you can say to yourself, &quot;BUD&quot; on the in-breath, &quot;DHO&quot; on the 
      out-breath. [2] Take this as your subject of awareness. Just do it like 
      that for now. When the air comes in, you know it; when it goes out, you 
      know it. Then your mind will be peaceful, not disturbed, not restless. 
      Just the air going in and out, continuously.</p>
      <dir>
        <i>
        <p>[1] &quot;are standing on their heads&quot;: the Venerable Ajahn used a common 
        Lao expression which<b> </b>literally means: &quot;raise their ass to the 
        sky&quot;.</p>
        <p>[2] &quot;BUD-DHO&quot;: a Parikamma or &quot;Mantra&quot; commonly used to maintain 
        one's attention when<b> </b>used in<b> </b>conjunction with other 
        methods such as mindfulness of the in-and-out breath or in the<b> </b>
        walking meditation or by itself as a recollection on<b> </b>the Buddha.</p>
      </dir>
      </i>
      <p>In the beginning, keep it this simple, nothing fancy. However long you 
      may sit, if you're &quot;sabai&quot; [*] or peaceful, you'll know within yourself. 
      If you keep at it, the breath becomes refined and softer, the body becomes 
      soft (relaxed), the mind becomes soft -- that's worth having! Go ahead, 
      let it happen naturally. Sitting &quot;sabai&quot;, firm in meditation, not in a 
      daze, not drowsy or nodding off, everything becomes effortless. Now you're 
      peaceful! Then as you're getting up: &quot;Wow, what was that?&quot; You can't stop 
      thinking of that peace.</p>
      <dir>
        <i>
        <p>[*] Sabai: a Thai word generally meaning &quot;comfortable&quot;, &quot;content&quot; or 
        physical and/or mental well-being, as opposed to discomfort or diseases 
        In meditation it can imply positive happiness or neutral contentment.</p>
      </dir>
      </i>
      <p>Then we follow through by keeping constant clear mindfulness [*], 
      knowing ourselves. Whatever we say, whatever we do, going here, going 
      there, going on alms-round, washing our bowls or eating, we know what it 
      is we are doing. We have mindfulness, staying steady. Just keep on doing 
      it like this! Whatever it's time to do, do it with constant mindfulness.</p>
      <dir>
        <i>
        <p>[*] Clear mindfulness: in Pàli it is Sati-Sampajanna, lit. 
        mindfulness and clear comprehension or more generally, a clear presence 
        of mind and self-knowing.</p>
      </dir>
      </i>
      <p>And walking meditation: take a straight path between two trees, about 
      seven or eight full armspans. Walking's the same as sitting Samàdhi. 
      Collect yourself, resolve that now you're going to get into this 
      meditation and calm down your mind so that clear mindfulness will be 
      strong enough to arise. As to methods, some will start by spreading Mettà 
      (loving-kindness) to all living creatures for protection. Go ahead, the 
      chicken-hearted need various approaches!</p>
      <p>Begin with your right foot first. Take a good step and walk, saying to 
      yourself: &quot;BUD-DHO, BUD-DHO...&quot; with your footsteps. Keep your attention 
      right there with your feet the whole time. If you feel restless, <i>stop
      </i>till peaceful, then step again. Know the beginning, middle and end of 
      the path, and know when you're walking back. <i>Know </i>where you are 
      continuously!</p>
      <p>So that's the method. You can do walking meditation. Some people will 
      say: &quot;Walking back and forth like that is looney!&quot; But there's a lot of 
      wisdom in walking meditation, you know. Walk back and forth. If you're 
      tired, stop. Turn your attention inwards and bring your mind to rest by 
      calmly being aware of your breath.</p>
      <p>Then become aware of one more thing, your alternating postures. 
      Standing, walking, sitting, lying down, we keep changing positions. We 
      can't only stand, only sit, or only lie down! We live using all these 
      postures, thus we must develop awareness in each and every position and 
      make them useful.</p>
      <p>Go ahead and do it! It's not easy. But, to put it simply: It's as if 
      you take this glass and put it here for two minutes, then put it there for 
      two minutes. Move it from here to there every two minutes. Just an 
      example, but do it like this with concentration. In watching your breath 
      it's the same; you do it until you doubt and suffer and that's when wisdom 
      can arise. Some people will say: &quot;What? Moving a glass back and forth like 
      that is nutty, not useful! Are you crazy?&quot; Never mind, just do it. And 
      don't forget, two minutes not five minutes. Concentrate! It's all in the 
      doing.</p>
      <p>Same with watching your breath. Sit up balanced in the cross-legged 
      posture, right leg resting on the left. Breathe in till it reaches here 
      (abdomen), breathe out till all the air is out of your lungs. Breathe in 
      until full then let it go. Now don't try to regulate it! However long or 
      short it is it's okay, good enough. Sit and watch your breath go in and 
      out naturally. Don't let it slip away. If it does, stop! Where has it 
      gone? Find it and bring it back.</p>
      <p>Sooner or later you'll meet up with something good. Just keep at it. 
      Don't think you can't do it. Just like sowing rice in the earth, as if 
      you're throwing it away, but soon a sprout is born, then it becomes a 
      sheaf, and soon you husk it and can eat &quot;khao mow&quot; (green sweet rice). 
      It's like that, you know. That's its nature.</p>
      <p>This is the same -- just sitting. Sometimes you think, &quot;What am I 
      sitting here looking at my breath for anyway? It'll go in and out by 
      itself without me gawking at it!&quot; That's just our opinionated mind, always 
      flea-picking. Ignore it! Just try to do it till peaceful, because when 
      calm, the breath becomes fine, body becomes relaxed, mind is relaxed, 
      all's just right. Continuing on till perhaps you're just sitting there 
      without your breath going in or out, but still alive. Don't be scared! 
      Don't run away thinking you've stopped breathing! This is already a 
      peaceful state. You don't have to do anything, just sit in it. Sometimes, 
      it's like you're not even breathing, but you are. Many things like this 
      can happen, but it's okay. Just be aware of it all, without being fooled 
      by any of it.</p>
      <p>Just keep doing it, and <i>often! </i>Right after you eat, hang up your 
      robe and just start walking: &quot;BUD-DHO, BUD-DHO...&quot; Keep at it till your 
      path becomes a knee-deep trench, just keep walking. When tired, go and 
      sit. Do a lot! Do it so that you <i>know, </i>so that you have it, so that 
      it's born, so that you understand what it's all about. Not just walking a 
      bit: chung, chok, chung, chok ... thinking of this and that, then up to 
      lie down in your hut, soon snoring away! You'll never see anything that 
      way. If you're lazy, when will it ever be finished? If you're tired or 
      lazy, how far will you get? Just get it together, work through and get 
      beyond your laziness. Not saying: &quot;Peaceful, peaceful, peaceful&quot;, then sit 
      and aren't peaceful right away, then quit because it isn't there.</p>
      <p>It's easy to say, but hard to do. Huh! Like saying: &quot;Oh, it's not hard 
      to plant rice, to plant and eat rice is better than this.&quot; But go out and 
      do it and you don't know the oxen from the buffalo from the plow! 
      Actually, doing it is a lot different from talking about it. That's how it 
      is, you know.</p>
      <p>All of you, wanting to find peacefulness -- it's there! But you still 
      don't know anything yet. Whoever you ask, you won't know. Just get to know 
      your own breath going in and out, &quot;BUD-DHO, BUD-DHO...&quot; That's enough. 
      Just do that. You don't have to think of much. At this time, know this, 
      learn this for now. &quot;I do it and I don't see anything.&quot; Doesn't matter, 
      just do it. Whatever comes up, okay, just do it like this, so you'll know 
      what it's about. Do it and see! If you just sit like this and know what's 
      happening it's really all okay. When your mind becomes peaceful, it knows. 
      You can sit all night till dawn and you won't feel you're even sitting, 
      you enjoy it. You can't explain it, it's like enjoyment.</p>
      <p>When it gets like this, you might want to give &quot;profound&quot; sermons, but 
      beware of getting &quot;verbal diarrhea&quot;, expounding the Dhamma constantly, 
      driving folks nutty with your non-stop teaching. Like old Novice Sang. One 
      night just at dusk, walking meditation time, I heard someone in the bamboo 
      grove nearby carrying on: &quot;Yo, yo, yo, yo...&quot; I sat and listened, 
      thinking, &quot;Who's teaching who over there? Who's carrying on?&quot; He didn't 
      stop, just kept babbling on. So I took my flashlight and walked over to 
      see. Sure enough, it was Novice Sang sitting under his bamboo clump, 
      lantern lit, cross-legged, bellowing at full blast, expounding the Dhamma 
      to the night! &quot;Sang, have you flipped your lid?&quot; &quot;Oh, I just can't hold it 
      in!&quot; he said. &quot;When sitting, I gotta teach; when walking, I gotta teach 
      ... don't know where it'll end! &quot; A real nut! Oh well, that's how it is, 
      it can happen, you know.</p>
      <p>But keep at it. Don't just follow your moods. When lazy, keep at it! 
      When energetic, keep at it! Do the sitting and walking and even when lying 
      down, watch your breath. Before sleeping, teach your mind: &quot;I won't 
      indulge in the pleasure of sleep.&quot; When you awaken, continue meditating. 
      And when eating, we remind ourselves: &quot;I won't eat this food with greed, 
      but only as medicine to sustain my life for this day and night, in order 
      to have strength enough to carry on meditating.&quot; Before sleeping we teach 
      ourselves; before eating we teach ourselves like that continually. If 
      standing, be aware; if sitting, be aware; if lying down, be aware. 
      Everything, do it that way! When you lie down, lie on your right side, 
      focusing on your breath, &quot;BUD-DHO, BUD-DHO ...&quot; until you fall asleep. And 
      as soon as you awaken, continue &quot;BUD-DHO, BUD-DHO ...&quot; as if you hadn't 
      skipped a breath! Then peacefulness will arise ... be continuously 
      mindful.</p>
      <p>Don't look at another's practice, you can't do that. Regarding sitting 
      meditation, sit balanced and erect. Don't have your head tilted back or 
      hanging down. Keep it balanced. Like the Buddha statue -- now he's 
      &quot;sitting tight&quot; and bright! If you want to change posture, endure the pain 
      to the utmost limit before changing. &quot;What?&quot; you say, &quot;I can't handle 
      that!&quot; But wait before moving. Endure the pain to its limit, then take 
      more. However much it hurts, go ahead and endure it. And if it's too 
      painful to keep &quot;BUD-DHO&quot; in mind, then take the pain as your object of 
      awareness: &quot;Pain, pain, pain, PAIN!&quot; on and on instead of &quot;BUD-DHO&quot;. Stay 
      with it till the pain reaches its end, and see what comes up. The Buddha 
      said that pain arises by itself, and it'll stop by itself. Let it just 
      die, don't give up! Maybe you'll break out in a sweat-drops as big as corn 
      kernels rolling down your back. But if you can get past the feeling once, 
      then you'll know what it's about. But that comes gradually, don't push 
      yourself too far. Just slowly keep at it.</p>
      <p>And know about eating ... chew, swallow, and where does it end up? Food 
      that's right or wrong for your body, you'll know it. Know where it 
      reaches. Refine the art of eating; eat and estimate when you'll be full 
      after five more mouthfuls, then stop! Take enough water and that's it. Try 
      and see if you can do it. Most people don't do it like that. Instead, they 
      eat till full, then top up with five more mouthfuls! But that's not the 
      way, understand? The Buddha said just keep eating attentively and know 
      you're not yet full, but you will be in five more mouthfuls, then stop! 
      Take enough water till full. Then, whether walking or sitting, you'll not 
      feel heavy and your meditation will become automatically better. But 
      people don't want to do it like that. If you don't really want to train 
      yourself, then you can't do it. Otherwise you eat till you're too full, 
      topping up with another five mouthfuls. That's how it is, the nature of 
      our greed and defilements and the things the<b> </b>Buddha taught go in 
      different directions. We have to watch ourselves.</p>
      <p>And sleeping, being aware, it's up to your know-how. Sometimes you 
      won't get to sleep on time; sleep early, sleep late, never mind. That's 
      what I do. Get to sleep late or not late, doesn't matter, when I first 
      awaken, I get right up. Don't make a fuss over it. Cut it right there. If 
      you awaken and are still sleepy, just get right up! Get up and go, wash 
      your face and start walking meditation, go right ahead and walk. That's 
      how we must train ourselves, do it!</p>
      <p>So these are the things to do. But you won't know about them from just 
      listening to what others tell you. You can only know from actually doing 
      the practice. So go ahead and do it. These are the first steps in training 
      the mind. When meditating, focus on only one thing. Sitting, the mind only 
      watches the breath going in and out, continually watching, slowly becoming 
      peaceful. If the mind is scattered, as soon as you sit you're off missing 
      home, mind reaching way over there, thinking you'd like to eat some 
      noodles (those who've just ordained -- hungry, no?). You want to eat, want 
      to drink, hungry, wanting, missing everything! Till you're crazy. But if 
      you go crazy then be crazy, till you can work through it.</p>
      <p>But do it! Have you ever done walking meditation? How is it? &quot;Mind 
      wanders&quot;. Then stop till it comes back. If it really wanders, then don't 
      breathe until you can't stand it -- your mind will come back. If you sit 
      and your mind goes running everywhere, hold your breath, don't let it out, 
      and when you can't stand it, it'll come back! Make the mind strong. 
      Training the mind is not the same as training animals, you know, it's 
      something that's <i>really </i>difficult to train! Don't be easily 
      discouraged. At times, holding your breath till your chest is about to 
      burst is the only thing that'll catch your mind -- it'll come running 
      back! Try it and see.</p>
      <p>During this rains retreat get to know what it's about. In the daytime, 
      do it; at night, do it; whenever you're free, go ahead and do it. Do 
      walking meditation night and day, even if you only have ten minutes, do 
      it! Keep your mind on one thing, continuously mindful of it. If something 
      comes up to talk about, stop, don't talk. Turn your attention right back 
      on your meditation, make it continuous.</p>
      <p>It's the same as the water in this drinking bottle. If we tilt it a 
      bit, it starts to &quot;drip, drip, drip...&quot;; we tilt it more and &quot;drippity, 
      drippity, drippity... That's like our mindfulness. And if we really pour 
      it out, it becomes a steady stream of water, like out of a tap, not just 
      dripping. Meaning that: whether we stand, walk, sit, lie down or whatever, 
      if we are always aware, then our mindfulness is the same as a steady 
      stream of water. If we really pour it out, it's a steady stream. So, if 
      our mind wanders, thinks of this and that, then our mindfulness is only 
      like dripping water.</p>
      <p>So training our mind is just like this. Whether we think of this or 
      that, are restless, aren't together, doesn't matter. Just keep practising 
      continually, and you'll develop awareness until it's a constant flow. 
      Whether standing, sitting, lying down, or whatever, that awareness will be 
      right there with you. Do it and see!</p>
      <p>Just sitting around, it's not going to happen by itself, you know . But 
      if you try too hard, you can't do it either. Don't try at all -- still 
      can't do it! Keep that in mind. Sometimes you don't even intend to sit in 
      meditation, but your work's finished and you sit down, empty your mind, 
      and pap! -- you're peaceful right away. Easy, because you're right there.</p>
      <p>Take this them -- that's enough for now!</p>
