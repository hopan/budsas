      <p align="center"><b>FRAGMENTS OF A TEACHING</b></p>
      </font><font SIZE="6">
      <p>A</font>ll of you have believed in Buddhism for many years now through 
      hearing about the Buddhist Teachings from many sources -- especially from 
      various monks and teachers. In some cases Dhamma is taught in very broad 
      and vague terms to the point where it is difficult to know how to put it 
      into practice in daily life. In other instances Dhamma is taught in high 
      language or special jargon to the point where most people find it 
      difficult to understand, especially if the teaching is done too literally 
      from scripture. Lastly there is Dhamma taught in a balanced way, neither 
      too vague nor too profound, neither too broad nor too esoteric -- just 
      right for the listener to understand and practise to personally benefit 
      from the Teachings. Today I would like to share with you Teachings of the 
      sort I have often used to instruct my disciples in the past; Teachings 
      which I hope may possibly be of personal benefit to those of you here 
      listening today.</p>
      <b>
      <p>One Who Wishes to Reach the Buddha-Dhamma</p>
      </b>
      <p>One who wishes to reach the Buddha-Dhamma must firstly be one who has 
      faith or confidence as a foundation. He must understand the meaning of 
      Buddha-Dhamma as follows:</p>
      <b>
      <p><i>Buddha:</i> </b>the One-Who-Knows, the one who has purity, radiance 
      and peace in his heart.</p>
      <b>
      <p><i>Dhamma:</i></b> the characteristics of purity, radiance and peace 
      which arise from morality, concentration and wisdom.</p>
      <p>Therefore, one who is to reach the Buddha Dhamma is one who cultivates 
      and develops morality, concentration and wisdom within himself.</p>
      <b>
      <p>Walking the Path of Buddha-Dhamma</p>
      </b>
      <p>Naturally people who wish to reach their home are not those who merely 
      sit and think of travelling. They must actually undertake the process of 
      travelling step by step, and in the right direction as well, in order to 
      finally reach home. If they take the wrong path they may eventually run 
      into difficulties such as swamps or other obstacles which are hard to get 
      around. Or they may run into dangerous situations in this wrong direction, 
      thereby possibly never reaching home.</p>
      <p>Those who reach home can relax and sleep comfortably -- home is a place 
      of comfort for body and mind. Now they have really reached home. But if 
      the traveller only passed by the front of his home or only walked around 
      it, he would not receive any benefit from having travelled all the way 
      home.</p>
      <p>In the same way, walking the path to reach the Buddha-Dhamma is 
      something each one of us must do individually ourselves, for no one can do 
      it for us. And we must travel along the proper path of morality, 
      concentration and wisdom until we find the blessings of purity, radiance 
      and peacefulness of mind that are the fruits of travelling the path. 
      However, if one only has knowledge of books and scriptures, sermons and 
      sutras, that is, only knowledge of the map or plans for the journey, even 
      in hundreds of lives one will never know purity, radiance and peacefulness 
      of mind. Instead one will just waste time and never get to the real 
      benefits of practice. Teachers are those who only point out the direction 
      of the Path. After listening to the teachers, whether or not we walk the 
      Path by practising ourselves, and thereby reap the fruits of practice, is 
      strictly up to each one of us.</p>
      <p>Another way to look at it is to compare practice to a bottle of 
      medicine a doctor leaves for his patient. On the bottle is written 
      detailed instructions on how to take the medicine, but, no matter how many 
      hundred times the patient reads the directions, he is bound to die if that 
      is all he does. He will gain no benefit from the medicine. And before he 
      dies he may complain bitterly that the doctor wasn't any good, that the 
      medicine didn't cure him! He will think that the doctor was a fake or that 
      the medicine was worthless, yet he has only spent his time examining the 
      bottle and reading the instructions. </p>
      <p>He hasn't followed the advice of the doctor and taken the medicine.</p>
      <p>However, if the patient actually follows the -doctor's advice and takes 
      the medicine regularly as prescribed, he will recover. And if he is very 
      ill, it will be necessary to take a lot of medicine, whereas if he is only 
      mildly ill, only a little medicine will be needed to finally cure him. The 
      fact that we must use a lot of medicine is a result of the severity of our 
      illness. It's only natural and you can see it for yourself with careful 
      consideration.</p>
      <p>Doctors prescribe medicine to eliminate disease from the body. The 
      Teachings of the Buddha are prescribed to cure disease of the mind, to 
      bring it back to its natural healthy state. So the Buddha can be 
      considered to be a doctor who prescribes cures for the ills of the mind. 
      He is, in fact, the greatest doctor in the world.</p>
      <p>Mental ills are found in each one of us without exception. When you see 
      these mental ills, does it not make sense to look to the Dhamma as 
      support, as medicine to cure your ills? Travelling the path of the 
      Buddha-Dhamma is not done with the body. You must travel with the mind to 
      reach the benefits. We can divide these travellers into three groups:</p>
      <i><b>
      <p>First Level:</b></i> this is comprised of those who understand that 
      they must practise themselves, and know how to do so. They take the 
      Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha as their refuge and have resolved to practise 
      diligently according to the Teachings. These persons have discarded merely 
      following customs and traditions, and instead use reason to examine for 
      themselves the nature of the world. These are the group of &quot;Buddhist 
      believers&quot;.</p>
      <i><b>
      <p>Middle Level:</b></i> This group is comprised of those who have 
      practised until they have an unshakeable faith in the Teachings of the 
      Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. They also have penetrated to the 
      understanding of the true nature of all compounded formations. These 
      persons gradually reduce clinging and attachment. They do not hold onto 
      things and their minds reach deep understanding of the Dhamma. Depending 
      upon the degree of non-attachment and wisdom they are progressively known<b>
      </b>as Stream-Enterers, Once-Returners and Non-Returners, or simply, Noble 
      Ones.</p>
      <i><b>
      <p>Highest Level:</b></i> This is the group of those whose practice has 
      led them to the body, speech and mind of the Buddha. They are above the 
      world, free of the world, and free of all attachment and clinging. They 
      are known as Arahats or Free Ones, the highest level of the Noble Ones.</p>
      <b>
      <p>How to Purify One's Morality</p>
      </b>
      <p>Morality is restraint and discipline of body and speech. On the formal 
      level this is divided into classes of precepts for lay people and for 
      monks and nuns. However, to speak in general terms, there is one basic 
      characteristic -- that is INTENTION. When we are mindful or 
      self-recollected, we have right intention. Practising self-recollection 
      and mindfulness will generate good morality.</p>
      <p>It is only natural that when we put on dirty clothes and our bodies are 
      dirty, that our minds too will feel uncomfortable and depressed. However, 
      if we keep our bodies clean and wear clean, neat clothes, it makes our 
      minds light and cheerful. So too, when morality is not kept, our bodily 
      actions and speech are dirty, and this is a cause for making the mind 
      unhappy, distressed and heavy. We are separated from right practice and 
      this prevents us from<font SIZE="1"> </font>penetrating into the essence 
      of the Dhamma in our minds. The wholesome bodily actions and speech 
      themselves depend on mind, properly trained, since mind orders body and 
      speech. Therefore, we must continue practice by training our minds.</p>
      <b>
      <p>Practice of Concentration Training</p>
      </b>
      <p>The training in concentration is practice to make the mind firm and 
      steady. This brings about peacefulness of mind. Usually our untrained 
      minds are moving and restless, hard to control and manage. Mind follows 
      sense distractions wildly just like water flowing this way and that, 
      seeking the lowest level. Agriculturists and engineers, though, know how 
      to control water so that it is of greater use to mankind. Men are clever, 
      they know how to dam water, make large reservoirs and canals -- all of 
      this merely to channel water and make it more useable. In addition the 
      water stored becomes a source of electrical power and light, further 
      benefits from controlling its flow so that it doesn't run wild and 
      eventually settle into a few low spots, its usefulness wasted.</p>
      <p>So too, the mind which is dammed and controlled, trained constantly, 
      will be of immeasurable benefit. The Buddha Himself taught, &quot;The mind that 
      has been controlled brings true happiness, so train your minds well for 
      the highest of benefits.&quot; Similarly, the animals we see around us -- 
      elephants, horses, cattle, buffalo, etc., must be trained before they can 
      be useful for work. Only after they have been trained is their strength of 
      benefit to us.</p>
      <p>In the same way, the mind that has been trained will bring many times 
      the blessings of that of an untrained mind. The Buddha and His Noble 
      Disciples all started out in the same way as us -- with untrained minds; 
      but afterwards look how they became the subjects of reverence for us all, 
      and see how much benefit we can gain through their teaching. Indeed, see 
      what benefit has come to the entire world from these men who have gone 
      through the training of the mind to reach the freedom beyond. The mind 
      controlled and trained is better equipped to help us in all professions, 
      in all situations. The disciplined mind will keep our lives balanced, make 
      work easier and develop and nurture reason to govern our actions. In the 
      end our happiness will increase accordingly as we follow the proper mind 
      training.</p>
      <p>The training of the mind can be done in many ways, with many different 
      methods. The method which is most useful and which can be practised by all 
      types of people is known as &quot;mindfulness of breathing&quot;. It is the 
      developing of mindfulness on the in-breath and the out-breath. In this 
      monastery we concentrate our attention on the tip of the nose and develop 
      awareness of the in-and out-breaths with the mantra word &quot;BUD-DHO&quot;. If the 
      meditator wishes to use another word, or simply be mindful of the air 
      moving in and out, this is also fine. Adjust the practice to suit 
      yourself. The essential factor in the meditation is that the noting or 
      awareness of the breath be kept up in the present moment so that one is 
      mindful of each in-breath and each out-breath just as it occurs. While 
      doing walking meditation we try to be constantly mindful of the sensation 
      of the feet touching the ground.</p>
      <p>This practice of meditation must be pursued as continuously as possible 
      in order for it to bear fruit. Don't meditate for a short time one day and 
      then in one or two weeks, or even a month, meditate again. This will not 
      bring results. The Buddha taught us to practise often, to practise 
      diligently, that is, to be as continuous as we can in the practise of 
      mental training. To practise meditation we should also find a suitably 
      quiet place free from distractions. In gardens or under shady trees in our 
      back yards, or in places where we can be alone are suitable environments. 
      If we are a monk or nun we should find a suitable hut, a quiet forest or 
      cave. The mountains offer exceptionally suitable places for practice.</p>
      <p>In any case, wherever we are, we must make an effort to be continuously 
      mindful of breathing-in and breathing-out. If the attention wanders to 
      other things, try to pull it back to the object of concentration. Try to 
      put away all other thoughts and cares. Don't think about anything -- just 
      watch the breath. If we are mindful of thoughts as soon as they arise and 
      keep diligently returning to the meditation subject, the mind will become 
      quieter and quieter. When the mind is peaceful and concentrated, release 
      it from the breath as the object of concentration. Now begin to<font SIZE="1">
      </font>examine the body and mind comprised of the five <i>khandhas</i>: 
      material form, feelings, perceptions, mental formations and consciousness. 
      Fxamine these five <i>khandhas</i> as they come and go. You will see 
      clearly that they are impermanent, that this impermanence makes them 
      unsatisfactory and undesirable, and that they come and go of their own -- 
      there is no &quot;self&quot; running things. There is to be found only nature moving 
      according to cause and effect. All things in the world fall under the 
      characteristics of instability, unsatisfactoriness and being without a 
      permanenr ego or soul. Seeing the whole of existence in this light, 
      attachment and clinging to the <i>khandhas</i> will gradually be reduced. 
      This is because we see the true characteristics of the world. We call this 
      the arising of wisdom.</p>
      <b>
      <p>The Arising of Wisdom</p>
      </b>
      <p>Wisdom is to see the truth of the various manifestations of body and 
      mind. When we use our trained and concentrated minds to examine the five
      <i>khandhas</i>, we will see clearly that both body and mind are 
      impermanent, unsatisfactory and soul-less. In seeing all compounded things 
      with wisdom we do not cling or grasp. Whatever we receive, we receive 
      mindfully. We are not excessively happy. When things of ours break up or 
      disappear we are not unhappy and do not suffer painful feelings -- for we 
      see clearly the impermanent nature of all things. When we encounter 
      illness and pain of any sort, we have equanimity because our minds have 
      been well trained. The true refuge is the trained mind. All of this is 
      known as wisdom which knows the true characteristics of things as they 
      arise. Wisdom arises from mindfulness and concentration. Concentration 
      arises from a base of morality or virtue. All of these things, morality, 
      concentration and wisdom, are so inter-related that it is not really 
      possible to separate them. In practice it can be looked at in this way: 
      first there is the disciplining of the mind to be attentive to breathing. 
      This is the arising of morality. When mindfulness of breathing is 
      practised continuously until the mind is quiet, this is the arising of 
      concentration. Then examination showing the breath as impermanent, 
      unsatisfactory and not-self, and the subsequent non-attachment, is the 
      arising of wisdom. Thus the practice of mindfulness of breathing can be 
      said to be a course for the development of morality, concentration and 
      wisdom. They all come together.</p>
      <p>When morality, concentration and wisdom are all developed, we call this 
      practising the Eightfold Path which the Buddha taught as our only way out 
      of suffering. The Eightfold Path is above all others because if properly 
      practised it leads directly to Nibbàna, to peace. We can say that this 
      practice reaches the Buddha-Dhamma truly and precisely.</p>
      <b>
      <p>Benefits from Practice</p>
      </b>
      <p>When we have practised meditation as explained above, the fruits of 
      practice will arise in the following three stages:</p>
      <p>First, for those practicioners who are at the level of &quot;Buddhists by 
      faith&quot;, there will arise increasing faith in the Buddha, Dhamma and 
      Sailgha. This faith will become the real inner support of each person. 
      Also, they will understand the cause-and-effect nature of all things, that 
      wholesome action brings wholesome result and that unwholesome action 
      brings unwholesome result. So for such a person there will be a great 
      increase in happiness and mental peace.</p>
      <p>Second, those who have reached the noble attainments of Stream-Winner, 
      Once-Returner or Non-Returner, have unshakeable faith in the Buddha, 
      Dhamma and Sangha. They are joyful and are pulled towards Nibbàna.</p>
      <p>Third, for those Arahats or Perfected One there will be the happiness 
      free from all suffering. These are the Buddhas free from the world, 
      complete in the Faring of the Holy Way.</p>
      <p ALIGN="CENTER">* * *</p>
      <p>We all have had the good fortune to be born as human beings and to hear 
      the Teachings of the Buddha. This is an opportunity that millions of other 
      beings do not have. Therefore do not be careless or heedless. Hurry and 
      develop merits, do good and follow the path of practice in the beginning, 
      in the middle and in the highest levels. Don't let time roll by unused and 
      without purpose. Try to reach the truth of the Buddhas Teachings even 
      today. Let me close with a Lao folk-saying: </p>
      <p>&quot;Many rounds of merriment and pleasure past, soon it will be evening. 
      Drunk with tears now<b>, </b>rest and see, soon it will be too late to 
      finish the journey.&quot;</p>
