      <p>(A talk given to a group of Western Monks from Wat Bovornives, Bangkok, 
      March 1977)</p>
      </i></font><font SIZE="6">
      <p>I</font>n the time of Ajahn Mun [1] and Ajahn Sao [2], life was a lot 
      simpler, a lot less complicated than it is today. In those days monks had 
      few duties and ceremonies to perform. They lived in the forests without 
      permanent resting places. There they could devote themselves entirely to 
      the practice of meditation.</p>
      <dir>
        <i>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">[1] Ajahn Mun: probably the most respected and most 
        influential Meditation master of this century in Thailand. Under his 
        guidance the Ascetic Forest Tradition (Dhutanga Kammatthàna) became a 
        very important tradition in the revival of Buddhist meditation practice. 
        The vast majority of recently deceased and presently living great 
        Meditation Masters of Thailand are either direct disciples of the 
        Venerable Ajahn or were substantially influenced by his Teachings. Aiahn 
        Mun passed away in November 1949.</p>
        <p>[2] Ajahn Sao: Ajahn Mun's Teacher.</p>
      </dir>
      </i>
      <p>In those times one rarely encountered the luxuries that are so 
      commonplace today, there simply weren't any. One had to make drinking cups 
      and spittoons out of bamboo and laypeople seldom came to visit. One didn't 
      want or expect much and was content with what one had. One could live and 
      breathe meditation!</p>
      <p>The monks suffered many privations living like this. If someone caught 
      malaria and went to ask for medicine, the Teacher would say, &quot;You don't 
      need medicine! Keep practising.&quot; Besides, there simply weren't all the 
      drugs that are available now. All one had were the herbs and roots that 
      grew in the forest. The environment was such that monks had to have a 
      great deal of patience and endurance; they didn't bother over minor 
      ailments. Nowadays you get a bit of an ache and you're off to the 
      hospital!</p>
      <p>Sometimes one had to walk ten to twelve kilometers on almsround 
      (pindapad). You would leave as soon as it was light and maybe return 
      around ten or eleven o'clock. One didn't get very much either, perhaps 
      some glutinous rice, salt or a few chilis. Whether you got anything to eat 
      with the rice or not didn't matter. That's the way it was. No one dared 
      complain of hunger or fatigue; they were just not inclined to complain but 
      learned to take care of themselves. They practised in the forest with 
      patience and endurance alongside the many dangers that lurked in the 
      surroundings. There were many wild and fierce animals living in the 
      jungles and there were many hardships for body and mind in the ascetic 
      practice of the Dhutanga or Forest-Dwelling monk. Indeed, the patience and 
      endurance of the monks in those days was excellent because the 
      circumstances compelled them to be so.</p>
      <p>In the present day, circumstances compel us in the opposite direction. 
      In ancient times, one had to travel by foot; then came the oxcart and then 
      the automobile. Aspiration and ambition increased, so that now, if the car 
      is not air-conditioned, one will not even sit in it; impossible to go if 
      there is no air-conditioning! The virtues of patience and endurance are 
      becoming weaker and weaker. The standards for meditation and practice are 
      lax and getting laxer, until we find that meditators these days like to 
      follow their own opinions and desires. When the old folks talk about the 
      old days, it's like listening to a myth or a legend. You just listen 
      indifferently, but you don't understand. It just doesn't reach you!</p>
      <p>As far as we should be concerned about the ancient monks' tradition, a 
      monk should spend at least five years with his Teacher. Some days you<b>
      </b>should avoid speaking to anyone. Don't allow yourself to speak or talk 
      very much. Don't read books! Read your own heart instead. Take Wat Pah 
      Pong for example. There days many university graduates are coming to 
      ordain. I try to stop them from spending their time reading books about 
      Dhamma, because these people are always reading books. They have so many 
      opportunities for reading books, but opportunities for reading their own 
      hearts are rare. So, when they come to ordain for three months following 
      the Thai custom, we try to get them to close their books and manuals. 
      While they are ordained they have this splendid opportunity to read their 
      own hearts.</p>
      <p>Listening to your own heart is really very interesting. This untrained 
      heart races around following its own untrained habits. It jumps about 
      excitedly, randomly, because it has never been trained. Therefore train 
      your heart! Buddhist meditation is about the heart; to develop the heart 
      or mind, to develop your own heart. This is very, very important. This 
      training of the heart is the main emphasis. Buddhism is the religion of 
      the heart. Only this! One who practises to develop the heart is one who 
      practises Buddhism.</p>
      <p>This heart of ours lives in a cage, and what's more, there's a raging 
      tiger in that cage. If this maverick heart of ours doesn't get what it 
      wants, it makes trouble. You must discipline it with meditation, with 
      Samàdhi. This is called &quot;Training the Heart&quot;. At the very beginning, the 
      foundation of practice is the establishment of moral discipline (Sila). 
      Sila is the training of the body and speech. From this arises conflict and 
      confusion. When you don't let yourself do what you want to do, there is 
      conflict.</p>
      <p>Eat little! Sleep little! Speak little! Whatever it may be of worldly 
      habits, lessen them, go against their power. Don't just do as you like, 
      don't indulge in your thoughts. Stop this slavish following. You must 
      constantly go against the stream of ignorance. This is called 
      &quot;Discipline&quot;. When you discipline your heart, it becomes very dissatisfied 
      and begins to struggle. It becomes restricted and oppressed. When the 
      heart is prevented from doing what it wants to do, it starts wandering and 
      struggling. Suffering (Dukkha) [*] becomes apparent to us.</p>
      <dir>
        <i>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">[*] Dukkha:refers to the implicit unsatisfactoriness, 
        incomplete-ness, imperfection, insecurity of all conditioned phenomena, 
        which, because they are always changing, are always liable to cause 
        suffering. Dukkha refers to all forms of unpleasantness from gross 
        bodily pains and the suffering implicit in old age, sickness and death, 
        to subtle feelings such as being parted from what we like or associated 
        with what we dislike, to refined mental states such as dullness, 
        boredom, restlessness, agitation, etc. This is one of the most 
        misunderstood concepts and one of the most important for spiritual 
        development.</p>
      </dir>
      </i>
      <p>This Dukkha, this suffering, is the first of the Four Noble Truths. 
      Most people want to get away from it. They don't want to have any kind of 
      suffering at all. Actually, this suffering is what brings us wisdom; it 
      makes us contemplate Dukkha. Happiness (Sukha) tends to make us close our 
      eyes and ears. It never allows us to develop patience. Comfort and 
      happiness make us careless. Of these two defilements, Dukkha is the 
      easiest to see. Therefore we must bring up suffering in order to put an 
      end to our suffering. We must first know what Dukkha is before we can know 
      how to practise meditation.</p>
      <p>In the beginning you have to train your heart like this. You may not 
      understand what is happening or what the point of it is, but when the 
      Teacher tells you to do something, then you must do it. You will develop 
      the virtues of patience and endurance. Whatever happens, you endure, 
      because that is the way it is. For example, when you begin to practise 
      Samàdhi you want peace and tranquillity. But you don't get any. You don't 
      get any because you have never practised this way. Your heart says, &quot;I'll 
      sit until I attain tranquillity.&quot; But when tranquillity doesn't arise, you 
      suffer. And when there is suffering, you get up and run away! To practise 
      like this can not be called &quot;developing the heart&quot; It's called 
      &quot;desertion&quot;.</p>
      <p>Instead of indulging in your moods, you train yourself with the Dhamma 
      of the Buddha. Lazy or diligent, you just keep on practising. Don't you 
      think that this is a better way? The other way, the way of following your 
      moods, will never reach the Dhamma. If you practise the Dhamma, then 
      whatever the mood may be, you keep on practising, constantly practising. 
      The other way of self-indulgence is not the way of the Buddha. When we 
      follow our own views on practice, our own opinions about the Dhamma<b>,
      </b>we can never see clearly what is right and what is wrong. We don't 
      know our own heart. We don't know ourselves.</p>
      <p>Therefore, to practise following your own teachings is the slowest way. 
      To practise following the Dhamma is the direct way. Lazy you practise; 
      diligent you practise. You are aware of time and place. This is called 
      &quot;developing the heart&quot;.</p>
      <p>If you indulge in following your own views and try to practise 
      accordingly, then you will start thinking and doubting a lot. You think to 
      yourself, &quot;I don't have very much merit. I don't have any luck. I've been 
      practising meditation for years now and I'm still unenlightened. I still 
      haven't seen the Dhamma.&quot; To practise with this kind of attitude can not 
      be called &quot;developing the heart&quot;. It is called &quot;developing disaster&quot;.</p>
      <p>If, at this time, you are like this, if you are a meditator who still 
      doesn't know, who doesn't see, if you haven't renewed yourself yet, it's 
      because you've been practising wrongly. You haven't been following the 
      Teachings of the Buddha. The Buddha taught like this: &quot;Ànanda, practise a 
      lot! Develop your practice constantly! Then all your doubts, all your 
      uncertainties, will vanish.&quot; These doubts will never vanish through 
      thinking, nor through theorizing, nor through speculation, nor through 
      discussion. Nor will doubts disappear by not doing anything. All 
      defilements will vanish through developing the heart, through right 
      practice only.</p>
      <p>The way of developing the heart as taught by the Buddha is the exact 
      opposite of the way of the world, because His Teachings come from a pure 
      heart. A pure heart, unattached to defilements, is the Way of the Buddha 
      and His Disciples.</p>
      <p>If you practise the Dhamma, you must bow your heart to the Dhamma. You 
      must not make the Dhamma bow to you. When you practise this way, suffering 
      arises. There isn't a single person who can escape this suffering. So when 
      you commence your practice suffering is right there.</p>
      <p>The duties of meditators are mindfulness, collectedness and 
      contentment. These things stop us. They stop the habits of the hearts of 
      those who have never trained. And why should we bother to do this? If you 
      don't bother to train your heart, then it remains wild, following the ways 
      of nature. It's possible to train that nature so that it can be used to 
      advantage. This is comparable to the example of trees. If we just left 
      trees in their natural state, then we would never be able to build a house 
      with them. We couldn't make planks or anything of use in building a house. 
      However, if a carpenter came along wanting to build a house, he would go 
      looking for trees such as these. He would take this raw material and use 
      it to advantage. In a short time he could have a house built.</p>
      <p>Meditation and developing the heart are similar to this. You must take 
      this untrained heart, the same as you would take a tree in its natural 
      state in the forest, and train this natural heart so that it is more 
      refined, so that it's more aware of itself and is more sensitive. 
      Everything is in its natural state. When we understand nature, then we can 
      change it, we can detach from it, we can let go of it. Then we won' t 
      suffer anymore.</p>
      <p>The nature of our heart is such that whenever it clings and grasps 
      there is agitation and confusion. First it might wander over there, then 
      it might wander over here. When we come to observe this agitation, we 
      might think that it's impossible to train the heart and so we suffer 
      accordingly. We don't understand that this is the way the heart is. There 
      will be thoughts and feelings moving about like this even though we are 
      practising, trying to attain peace. That's the way it is.</p>
      <p>When we have contemplated many times the nature of the heart, then we 
      will come to understand that this heart is just as it is and can't be 
      otherwise. We will know that the heart's ways are just as they are. That's 
      its nature. If we see this clearly, then we can detach from thoughts and 
      feelings. And we don't have to add on anything more by constantly having 
      to tell ourselves that &quot;that's just the way it is&quot;. </p>
      <p>When the heart truly understands, it lets go of everything. Thinking 
      and feeling will still be there, but that very thinking and feeling will 
      be deprived of power. </p>
      <p>This is similar to a child who likes to play and frolic in ways that 
      annoy us, to the extent that we scold or spank him. We should understand 
      that it's natural for a child to act that way. Then we could let go and 
      leave him to play in his own way. So our troubles are over. How are they 
      over? Because we accept the ways of children. Our outlook changes and we 
      accept the true nature of things. We let go and our heart becomes more 
      peaceful. We have &quot;Right Understanding&quot;.</p>
      <p>If we have wrong understanding, then even living in a deep, dark cave 
      would be chaos, or living high up in the air would be chaos. The heart can 
      only be at peace when there is &quot;Right Understanding&quot;. Then there are no 
      more riddles to solve and no more problems arise.</p>
      <p>This is the way it is. You detach. You let go. Whenever there is any 
      feeling of clinging, we detach from it, because we know that that very 
      feeling is just as it is. It didn't come along especially to annoy us. We 
      might think that it did, but in truth it just is that way. If we start to 
      think and consider it further, that, too, is just as it is. If we let go, 
      then form is merely form, sound is merely sound, odour is merely odour, 
      taste is merely taste, touch is merely touch and the heart is merely the 
      heart. It's similar to oil and water. If you put the two together in a 
      bottle, they won't mix because of the difference in their nature.</p>
      <p>Oil and water are different in the same way that a wise man and an 
      ignorant man are different. The Buddha lived with form, sound, odour, 
      taste, touch and thought. He was an Arahant (Enlightened One), so He 
      turned away from rather than toward these things. He turned away and 
      detached little by little since He understood that the heart is just the 
      heart and thought is just thought. He didn't confuse and mix them 
      together.</p>
      <p>The heart is just the heart; thoughts and feelings are just thoughts 
      and feelings. Let things be just as they are! Let form be just form, let 
      sound be just sound, let thought be just thought. Why should we bother to 
      attach to them? If we think and feel in this way, then there is detachment 
      and separateness. Our thoughts and feelings will be on one side and our 
      heart will be on the other. Just like oil and water -- they are in the 
      same bottle but they are separate.</p>
      <p>The Buddha and His Enlightened Disciples lived with ordinary, 
      unenlightened people. They not only lived with these people, but They 
      taught these ordinary, unenlightened, ignorant ones how to be Noble, 
      Enlightened, Wise Ones. They could do this because They knew how to 
      practise. They knew that it's a matter of the heart, just as I have 
      explained.</p>
      <p>So, as far as your practice of meditation goes, don't bother to doubt 
      it. If we run away from home to ordain, it's not running away to get lost 
      in delusion. Nor out of cowardice or fear. It's running away in<b> </b>
      order to train ourselves, in order to master ourselves. If we have 
      understanding like this, then we can follow the Dhamma. The Dhamma will 
      become clearer and clearer. The one who understands the Dhamma, 
      understands himself; and the one who understands himself, understands the 
      Dhamma. Nowadays, only the sterile remains of the Dhamma have become the 
      accepted order. In reality, the Dhamma is everywhere. There is no need to 
      escape to somewhere else. Instead escape through wisdom. Escape through 
      intelli-gence. Escape through skill. Don't escape through ignorance. If 
      you want peace, then let it be the peace of wisdom. That's enough!</p>
      <p>Whenever we see the Dhamma, then there is the right way, the right 
      path. Defilements are just defilements, the heart is just the heart. 
      Whenever we detach and separate so that there are just these things as 
      they really are, then they are merely objects to us. When we are on the 
      right path, then we are impeccable. When we are impeccable, there is 
      openness and freedom all the time.</p>
      <p>The Buddha said, &quot;Listen to me, Monks. You must not cling to any 
      dhammas.&quot; [*] What are these dhammas? They are everything; there isn't 
      anything which is not dhamma. Love and hate are dhammas, happiness and 
      suffering are dhammas, like and dislike are dhammas; all of these things, 
      no matter how insignificant, are dhammas. When we practise the Dhamma, 
      when we understand, then we can let go. And thus we can comply with the 
      Buddha's Teaching of not clinging to any dhammas.</p>
      <dir>
        <i>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">[*] Dhamma and dhamma: please note the various 
        meanings of the words &quot;Dhamma&quot; (the liberating law discovered and 
        proclaimed by the Buddha), and &quot;dhamma&quot; (any quality, thing, object of 
        mind and/or any conditioned or unconditioned phenomena). Sometimes the 
        meanings also overlap. </p>
      </dir>
      </i>
      <p>All conditions that are born in our heart, all conditions of our mind, 
      all conditions of our body, are. always in a state of change. The Buddha 
      taught not to cling to any of them. He taught His Disciples to practise in 
      order to detach from all conditions and not to practise in order to attain 
      to any more.</p>
      <p>If we follow the Teachings of the Buddha, then we are right. We are 
      right but it is also troublesome. It's not that the Teachings are 
      troublesome, but it's our defilements which are troublesome. The 
      defilements wrongly comprehended obstruct us and cause us trouble. There 
      isn't really anything troublesome with following the Buddha's Teaching. In 
      fact we can say that clinging to the Path of the Buddha doesn't bring 
      suffering, because the Path is simply &quot;let go&quot; of every single dhamma!</p>
      <p>For the ultimate in the practise of Buddhist Meditation, the Buddha 
      taught the practise of &quot;letting go&quot;. Don't carry anything around! Detach! 
      If you see goodness, let it go. If you see rightness, let it go. These 
      words' &quot;let go&quot;, do not mean<b> </b>that we don't have to practise. It 
      means that we have to practise following the method of &quot;letting go&quot; 
      itself. The Buddha taught us to contemplate all dhammas, to develop the 
      Path through contemplating our own body and heart. The Dhamma isn't 
      anywhere else. It's right here! Not someplace far away. It's right here in 
      this very body and heart of ours.</p>
      <p>Therefore a meditator must practise with energy. Make the heart grander 
      and brighter. Make it free and independent. Having done a good deed, don't 
      carry it around in your heart, let it go. Having refrained from doing an 
      evil deed, let it go. </p>
      <p>The Buddha taught us to live in the immediacy of the present, in the 
      here and now. Don't lose yourself in the past or the future.</p>
      <p>The Teaching that people least understand and which conflicts most with 
      their own opinions, is this Teaching of &quot;letting go&quot; or &quot;working with an 
      empty mind&quot;. This way of talking is called &quot;Dhamma language&quot;. When we 
      conceive this in worldly terms, we become confused and think that we can 
      do anything we want. It can be interpreted this way, but its real meaning 
      is closer to this: It's as if we are carrying a heavy rock. After a while 
      we begin to feel its weight but we don't know how to let it go. So we 
      endure this heavy burden all the time. If someone tells us to throw it 
      away, we say, &quot;If I throw it away, I won't have anything left!&quot; If told of 
      all the benefits to be gained from throwing it away, we wouldn't believe 
      them but would keep thinking, &quot;If I throw it away, I will have nothing!&quot; 
      So we keep on carrying this heavy rock until we become so weak and 
      exhausted that we can no longer endure, then we drop it.</p>
      <p>Having dropped it, we suddenly experience the benefits of letting go. 
      We immediately feel better and lighter and we know for ourselves how much 
      of a burden carrying a rock can be. Before we let go of the rock, we 
      couldn't possibly know the benefits of letting go. So if someone tells us 
      to let go, an unenlightened man wouldn't see the purpose of it. He would 
      just blindly clutch at the rock and refuse to let go until it became so 
      unbearably heavy that he just has to let go. Then he can feel for himself 
      the lightness and relief and thus know for himself the benefits of letting 
      go. Later on we may start carrying burdens again, but now we know what the 
      results will be, so we can now let go more easily. This understanding that 
      it's useless to carry burdens around and that letting go brings ease and 
      lightness is an example of knowing ourselves.</p>
      <p>Our pride, our sense of self that we depend on, is the same as that 
      heavy rock. Like that rock, if we think about letting go of self-conceit, 
      we are afraid that without it, there would be nothing left. But when we 
      can finally let it go, we realize for ourselves the ease and comfort of 
      not clinging.</p>
      <p>In the training, of the heart, you mustn't cling to either praise or 
      blame. To just want praise and not to want blame is the way of the world. 
      The Way of the Buddha is to accept praise when it is appropriate and to 
      accept blame when it is appropriate. For example, in raising a child it's 
      very good not to just scold all the time. Some people scold too much. A 
      wise person knows the proper time to scold and the proper time to praise. 
      Our heart is<b> </b>the same. Use intelligence to know the heart. Use 
      skill in taking care of your heart. Then you will be one who is clever in 
      the training of the heart. And when the heart is skilled, it can rid us of 
      our suffering. Suffering exists right here in our hearts. It's always 
      complicating things, creating and making the heart heavy. It's born here. 
      It also dies here.</p>
      <p>The way of the heart is like this. Sometimes there are good thoughts, 
      sometimes there are bad thoughts. The heart is deceitful. Don't trust it! 
      Instead look straight at the conditions of the heart itself. Accept them 
      as they are. They're just as they are. Whether it's good or evil or 
      whatever, that's the way it is. If you don't grab hold of these 
      conditions, then they don't become anything more or less than what they 
      already are. If we grab hold we'll get bitten and will then suffer.</p>
      <p>With &quot;Right View&quot; there's only peace. Samàdhi is born and wisdom takes 
      over. Wherever you may sit or lie down, there is peace. There is peace 
      everywhere, no matter where you may go.</p>
      <p>So today you have brought your disciples here to listen to the Dhamma. 
      You may understand some of it, some of it you may not. In order for you to 
      understand more easily, I've talked about the practice of meditation. 
      Whether you think it is right or not, you should take and contemplate it.</p>
      <p>As a Teacher myself, I've been in a similar predicament. I, too, have 
      longed to listen to Dhamma talks because, wherever I went, I was giving 
      talks to others but never had a chance to listen. So, at this time, you 
      really appreciate listening to a talk from a Teacher. Time passes by so 
      quickly when you're sitting and listening quietly. You're hungry for 
      Dhamma so you really want to listen. At first, giving talks to others is a 
      pleasure, but after awhile, the pleasure is gone. You feel bored and 
      tired. Then you want to listen. </p>
      <p>So when you listen to a talk from a Teacher, you feel much inspiration 
      and you understand easily. When you are getting old and there's hunger for 
      Dhamma, its flavour is especiallydelicious.</p>
      <p>Being a Teacher of others you are an example to them, you're amodel for 
      other bhikkhus. You're an example to your disciples. You're an example to 
      everybody, so don't forget yourself. But don't think about yourself 
      either. If such thoughts do arise, get rid of them. If you do this then 
      you will be one who knows himself.</p>
      <p>There are a million ways to practise Dhamma. There's no end to the 
      things that can be said about meditation. There are so many things that 
      can make us doubt. Just keep sweeping them out, then there's no more 
      doubt! When we have right understanding like this, no matter where we sit 
      or walk, there is peace and ease. Wherever we may meditate, that's the 
      place you bring your awareness. Don't hold that one only meditates while 
      sitting or walking. Everything and everywhere is our practice. There's 
      awareness all the time. There is mindfulness all the time. We can see 
      birth and death of mind and body all the time and we don't let it clutter 
      our hearts. Let it go constantly. If love comes, let it go back to its 
      home. If greed comes, let it go home. If anger comes, let it go home. 
      Follow them! Where do they live? Then escort them there. Don't keep 
      anything. If you practise like this then you are like an empty house. Or, 
      explained another way, this is an empty heart, a heart empty and free of 
      all evil. We call it an &quot;empty heart&quot;, but it isn't empty as if there was 
      nothing, it's empty of evil but filled with wisdom. Then whatever you do, 
      you'll do with wisdom. You'll think with wisdom. You'll eat with wisdom. 
      There will only be wisdom.</p>
      <p>This is the Teaching for today and I offer it to you. I've recorded it 
      on tape. If listening to Dhamma makes your heart at peace, that's good 
      enough. You don't need to remember anything. Some may not believe this. If 
      we make our heart peaceful and just listen, letting it pass by but 
      contemplating continuously like this, then we're like a tape recorder. 
      After some time when we <i>turn on</i>, everything is there. Have no fear 
      that there won't be anything. As soon as you turn on your tape recorder, 
      everything is there.</p>
      <p>I wish to offer this to every bhikkhu and to everyone. Some of you 
      probably know only a little Thai, but that doesn't matter. May you learn 
      the language of the Dhamma. That's good enough!</p>
