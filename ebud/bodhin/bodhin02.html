      </font><font SIZE="3"><i>
      <p>(A Discourse delivered to the assembly of Western Monks, Novices and 
      Lay-disciples at Bung<b> </b>Wai Forest Monastery, Ubon, on 10<sup>th</sup> 
      October, 1977. This Discourse was offered to the parents of one of the 
      monks on the occasion of their visit from France.)</p>
      </i></font><font SIZE="6">
      <p>I</font> am happy that you have taken this opportunity to come and 
      visit Wat Pah Pong, and to see your son who is a monk here, however I'm 
      sorry I have no gift to offer you. France already has so many material 
      things, but of Dhamma there's very little. Having been there and seen for 
      myself, there isn't really any Dhamma there which could lead to peace and 
      tranquillity. There are only things which continually make one's mind 
      confused and troubled.</p>
      <p>France is already materially prosperous, it has so many things to offer 
      which are sensually enticing: sights, sounds, smells, tastes and textures. 
      However, people ignorant of Dhamma only become confused by them. So today 
      I will offer you some Dhamma to take back to France as a gift from Wat Pah 
      Pong and Wat Pah Nanachat.</p>
      <p>What is Dhamma? Dhamma is that which can cut through the problems and 
      difficulties of mankind, gradually reducing them to nothing. That's what 
      is called Dhamma and that’s what should be studied throughout our daily 
      lives so that when some mental impression arises in us, we'll be able to 
      deal with and go beyond it.<font SIZE="1"> </p>
      </font>
      <p>Problems are common to us all whether living here in Thailand or in 
      other countries. If we don't know how to solve them, we'll always be 
      subject to suffering and distress. That which solves problems is wisdom 
      and to have wisdom we must develop and train the mind.</p>
      <p>The subject of practice isn't far away at all, it's right here in our 
      body and mind. Westerners and Thais are the same; they both have a body 
      and mind. A confused body and mind means a confused person and a peaceful 
      body and mind, a peaceful person. </p>
      <p>Actually, the mind, like rain water, is pure in its natural state. If 
      we were to drop green coloring into clear rain water, however, it would 
      turn green. If yellow coloring it would turn yellow.</p>
      <p>The mind reacts similarly. When a comfortable mental impression &quot;drops&quot; 
      into the mind, the mind is comfortable. When the mental impression is 
      uncomfortable, the mind is uncomfortable. The mind becomes &quot;cloudy&quot; just 
      like the colored water. When clear water contacts yellow, it turns yellow. 
      When it contacts green, it turns green. It will change color every time. 
      Actually, that water which is green or yellow is naturally clean and 
      clear. This is also the natural state of the mind, clean and pure and 
      unconfused. It becomes confused only because it pursues mental 
      impressions; it gets lost in its moods! </p>
      <p>Let me explain more clearly. Right now we are sittimg in a peaceful 
      forest. Here, if there's no wind, a leaf remains still. When a wind blows 
      it flaps and flutters. The mind is similar to that leaf. When it contacts 
      a mental impression, it too, &quot;flaps and flutters&quot; according to the nature 
      of that mental impression. And the less we know of Dhamma, the more the 
      mind will continually pursue mental impressions. Feeling happy, it 
      succumbs to happiness. Feeling suffering, it succumbs to suffering. It's 
      constant confusion!</p>
      <p>In the end people become neurotic. Why? Because they don't know! They 
      just follow their moods and don't know how to look after their own minds. 
      When the mind has no one to look after it, it's like a child without a 
      mother or father to take care of him. An orphan has no refuge and, without 
      a refuge, he's very insecure.</p>
      <p>Likewise, if the mind is not looked after, if there is no training or 
      maturation of character with right understanding, it's reallv troublesome.</p>
      <p>The method of training the mind which I will give you todav is 
      Kammatthàna. &quot;Kamma&quot; means 'action' and &quot;thàna&quot; means 'base'. In Buddhism 
      it is the method of making the mind peaceful and tranquil. It's for you to 
      use in training the mind and with the trained mind investigate the body.</p>
      <p>Our being is composed of two parts: one is the body, the other, the 
      mind. There are only these two parts. What is called &quot;the bodv&quot;, is that 
      which can be seen with our phvsical eyes. &quot;The mind&quot;, on the other hand, 
      has no physical aspect. The mind can onlv be <i>seen </i>with the 
      &quot;internal eye&quot; or the &quot;eye of the mind&quot;. These two things, bodv and mind, 
      are in a constant state of turmoil.</p>
      <p>What is the mind? The mind isn't reallv anv &quot;thing&quot;. Conventionally 
      speaking, it's that which feels or senses. That which senses, receives and 
      experiences all mental impressions is called &quot;mind&quot;. Right at this moment 
      there is mind. As I am speaking to you, the mind acknowledges what I am 
      saying. Sounds enter through the ear and you know what is being said. That 
      which experiences this is called &quot;mind&quot;.</p>
      <p>This mind doesn't have any self or substance. It doesn’t have any form. 
      It just experiences mental activities, that's all ! If we teach this mind 
      to have right view, this mind won't have any problems. It will be at ease.</p>
      <p>The mind is mind. Mental objects are mental objects. Mental objects are 
      not the mind, the mind is not mental objects. In order to clearly 
      understand our minds and the mental objects in our minds, we say that the 
      mind is that which receives mental objects which <i>pop </i>into it.</p>
      <p>When these two things, mind and its object, come into contact with each 
      other, they give rise to feelings. Some are good, some bad, some cold, 
      some hot, all kinds! Without wisdom to deal with these feelings, however, 
      the mind will be troubled.</p>
      <p>Meditation is the way of developing the mind so that it may be a base 
      for the arising of wisdom. Here the breath is a physical foundation. We 
      call it Œnàpànasati or &quot;mindfulness of breathing&quot;. Here we make breathing 
      our mental object. </p>
      <p>We take this object of meditation because it's the simplest and because 
      it has been the heart of meditation since ancient times. </p>
      <p>When a good occasion arises to do sitting meditation, sit cross-legged: 
      right leg on top of the left leg, right hand on top of the left hand. Keep 
      your back straight and erect. Say, to yourself &quot;Now I will let go of all 
      my burdens and concerns.&quot; You don’t want anything that will cause you 
      worry. Let go of all concerns for the time being.</p>
      <p>Now fix vour attention on<b> </b>the breath. Then breathe in and 
      breathe out. In developing awareness of breathing, don't intentionally 
      make the breath long or short. Neither make it strong or weak. Justlet it 
      flow normally and naturally. Mindfulness and self-awareness,arising from 
      the mind, will know the in-breath and the out-breath.</p>
      <p>Be at ease. Don't think about anything. No need to think of this or 
      that. The only thing you have to do is fix your attention on the breathing 
      in and breathing out. You have nothing else to do but that! Keep your 
      mindfulness fixed on the in-and out-breaths as they occur. Be aware of the 
      beginning, middle and end of each breath. On inhalation, the beginning of 
      the breath is at the nose tip, the middle at the heart, and the end in the 
      abdomen. On exhalation, it's just the reverse: the beginning of the breath 
      is in the abdomen, the middle at the heart, and the end at the nose tip. 
      Develop the awareness of the breath: 1, at the nose tip; 2, at the heart; 
      3, in the abdomen. Then in reverse: 1, in the abdomen; 2, at the heart; 
      and 3, at the nose tip.</p>
      <p>Focusing the attention on these three points will relieve all worries. 
      Just don't think of anything else! Keep your attention on the breath. 
      Perhaps other thoughts will enter the mind. It will take up other themes 
      and distract you. Don't be concerned. Just take up the breathing again as 
      your object of attention. The mind may get caught up in judging and 
      investigating your moods, but continue to practise, being constantly aware 
      of the beginning, middle and the end of each breath.</p>
      <p>Eventually, the mind will be aware of the breath at these three points 
      all the time. When you do this practice for some time, the mind and body 
      will get accustomed to the work. Fatigue will disappear. The body will 
      feel lighter and the breath will become more and more refined. Mindfulness 
      and self-awareness will protect the mind and watch over it.</p>
      <p>We practise like this until the mind is peaceful and calm, until it is
      <i>one - One</i> means that the mind will be completely absorbed in the 
      breathing, that it doesn't separate from the breath. The mind will be 
      unconfused and at ease. It will know the beginning, middle and end of the 
      breath and remain steadily fixed on it.</p>
      <p>Then when the mind is peaceful, we fix our attention on the in-breath 
      and out-breath at the nose tip only. We don't have to follow it up and 
      down to the abdomen and back. Just concentrate on the tip of the nose 
      where the breath comes in and goes out.</p>
      <p>This is called &quot;calming the mind&quot;, making it relaxed and peaceful. When 
      tranquillity arises, the mind <i>stops; </i>it <i>stops</i> with its 
      single object, the breath. This is what's known as making the mind 
      peaceful so that wisdom may arise.</p>
      <p>This is the beginning, the foundation of our practice. You should try 
      to practise this every single day, wherever you may be. Whether at home, 
      in a car, lying or sitting down, you should be mindfully aware and watch 
      over the mind constantly.</p>
      <p>This is called mental training which should be practised in all the 
      four postures. Not just<b> </b>sitting, but standing, walking and lying as 
      well. The point is that we should know<b> </b>what the state of the mind 
      is at each moment, and, to be able to do this, we must be constantly 
      mindful and aware. Is the mind happy or suffering? Is it confused? Is it 
      peaceful? Getting to know the mind in<b> </b>this manner allows it to 
      become tranquil, and when it does become tranquil, wisdom will arise.</p>
      <p>With the tranquil mind investigate the meditation subject which is the 
      body, from the top of the head to the soles of the feet, then<b> </b>back 
      to the head. Do this over and over again. Look at and see the hair of the 
      head, hair of the body, the nails, teeth and skin. In this meditation we 
      will see that this whole body is composed of four &quot;elements&quot;: earth, 
      water, fire and wind.</p>
      <p>The hard and solid parts of our body make up the earth element; the 
      liquid and flowing parts, the water element. Winds that pass up and down 
      our body make up the wind element, and the heat in our body, the fire 
      element.</p>
      <p>Taken together, they compose what we call a &quot;human being&quot;. However, 
      when the body is broken down into its component parts, only these four 
      elements remain. The Buddha taught that there is no &quot;being&quot; per se, no 
      human, no Thai, no Westerner, no person, but that ultimately, there are 
      only these four elements -- that's all! We assume that there is a person 
      or a '&quot;being&quot; but, in reality, there isn't anything of the sort. Whether 
      taken separately as earth, water, fire and wind, or taken together 
      labelling what they form a &quot;human being&quot;, they're all impermanent, subject 
      to suffering and not-self. They are all unstable, uncertain and in a state 
      of constant change -- not stable for a single moment!</p>
      <p>Our body is unstable, altering and changing constantly. Hair changes, 
      nails change, teeth change, skin changes -- everything changes, 
      completely!</p>
      <p>Our mind, too, is always changing. It isn't a self or substance. It 
      isn't really &quot;us&quot;, not really &quot;them&quot;, although it may think so. Maybe it 
      will think about killing itself. Maybe it will think of happiness or of 
      suffering -- all sorts of things! It's unstable. If we don't have wisdom 
      and we believe this mind of ours, it'll lie to us continually. And we will 
      alternately suffer and be happy.</p>
      <p>This mind is an uncertain thing. This body is uncertain. Together they 
      are impermanent. Together they are a source of suffering. Together they 
      are devoid of self. These, the Buddha pointed out, are neither a being, 
      nor a person, nor a self, nor a soul, nor us, nor they. They are merely 
      elements: earth, water, fire, and wind. Elements only!</p>
      <p>When the mind sees this, it will rid itself of attachment which holds 
      that &quot;I&quot; am beautiful, &quot;I&quot; am good, &quot;I&quot; am evil, &quot;I&quot; am suffering, &quot;I&quot; 
      have, &quot;I&quot; this or &quot;I&quot; that. You will experience a state of unity, for 
      you'll have seen that all of mankind is basically the same. There is no 
      &quot;I&quot;. There are only elements. When you contemplate and see impermance, 
      suffering and not-self, there will no longer be clinging to a self, a 
      being, I or he or she. The mind which sees this will give rise to Nibbida, 
      world-weariness and dispassion. It will see all things as only 
      impermanent, suffering and not-self.</p>
      <p>The mind then <i>stops . </i>The mind is Dhamma. Greed, hatred and 
      delusion will then diminish and recede little by little until finally 
      there is only mind -- just the pure mind. This is called &quot;practising 
      meditation&quot;.</p>
      <p ALIGN="CENTER">* * *</p>
      <p>Thus, I ask you to receive this gift of Dhamma which I offer you to 
      study and contemplate in your daily lives. Please accept this Dhamma 
      Teaching from Wat Pah Pong and Wat Pah Nanachat as an inheritance handed 
      down to you. All of the monks here, including your son, and all the 
      Teachers, make you an offering of this Dhamma to take back to France with 
      you. It will show you the way to peace of mind, it will render your mind 
      calm and unconfused. Your body may be in turmoil, but your mind will not. 
      Those in the world may be confused, but you will not. Even though there is 
      confusion in your country, you will not be confused because the mind will 
      have <i>seen, </i>the mind is Dhamma. This is the right path, the proper 
      way.</p>
      <p>May you remember this Teaching in the future.</p>
      <p>May you be well and happy.</p>
