      <p>(<i>An informal talk given to a group of newly ordained monks after the 
      evening chanting, middle of the Rains Retreat, 1978)</p>
      </i><font SIZE="6">
      <p>O</font>ur way of practice is looking closely at things and making them 
      clear. We're persistent and constant, yet not rushed or hurried. Neither 
      are we too slow. It's a matter of gradually feeling our way and bringing 
      it together. However, all of this bringing it together is working towards 
      something, there is a point to our practice.</p>
      <p>For most of us, when we first start to practise, it's nothing other 
      than desire. We start to practise because of wanting. At this stage our 
      wanting is wanting in the wrong way. That is, it's deluded. It's wanting 
      mixed with wrong understanding.</p>
      <p>If wanting is not mixed with wrong understanding like this, we say that 
      it's wanting with wisdom (Pannà) [*]. It's not deluded -- it's wanting 
      with right understanding. In a case like this we say that it's due to a 
      person's Parami or past accumulations. However, this isn't the case with 
      everyone.</p>
      <dir>
        <i>
        <p>[*] Pannà : has a wide range of meanings from general common sense to 
        knowledgeable understanding, to profound insight into Dhamma. Although 
        each use of the word may have a different meaning, implicit in all of 
        them<b> </b>is an increasing understanding of Dhamma culminating in 
        profound Insight and Enlightenment.</p>
      </dir>
      </i>
      <p>Some people don't want to have desires, or they want not to have 
      desires, because they think that our practice is directed at not wanting. 
      However, if there is no desire, then there's no way of practice.</p>
      <p>We can see this for ourselves. The Buddha and all His Disciples 
      practised to put an end to defilements. We must want to practise and must 
      want to put an end to defilements. We must want to have peace of mind and 
      want not to have confusion. However, if this wanting is mixed with wrong 
      understanding, then it will only amount to more difficulties for us. If we 
      are honest about it, we really know nothing at all. Or, what we do know is 
      of no consequence, since we are unable to use it properly.</p>
      <p>Everybody, including the Buddha, started out like this, with the desire 
      to practise -- wanting to have peace of mind and wanting not to have 
      confusion and suffering. These two kinds of desire have exactly the same 
      value. If not understood then both wanting to be free from confusion and 
      not wanting to have suffering are defilements. They're a foolish way of 
      wanting -- desire without wisdom.</p>
      <p>In our practice we see this desire as either sensual indulgence or 
      self-mortification. </p>
      <p>It's in this very conflict that our Teacher, the Buddha, was caught up, 
      just this dilemma. He followed many ways of practice which merely ended up 
      in these two extremes. And these days we are exactly the same. We are 
      still afflicted by this duality, and because of it we keep falling from 
      the Way.</p>
      <p>However, this is how we must start out. We start out as worldly beings, 
      as beings with defilements, with wanting devoid of wisdom, desire without 
      right understanding. If we lack proper understanding, then both kinds of 
      desire work against us. Whether it's wanting or not wanting, it's still 
      craving (Tanhà). If we don't understand these two things then we won't 
      know how to deal with them when they arise. We will feel that to go 
      forward is wrong and to go backwards is wrong, and yet we can't stop. 
      Whatever we do we just find more wanting. This is because of the lack of 
      wisdom and because of craving. It's right here, with this wanting and not 
      wanting, that we can understand the Dhamma. 'I'he Dhamma which we are 
      looking for exists right here, but we don't see it. Rather, we persist in 
      our efforts to stop wanting. We want things to be a certain way and not 
      any other way. Or, we want them not to be a certain way, but to be another 
      way. Really these two things are the same. They are part of the same 
      duality.</p>
      <p>Perhaps we may not realize that the Buddha and all of His Disciples had 
      this kind of wanting. However the Buddha understood regarding wanting and 
      not wanting. He understood that they are simply the activity of mind, that 
      such things merely appear in a flash and then disappear. These kinds of 
      desires are going on all the time. When there is wisdom, we don't identify 
      with them -- we are free from clinging. Whether it's wanting or not 
      wanting, we simply see it as such. In reality it's merely the activity of 
      the natural mind. When we take a close look, we see clearly that this is 
      how it is.</p>
      <b>
      <p>The Wisdom of Everyday Experience.</p>
      </b>
      <p>So it's here that our practice of contemplation will lead us to 
      understanding. Let us take an example, the example of a fisherman pulling 
      in his net with a big fish in it. How do you think he feels about pulling 
      it in? If he's afraid that the fish will escape, he'll be rushed and start 
      to struggle with the net, grabbing and tugging at it. Before he knows it, 
      the big fish has escaped -- he was trying too hard.</p>
      <p>In the olden days they would talk like this. They taught that we should 
      do it gradually, carefully gathering it in without losing it. This is how 
      it is in our practice; we gradually feel our way with it, carefully 
      gathering it in without losing it. Sometimes it happens that we don't feel 
      like doing it. Maybe we don't want to look or maybe we don't want to know, 
      but we keep on with it. We continue feeling for it. This is practice: if 
      we feel like doing it, we do it, and if we don't feel like doing it, we do 
      it just the same. We just keep on doing it.</p>
      <p>If we are enthusiastic about our practice, the power of our faith will 
      give energy to what we are doing. But at this stage we are still without 
      wisdom. Even though we are very energetic, we will not derive much benefit 
      from our practice. We may continue with it for a long time and a feeling 
      will arise that we aren't going to find the Way. We may feel that we 
      cannot find peace and tranquillity, or that we aren't sufficiently 
      equipped to do the practice. Or maybe we feel that this Way just isn't 
      possible anymore. So we give up!</p>
      <p>At this point we must be very, very careful. We must use great patience 
      and endurance. It's just like pulling in the big fish -- we gradually feel 
      our way with it. We carefully pull it in. The struggle won't be too 
      difficult, so without stopping we continue pulling it in. Eventually, 
      after some time, the fish becomes tired and stops fighting and we're able 
      to catch it easily. Usually this is how it happens, we practise gradually 
      gathering it together. </p>
      <p>It's in this manner that we do our contemplation. If we don't have any 
      particular knowledge or learning in the theoretical aspects of the 
      Teachings, we contemplate according to our everyday experience. We use the 
      knowledge which we already have, the knowledge derived from our everyday 
      experience. This kind of knowledge is natural to the mind. Actually, 
      whether we study about it or not, we have the reality of the mind right 
      here already. The mind is the mind whether we have learned about it or 
      not. This is why we say that whether the Buddha is born in the world or 
      not, everything is the way it is. Everything already exists according to 
      its own nature. This natural condition doesn't change, nor does it go 
      anywhere. It just is that way. This is called the Sacca Dhamma. However, 
      if we don't understand about this Sacca Dhamma, we won't be able to 
      recognize it.</p>
      <p>So we practise contemplation in this way. If we aren't particularly 
      skilled in scripture, we take the mind itself to study and read. 
      Continually we contemplate (lit. talk with ourselves) and understanding 
      regarding the nature of the mind will gradually arise. We don't have to 
      force anything.</p>
      <b>
      <p>Constant Effort.</p>
      </b>
      <p>Until we are able to stop our mind, until we reach tranquillity, the 
      mind will just continue as before. It's for this reason that the Teacher 
      says, &quot;Just keep on doing it, keep on with the practice!&quot; Maybe we think, 
      &quot;If I don't yet understand, how can I do it?&quot; Until we are able to 
      practise properly, wisdom doesn't arise. So we say just keep on with it. 
      If we practise without stopping we'll begin to think about what we are 
      doing. We'll start to consider our practice.</p>
      <p>Nothing happens immediately, so in the beginning we can't see any 
      results from our practice. This is like the example I have often given you 
      of the man who tries to make fire by rubbing two sticks of wood together. 
      He says to himself, &quot;They say there's fire here.&quot; and he begins rubbing 
      energetically. He's very impetuous. He rubs on and on but his impatience 
      doesn't end. He wants to have that fire. He keeps wanting to have that 
      fire, but the fire doesn't come. So he gets discouraged and stops to rest 
      for awhile. He starts again but the going is slow, so he rests again. By 
      then the heat has disappeared; he didn't keep at it long enough. He rubs 
      and rubs until he tires and then he stops altogether. </p>
      <p>Not only is he tired, but he becomes more and more discouraged until he 
      gives up completely. &quot;There's no fire here!&quot; Actually he was doing the 
      work, but there wasn't enough heat to start a fire. The fire was there all 
      the time but he didn't carry on to the end.</p>
      <p>This sort of experience causes the meditator to get discouraged in his 
      practice, and so he restlessly changes from one practice to another. And 
      this sort of experience is also similar to our own practice. It's the same 
      for everybody. Why? Because we are still grounded in defilements. The 
      Buddha had defilements also, but He had a lot of wisdom in this respect. 
      While still worldlings the Buddha and the Arahants were just the same as 
      us. If we are still worldlings then we don't think rightly. Thus when 
      wanting arises we don't see it, and when not wanting arises we don't see 
      it. Sometimes we feel stirred up, and sometimes we feel contented. When we 
      have not wanting we have a kind of contentment, but we also have a kind of 
      confusion. When we have wanting this can be contentment and confusion of 
      another kind. It's all intermixed in this way.</p>
      <b>
      <p>Knowing Oneself and Knowing Others.</p>
      </b>
      <p>The Buddha taught us to contemplate our body, for example: hair of the 
      head, hair of the body, nails, teeth, skin ... it's all body. Take a look! 
      We are told to investigate right here. If we don't see these things 
      clearly as they are in ourselves. we won't understand regarding other 
      people. We won't see others clearly nor will we see ourselves. However, if 
      we do understand and see clearly the nature of our own bodies, our doubts 
      and wanderings regarding others will disappear. This is because body and 
      mind (Rùpa and Nàma) are the same for everybody. It isn't necessary to go 
      and examine all the bodies in the world since we know that they are the 
      same as us -- we are the same as them. If we have this kind of 
      understanding then our burden becomes lighter. Without this kind of 
      understanding, all we do is develop a heavier burden. In order to know 
      about others we would have to go and examine everybody in the entire 
      world. That would be very difficult. We would soon become discouraged.</p>
      <p>Our Vinaya is similar to this. When we took at our Vinaya (Code of 
      Monks' Discipline) we feel that it's very difficult. We must keep every 
      rule, study every rule, review our practice with every rule. If we just 
      think about it, &quot;Oh, it's impossible!&quot; We read the literal meaning of all 
      the numerous rules and, if we merely follow our thinking about them, we 
      could well decide that it's beyond our ability to keep them all. Anyone 
      who has had this kind of attitude towards the Vinaya has the same feeling 
      about it --there are a lot of rules!</p>
      <p>The scriptures tell us that we must examine ourselves regarding each 
      and every rule and keep them all strictly. We must know them all and 
      observe them perfectly. This is the same as saying that to understand 
      about others we must go and examine absolutely everybody. This is a very 
      heavy attitude. And it's like this because we take what is said literally. 
      If we follow the textbooks, this is the way we must go. Some Teachers 
      teach in this manner -- strict adherence to what the textbooks say. It 
      just can't work that way. (on another occasion the Venerable Ajahn 
      completed the analogy by saying that if we know how to guard our own 
      minds, then it is the same as observing all of the numerous rules of the 
      Vinaya).</p>
      <p>Actually, if we study theory like this, our practice won't develop at 
      all. In fact our faith will disappear, our faith in the Way will be 
      destroyed. This is because we haven't yet understood. When there is wisdom 
      we will understand that all the people in the entire world really amount 
      to just this one person. They are the same as this very being. So we study 
      and contemplate our own body and mind. With seeing and understanding the 
      nature of our own body and mind comes understanding the bodies and minds 
      of everyone. And so, in this way, the weight of our practice becomes 
      lighter.</p>
      <p>The Buddha said to teach and instruct ourselves --nobody else can do it 
      for us. When we study and understand the nature of our own existence, we 
      will understand the nature of all existence. </p>
      <p>Everyone is really the same. We are all the same &quot;make&quot; and come from 
      the same company -- there are only different shades, that's all! Just like 
      'Bort-hai' and 'Tum-jai'. They are both pain-killers and do the same 
      thing, but one type is called 'Bort-hai' and the other 'Tum-jai'. Really 
      they aren't different.</p>
      <p>You will find that this way of seeing things gets easier and easier as 
      you gradually bring it all together. We call this &quot;feeling our way&quot;, and 
      this is how we begin to practise. We'll become skilled at doing it. We 
      keep on with it until we arrive at understanding, and when this 
      understanding arises, we will see reality clearly.</p>
      <b>
      <p>Theory and Practice.</p>
      </b>
      <p>So we continue this practice until we have a feeling for it. After a 
      time, depending on our own particular tendencies and abilities, a new kind 
      of understanding arises. This we call Investigation of Dhamma 
      (Dhamma-vicaya), and this is how the Seven Factors of Enlightenment arise 
      in the mind. Investigation of Dhamma is one of them. The others are: 
      Mindfulness, Energy, Rapture, Tranquillity, Concentration (Samàdhi) and 
      Equanimity.</p>
      <p>If we have studied about the Seven Factors of Enlightenment, then we'll 
      know what the books say, but we won't have seen the real Factors of 
      Enlightenment. The real Factors of Enlightenment arise in the mind. </p>
      <p>Thus the Buddha came to give us all the various Teachings. All the 
      Enlightened Ones have taught the way out of suffering and Their recorded 
      Teachings we call the theoretical Teachings. This theory originally came 
      from the practice, but it has become merely book learning or words.</p>
      <p>The real Factors of Enlightenment have disappeared because we don't 
      know them within ourselves, we don't see them within our own minds. If 
      they arise they arise out of practice. If they arise out of practice then 
      they are factors leading to Enlightenment of the Dhamma and we can use 
      their arising as an indication that our practice is correct. If we are not 
      practising rightly, such things will not appear.</p>
      <p>If we practise in the right way, then we can see Dhamma. So we say to 
      keep on practising, feeling your way gradually and continually 
      investigating. Don't think that what you are looking for can be found 
      anywhere other than right here.</p>
      <p>One of my senior disciples had been learning Pali at a study Temple 
      before he came here. He hadn't been very successful with his studies so he 
      thought that, since monks who practise meditation are able to see and 
      understand everything just by sitting, he would come and try this way. He 
      came here to Wat Pah Pong with the intention of sitting in meditation so 
      that he would be able to translate Pali scriptures. He had this kind of 
      understanding about practice. So I explained to him about our way. He had 
      misunderstood completely. He had thought it an easy matter just to sit and 
      make everything clear.</p>
      <p>If we talk about understanding Dhamma then both study monks and 
      practice monks use the same words. But the actual understanding which 
      comes from studying theory and that which comes from practising Dhamma is 
      not quite the same. It may seem to be the same, but one is more profound. 
      One is deeper than the other. The kind of understanding which comes from 
      practice leads to surrender, to giving up. Until there is complete 
      surrender we persevere -- we persist in our contemplation. If desires or 
      anger and dislike arise in our mind, we aren't indifferent to them. We 
      don't just leave them but rather take them and investigate to see how and 
      from where they arise. If such moods are already in our mind, then we 
      contemplate and see how they work against us. We see them clearly and 
      understand the difficulties which we cause ourselves by believing and 
      following them. This kind of understanding is not found anywhere other 
      than in our own pure mind.</p>
      <p>It's because of this that those who study theory and those who practise 
      meditation misunderstand each other. Usually those who emphasize study say 
      things like this, &quot;Monks who only practise meditation just follow their 
      own opinions. They have no basis in their Teaching.&quot; Actually, in one 
      sense, these two ways of study and practice are exactly the same thing. It 
      can help us to understand if we think of it like the front and back of our 
      hand. If we put our hand out, it seems as if the back of the hand has 
      disappeared. Actually the back of our hand hasn't disappeared anywhere, 
      it's just hidden underneath. When we say that we can't see it, it doesn't 
      mean that it has disappeared completely, it just means that it's hidden 
      underneath. When we turn our hand over, the same thing happens to the palm 
      of the hand. It doesn't go anywhere, it's merely hidden underneath.</p>
      <p>We should keep this in mind when we consider practice. If we think that 
      it has &quot;disappeared&quot;, we'll go off to study, hoping to get results. But it 
      doesn't matter how much you study <i>about</i> Dhamma, you'll never 
      understand, because you won't know in accordance with Truth. If we do 
      understand the real nature of Dhamma, then it becomes letting go. This is 
      surrender -- removing attachment (Upàdàna), not clinging anymore, or, if 
      there still is clinging, it becomes less and less. There is this kind of 
      difference between the two ways of study and practice.</p>
      <p>When we talk about study, we can understand it like this: our eye is a 
      subject of study, our ear is a subject of study -- everything is a subject 
      of study. We can know that form is like this and like that, but we attach 
      to form and don't know the way out. We can distinguish sounds, but then we 
      attach to them. Forms, sounds, smells, tastes, bodily feelings and mental 
      impressions are all like a snare to entrap all beings.</p>
      <p>To investigate these things is our way of practising Dhamma. When some 
      feeling arises we turn to our understanding to appreciate it. If we are 
      knowledgeable regarding theory, we will immediately turn to that and see 
      how such and such a thing happens like this and then becomes that ... and 
      so on. If we haven't learned theory in this way, then we have just the 
      natural state of our mind to work with. This is our Dhamma. If we have 
      wisdom then we'll be able to examine this natural mind of ours and use 
      this as our subject of study. It's exactly the same thing. Our natural 
      mind is theory. The Buddha said to take whatever thoughts and feelings 
      arise and investigate them. Use the reality of our natural mind as our 
      theory. We rely on this reality.</p>
      <b>
      <p>Insight Meditation (Vipassanà)</p>
      </b>
      <p>If you have faith it doesn't matter whether you have studied theory or 
      not. If our believing mind leads us to develop practice, if it leads us to 
      constantly develop energy and patience, then study doesn't matter. We have 
      mindfulness as a foundation for our practice. We are mindful in all bodily 
      postures, whether sitting, standing, walking or lying. And if there is 
      mindfulness there will be clear comprehension to accompany it. Mindfulness 
      and clear comprehension will arise together. They may arise so rapidly, 
      however, that we can't tell them apart. But, when there is mindfulness, 
      there will also be clear comprehension.</p>
      <p>When our mind is firm and stable, mindfulness will arise quickly and 
      easily and this is also where we have wisdom. Sometimes, though, wisdom is 
      insufficient or doesn't arise at the right time. There may be mindfulness 
      and clear comprehension, but these alone are not enough to control the 
      situation. Generally, if mindfulness and clear comprehension are a 
      foundation of mind, then wisdom will be there to assist. However, we must 
      constantly develop this wisdom through the practice of Insight Meditation. 
      This means that whatever arises in the mind can be the object of 
      mindfulness and clear comprehension. But we must see according to Anicca, 
      Dukkha, Anattà. Impermanence (Anicca) is the basis. Dukkha refers to the 
      quality of unsatisfactoriness, and Anattà says that it is without 
      individual entity. We see that it's simply a sensation that has arisen, 
      that it has no self, no entity and that it disappears of its own accord. 
      Just that! Someone who is deluded, someone who doesn't have wisdom, will 
      miss this occasion, he won't be able to use these things to advantage.</p>
      <p>If wisdom is present then mindfulness and clear comprehension will be 
      right there with it. However, at this initial stage the wisdom may not be 
      perfectly clear. Thus mindfulness and clear comprehension aren't able to 
      catch every object, but wisdom comes to help. It can see what quality of 
      mindfulness there is and what kind of sensation has arisen. Or, in its 
      most general aspect, whatever mindfulness there is or whatever sensation 
      there is, it's all Dhamma.</p>
      <p>The Buddha took the practice of Insight Meditation as His foundation. 
      He saw that this mindfulness and clear comprehension were both uncertain 
      and unstable. Anything that's unstable, andwhich we want to have stable, 
      causes us to suffer. We want things to be according to our own desires, 
      but we must suffer because things just aren't that way. This is the 
      influence of an unclean mind, the influence of a mind which is lacking 
      wisdom.</p>
      <p>When we practise we tend to become caught up in wanting it easy, 
      wanting it to be the way we like it. We don't have to go very far to 
      understand about such an attitude. Merely look at this body! Is it ever 
      really the way we want it? One minute we like it to be one way and the 
      next minute we like it to be another way. Have we ever really had it the 
      way we liked? The nature of our bodies and minds is exactly the same in 
      this regard. It simply is the way it is.</p>
      <p>This point in our practice can be easily missed. Usually, whatever we 
      feel doesn't agree with us, we throw out; whatever doesn't please us, we 
      throw out. We don't stop to think whether the way we like and dislike 
      things is really the correct way or not. We merely think that the things 
      we find disagreeable must be wrong, and those which we find agreeable must 
      be right.</p>
      <p>This is where craving comes from. When we receive stimuli by way of 
      eye, ear, nose, tongue, body or mind, a feeling of liking or disliking 
      arises. This shows that the mind is full of attachment. So the Buddha gave 
      us this Teaching of Impermanence. He gave us a way to contemplate things. 
      If we cling to something which isn't permanent, then we'll experience 
      suffering. There's no reason why we should want to have these things in 
      accordance with our likes and dislikes. it isn't possible for us to make 
      things be that way. We don't have that kind of authority or power. 
      Regardless of however we may like things to be, everything is already the 
      way it is. Wanting like this is not the way out of suffering.</p>
      <p>Here we can see how the mind which is deluded understands in one way, 
      and the mind which is not deluded understands in another way. When the 
      mind with wisdom receives some sensation for example, it sees it as 
      something not to be clung to or identified with. This is what indicates 
      wisdom. If there isn't any wisdom then we merely follow our stupidity. 
      This stupidity is not seeing impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and 
      not-self. That which we like we see as good and right. That which we don't 
      like we see as not good. We can't arrive at Dhamma this way -- wisdom 
      cannot arise. If we can see this, then wisdom arises.</p>
      <p>The Buddha firmly established the practice of Insight Meditation in His 
      mind and used it to investigate all the various mental impressions. 
      Whatever arose in His mind He investigated like this: even though we like 
      it, it's uncertain. It's suffering, because these things which are 
      constantly rising and falling don't follow the influence of our minds. All 
      these things are not a being or a self, they don't belong to us. The 
      Buddha taught us to see them just as they are. It is this principle on 
      which we stand in practice.</p>
      <p>We understand then that we aren't able to just bring about various 
      moods as we wish. Both good moods and bad moods are going to come up. Some 
      of them are helpful and some of them are not. If we don't understand 
      rightly regarding these things, then we won't be able to judge correctly. 
      Rather we will go running after craving -- running off following our 
      desires.</p>
      <p>Sometimes we feel happy and sometimes we feel sad, but this is natural. 
      Sometimes we'll feel pleased and at other times disappointed. What we like 
      we hold as good, and what we don't like we hold as bad. In this way we 
      separate ourselves further and further and further from Dhamma. When this 
      happens, we aren't able to understand or recognize Dhamma, and thus we are 
      confused. Desires increase because our minds have nothing but delusion.</p>
      <p>This is how we talk about the mind. It isn't necessary to go far away 
      from ourselves to find understanding. We simply see that these states of 
      mind aren't permanent. We see that they are unsatisfactory and that they 
      aren't a permanent self. If we continue to develop our practice in this 
      way, we call it the practice of Vipassanà or Insight Meditation. We say 
      that it is recognizing the contents of our mind and in this way we develop 
      wisdom.</p>
      <b>
      <p>Samatha (Calm) Meditation.</p>
      </b>
      <p>Our practice of Samatha is like this: We establish the practice of 
      mindfulness on the in-and out-breath, for example, as a foundation or 
      means of controlling the mind. By having the mind follow the flow of the 
      breath it becomes steadfast, calm and still. This practice of calming the 
      mind is called Samatha Meditation. It's necessary to do a lot of this kind 
      of practice because the mind is full of many disturbances. It's very 
      confused. We can't say how many years or how many lives it's been this 
      way. If we sit and contemplate we'll see that there's a lot that doesn't 
      conduce to peace and calm and a lot that leads to confusion!</p>
      <p>For this reason the Buddha taught that we must find a meditation 
      subject which is suitable to our particular tendencies, a way of practice 
      which is right for our character. For example, going over and over the 
      parts of the body: hair of the head, hair of the body, nails, teeth and 
      skin, can be very calming. The mind can become very peaceful from this 
      practice. If contemplating these five things leads to calm, it's because 
      they are appropriate objects for contemplation according to our 
      tendencies. Whatever we find to be appropriate in this way, we can 
      consider to be our practice and use it to subdue the defilements.</p>
      <p>Another example is recollection of death. For those who still have 
      strong greed, aversion and delusion and find them difficult to contain, 
      it's useful to take this subject of personal death as a meditation. We'll 
      come to see that everybody has to die, whether rich or poor. We'll see 
      both good and evil people die. Everybody must die! Developing this 
      practice we find that an attitude of dispassion arises. The more we 
      practise the easier our sitting produces calm. This is because it's a 
      suitable and appropriate practice for us. If this practice of Calm 
      Meditation is not agreeable to our particular tendencies, it won't produce 
      this attitude of dispassion. if the object is truly suited to us then 
      we'll find it arising regularly, without great difficulty, and we'll find 
      ourselves thinking about it often.</p>
      <p>Regarding this we can see an example in our everyday lives. When lay 
      people bring trays of many different types of food to offer the monks, we 
      taste them all to see which we like. When we have tried each one we can 
      tell which is most agreeable to us. This is just an example. That which we 
      find agreeable to our taste we'll eat, we find that most suitable. We 
      won't bother about the other various dishes.</p>
      <p>The practice of concentrating our attention on the in-and out-breath is 
      an example of a type of meditation which is suitable for us all. It seems 
      that when we go around doing various different practices, we don't feel so 
      good. </p>
      <p>But as soon as we sit and observe our breath we have a good feeling, we 
      can see it clearly. There's no need to go looking far away, we can use 
      what is close to us and this will be better for us. Just watch the breath. 
      It goes out and comes in, out and in -- we watch it like this. For a long 
      time we keep watching our breathing in and out and slowly our mind 
      settles. Other activity will arise but we feel like it is distant from us. 
      Just like when we live apart from each other and don't feel so close 
      anymore. We don't have the same strong contact anymore or perhaps no 
      contact at all.</p>
      <p>When we have a feeling for this practice of mindfulness of breathing, 
      it becomes easier. If we keep on with this practice we gain experience and 
      become skilled at knowing the nature of the breath. We'll know what it's 
      like when it's long and what it's like when it's short.</p>
      <p>Looking at it one way we can talk about the food of the breath. While 
      sitting or walking we breathe, while sleeping we breathe, while awake we 
      breathe. If we don't breathe then we die. If we think about it we see that 
      we exist only with the help of food. If we don't eat ordinary food for ten 
      minutes, an hour or even a day, it doesn't matter. This is a coarse kind 
      of food. However, if we don't breathe for even a short time we'll die. If 
      we don't breathe for five or ten minutes we would be dead. Try it!</p>
      <p>One who is practising mindfulness of breathing should have this kind of 
      understanding. The knowledge that comes from this practice is indeed 
      wonderful. If we don't contemplate then we won't see the breath as food, 
      but actually we are &quot;eating&quot; air all the time, in, out, in, out ... all 
      the time. Also you'll find that the more you contemplate in this way, the 
      greater the benefits derived from the practice and the more delicate the 
      breath becomes. It may even happen that the breath stops. It appears as if 
      we aren't breathing at all. Actually, the breath is passing through the 
      pores of the skin. This is called the &quot;delicate breath&quot;. When our mind is 
      perfectly calm, normal breathing can cease in this way. We need not be at 
      all startled or afraid. If there's no breathing what should we do? Just 
      know it! Know that there is no breathing, that's all. This is the right 
      practice here.</p>
      <p>Here we are talking about the way of Samatha practice, the practice of 
      developing calm. If the object which we are using is right and appropriate 
      for us, it will lead to this kind of experience. This is the beginning, 
      but there is enough in this practice to take us all the way, or at least 
      to where we can see clearly and continue in strong faith. If we keep on 
      with contemplation in this manner, energy will come to us. This is similar 
      to the water in an urn. We put in water and keep it topped up. We keep on 
      filling the urn with water and thereby the insects which live in the water 
      don't die. Making effort and doing our everyday practice is just like 
      this. It all comes back to practice. We feel very good and peaceful.</p>
      <p>This peacefulness comes from our one-pointed state of mind. This 
      one-pointed state of mind, however, can be very troublesome, since we 
      don't want other mental states to disturb us. Actually, other mental 
      states do come and, if we think about it, that in itself can be the 
      one-pointed state of mind. </p>
      <p>It's like when we see various men and women, but we don't have the same 
      feeling about them as we do about our mother and father. In reality all 
      men are male just like our father and all women are female just like our 
      mother, but we don't have the same feeling about them. We feel that our 
      parents are more important. They hold greater value for us.</p>
      <p>This is how it should be with our one-pointed state of mind. </p>
      <p>We should have the same attitude towards it as we would have towards 
      our own mother and father. All other activity which arises we appreciate 
      in the same way as we feel towards men and women in general. </p>
      <p>We don't stop seeing them, we simply acknowledge their presence and 
      don't ascribe to them the same value as our parents.</p>
      <b>
      <p>Undoing the Knot.</p>
      </b>
      <p>When our practice of Samatha arrives at calm, the mind will be clear 
      and bright. The activity of mind will become less and less. The various 
      mental impressions which arise will be fewer. When this happens great 
      peace and happiness will arise, but we may attach to that happiness. We 
      should contemplate that happiness as uncertain. We should also contemplate 
      unhappiness as uncertain and impermanent. We'll understand that all the 
      various feelings are not lasting and not to be clung to. We see things in 
      this way because there's wisdom. We'll understand that things are this way 
      according to their nature. </p>
      <p>If we have this kind of understanding it's like taking hold of one 
      strand of a rope which makes up a knot. If we pull it in the right 
      direction, the knot will loosen and begin to untangle. It'll no longer be 
      so tight or so tense. This is similar to understanding that it doesn't 
      always have to be this way. Before, we felt that things would always be 
      the way they were and, in so doing, we pulled the knot tighter and 
      tighter. This tightness is suffering. Living that way is very tense. So we 
      loosen the knot a little and relax. Why do we loosen it? Because it's 
      tight! If we don't cling to it then we can loosen it. It's not a permanent 
      condition that must always be that way.</p>
      <p>We use the Teaching of Impermanence as our basis. We see that both 
      happiness and unhappiness are not permanent. We see them as not 
      dependable. There is absolutely nothing that's permanent. With this kind 
      of understanding we gradually stop believing in the various moods and 
      feelings which come up in the mind. Wrong understanding will decrease to 
      the same degree that we stop believing in it. This is what is meant by 
      undoing the knot. It continues to become looser. Attachment will be 
      gradually uprooted.</p>
      <b>
      <p>Disenchantment</p>
      </b>
      <p>When we come to see impermanence, unsatisfactori-ness and not-self in 
      ourselves, in this body and mind, in this world, then we'll find that a 
      kind of boredom will arise. This isn't the everyday boredom that makes us 
      feel like not wanting to know or see or say anything, or not wanting to 
      have anything to do with anybody at all. That isn't real boredom, it still 
      has attachment, we still don't understand. We still have feelings of envy 
      and resentment and are still clinging to the things which cause us 
      suffering.</p>
      <p>The kind of boredom which the Buddha talked about is a condition 
      without anger or lust. It arises out of seeing everything as impermanent. 
      When pleasant feeling arises in our mind, we see that it isn't lasting. 
      This is the kind of boredom we have. We call it Nibbidà or disenchantment. 
      That means that it's far from sensual craving and passion. We see nothing 
      as being worthy of desire. Whether or not things accord with our likes and 
      dislikes, it doesn't matter to us, we don't identify with them. We don't 
      give them any special value.</p>
      <p>Practising like this we don't give things reason to cause us 
      difficulty. We have seen suffering and have seen that identifying with 
      moods can not give rise to any real happiness. It causes clinging to 
      happiness and unhappiness and clinging to liking and disliking, which is 
      in itself the cause of suffering. When we are still clinging like this we 
      don't have an even-minded attitude towards things. Some states of mind we 
      like and others we dislike. If we are still liking and disliking, then 
      both happiness and unhappiness are suffering. It's this kind of attachment 
      which causes suffering. The Buddha taught that whatever causes us 
      suffering is in itself unsatisfactory.</p>
      <b>
      <p>The Four Noble Truths</p>
      </b>
      <p>Hence we understand that the Buddha's Teaching is to know suffering and 
      to know what causes it to arise. And further, we should know freedom from 
      suffering and the way of practice which leads to freedom. He taught us to 
      know just these four things. When we understand these four things we'll be 
      able to recognize suffering when it arises and will know that it has a 
      cause. We'll know that it didn't just drift in! When we wish to be free 
      from this suffering, we'll be able to eliminate its cause.</p>
      <p>Why do we have this feeling of suffering, this feeling of 
      unsatisfactoriness? We'll see that it's because we are clinging to our 
      various likes and dislikes. We come to know that we are suffering because 
      of our own actions. We suffer because we ascribe value to things. So we 
      say, know suffering, know the cause of suffering, know freedom from 
      suffering and know the Way to this freedom. When we know about suffering 
      we keep untangling the knot. But we must be sure to untangle it by pulling 
      in the right direction. That is to say, we must know that this is how 
      things are. Attachment will be torn out. This is the practice which puts 
      an end to our suffering.</p>
      <p>Know suffering, know the cause of suffering, know freedom from 
      suffering and know the Path which leads out of suffering. This is Magga 
      (Path). It goes like this: Right View, Right Thought, Right Speech, Right 
      Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, Right 
      Concentration. When we have the right understanding regarding these 
      things, then we have the Path. These things can put an end <u>to</u> 
      suffering. They lead us to morality, concentration and wisdom (Sìla, 
      Samàdhi, Pannà).</p>
      <p>We must clearly understand these four things. We must want to 
      understand. We must want to see these things in terms of reality. When we 
      see these four things we call this Sacca Dhamma. Whether we look inside or 
      in front or to the right or left, all we see is Sacca Dhamma. We simply 
      see that everything is the way it is. For someone who has arrived at 
      Dhamma, someone who really understands Dhamma, wherever he goes, 
      everything will be Dhamma.</p>
