      <p>(A brief talk given as final instruction to an elderly Englishwoman who 
      spent two months under the guidance of Ajahn Chah at the end of 1978 and 
      beginning of 1979.)</p>
      </i></font><font SIZE="6">
      <p>T</font>his short talk is for the benefit of a <i>new </i>disciple who 
      will soon be returning to London. May it serve to help you understand the 
      Teaching that you have studied here at Wat Pah Pong. Most simply, this is 
      the practice to be free of suffering in the cycle of birth and death.</p>
      <p>In order to do this practice, remember to regard all the various 
      activities of mind, all those you like and all those you dislike, in the 
      same way as you would regard a cobra. The cobra is an extremely poisonous 
      snake, poisonous enough to cause death if it should bite us. And so, also, 
      it is with our moods: the moods that we like are poisonous, the moods that 
      we dislike are also poisonous. They prevent our minds from being free and 
      hinder our understanding of the Truth as it was taught by the Buddha.</p>
      <p>Thus it is necessary to try to maintain our mindfulness throughout the 
      day and night. Whatever you may be doing, be it standing, sitting, lying 
      down, speaking or whatever, you should do with mindfulness. When you are 
      able to establish this mindfulness, you'll find that there will arise 
      clear comprehension associated with it, and these two conditions will 
      bring about wisdom. Thus mindfulness, clear comprehension and wisdom will 
      work together, and you'll be like one who is <i>awake </i>both day and 
      night.</p>
      <p>These Teachings left us by the Buddha are not Teachings to be just 
      listened to, or simply absorbed on an intellectual level. They are 
      Teachings that through practice can be made to arise and known in our 
      hearts. Wherever we go, whatever we do, we should have these Teachings. 
      And what we mean by &quot;to have these Teachings&quot; or &quot;to have the Truth&quot;, is 
      that, whatever we do or say, we do and say with wisdom. When we think and 
      contemplate, we do so with wisdom. </p>
      <p>We say that one who has mindfulness and clear comprehension combined in 
      this way with wisdom, is one who is close to the Buddha. </p>
      <p>When you leave here, you should practise bringing everything back to 
      your own mind. Look at your mind with this mindfulness and clear 
      comprehension and develop this wisdom. With these three conditions there 
      will arise a &quot;letting go&quot;. You'll know the constant arising and passing 
      away of all phenomena.</p>
      <p>You should know that that which is arising and passing away is only the 
      activity of mind. When something arises, it passes away and is followed by 
      further arising and passing away. </p>
      <p>In the Way of Dhamma we call this arising and passing away &quot;birth and 
      death&quot;; and this is everything -- this is all there is! When suffering has 
      arisen, it passes away, and, when it has passed away, suffering arises 
      again [*]. There's just suffering arising and passing away. When you see 
      this much, you'll be able to know constantly this arising and passing 
      away; and, when your knowing is constant, you'll see that this is really 
      all there is. Everything is just birth and death. It's not as if there is 
      anything which carries on. There's just this arising and passing away as 
      it is --that's all.</p>
      <dir>
        <i>
        <p>[*] Suffering in this context refers to the implicit 
        unsatisfactoriness of all compounded existence as distinct from 
        suffering as merely the opposite of happiness.</p>
      </dir>
      </i>
      <p>This kind of seeing will give rise to a tranquil feeling of dispassion 
      towards the world. Such a feeling arises when we see that actually there 
      is nothing worth wanting; there is only arising and passing away, a being 
      born followed by a dying. This is when the mind arrives at &quot;letting go&quot;, 
      letting everything go according to its own nature. Things arise and pass 
      away in our mind, and we know. When happiness arises, we know; when 
      dissatisfaction arises, we know. And this &quot;knowing happiness&quot; means that 
      we don't identify with it as being <i>ours .</i> And likewise with 
      dissatisfaction and unhappiness, we don't identify with them as being <i>
      ours .</i> When we no longer identify with and cling to happiness and 
      suffering, we are simply left with the natural way of things.</p>
      <p>So we say that mental activity is like the deadly poisonous cobra. If 
      we don't interfere with a cobra, it simply goes its own way. Even though 
      it may be extremely poisonous, we are not affected by it; we don't go near 
      it or take hold of it, and it doesn't bite us. The cobra does what is 
      natural for a cobra to do. That's the way it is. If you are clever you'll 
      leave it alone. And so you let be that which is good. You also let be that 
      which is not good -- let it be according to its own nature. Let be your 
      liking and your disliking, the same way as you don't interfere with the 
      cobra.</p>
      <p>So, one who is intelligent will have this kind of attitude towards the 
      various moods that arise in the mind. When goodness arises, we let it be 
      good, but we know also. We understand its nature. And, too, we let be the 
      not-good, we let it be according to its nature. We don't take hold of it 
      because we don't want anything. We don't want evil, neither do we want 
      good. We want neither heaviness nor lightness, happiness nor suffering. 
      When, in this way, our wanting is at an end, peace is firmly established.</p>
      <p>When we have this kind of peace established in our minds, we can depend 
      on it. This peace, we say, has arisen out of confusion. Confusion has 
      ended. The Buddha called the attainment of final Enlightenment an 
      &quot;extinguishing&quot;, in the same way that fire is extinguished. We extinguish 
      fire at the place at which it appears. Wherever it is hot, that's where we 
      can make it cool. And so it is with Enlightenment. Nibbàna is found in 
      Samsàra [*]. Enlightenment and delusion (Samsàra) exist in the same place, 
      just as do hot and cold. It's hot where it was cold and cold where it was 
      hot. When heat arises, the coolness disappears, and when there is 
      coolness, there's no more heat. In this way Nibbàna and Samsàra are the 
      same.</p>
      <dir>
        <i>
        <p>[*] Samsàra: lit. perpetual wandering, is a name by which is 
        designated the sea of life ever restlessly heaving up and down, the 
        symbol of this continuous process of ever again and again being born, 
        growing old, suffering and dying.</p>
      </dir>
      </i>
      <p>We are told to put an end to Samsàra, which means to stop the 
      ever-turning cycle of confusion. This putting an end to confusion is 
      extinguishing the fire. When external fire is extinguished there is 
      coolness. When the internal fires of sensual craving, aversion and 
      delusion are put out, then this is <i>coolness </i>also<i>.</p>
      </i>
      <p>This is the nature of Enlightenment; it's the extinguishing of fire, 
      the cooling of that which was hot. This is peace. This is the end of 
      Samsàra, the cycle of birth and death. When you arrive at Enlightenment, 
      this is how it is. It's an ending of the ever-turning and ever-changing, 
      an ending of greed, aversion and delusion in our minds. We talk about it 
      in terms of happiness because this is how worldly people understand the <i>
      ideal </i>to be, but in reality it has gone beyond. It is beyond both 
      happiness and suffering. It's perfect peace.</p>
      <p ALIGN="CENTER">* * *</p>
      <p>So as you go you should take this Teaching which I have given you and 
      contemplate it carefully. Your stay here hasn't been easy and I have had 
      little opportunity to give you instruction, but in this time you have been 
      able to study the real meaning of our practice. May this practice lead you 
      to happiness; may it help you grow in<b> </b>Truth. May you be freed from 
      the suffering of birth and death.</p>
