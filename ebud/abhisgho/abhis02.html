    </i><b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Introduction</font></p>
    </b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the 89 types of consciousness,
    enumerated in the first chapter, 52 mental states arise in varying degree. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There are 7 concomitants common to every
    consciousness. There are 6 others that may or may not arise in each and every
    consciousness. They are termed <i>Pakinnaka</i> (Particulars). </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">All these 13 are designated <i>aññasamana,</i>
    a rather peculiar technical term. <i>Añña</i> means 'other', <i>samana</i> means
    'common'. <i>Sobhanas,</i> (Good), when compared with <i>asobhanas</i> (Evil,) are called <i>añña</i>
    - 'other', being of the opposite category. So are the <i>asobhanas</i> in
    contradistinction to <i>Sobhanas</i>. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These 13 become moral or immoral according to
    the type of consciousness in which they occur. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">14 concomitants are variably found in every
    type of immoral consciousness. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">19 are common to all types of moral
    consciousness. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">6 other moral concomitants occur as occasion
    arises. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Thus these fifty-two (7 + 6 + 14 + 19 + 6 =
    52) are found in the respective types of consciousness in different proportions. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In this chapter all the 52 mental states are
    enumerated and classified. Every type of consciousness is microscopically analyzed, and
    the accompanying mental states are given in detail. The type of consciousness in which
    each mental state occurs, is also described. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To an impatient lay reader this chapter will
    appear rather dry and uninteresting. To a critical and intelligent reader it will, on the
    contrary, serve as an intellectual treat. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">At the outset, for instance, a student of
    chemistry may find the numerous chemical formulas somewhat perplexing. But he finds the
    subject interesting and edifying, when he seriously attempts to analyze and examine the
    various substances with different tests. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In like manner a student of Abhidhamma who
    reads this chapter should first try to analyze and examine care fully every type of
    consciousness and see for himself the mental states thereof according to his own
    reasoning. Later, he should compare his results with the original text. He will then find
    this chapter most illuminating, and instead of wasting time in memorizing numbers, he will
    intelligently grasp the meaning of the text. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">For example, let us analyze the first immoral
    type of consciousness, rooted in attachment. </font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Somanassa-sahagata -</i> Accompanied by
    pleasure,</font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Ditthigata-sampayutta -</i> Connected with
    misbelief,</font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Asankharika -</i> Unprompted. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This consciousness, when analyzed, will show
    that the <i>vedana</i> or feeling is pleasure'. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The 7 Universals and all the Particulars are
    found in it.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The 4 Immoral mental states common to all
    immorals such as <i>moha</i> (delusion), <i>ahirika</i> (shamelessness), <i>anottappa,</i>
    (fearlessness), and <i>uddhacca</i> (restlessness) must arise in it. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">What about the remaining ten? </font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Lobha</i> - attachment must arise. </font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Ditthi</i> - misbelief must arise. </font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Mana</i> - conceit cannot arise. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Conceit does not arise in <i>lobha</i>
    consciousness, together with misbelief. <i>Ditthi</i> is connected with wrong view, while <i>mana</i>
    is concerned with egoism. Both of them, say the commentators, are like two lions that
    cannot live together in one cave. </font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Dosa</i> (hatred), <i>issa</i> (envy), <i>macchariya</i>
    (avarice), and <i>kukkucca</i> (brooding) cannot arise, because these four are akin to
    aversion. They are found only in hateful consciousness.</font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Thina</i> and <i>middha</i> - (sloth and
    torpor) do not arise because this is an unprompted consciousness. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">No <i>sobhanas</i> - (beautiful) occur in an
    immoral consciousness. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Total - 7 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 19. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, on analysis, we see that the first
    immoral consciousness consists of 19 mental states. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The other types of consciousness should be
    similarly analyzed. </font></p>

    concomitants. Both consciousness and its respective co-adjuncts arise and perish
    simultaneously. But there are some material qualities such as <i>viññatti rupa*</i>
    (Modes of Intimation) - that arise and perish simultaneously with the consciousness. To
    exclude them the third property of having a common object has been attributed. That which
    possesses these three characteristics must necessarily be endowed with the fourth - a

    </b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">2. <b>Phassa</b>- Derived from <i>phas,</i>
    to contact.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">For any sense-impression to occur, three
    things are essential - namely, consciousness, respective sense and the object. For
    instance, one sees an object with the consciousness through the eye as its instrument. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When an object presents itself to the
    consciousness through one of the six senses there arises the mental state-contact.
    &quot;It should not be understood that mere collision is contact<i> (Na sangatimatto eva
    Phasso). </font></p>
    </i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Like a pillar which acts as a strong
    support to the rest of the structure, even so is contact to the coexistent mental
    concomitants. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Contact means 'it touches' <i>(phusati'ti).</i>
    It has touching <i>(phusana)</i> as its salient characteristic <i>(lakkhana), </i>impact <i>(sanghattana)</i>
    as its function <i>(rasa), </i>coinciding (of the physical basis, object and
    consciousness) as its manifestation <i>(sannipata paccupatthana),</i> and the object which
    has entered the avenue (of awareness) as proximate cause <i>(padatthana).&quot;</i> </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Contact is mentioned first because it
    precedes all other mental states. &quot;Touching by contact, consciousness experiences by
    feeling, perceives by perception, wills by volition - <i>(Phassena phusitva, vedanaya
    vediyati, saññaya sañjanati, cetanaya ceteti)&quot;.</i> According to <i>Paticca-Samuppada,</i>
    too, Contact conditions Feeling. But strictly speaking, there is no reason for the
    sequence because all these mental states are coexistent. The Atthasalini states -
    &quot;For of states, arisen in one conscious moment, it is not valid to say that 'this'
    arises first, 'that' afterwards. The reason is not because contact is a strong support.
    Contact is just mentioned first in the order of teaching, but it was also permissible to
    bring it in thus: - There are feeling and contact, perception and contact, volition and
    contact; there are consciousness and contact, feeling, perception, volition, initial
    application of mind. In the order of teaching, however, contact is mentioned first. Nor is
    the sequence of words among the remaining states of any special significance.&quot; </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Contact is given priority of place, as
    standing for the inception of the thought, and as the sine qua non of all the allied
    states, conditioning them much as the roof-tree of a storeyed house supports all the other
    combinations of material.&quot; -- (Mrs. Rhys Davids - Buddhist Psychology, p. 6.) </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">3. <b>Vedana</b> - Derived from <i>vid,</i>
    to experience. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Feeling is a more appropriate rendering for <i>vedana</i>
    than sensation. Like contact, feeling is an essential property of every consciousness. It
    may be pleasurable painful, or neutral. Pain and pleasure pertain to body as well. But
    physical feeling is not of ethical importance. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to the commentators feeling is like
    a master who enjoys a dish prepared by a cook. The latter is compared to the remaining
    mental states that constitute a thought-complex. Strictly speaking, it is feeling that
    experiences an object when it comes in contact with the senses. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is this feeling that experiences the
    desirable or undesirable fruits of an action done in this or in a previous birth. Besides
    this mental state there is no soul or any other agent to experience the result of the
    action. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It should be understood here that Nibbanic
    bliss is not connected with feeling. Nibbanic bliss is certainly the highest happiness <i>(sukha),</i>
    but it is the happiness of relief from suffering. It is not the enjoyment of a pleasurable
    object. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">4. <b>Sañña</b> - <i>Sam</i> + <i>ña,</i>
    to know, (Compare Latin cognoscere, to know.)</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The meaning of this term widely varies
    according to the context. To avoid unnecessary confusion, it is best to understand the
    specific meaning used in the particular connection as a universal mental state. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The chief characteristic of <i>sañña</i> is
    the cognition of an object by way of a mark as blue etc. It is <i>sañña</i> that enables
    one to recognize an object that has once been perceived by the mind through the senses.
    &quot;Its procedure is likened to the carpenter's recognition of certain kinds of wood by
    the mark he had made on each; to the treasurer's specifying certain articles of jewelry by
    the ticket on each; to the wild animal's discernment in the scarecrow of the work of
    man.&quot; </font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sañña,</i> therefore, means simple sense
    perception.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Perception,&quot; according to a modern
    Dictionary of Philosophy, &quot;is the apprehension of ordinary sense-objects, such as
    trees, houses, chairs, etc., on the occasion of sensory stimulation.&quot; </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Perception is not used here in the sense
    employed by early modern philosophers such as Bacon, Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As one of the five <i>khandhas</i>
    (Aggregates) <i>sañña</i> is used in the sense of perception. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Could it be that memory is due to this <i>sañña?
    </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sañña, viññana</i> and <i>pañña</i>
    should be differentiated from one another. <i>Sañña</i> is like the mere perception of a
    rupee coin by a child. By its whiteness, roundness and size it merely recognizes the coin
    as a rupee, utterly ignorant of its monetary value. A man, for instance, discerns its
    value and its utility, but is not aware of its chemical composition. <i>Viññana</i> is
    comparable to the ordinary man's knowledge of the rupee. <i>Pañña</i> is like the
    analytical knowledge of a chemist who knows all its chemical properties in every detail. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">5. <b>Cetana</b> - </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Both <i>cetana</i> and <i>citta</i> are
    derived from the same root <i>cit,</i> to think. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the case of <i>citta</i> - mind or
    consciousness - the root assumes the meaning of discernment <i>(vijanana),</i> while in <i>cetana</i>
    it is used in the sense of co-ordination <i>(abhisandhana) </i>and accumulation <i>(ayuhana).</font></p>
    </i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to the Atthasalini and
    Vibhavini Tika <i>cetana</i> is that which co-ordinates the mental states associated with
    itself on the object of consciousness. <i>(Attana sampayutta-dhamme arammane
    abhisandahati). </i>Like a chief disciple, or like a carpenter who fulfills his duties and
    regulates the work of others as well, so does <i>cetana</i> fulfill its own function and
    regulate the function of other concomitants associated with itself.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A further explanation has been offered. <i>Cetana</i>
    is that which arrives at action in conditioning the conditioned. <i>(Sankhatabhisankharane
    va byaparam apajjati'ti cetana).</i> <i>Cetana</i> is that which plays a predominant part
    in all actions, moral and immoral.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Shwe Zan Aung says that according to Ledi
    Sayadaw, the Burmese Abhidhamma scholar, &quot;Cetana acts on its concomitants, acts in
    getting the object, and acts on accomplishing the task, i.e., determines action.&quot;
    (Compendium, p. 236).</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The most significant mental state in the
    Mundane Consciousness <i>(lokiya)</i> is this <i>cetana,</i> while in the Supra mundane it
    is <i>pañña,</i> wisdom or insight. Mundane thoughts tend to accumulate Kamma. Supra
    mundane thoughts, on the contrary, tend to eradicate Kamma. Hence <i>cetana</i> in the
    supra mundane consciousness does not constitute Kamma. <i>Cetana</i> in every moral and
    immoral type of mundane consciousness, on the other hand, is regarded as Kamma. Although <i>Cetana</i>
    is found in <i>Vipaka</i> types of consciousness too, it is of no moral significance as it
    lacks accumulative power. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is this <i>cetana</i> that is alluded to
    as <i>sankhara</i> and (Kamma) <i>bhava</i> in the <i>Paticca Samuppada.</i> In the <i>pañcakkhandha,</i>
    by <i>sankharakkhandha</i> are meant the fifty mental states, excluding <i>vedana</i> and <i>sañña,</i>
    with <i>cetana</i> as the foremost. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">From a psychological standpoint <i>cetana</i>
    determines the activities of the mental states associated with it. From an ethical
    standpoint, it determines its inevitable consequences. Hence where there is no <i>cetana,</i>
    there is no Kamma. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">6. <b>Ekaggata</b> - </font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Eka + agga + ta</i> = one-pointedness, or
    concentration on one object, or focusing the mind on one object. It is like a steady
    lamp-flame in a windless place. It is like a firmly fixed pillar that cannot be shaken by
    the wind. It is like water that binds together several substances to form one concrete
    compound. This mental state prevents its adjuncts from dissipation and fixes them on one
    object. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This one-pointedness is one of the five Jhana
    factors. When it is developed and cultivated it is designated <i>samadhi.</i> &quot;It is
    the germ of all attentive, selected, focused, or concentrated consciousness.&quot;
    (Compendium, p. 241). </font></p>

    controls its co-associates. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Although <i>cetana</i> determines the

    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Jivitindriya</i> is twofold - namely,

    </i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There is a certain kind of <i>rupa-jivitindriya</i>
    in plant life. But, <i>rupa-jivitindriya</i> in men and animals is differentiated from

    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Both <i>nama-jivitindriya</i> and <i>rupa-jivitindriya</i>
    arise at the moment of conception. They simultaneously perish at the moment of decease.
    Hence death is regarded as the perishing of this <i>jivitindriya.</i> Immediately after,
    due to the power of Kamma, another <i>nama-jivitindriya</i> arises in the subsequent birth
    at the moment of conception. Simultaneous with the arising of the one <i>nama-jivitindriya</i>
    there arise three <i>rupa-jivitindriyas</i> in the case of a human being.* </font></p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">8. <b>Manasikara</b> - </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The literal meaning of the term is 'making in
    the mind'. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Turning the mind towards the object is the
    chief characteristic of <i>manasikara.</i> It is like the rudder of a ship, which is
    indispensable to take her directly to her destination. Mind without <i>manasikara</i> is
    like a rudderless ship. </font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Manasikara</i> is also compared to a
    charioteer that sits with close attention on two well-trained horses (mind and object) as
    regards their rhythmical movements. <i>Manasikara</i> should be distinguished from <i>vitakka</i>
    which is to follow. The former directs its concomitants to the object, while the latter
    applies or throws <i>(pakkhipanto viya) </i>them on the object. <i>Vitakka</i> is like a
    favorite courtier that introduces a villager (mind) into the presence of a king (object). </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Attention is the closest equivalent to <i>manasikara,</i>
    although the Pali term does not fully connote the meaning attached to the English word
    from a strictly philosophical standpoint. As a mental state it is mere spontaneous
    attention. In <i>manasikara,</i> as in attention, there is no peculiar vividness or
    clarity. To <i>sañña</i> may be attributed this vividness to some extent. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Could <i>manasikara</i> also be an aid to

    Abhidhamma. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the Sutta Pitaka it has been employed in

    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">'Lifting' of the concomitants to the object <i>(abhiniropana)</i>
    is its chief characteristic. As someone ascends to the king's palace depending on a king's

    (Atthasalini, p. 114). </font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Vitakka</i> may well be defined as the

    two <i>cetasikas</i> should be clearly understood. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Different values are attached to <i>vitakka</i>
    when it is used in different connections. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As an ordinary particular <i>(pakinnaka)</i>
    mental state it is simply called <i>vitakka.</i> When it is developed and cultivated it
    becomes the foremost factor of the First Jhana. Then it is termed <i>appana</i> because
    the mind is steadfastly fixed on the object. The ordinary <i>vitakka</i> simply throws the
    mind to the surface of the object. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the subsequent Jhanas <i>vitakka</i> is,
    however, inhibited, owing to the habitual association with the object. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A villager, for instance, who visits the
    king's palace for the first time, needs the introduction of a favorite courtier. For his

    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is this developed <i>appana-vitakka</i>
    that is known as <i>samadhi</i> or concentration. </font></p>

    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Vitakka</i> is used in entirely a

    is fourfold, viz., the idea of what is due to one's birth, age, worth, and education.
    Thus, one having <i>hiri</i> will think 'Only mean folk (fishers etc.) children, poor
    wretches, the blind and ignorant, would do such an act,' and refrains. The external source
    of <i>ottappa</i> is, the idea that 'the body of the faithful will blame you,' and hence
    one refrains. If a man has <i>hiri,</i> he is, as said the Buddha, his own best master. To
    one who is sensitive by way of <i>ottappa,</i> the masters of the faith are the best
    guides.&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In a supplementary paragraph the 'marks'
    (consistency etc.) are thus explained: 'In <i>hiri</i> one reflects on the worth of one's
    birth, one's teacher, one's estate, and one's fellow students. In <i>ottappa</i> one feels
    dread at self-reproach, the blame of others, chastisement, and retribution in another
    life.&quot; -- (Buddhist Psychology, p. 20). </font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Hiri</i> and <i>ottappa</i> are regarded

    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In some rare instances <i>uddhacca</i> is

    to establish, to place, to put. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sanskrit <i>sraddha</i> is composed of <i>Srat</i>
    = faith + <i>dha</i> to establish. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to Pali, <i>saddha</i> is
    well-established confidence in the Buddha, Dhamma, and the Sangha. Purification <i>(sampasadana)</i>
    of its mental associates is its chief characteristic. It is compared to the
    water-purifying gem of the universal monarch. This particular gem, when thrown into water,
    causes mud and water-weeds to subside. The water is consequently purified. In the same way
    <i>saddha</i> purifies the mind of its stains. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This <i>saddha</i> is not blind faith. It is
    confidence based on knowledge. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One might question whether a non-Buddhist
    could also possess this <i>saddha. </font></p>
    </i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Atthasalini raises this very question and
    provides an answer which is rather unsatisfactory and inadequate. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Do men of false opinions not believe in
    their own teachers?&quot; questions Venerable Buddhaghosa. His answer is:-</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;They do. But that is not <i>saddha,</i>
    it is a mere acquiescence in words <i>(vacana-sampaticchana-mattameva)&quot;. </font></p>
    </i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If <i>saddha</i> is limited only to
    Buddhists, what shall we say when a non-Buddhist places his faith or confidence in his
    teacher? Surely his mind also gets purified to some extent when he thinks of his
    particular religious teacher.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Could it be <i>ditthi</i> - false view? Then
    it is immoral <i>(akusala).</i> In such a case there is no occasion for a non-Buddhist to
    experience a moral consciousness. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Would it not be more correct to say that <i>saddha</i>
    is mere confidence or faith, instead of restricting it to the Triple Gem? </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Dhammasangani explains <i>saddha</i> as
    follows:-</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The faith which on that occasion is
    trusting in, the professing confidence in, the sense of assurance, faith, faith as a
    faculty and as a power&quot;. -- (Buddhist Psychology, p. 14.)</font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Saddha</i> is also apprehension

    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">30. <b>Sati</b> - Derived from <i>sar,</i> to
    remember. </font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sati</i> does not exactly correspond to
    the Western conception of memory. Mindfulness is a better equivalent for <i>sati.</i> It
    has to be developed. In the Satipatthana Sutta are described in detail various methods to
    develop this <i>sati.</i> When it is highly developed one acquires the power of
    remembering past births. It is this <i>sati</i> that is regarded as one of the factors of
    the Noble Eightfold Path. </font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sati</i> tends to present before oneself
    good things without allowing them to be forgotten. Its chief characteristic is 'not
    floating away' <i>(apilapana).</i> Unlike pumpkins and pots that float on water, <i>sati</i>
    plunges into the object of thought. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It should be noted that this particular <i>sati</i>
    is not found in immoral types of consciousness. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">What is found in immoral consciousness is <i>miccha
    sati</i> (wrong mindfulness). </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Dhammasangani explains <i>sati</i> as
    follows:-</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The mindfulness which on that occasion
    is recollecting, calling back to mind; the mindfulness which is remembering, bearing in
    mind, the opposite of superficiality and of obliviousness; mindfulness as faculty;
    mindfulness as power, right mindfulness&quot;. -- (Buddhist Psychology, p. 16). </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Commenting on <i>sati,</i> Mrs. Rhys Davids
    says:-</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Buddhaghosa's comment on <i>sati,</i>
    in which he closely follows and enlarges on the account in Mil. 37, 38, shows that the
    traditional conception of that aspect of consciousness had much in common with the Western
    modern theory of conscience or moral sense. <i>Sati</i> appears under the metaphor of an
    inward mentor, discriminating between good and bad and prompting choice. Hardy went so far
    as to render it by 'conscience', but this slurs over the interesting divergence's between
    Eastern and Western thought. The former is quite unmystical of the subject of <i>sati.</i>
    It takes the psychological process or representative functioning (without bringing out the
    distinction between bare memory and judgment), and presents the same under an ethical
    aspect&quot;. -- (Buddhist Psychology, p. 16).</font></p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This is opposed to <i>dosa</i> (See Ch. 1
    note 9). It is not mere absence of hatred or aversion, but is a positive virtue. </font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Adosa</i> is synonymous with <i>metta,</i>
    Loving-kindness, which is one of the four sublime abodes <i>(brahma-vihara)</i>. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Readers will note that in enumerating the
    sublime abodes only two are mentioned, viz. - <i>karuna</i> and <i>mudita.</i> The reason

    equanimity.</font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Adosa</i> is also one of the three roots
    of good. Like an agreeable friend, absence of churlishness or coarseness <i>(candikka)</i>
    is its chief characteristic. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">34. <b>Three Roots of Good:</b> -</font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Alobha, adosa and amoha</i> are the three
    roots of good. <i>Amoha</i> is not mentioned amongst the nineteen Beautiful <i>cetasikas</i>
    because it is implied by <i>pañña</i> - wisdom.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Atthasalini gives a vivid description of
    these three virtues as follows:</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Of these three, <i>alobha</i> has the
    characteristic of non-adhesion of the mind to an object, or of not sticking like a drop of
    water on a lotus leaf. Its function is non-appropriation like an emancipated Bhikkhu
    (Arahat). Its manifestation is detachment like a man fallen in filth. </font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Adosa</i> has the characteristic of
    non-churlishness or non-resentment like an agreeable friend. Its function is the
    suppression of annoyance or feverishness like sandal wood. Its manifestation is loveliness
    like the full moon. The characteristic, function, etc., of <i>amoha</i> have been
    explained in connection with the term <i>paññindriya</i> (Faculty of Wisdom). Of these
    three, again, <i>alobha</i> is opposed to the taint of selfishness, <i>adosa</i> to that
    of impurity <i>(dussilya), amoha</i> to the non-development of moral conditions. </font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Alobha </i>is the cause of
    generosity, <i>adosa</i> of morality, <i>amoha</i> of meditation. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Through <i>alobha</i> what is in excess
    is not taken, for the greedy take what is in excess. Through <i>adosa</i> what is not less
    is taken, for the hateful take what is less. Through <i>amoha</i> what is unperverted is
    taken, for the deluded take what is perverted. Through <i>alobha,</i> one regards a
    manifest fault as such and admits it, but the greedy conceal it. Through <i>adosa</i> one
    regards a manifest virtue as such and admits it, but the hateful efface it. Through <i>amoha,</i>
    one regards what really is as such and admits it, but the deluded regard what is false as
    true, and what is true as false. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Through <i>alobha</i> there is no
    sorrow arising from separation of the beloved, for affection is the intrinsic nature of
    the greedy as well as the inability to bear the separation from the beloved. Through <i>adosa</i>
    there arises no sorrow from association with the unbeloved since disagreeableness is the
    intrinsic nature of the hateful as well as the inability to bear the association with the
    unbeloved. Through <i>amoha</i> there arises no sorrow from not getting what one desires,
    for it is the intrinsic nature of the deluded to think - 'From where could it be got?'
    etc. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Through <i>alobha</i> there arises no
    sorrow from rebirth, since the former is opposed to craving and the latter is the root of
    craving. Through <i>adosa</i> there arises no sorrow from decay, since the intensely
    hateful become quickly aged. Through <i>amoha</i> there is not sorrow from death, for a
    bewildered death is painful. There is no such death for the undeluded. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;There is harmonious living to the lay
    people through <i>alobha,</i> to the recluses through <i>amoha,</i> and to all through <i>adosa.</i>
    </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In particular through <i>alobha</i>
    there is no rebirth in the plane of Petas, since beings are generally born amongst Petas
    through craving. <i>Alobha</i> is the antithesis of craving. Through <i>adosa</i> there is
    no rebirth in the <i>niraya</i> (Woeful State). Through hate, which is of a churlish
    nature, beings are born in woeful states resembling hatred. <i>Adosa</i> is the antithesis
    of hatred. Through <i>amoha</i> there is no rebirth in the animal plane. Due to utter
    delusion through ignorance, beings are born amongst animals. <i>Amoha</i> is the
    antithesis of ignorance. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Of them <i>alobha</i> dissuades
    attraction from lust; <i>adosa</i> from recoiling through hate; <i>amoha</i> from stolid
    indifference through ignorance. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Moreover through these three there arise
    respectively these three notions - those of renunciation, non-anger and harmlessness; and
    those of loathsomeness, immeasurableness, and fundamental elements<i> (dhatu). </font></p>
    </i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Through <i>alobha</i> the extreme
    of indulgence in sensual pleasures is inhibited: through <i>adosa</i> that of
    self-mortification. Through <i>amoha</i> there is training according to the Middle Path. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Similarly through <i>alobha</i> the
    bodily bond of covetousness <i>(abhijjha kayagantha)</i> is destroyed, through <i>adosa</i>
    that of ill-will, and through <i>amoha</i> the remaining two. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The first two states of mindfulness are
    accomplished by the power of the first two, and the last two by the power of the third. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Herein <i>alobha</i> is conducive to
    health, for the unattached person does not resort to what is attractive but suitable -
    hence health ensues. <i>Adosa</i> is conducive to youthfulness, for the unhateful person
    remains young for a long time, being not burnt by the fire of anger which causes wrinkles
    and grey hair. <i>Amoha</i> is conducive to longevity of life, for the undeluded person,
    distinguishing between what is agreeable and disagreeable, avoids the latter and adopts
    the former and lives long. </font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Alobha</i> is conducive to the
    acquisition of wealth, for by generosity wealth is obtained. <i>Adosa</i> is conducive to
    the acquisition of friends, for by loving-kindness friends are won and are not lost. </font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Amoha</i> is conducive to personal
    achievements, for the undeluded person, doing only what is beneficial to himself,
    regulates his own self. </font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Alobha</i> is conducive to divine
    life, <i>adosa</i> to Brahma life, and <i>amoha</i> to Aryan life. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Through <i>alobha</i> one is at peace
    with his acquisition of wealth amongst beings and things belonging to one's party, for
    through their destruction there is no grief caused to him by excessive attachment. Through
    <i>adosa</i> amongst those belonging to other parties he is happy, for the non inimical
    person is devoid of the feeling of ill-will even amongst the hostile. Through <i>amoha</i>
    he is happy amongst those who belong to a neutral party, for the undeluded person is
    devoid of all attachment. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Through <i>alobha</i> there is insight
    into impermanence, for the greedy person does not see impermanence in things that are
    impermanent, owing to his desire for enjoyment. Through <i>adosa</i> there is insight into
    suffering for one with a loving-disposition has abandoned that grasping, the cause of
    vexation, and sees things as sorrowful. Through <i>amoha</i> there is insight into
    soullessness, for the undeluded person is skillful in understanding things as they truly
    are. He sees the guideless fivefold group as guideless. </font></p>

    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">49. </b>The following illuminating note by
    Mrs. Rhys Davids on these four virtues is well worth reading. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;On these four great exercises, see Rhys
    Davids, S. B. E. xi 201, n.; and on their emancipating efficacy, M. i. 38. Buddhaghosa
    again refers to the reader to his Visuddhi Magga for a more detailed commentary (vide
    chap. ix, and cf. Hardy, 'Eastern Monachism', p . 243 et seq. )... The object of thought <i>(arammana)</i>
    in this connection will be 'limited' if the student dwells in love etc., on but a
    restricted number of beings; 'infinite' if his heart embraces vast numbers.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">'The commentator has not a little to say in
    the present work, however, on the nature and mutual relations of the 'Abodes' (pp.
    193-195). First, the characteristics of each are fully set forth, together with their
    false manifestation <i>(vipatti). </i>Clinging <i>(sinehasambhavo)</i> is the <i>vipatti</i>
    of love, the essential mark of which is the carrying on of beneficent conduct etc. Tears
    and the like are less truly characteristic of pity <i>(karuna)</i> than is the bearing and
    relieving the woes of others. Laughter and the like are less genuine expressions of
    sympathy <i>(mudita) </i>than is appreciation of what others have achieved. And there is a
    condition of disinterestedness <i>(upekkha)</i> which is prompted by ignorance, and not by
    that insight into the karma of mankind which can avail to calm the passions.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;He next designates the four antisocial
    attitudes which are to be extirpated by these ethical disciplines taken in order -
    ill-will <i>(vyapada),</i> cruelty <i>(vihesa),</i> aversion <i>(arati), </i>and passion <i>(raga)
    </i>- and shows how each virtue has also a second vice opposed to it. This he terms its
    near enemy, as being less directly assailed by it than its ethical opposite, the latter
    resembling an enemy who has to lurk afar in the jungle and the hills. Love and vengeful
    conduct cannot coexist. To prevail in this respect, let love be developed fearlessly. But
    where love and its object have too much in common, love is threatened by lust. On this
    side let love be guarded well. Again the near enemy to pity, more insidious than cruelty,
    is the self-pity pining for what one has not got or has lost - a low, profane melancholy.
    And the corresponding worldly happiness in what one has, or in consequence of
    obliviousness as to what one has lost, lies in wait to stifle appreciation of the good
    fortune of others. Lastly, there is the unintelligent indifference of the worldling who
    has not triumphed over limitations nor mastered cause and effect, being unable to
    transcend external things. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The remainder of his remarks are
    occupied with the necessary sequence in the four Abodes, and the importance of observing
    method in their cultivation, and finally with their other technical appellation of <i>appamañña</i>
    or infinitudes. In this connection he repeats the touching illustration given in Hardy
    (op. Cit., 249) of the mother, and the four children. Her desire for the growth of the
    infant is as <i>metta;</i> for the recovery of the sick child as <i>karuna;</i> for the
    maintenance of the gifts displayed by the youth as <i>mudita;</i> while her care not to
    hinder the career of her grown-up son is as <i>upekkha.</i> </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;It may be remarked, by the way, that
    when Hardy with a foreigner's want of <i>mudita</i> calumniates the Buddhist mendicant (p.
    250) as one who thinks about the virtues of solidarity without practicing them, he quite
    forgets that these exercises are but preparations of the will for that ministering to the
    intellectual need of others to which the recluse's life was largely devoted, and the
    importance of which the Western, in his zeal for material forms of charity, does not even
    now appreciate at its real value. And Buddhism did not believe in giving the rein to good
    impulses unregulated by intellectual control&quot;. -- (Buddhist Psychology, pp- 65-37).</font></p>
    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">50. Paññindriya -</font></p>
    </b><i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Pa</i> = rightly; <i>ña,</i> to know,

    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Its chief characteristic is understanding as
    it really is, or irresistible understanding, i.e., penetrative knowledge <i>(Yathasabhava-pativedho
    va akkhalita-pativedho). </font></p>
    </i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As <i>pañña</i> dominates in
    understanding the real nature and as it overcomes ignorance, it is called a controlling
    faculty <i>(indriya). </font></p>
    </i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In Abhidhamma <i>ñana, pañña,</i> and <i>amoha</i>
    are used as interchangeable terms. In types of consciousness connected with knowledge <i>(ñana-sampayutta)</i>
    the reference is to this <i>pañña.</i> By <i>amoha,</i> one of the three moral roots, is
    also meant this <i>pañña</i>. As one of the four means of accomplishing one's ends <i>(iddhi-pada)</i>
    it assumes the name of <i>vimamsa</i> (lit., examination). When purified by <i>samadhi,</i>
    <i>pañña</i> assumes the honorable role of <i>abhiñña</i> (higher knowledge). Highly
    developed <i>pañña</i> is elevated to the state of a <i>bojjhanga-dhamma-vicaya</i>
    (Investigation of the Truth) and <i>magganga-samma ditthi,</i> Right View. The culmination
    of <i>pañña</i> is the Omniscience of a Buddha. </font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Pañña,</i> in the strictest sense of the
    term, is seeing things as they truly are, i.e., in the light of <i>anicca</i>
    (impermanence), <i>dukkha</i> (sorrow), and <i>anatta</i> (soullessness). </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Reason, intellect, insight, knowledge,
    wisdom, intelligence - all convey some aspects of <i>pañña,</i> but none of them exactly
    corresponds to the Pali term. Both knowledge and wisdom are employed here according to the
    context. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Mrs. Rhys David's comment on this important
    term is interesting. She writes:- </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;To fit the term <i>pañña</i> with its
    approximate European equivalent is one of the cruxes of Buddhist philosophy. I have tried
    in turn reason, intellect, insight, science, understanding and knowledge. All of these
    have been, and are, used in the literature of philosophy with varying shades of
    connotation, according as the sense to be conveyed is popular and vague, psychological and
    precise or transcendental and - <i>passez-moi le mot</i> - having precise vagueness.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">And each of them might, with one implication
    or another, represent <i>pañña</i>. The main difficulty in choice lay in determining
    whether, to the Buddhist, <i>pañña </i>stood for mental function, or for the aggregate
    product of certain mental functioning, or for both. When all the allusions to <i>pañña </i>in
    the Sutta Pitaka have been collated, a final translation becomes possible. Here it must
    suffice to quote two. M i. 292, he who has <i>pañña (paññava) </i>is declared in
    virtue thereof to understand <i>(pajanati)</i> the nature of the phenomenon of pain or ill
    (the Four Noble Truths). In D. i. 124 Gotama asks: what is this <i>pañña</i>? and
    himself sets out its content as consisting in certain intellectual attainments, viz., the
    Jhanas, insight into the nature of impermanence, the mental image of one's self, the power
    of <i>iddhi,</i> the cosmic Ear, insight into other minds, into one's own past lives, the
    cosmic Eye, and the elimination of all vitiating tendencies. Buddhaghosa also (Visuddhi
    Magga Ch. XIV,) distinguishes <i>pañña</i> from <i>sañña</i> and <i>viññana.</i> He
    describes it as adequate to discern not only what these can, viz., sense-objects and the
    Three Marks (impermanence, pain and non-substantiality) respectively, but also the path.
    For him, then, it might be called intellect 'at a higher power'. And in Gotama's reply,
    all those terms are described in terms of intellectual process. Nevertheless, it is clear
    that the term did not stand for bare mental process of a certain degree of complexity, but
    that it also implied mental process as cultivated in accordance with a certain system of
    concepts objectively valid for all Buddhist adepts. Hence I think it best to reject such
    terms as reason, intellect, and understanding, and to choose wisdom, or science, or
    knowledge, or philosophy. Only they must be understood in this connection as implying the
    body of learning as assimilated and applied by the intellect of a given individual&quot;.

    </b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Of the 52 types of mental states eleven
    are called <i>aniyatayogi</i> - unfixed adjuncts. They arise in different kinds of
    consciousness separately because their particular objects differ. They may or may not
    arise in those types of consciousness to which they are allied. For instance, <i>issa,
    macchariya,</i> and <i>kukkucca</i> must arise in a consciousness connected with aversion.
    One of the three must arise at one particular moment. All the three do not occur
    simultaneously. Besides they are not bound to be present in such a consciousness. So are
    the three Abstinences, two Illimitables, Conceit, Sloth and Torpor. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The remaining 41 types are called <i>niyatayogi</i>
    - fixed adjuncts. They invariably arise in those types of consciousness allied to them. </font></p>
    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">53. Abstinences -</font></p>
    </b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These three are collectively found only
    in the Supra mundane consciousness, as they constitute three of eight factors of the Noble
    Path. They cannot arise in the <i>rupavacara</i> and <i>arupavacara,</i> nor in the <i>kamavacara
    vipaka</i> and <i>kriya cittas.</i> They deal with three forms of refraining from
    committing evil through word, deed, and livelihood. As such they arise separately only in
    the eight types of moral consciousness according to the abstinence from the particular
    evil. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These Abstinences appear in full force only
    in the <i>lokuttara-cittas,</i> because the corresponding evils are completely eradicated
    by them. In the <i>kamavacara-kusala-cittas</i> there is only a temporary inhibition of
    evil.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As <i>kamavacara-vipaka-cittas</i> are merely
    effects they cannot arise in them. Since <i>kriya-cittas</i> are experienced only by
    Arahats, they do not arise in them. In the <i>rupavacara</i> and <i>arupavacara</i> planes
    they do not occur because the need for moral purification, the function of these
    abstinences, does not arise there. </font></p>
    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">54. Illimitables (Sublime Abodes)-</font></p>
    </b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Of the four only two are mentioned here.
    The other two have already been dealt with in their respective places.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It should be noted that the objects of these
    tables are beings. Therefore they cannot arise in the Supra mundane consciousness which
    has for its object Nibbana. This does not mean that Arahats and other Aryans do not
    possess these virtues. They are not present only in the Path and Fruit consciousness. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">They do not occur in the fifth Jhana as it is
    accompanied by <i>upekkha</i> - neutral feeling. In the <i>arupa-cittas</i> also they do
    not arise as they also are connected with <i>upekkha.</i> In the eight <i>kiriya cittas,</i>
    which the Arahats experience, they arise because the Arahats also radiate thoughts of <i>karuna</i>
    and <i>mudita</i> towards all beings. </font></p>
