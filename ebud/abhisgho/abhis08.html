        </b><p ALIGN="LEFT">§ 1. I shall now explain here, in a fitting manner, how causal states
        act as relations to the conditioned states (1). </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">§ 2. The compendium of relations is twofold: </p>
        <dir>

          B. The Law of Causal Relations (3). </p>

        <p ALIGN="LEFT">Of these, the Law of Dependent Arising is marked by the simple happening
        of a state dependent on its antecedent state (4). </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">The Law of Causal Relations is said with reference to the existence of
        conditions that relate to one another. </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">Teachers explain them by mixing both methods. </p>
        <b><p ALIGN="LEFT">The Law of Dependent Arising</p>
        </b><p ALIGN="LEFT">Therein: </p>
        <dir>
          <p ALIGN="LEFT">Dependent on Ignorance (5 ) arise Conditioning Activities (6). <br>
          Dependent on Conditioning Activities arises (Rebirth) Consciousness (7). <br>
          Dependent on (Rebirth) Consciousness arise Mind and Matter (8). <br>
          Dependent on Mind and Matter arise the six (Sense) Bases (9).<br>
          Dependent on the six (sense) Bases arises contact (10).<br>
          Dependent on Contact arises Feeling (11). <br>
          Dependent on Feeling arises Craving (12). <br>
          Dependent on Craving arises Grasping (13). <br>
          Dependent on Grasping arises Action or Becoming (14)<br>
          Dependent on Action arises Birth (15). <br>
          Dependent on Birth arise Decay, Death, Sorrow, Lamentation, Pain, Grief, and Despair. <br>
          Thus arises the whole mass of suffering. </p>
          <p ALIGN="LEFT">Herein this is the Law of the Dependent Arising. </p>
        </dir>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">It should be understood that there are three periods twelve factors,
        twenty modes, three connections, four divisions, three rounds, and two roots. </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">How ? </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">Ignorance and Conditioning Activities belong to the past; Birth, Decay,
        Death belong to the future; the intermediate eight to the present. Thus there are three
        periods. </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">Ignorance, (moral and immoral) Activities, (Rebirth) Consciousness, Mind
        and Matter, Six Sense Bases, Contact, Feeling, Craving, Grasping, Action, Birth, Decay and
        Death are the twelve factors. The terms Sorrow and so on are shown as incidental
        consequences (of Birth). </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">Here, by taking ignorance and activities, craving, grasping, and action
        are also taken. Likewise, by taking craving, grasping, and action, ignorance and
        activities are also taken. By taking birth, decay and death, the five effects with
        consciousness and so on are taken also. Thus there are: </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">Five causes pertaining to the past, and five effects to the present; five
        causes pertaining to the present, and five effects to the future. </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">There are twenty, modes, three connections and four divisions. </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">The three Rounds: </p>
        <dir>
          <p ALIGN="LEFT">1. Ignorance, craving, and grasping belong to the Round of Passions; <br>
          2. One part of becoming <i>(bhava)</i> known as action and (moral and immoral) activities
          belongs to the Round of Kamma. <br>
          3. One part of becoming known as renewed existence <i>(upapattibhava)</i> and the rest
          belong to the Round of Effects. </p>
        </dir>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">Ignorance and craving should be understood as the two roots (10) (see
        diagrams XVI and XVII).</p>
        <b><p ALIGN="LEFT">Summary</p>
        </b><p ALIGN="LEFT">By the destruction of these roots does the Round cease. </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">The ignorance, originating from defilements (17), increases in the
        constantly oppressed who faint by decay and death. </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">The Great Sage has thus expounded this entangled, beginningless existence
        in the triple sphere as the 'Law of Dependent Arising'. </td>

    which is paraphrased by <font FACE="Times New Roman"><i>'upakarakadhamma'</i> - aiding or
    supportive conditions. These various or principal causes are described in detail in the
    Patthanapakarana, the seventh book of the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The system expounded in this

    </font><p ALIGN="LEFT">The difference between the two understood as follows: </p>

      This is the <font FACE="Times New Roman"><i>paticcasamuppadanaya</i></font>. </p>

    which is the cause. When ignorance is destroyed and turned into knowingness, all causality
    is shattered as in the case of Buddhas and Arahats. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">6. <font FACE="Times New Roman"><b>Sankhara</b></font> - This is a
    multisignificant term which should be understood according to the context. Here the term
    signifies immoral <i>(akusala), </i>moral <i>(kusala),</i> and unshakable <i><font
    FACE="Times New Roman">(a</font>neñj<font FACE="Times New Roman">a)</font></i> volitions <font
    FACE="Times New Roman"><i>(cetana)</i></font> which constitute Kamma that produces

    second, all volitions in the 8 types of Beautiful <i>(kusala)</i> consciousness and the 5
    types of <font FACE="Times New Roman"><i>kusala rupa-jhana</i></font> consciousness; the
    third, all volitions in the 4 types of <font FACE="Times New Roman"><i>kusala
    arupa-jhanas.</i> Where is no proper English equivalent which gives the exact connotation
    of this Pali term. <i>Sankhara,</i></font> as one of the five aggregates, implies the 50
    mental states excluding feeling and perception. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The volitions of the four supramundane Path consciousnesses <i>(lokuttara-magga-citta)</i>
    are not regarded as <font FACE="Times New Roman"><i>sankhara</i></font> because they tend
    to eradicate ignorance. Wisdom <i>(paññ<font FACE="Times New Roman">a)</font></i> is
    predominant in Supramundane types of consciousness, while volition <font
    FACE="Times New Roman"><i>(cetana)</i></font> is predominant in the mundane types of
    consciousness. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Ignorance is predominant in immoral activities, while it is latent in
    moral activities. Hence both moral and immoral actions are regarded as caused by
    ignorance. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">7. <b>Viññ<font FACE="Times New Roman">ana</font></b> - strictly denotes
    the 19 types of rebirth-consciousness <i>(patisandhi viññ<font FACE="Times New Roman">ana)</font></i>

    FACE="Times New Roman"><i> (vipaka-citta)</i></font> experienced during lifetime, are also
    implied by the term. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The foetus in the mother's womb is formed by the combination of this
    relinking-consciousness with the sperm and ovum cells of the parents. In this
    consciousness are latent all the past impressions, characteristics and tendencies of that
    particular individual life-flux. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">This relinking-consciousness is regarded as &quot;radiant&quot; <i>(pabhassara)</i>
    as it is either devoid of immoral roots of lust, hatred and delusion (as in the case of
    rootless resultants - <i>ahetuka-vip<font FACE="Times New Roman">aka),</font></i> or
    accompanied by moral roots (as in the case of resultants with roots).</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">8. <font FACE="Times New Roman"><b>Nama-rupa</b></font> - This compound

    together. In the case of <font FACE="Times New Roman"><i>arupa</i></font> planes there

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">From this it is evident that sex is determined by past Kamma at the very
    conception of the being. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Here <font FACE="Times New Roman"><i>kaya</i></font> means the sensitive
    part of the body. Sex is not developed at the moment of conception but the potentiality is
    latent. Neither the heart nor the brain, the supposed seat of consciousness, is developed
    but the potentiality of the seat is latent.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">9. <font FACE="Times New Roman"><b>Salayatana</b></font> - During the
    embryonic period the six sense-bases gradually evolve from the psycho physical phenomena
    in which are latent infinite potentialities. The insignificant, infinitesimally small
    speck now develops into a complex six-sense-machine which now operates almost mechanically
    without any agent like a soul to act as the operator. The six sense-bases are eye, ear,
    nose, tongue, body, and mind. The first five refer to the sensitive organs that evolve by
    degrees. Mind-base has already been explained. </p>

    craving for sensual pleasures associated with the view of eternalism <font

    pleasures thinking that everything perishes after death. The last is the materialistic

    <font FACE="Times New Roman"><i><p ALIGN="LEFT">Bhava-tanha</i></font> and <font

    Planes respectively. Usually these two terms are rendered by craving for existence and
    non-existence. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">There are six kinds of craving corresponding to the six sense-objects such
    as form, sound, and so on. They become 12 when they are treated as internal and external.
    They are reckoned as 36 when past, present and future are taken into consideration. When

    only difference between <font FACE="Times New Roman"><i>sankhara</i></font> and <i>kammabhava</i>

        and matter - related to mind and matter. Thus the relations are sixfold.</p>
        <b><p ALIGN="LEFT">Relations of Mind and Matter</p>
        </b><p ALIGN="LEFT">How? </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">A. In six ways mind is related to mind: </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">Consciousness and mental states that immediately cease, relate themselves
        to present consciousness and mental states by way of <b>contiguity</b>, <b>immediacy</b>, <b>absence</b>
        and <b>separation</b>. </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">Preceding Javanas are related to the subsequent, Javanas by way of <b>repetition</b>
        (or <b>habitual recurrence</b>). Coexisting consciousness and mental states are related to
        one another by way of <b>association</b>. </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">B. In five ways mind is related to mind and matter: </p>
        <font FACE="Times New Roman"><b><p ALIGN="LEFT">Root, Jhana</b></font> and <b>Path</b>
        factors are related to coexisting mind and matter by way of <b>root,</b> etc. </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">Coexisting volition is related to coexisting mind and matter and
        asynchronous volition to mind and matter born of Kamma by way of <b>Kamma</b>. </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">The (mental) aggregates of effect are related to one another and
        coexistent matter by way of <b>effect.</b> </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">C. Only in one way is mind related to matter: </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">Subsequent consciousness and mental states are related to this preceding
        (material) body by way of <b>post-occurrence. </p>
        </b><p ALIGN="LEFT">D. Only in one way is matter related to mind: </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">The six bases during life are related to the seven elements of cognition,
        and the five objects to the five processes of sense-cognition by way of <b>antecedence.</b>
        </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">E. In two ways are concepts, mind and matter related to mind - namely, by
        way of <b>object</b> and <b>powerful dependence. </p>
        </b><p ALIGN="LEFT">Therein object is sixfold as form, etc. But <b>powerful dependence</b>
        is threefold - namely, powerful dependence as <b>object,</b> powerful dependence as <b>contiguity,</b>
        and powerful dependence as <b>intrinsic nature.</p>
        </b><p ALIGN="LEFT">Of them the object itself when it becomes prominent serves as a <b>powerful
        dependence</b> of the object. Consciousness and mental states that immediately cease, act
        as the <b>powerful dependence</b> <b>of proximity.</b> The <b>powerful dependence of
        intrinsic nature</b> is of several kinds: states of lust, etc., states of confidence,
        etc., pleasure, pain, individual, food, season, lodging conditions, internal and external,
        as the case may be, are related to moral states, etc. Kamma, too, is similarly related to
        its effects. </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">F. Mind and matter are related to mind and matter in nine ways according
        to circumstances - namely, by way of <b>predominance, conascence, reciprocity, dependence,
        nutriment, control, dissociation, presence,</b> and <b>non separation.</b> </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">Therein relation of <b>predominance</b> is twofold: </p>
        <dir>
          <p ALIGN="LEFT">i. The object to which weight is attached is related to states of mind by
          way of objective predominance. </p>
          <p ALIGN="LEFT">ii. The fourfold coexisting predominance is related to coexisting mind and
          matter by way of conascence. </p>
        </dir>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">The relation of conascence is threefold: consciousness and mental states
        are related to one another and to the coexisting material states; the four Great
        Essentials mutually and to the derived material qualities; the heart-base and the
        resultant (mental aggregates) to one another at the moment of rebirth. </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">The relation of reciprocity is threefold: consciousness and mental states
        are related to one another; the four Great Essentials, to one another; the heart-base and
        the resultant mental aggregates to one another at the moment of rebirth. </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">The relation of dependence is threefold: consciousness and mental states
        are related to one another and coexisting matter; the four chief elements, to one another
        and derived material qualities; and six bases, to the seven cognitive elements. </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">The relation of nutriment is twofold: edible food is related to this body;
        and immaterial nutriment, to the coexisting mind and matter. </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">The relation of control is threefold: the five sensitive organs are
        related to the five kinds of cognition; the controlling power of material vitality, to the
        material qualities that have been grasped at; the immaterial controlling factors, to the
        coexistent mind and matter. </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">The law of dissociation is threefold: at the moment of conception the
        basis of mind is related to the effects (of kamma), and consciousness and mental states,
        to coexistent mind and matter by way of coexistence; the subsequent consciousness and
        mental states, to this antecedent body by way of post-occurrence; the six bases, in the
        course of life, to the seven cognitive elements by way of antecedence. </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">The five kinds of relations - coexistence, antecedence, post-occurrence,
        edible food, and material life - are, in every way, in the relation of presence and of
        non-separation. </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">All relations are included in the relations of object, powerful
        dependence, Kamma and presence. </p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">Herein coexisting material qualities should be understood as twofold
        throughout the course of life they should be understood as those born of mind, and at
        rebirth as those born of kamma. </p>
        <b><p ALIGN="LEFT">Summary</p>
        </b><p ALIGN="LEFT">Thus the relative conditions pertaining to the three periods of time

    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT">Notes: </p>
    </b><p ALIGN="LEFT">18. <b>Hetu-paccaya</b> - Here <i>paccaya</i> presents some
    difficulty. It is defined as that by means of which an effect comes to be. In other words
    it is the cause. Furthermore, it is explained as a 'serviceable or supportive factor' <font
    FACE="Times New Roman"><i>(upakarako dhammo).</i></font> <i>Hetu</i> is defined as 'that
    by which an effect is established'. It is used in the sense of 'root' <font
    FACE="Times New Roman"><i>(mulatthena).</i></font> Like the roots of a tree are hetu; like
    water and manure that aid its growth are <i>paccaya.</i> In the Abhidhamma these two
    related terms are used in two different senses. In the Suttas, however, they are
    invariably employed as Synonymous terms, without any distinction, as, for example <i>ko
    hetu, ko paccayo</i> - what is the reason? what is the cause? </p>
    <font FACE="Times New Roman"><p ALIGN="LEFT">In the Patthana 24 such </font><i>paccayas</i>
    are enumerated, and <i>hetu</i> is one of them. <i>Hetu-paccaya</i> is explained as <i>'hetu</i>
    itself is a <i>paccaya'</i> or 'as <i>hetu</i> it becomes a <i>paccaya'</i>. It is
    interpreted as a supportive or serviceable factor in the sense of root <font
    FACE="Times New Roman"><i>(mulatthena upakarako dhammo). </i>The causal relation by way of
    'root' may be suggested as the closest rendering. (See Compendium, p. 279; Journal of the
    Pali Text Society, 1915-1916, pp. 29-53.) </p>
    </font><p ALIGN="LEFT">'Roots are purely mental. They are the six moral and immoral roots.
    See Chapter I. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">19. <font FACE="Times New Roman"><b>Arammana</b></font> - or <font
    FACE="Times New Roman"><b>alambana</b></font>. The former is derived from <i>a + Ö ram,</i>
    to delight in; the latter from <font FACE="Times New Roman"><i>a + Ö lamb, </i></font>to
    hang upon. Things which the subject delights in or hangs upon are 'objects'. There are six
    classes of objects. A form, for instance, acts as a causal relation to
    visual-consciousness by way of an 'object'. It should be stated that there is nothing
    mundane or supramundane that does not become an object for mind. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">20. <b>Adhipati</b> - Lit., mastery or lordship over one's own. 0ne of the
    four dominant factors - namely, wish, thought, effort and reasoning - may, at one time,
    causally relate itself to coexistent mental states and material phenomena by way of
    predominance. &quot;Whenever such phenomena as consciousness and mental states arise by
    giving pred<font FACE="Times New Roman">ominance to one of these four factors, then this
    phenomenon is to the other phenomenon a condition by way of predominance&quot;. (Patthana)</p>
    </font><p ALIGN="LEFT">21. <b>Anantara</b> and <b>Samanantara</b> - In meaning there is no
    difference between the two terms. They differ only in etymology. According to Buddhist
    philosophy one thought-moment perishes, immediately giving birth to another. The
    succeeding thought-moment inherits all the potentialities of its immediate predecessor.
    The perishing preceding states causally relate themselves to immediately following states
    by way of contiguity and immediacy. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">22. <b>Sahaj<font FACE="Times New Roman">ata</font></b> - The causal
    relation by way of conascence, as, for instance, the four mental aggregates, the different
    mental states that simultaneously arise in a particular type of consciousness, the four
    Great Essentials that arise together, the appearance of the three 'decads' at the moment
    of conception, etc. In the <i>paticca</i>-<font FACE="Times New Roman"><i>samuppada</i></font>
    it may be mentioned that both contact and feeling which appear as causes and effect are
    conascent. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">A mental state may be conascent with a mental state, a mental with a
    physical, a physical with a physical, and a physical with a mental. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">23. <b>Aññamañña</b> - Just as the legs of a tripod are reciprocally
    helpful, even so mental or physical state or states may be causally related by way of
    reciprocity (or mutuality). Causal relations of conascence and reciprocity should be
    differentiated. They are not identical. For instance, mind-born material phenomena are not
    reciprocally related to the coexisting mind, nor are the material derivatives to the
    coexisting Great Essentials. As a rule, mind and matter are reciprocally related. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">24. <b>Nissaya</b> and <b>Upanissaya</b> - derived from <i>upa + ni + Ö
    si,</i> to lie. <i>Upa</i> is an intensive prefix. As trees depend on the ground for their
    support, and as pictures depend on a canvas on which they are painted, so is the causal
    relation of dependence. <i>Upanissaya</i> is defined as a stronger form of Nissaya. It is
    compared to the rains on which depend the growth of trees. S. Z. Aung renders <i>upanissaya</i>
    by 'sufficing condition'. For instance, one of the five heinous crimes such as matricide,
    parricide and so on, will serve as an <i>upanissaya</i> to effect a birth in a woeful
    state. Good environments, early education, etc., will serve as a causal relation by way of
    'dependence' (nissaya) for the acquisition of health, wealth and knowledge in later life.
    Just as good actions become <i>upanissaya</i> for future good deeds, even so they may
    become <i>upanissaya</i> for evil too as, for instance, spiritual pride. See Ledi
    Sayadaw's learned article on this subject in P.T.S. Journal, 1916, pp. 49-53. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">25. <b>Pur<font FACE="Times New Roman">ejata</font></b> - lit., born
    before or that which pre-exists. The six physical bases and six sensual objects are
    regarded as pre-existent. The pre-existent things are regarded as causal relations only
    when they continue to exist in the present and not by mere antecedence. Priority is not a
    good rendering. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">26. <font FACE="Times New Roman"><b>Pacchajata</b></font> - Of the 89
    types of consciousness, 85 types, excluding the four <font FACE="Times New Roman"><i>arupa</i></font>
    resultants, and the 52 mental states, are causally related to the antecedent physical body
    by way of post-occurrence. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">27. <b><font FACE="Times New Roman">Aseva</font>na</b> - Repeated
    practice, as a rule, leads to proficiency. This applies to both good and evil things. By
    repetition one acquires a certain amount of skill in any particular thing. <font
    FACE="Times New Roman"><i>Asevana</i></font> denotes this repeated practice. In <i>javana</i>
    process the second thought moment is causally related to the first, the third to the
    second, the fourth to the third, by way of recurrence. This is the reason why the fourth <i>javana</i>
    thought-moment is considered very powerful. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">28. <b>Kamma</b> means the volition that plays the most important part in
    moral and immoral thoughts, words, and deeds. This volition, technically known as Kamma,
    is causally related to the Kamma-born material phenomena, etc. As a seed to a tree so is
    Kamma causally related to its inevitable results. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">29. <b>Vip<font FACE="Times New Roman">aka</font></b> - Like a cool breeze
    that pacifies a person seated under the cool shade of a tree, even so mental states of
    resultant types of consciousness are causally related to coexistent mental states and
    material phenomena by way of 'effect' due to their effortless peaceful nature. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">30. <font FACE="Times New Roman"><b>Ahara</b></font> - Just as material
    food sustains the physical body, even so mental foods sustain mental states. Edible food
    is causally related to the body by way of nutriment or food; so are mental contacts or
    impressions <i>(phassa)</i> to feelings; volitions or moral and immoral actions <i>(mano-sañetan<font
    FACE="Times New Roman">a)</font></i> to rebirth-consciousness <i>(patisandhi viññ<font
    FACE="Times New Roman">ana);</font></i> and rebirth-consciousness <i>(viññ<font
    FACE="Times New Roman">ana)</font></i> to mind and matter.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">31. <b>Indriya</b> - The controlling factors enumerated in Chapter VII
    become causally related to the coexistent mental states and material phenomena because
    they exercise control in their respective spheres. For instance, confidence controls its
    co-adjuncts in religious convictions; psychic and physical life, in vivifying mind and
    matter; mindfulness, in contemplative exercise; feelings, in grief and happiness, etc.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">32. <b>Jh<font FACE="Times New Roman">ana</font></b> - The seven <font
    FACE="Times New Roman"><i>jhana</i></font> factors of (1) initial application, (2)
    sustained application, (3) rapture, (4) happiness, (5) equanimity, (6) displeasure and (7)
    one-pointedness are causally related to one another and other concomitants by way of close
    perception and contemplation. For instance, the initial application <i>(vitakka)</i> is
    causally related to its concomitants in directing them towards the desired object. See
    Chapter 1. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">1, 2, 3, 4, 7 are found in two classes of consciousness rooted in
    attachment; 1, 2, 6, 7, in hateful consciousness; 1, 2, 5, 7, in deluded consciousness. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">33. <b>Magga</b> - means a way or road. One way leads to woeful states;
    the other, to states of bliss. The vehicles that convey travelers to the former are the
    evil 'Path Constituents' of wrong views, wrong application, wrong effort, and wrong
    one-pointedness. The vehicles that ply on the latter way are right understanding, right
    aspirations, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right
    mindfulness, and right one-pointedness. These path factors are causally related to both
    mind and body, leading downwards in the case of bad ones, and leading away from existence
    (niyy<font FACE="Times New Roman">ana) in the case of good ones. </p>
    </font><p ALIGN="LEFT">34. <b>Sampayutta</b> - Though possessing distinct characteristics
    from an ultimate standpoint yet, as certain mental states arise together, perish together,
    have one identical object and one identical base, they are causally related to one another
    by way of 'association'. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">35. <b>Vippayutta</b> is the opposite of the foregoing. Sweet and bitter
    tastes may be helpful to each other in being dissimilar. For instance, mind that depends
    on the heart-basis is causally related to it by way of dissociation because, both mind and
    heart-basis are not mutually bound, as water on a lotus leaf. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">36. <b>Atthi</b> is the causal relation of states that exist in the
    present to similar states like the causal relation of coexistence. The visibility of
    objects, for instance, is due to the presence of light. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">37. <b>Natthi</b> - As with the disappearance of light, darkness spreads,
    so with the disappearance of the predecessor, the successor appears. Such is the causal
    relation by way of absence. For instance, the visual consciousness <i>(dassana)</i> is
    causally related to the immediately following receiving consciousness <i>(sampaticchana) </i>by
    way of absence. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">38. <b>Vigata</b> and <b>Avigata</b> are similar to Natthi and Atthi
    respectively.</p>

    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT">Notes:</p>
    </b><p ALIGN="LEFT">39. <b>Paññatti</b> - There are two kinds of <i>paññatti</i> or
    concepts - namely, <i>attha-paññatti</i> and <i><font FACE="Times New Roman">nama-pa</font>ññatti.</i>
    The former is made known, that is, the object conveyed by the concept. The latter is that
    which makes known, that is, the name given to the object. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Land, mountain, etc. are called <i><font FACE="Times New Roman">'santhana-pa</font>ññatti'</i>,
    formal concepts, since they correspond to the form of things. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Chariot, village, etc., are called <i><font FACE="Times New Roman">'samuha-pa</font>ññatti'</i>,
    collective concepts, since they correspond to a collection or group of things. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">East, west, etc., are called <i><font FACE="Times New Roman">'disa-pa</font>ññatti'</i>,
    local concepts, since they correspond to locality. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Morning, noon, etc., are called <i><font FACE="Times New Roman">'kala-pa</font>ññatti'</i>,
    time concepts, since they correspond to time. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Well, cave, etc., are called <i><font FACE="Times New Roman">'akasa-pa</font>ññatti'</i>,
    space-concepts, since they correspond to open space. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Visualized image, conceptualized image, etc. are called <i>'nimitta-paññatti'</i>,
    since they correspond to mental signs gained by mental development. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">40. Six kinds of <b>Paññatti</b> -</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">1. Matter, feeling, etc., exist in an ultimate sense. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">2. Land, mountain, etc., are terms given to things that do not exist in an
    ultimate sense. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">3. 'Possessor of sixfold supernormal vision.' </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Here the former does not exist in an ultimate sense, but the latter does. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">4. Woman's voice. Here the voice exists in an ultimate sense, but not the
    woman. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">5. Eye-consciousness. Here the sensitive eye exists in an ultimate sense,
    and so does the consciousness dependent on it. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">6. King's son. Here neither the son nor the king exists in an ultimate
