    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font size="4" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">PREFACE</font></p>
    </b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">A</font>bhidhamma, as the
    term implies, is the Higher Teaching of the Buddha. It expounds the quintessence of His
    profound doctrine. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Dhamma, embodied in the Sutta Pitaka, is
    the conventional teaching <i>(vohara desana),</i> and the Abhidhamma is the ultimate
    teaching <i>(paramattha desana)</i> </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the Abhidhamma both mind and matter, which
    constitute this complex machinery of man, are microscopically analyzed. Chief events
    connected with the process of birth and death are explained in detail. Intricate points of
    the Dhamma are clarified. The Path of Emancipation is set forth in clear terms. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Modern Psychology, limited as it is comes
    within the scope of Abhidhamma inasmuch as it deals with the mind, with thoughts,
    thought-processes, and mental states but it does not admit of a psyche or a soul. Buddhism
    teaches a psychology without a psyche. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If one were to read the Abhidhamma as a
    modern textbook on psychology, one would be disappointed. No attempt has here been made to
    solve all the problems that confront a modern psychologist. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Consciousness is defined. Thoughts are
    analyzed and classified chiefly from an ethical standpoint. All mental states are
    enumerated. The composition of each type of consciousness is set forth in detail. The
    description of thought-processes that arise through the five sense-doors and the mind-door
    is extremely interesting. Such a clear exposition of thought-processes cannot be found in
    any other psychological treatise. </font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Bhavanga</i> and <i>Javana</i>
    thought-moments, which are explained only in the Abhidhamma, and which have no parallel in
    modern psychology, are of special interest to a research student in psychology. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">That consciousness flows like a stream, a
    view propounded by some modern psychologists like William James, becomes extremely clear
    to one who understands the Abhidhamma. It must be added that an Abhidhamma student can
    fully comprehend the <i>Anatta</i> (No-soul) doctrine, the crux of Buddhism, which is
    important both from a philosophical and an ethical standpoint. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The advent of death, process of rebirth in
    various planes without anything to pass from one life to another, the evidently verifiable
    doctrine of Kamma and Rebirth are fully explained. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Giving a wealth of details about mind,
    Abhidhamma discusses the second factor of man-matter or <i>rupa.</i> Fundamental units of
    matter, material forces, properties of matter, source of matter, relationship of mind and
    matter, are described. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the Abhidhammattha Sangaha there is a
    brief exposition of the Law of Dependent Origination, followed by a descriptive account of
    the Causal Relations that finds no parallel in any other philosophy. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A physicist should not delve into Abhidhamma
    to get a thorough knowledge of physics. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It should be made clear that Abhidhamma does
    not attempt to give a systematized knowledge of mind and matter. It investigates these two
    composite factors of so-called being to help the understanding of things as they truly
    are. A philosophy has been developed on these lines. Based on that philosophy, an ethical
    system has been evolved to realize the ultimate goal, Nibbana. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As Mrs. Rhys Davids rightly says, Abhidhamma
    deals with &quot;(1) What we find (a) within us (b) around us and of (2) what we aspire to
    find.&quot; </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In Abhidhamma all irrelevant problems that
    interest students and scholars, but having no relation to one's Deliverance, are
    deliberately set aside. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Abhidhammattha Sangaha, the authorship of
    which is attributed to venerable Anuruddha Thera, an Indian monk of Kanjevaram
    (Kañcipura), gives an epitome of the entire Abhidhamma Pitaka. It is still the most
    fitting introduction to Abhidhamma. By mastering this book, a general knowledge of
    Abhidhamma may easily be acquired. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To be a master of Abhidhamma all the seven
    books, together with commentaries and sub-commentaries, have to be read and re-read
    patiently and critically. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Abhidhamma is not a subject of fleeting
    interest designed for the superficial reader. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To the wise truth-seekers, Abhidhamma is an
    indispensable guide and an intellectual treat. Here there is food for thought to original
    thinkers and to earnest students who wish to increase their wisdom and lead an ideal
    Buddhist life.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">However, to the superficial, Abhidhamma must
    appear as dry as dust. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It may be questioned, &quot;Is Abhidhamma
    absolutely essential to realize Nibbana, the summum bonum of Buddhism, or even to
    comprehend things as they truly are?&quot; </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Undoubtedly Abhidhamma is extremely helpful
    to comprehend fully the word of the Buddha and realize Nibbana, as it presents a key to
    open the door of reality. It deals with realities and a practical way of noble living,
    based on the experience of those who have understood and realized. Without a knowledge of
    the Abhidhamma one at times' finds it difficult to understand the real significance of
    some profound teachings of the Buddha. To develop Insight <i>(vipassana) </i>Abhidhamma is
    certainly very useful. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">But one cannot positively assert that
    Abhidhamma is absolutely necessary to gain one's Deliverance. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Understanding or realization is purely
    personal <i>(sanditthika).</i> The four Noble Truths that form the foundation of the
    Buddha's teaching are dependent on this one fathom body. The Dhamma is not apart from
    oneself. Look within, Seek thyself. Lo, the truth will unfold itself. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Did not sorrow-afflicted Patacara, who lost
    her dear and near ones, realize Nibbana; reflecting on the disappearance of water that
    washed her feet? </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Did not Culapanthaka, who could not memorize
    a verse even for four months, attain Arahatship by comprehending the impermanent nature of
    a clean handkerchief that he was handling, gazing at the sun? </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Did not Upatissa, later venerable Sariputta
    Thera, realize Nibbana, on hearing half a stanza relating to cause and effect? </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To some a fallen withered leaf alone was
    sufficient to attain Pacceka Buddha hood.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It was mindfulness on respiration <i>(anapana-sati)
    </i>that acted as the basis for the Bodhisatta to attain Buddha hood. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To profound thinkers, a slight indication is
    sufficient to discover great truths. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to some scholars, Abhidhamma is not
    a teaching of the Buddha, but is a later elaboration of scholastic monks. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Tradition, however, attributes the nucleus of
    the Abhidhamma to the Buddha Himself. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Commentators state that the Buddha, as a mark
    of gratitude to His mother who was born in a celestial plane, preached the Abhidhamma to
    His mother Deva and others continuously for three months. The principal topics <i>(matika)</i>
    of the advanced teaching such as moral states<i> (kusala dhamma), </i>immoral states <i>(akusala
    dhamma) </i>and indeterminate states <i>(abyakata dhamma), </i>etc., were taught by the
    Buddha to venerable Sariputta Thera, who subsequently elaborated them in the six books
    (Kathavatthu being excluded) that comprise the Abhidhamma Pitaka. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Whoever the great author or authors of the
    Abhidhamma may have been, it has to be admitted that he or they had intellectual genius
    comparable only to that of the Buddha. This is evident from the intricate and subtle
    Patthana Pakarana which minutely describes the various causal relations. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is very difficult to suggest an
    appropriate English equivalent for Abhidhamma. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There are many technical terms, too, in
    Abhidhamma which cannot be rendered into English so as to convey their exact connotation.
    Some English equivalents such as consciousness, will, volition, intellect, perception are
    used in a specific sense in Western Philosophy. Readers should try to understand in what
    sense these technical terms are employed in Abhidhamma. To avoid any misunderstanding, due
    to preconceived views, Pali words, though at times cumbersome to those not acquainted with
    the language, have judiciously been retained wherever the English renderings seem to be
    inadequate. To convey the correct meaning implied by the Pali terms, the etymology has
    been given in many instances. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">At times Pali technical terms have been used
    in preference to English renderings so that the reader may be acquainted with them and not
    get confused with English terminology. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes readers will come across unusual
    words such as corruption, defilement, volitional activities, functional, resultants, and
    so forth, which are of great significance from an Abhidhamma standpoint. Their exact
    meaning should be clearly understood.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In preparing this translation, Buddhist
    Psychology by Mrs. Rhys Davids and the Compendium of Philosophy (Abhidhammattha Sangaha)
    by Mr. Shwe Zan Aung proved extremely helpful to me. Liberty has been taken to quote them
    wherever necessary with due acknowledgment.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">My grateful thanks are due to the Kandy
    Buddhist Publication Society for the printing of this fourth revised volume, to the
    printers for expediting the printing, to Miss Rañjani Goonatilaka for correcting the
    proofs, and to Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi for his useful suggestions. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Above all I have to thank Mr. Lankatilaka, a
    most distinguished artist of Sri Lanka, for his beautiful and symbolical dust jacket
    design. </font></p>
