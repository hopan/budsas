    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Notes - </font></p>
    </b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">3. <b>Vedana</b> is a significant mental
    state which is common to all types of consciousness. Feeling is its characteristic <i>(vedayita-lakkhana),
    </i>and is born of contact. Sensation, therefore, is not an appropriate rendering for <i>vedana.
    </font></p>
    </i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Feeling is defined as: &quot;a conscious,
    subjective impression which does not involve cognition or representation of an object.''</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sensation is explained as: &quot;the content
    of sensuous intuition, or the way in which a conscious subject is modified by the presence
    of an object.&quot; </font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Vedana</i> modifies the stream of
    consciousness and serves both as a life-promoting and life-destroying force. Pleasure, for
    example, promotes life; pain impairs it. As such feeling plays a very important part in
    the life of man. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Experiencing the taste of an object is the
    function of <i>vedana (anubhavana rasa).</i> Particular likes and dislikes depend on the
    desirability and the undesirability of the external object. Generally they are
    mechanistic. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes the freewill of a person determines
    the mode of feeling independent of the nature of the object. The sight of an enemy, for
    example, would normally be a source of displeasure, but a right-understanding person
    would, on the contrary, extend his loving-kindness towards him and experience some kind of
    pleasure. Socrates, for instance, drank that cup of poison with joy and faced a happy
    death. Once a certain Brahman poured a torrent of abuse on the Buddha, but He kept smiling
    and returned love unto him. The ascetic Khantivadi, who was brutally tortured by a
    drunkard king, wished him long life instead of cursing him. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A bigoted non-Buddhist, on the other hand,
    may even, at the sight of a Buddha, harbour a thought of hatred. His feeling will be one
    of displeasure. Likewise a similar feeling may arise in the heart of a bigoted Buddhist at
    the sight of a religious teacher of an alien faith. What is meat and drink to one, may be
    poison to another. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Material pleasures, for instance, would be
    highly prized by an average person. An understanding recluse would find happiness in
    renouncing them and leading a life of voluntary poverty in perfect solitude. Such a
    solitary life, a sensualist may view as hell. Yes, what is heaven to one may be hell to
    another; what is hell to one may be heaven to another. We ourselves create them, and they
    are more or less mind-made. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;There are, o Bhikkhus, two kinds of
    feeling-pain and happiness&quot;, says the Buddha. Well, then, how can there be a third
    which is neither pain nor happiness? The commentary states that blameless neutral feeling
    is included in happiness and the blameworthy in pain. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Again, the Buddha has stated that whatever is
    felt in this world, all that is pain. It is because of the changeable nature of all
    conditioned things. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">From another standpoint considering all forms
    of feeling as purely mental, there are only three kinds - namely, happiness <i>(sukha),</i>
    pain <i>(dukkha), </i>and neutral <i>(adukkhamasukha). </font></p>
    </i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Atthasalini explains them, as follows:-</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The term <i>sukha</i> means 'pleasurable
    feeling' <i>(sukha-vedana), </i>'root of happiness' <i>(sukha-mula),</i> 'pleasurable
    object' <i>(sukharammana),</i> 'cause of happiness' <i>(sukha-hetu),</i> 'conditioning
    state of pleasure, <i>(sukha-paccayatthana),</i> free from troubles' <i>(abyapajjha),</i>
    'Nibbana', etc.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the expression: &quot;By eliminating <i>sukha</i>&quot;
    - <i>sukha</i> means pleasurable feeling. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the expression: &quot;<i>Sukha</i> is
    non-attachment in this world&quot;. Here <i>sukha</i> means root of pleasure. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the expression: &quot;Since, o Mahali,
    form is <i>sukha,</i> falls and descends on sukha&quot;. Here <i>sukha</i> means object of
    pleasure. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Merit, o Bhikkhus, is a synonym for <i>sukha</i>.&quot;
    Here <i>sukha</i> means cause of pleasure. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Not easy is it, o Bhikkhus, to attain
    to heavenly <i>sukha</i> by description&quot;. &quot;They know not <i>sukha</i> who do not
    see <i>nandana</i>&quot;. Here <i>sukha</i> means conditioning state of pleasure. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;These states constitute a <i>sukha</i>
    life in this very world&quot;. Here <i>sukha</i> means freedom from troubles.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Nibbana is supreme <i>sukha''.</i> Here
    <i>sukha</i> means Nibbana. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">From these quotations the reader can
    understand in what different senses the term <i>sukha</i> is used in the texts. In this
    particular connection the term <i>sukha</i> is used in the sense of pleasurable feeling. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Nibbana is stated to be supreme bliss <i>(sukha).
    </i>This does not mean that there is a pleasurable feeling in Nibbana although the term <i>sukha</i>
    is used. Nibbana is a bliss of relief. The release from suffering is itself Nibbanic
    bliss. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The term <i>dukkha</i> means 'painful
    feeling', 'basis of pain', object of pain', cause of pain', 'conditioning state of pain',
    etc. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">''By eliminating <i>dukkha</i>&quot; - here <i>dukkha</i>
    means painful feeling. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Birth too is <i>dukkha</i>&quot; - here
    <i>dukkha</i> means basis of pain. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Since, o Mahali, form is <i>dukkha</i>,
    falls and descends on pain&quot; - here <i>dukkha</i> means object of <i>dukkha. </font></p>
    </i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Accumulation of evil is <i>dukkha</i>&quot;
    - here <i>dukkha</i> means cause of pain. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;It is not easy, o Bhikkhus, to realize
    the pain of woeful states by description&quot; - here <i>dukkha</i> means
    &quot;conditioning states of pain.&quot; </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In this particular connection the term <i>dukkha</i>
    is used in the sense of painful feeling. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the Dhammacakka Sutta the Buddha
    enumerates eight divisions of <i>dukkha </i>-namely: </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. Birth is suffering, 2. decay is suffering,
    3. disease is suffering, 4. death is suffering, 5. association with the unpleasant is
    suffering, 6. separation from the beloved is suffering, 7. when one does not obtain what
    one desires there is suffering, 8. in brief the Five Aggregates are suffering. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">All these are the causes of <i>dukkha.</i> </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When the Buddha addresses Devas and men He
    speaks of eight kinds of <i>dukkha.</i> When He addresses only men He speaks of twelve.
    Instead of <i>vyadhi</i> (disease) He says <i>soka</i> (grief), <i>parideva</i>
    (lamentation), <i>dukkha</i> (pain), <i>domanassa</i> (displeasure) <i>upayasa</i>
    (despair) are suffering. All these five are included in <i>vyadhi</i> which embraces both
    physical and mental disharmony. </font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Soka, domanassa,</i> and <i>upayasa</i>
    are mental, while <i>dukkha</i> and <i>parideva</i> are physical. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Practically there is no marked difference
    between the two formulas. </font></p>
    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Adukkha-m-asukha</b> is that which is
    neither pain nor happiness. It is a neutral feeling. This corresponds to both stolid
    indifference and Stoic indifference. The Pali term <i>upekkha,</i> which has a wider
    connotation, is more frequently used to denote this kind of neutral feeling. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In an immoral type of consciousness <i>upekkha</i>
    assumes the role of stolid indifference because it is prompted by ignorance. In an <i>ahetuka</i>
    resultant consciousness, such as a sense-impression, <i>upekkha</i> means simple neutral
    feeling which has no ethical value. <i>Adukkha-m-asukha</i> strictly applies in this
    connection. <i>Upekkha</i> latent in a <i>kamavacara sobhana citta</i> (Beautiful type of
    consciousness pertaining to the Sense-sphere) may be any of the following states - simple
    indifference (not stolid because there is no ignorance), simple neutral feeling,
    disinterestedness, unbiased feeling, Stoic indifference, and perfect equanimity. </font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Upekkha</i> in the <i>jhana</i>
    consciousness is perfect equanimity born of concentration. It is both ethical and
    intellectual. (See Ch. 1, Note 42. )</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to a still wider classification <i>vedana</i>
    is fivefold namely. </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">(i ) <i>sukha</i> (physical happiness),<br>
      (ii) <i>somanassa</i> (mental pleasure),<br>
      (iii) <i>dukkha</i> (physical pain), <br>
      (iv) <i>domanassa</i> (mental displeasure), <br>
      (v) <i>upekkha</i> (indifference, equanimity, or neutral feeling ) . </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">All feelings, from an ultimate standpoint,
    are mental because <i>vedana</i> is a <i>cetasika.</i> But a differentiation has been made
    with regard to <i>sukha</i> and <i>dukkha.</i> </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Of all the 89 types of consciousness only two
    are associated with either <i>sukha</i> or <i>dukkha.</i> One is the body-consciousness
    associated with happiness, and the other is body-consciousness associated with pain. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Both these are the resultant types of
    consciousness, effects of good and evil Kamma.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A soft touch, for instance, yields happiness.
    A pinprick, on the contrary, yields pain. In these cases one experiences the aforesaid two
    types of consciousness respectively. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now a question arises - Why only the
    body-consciousness is associated with happiness and pain? Why not the other
    sense-impressions? </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Mr. Aung provides an answer in his
    introductory essay to the Compendium: -</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The sense of touch alone is accompanied
    by the positive hedonic elements of pain and pleasure; the other four senses are
    accompanied by hedonic indifference. This exceptional distinction is assigned to the sense
    of touch, because the impact between the sentient surface <i>(pasada rupa) </i>and the
    respective objects of other senses, both sets of which are secondary qualities of body, is
    not strong enough to produce physical pain or pleasure. But in the case of touch there is
    contact with one or other, or all the three primary qualities (locality - <i>pathavi,</i>
    temperature - <i>tejo,</i> pressure - <i>vayo)</i> and this is strong enough to affect
    those primary qualities in the percipient's own body. Just as cotton wool on the anvil
    does not affect the latter, but a hammer striking cotton wool imparts its check to the
    anvil also.'' -- (Compendium of Philosophy p. 14). </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the case of touch the impact is strong.
    The &quot;essentials&quot;, <i>pathavi, tejo</i> and <i>vayo</i> (extension, heat, and
    motion) - <i>apo,</i> cohesion, is excluded being intangible - forcibly and directly
    strike against the essentials of the body. Consequently there is either pain or happiness.
    In the case of seeing, hearing, smelling, and tasting, there is a bare impact. The
    consequent feeling is neither pain nor happiness. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Although these sense-impressions may be <i>sukha,
    dukkha,</i> or <i>upekkha</i> the <i>javana</i> thought processes conditioned thereby may
    not necessarily be associated with a similar feeling. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">For instance, the Buddha experienced a
    body-consciousness associated with pain when a rock splinter struck His foot, but His <i>javana</i>
    thought-process conditioned thereby would not necessarily be associate with displeasure.
    Unaffected by the pain, He would have experienced perfect equanimity. The immanent feeling
    in the stream of consciousness would have been <i>upekkha.</i> Similarly at the sight of
    the Buddha, a right-understanding person would automatically experience an
    eye-consciousness associated with indifference <i>(upekkha-sahagata cakkhu-viññana)</i>
    but his <i>javana</i> thought would be moral. The innate feeling would be pleasure <i>(somanassa).
    </font></p>
    </i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This intricate point should be clearly
    understood. </font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Somanassa</i> (good-mindedness ) and <i>domanassa</i>
    (bad-mindedness) are purely mental. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These five kinds of feeling could be reduced
    to three, the three to two, and the two to one as follows:-</font></p>
    <dir>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">i. <i>sukha + somanassa; upekkha; dukkha +
      domanassa <br>
      </i>ii. <i>sukha ; upekkha; dukkha <br>
      </i>iii. <i>sukha; dukkha <br>
      </i>iv. <i>dukkha</i> <br>
      <i>(Upekkha</i> is merged in <i>sukha,</i> and <i>sukha</i> is ultimately merged in <i>dukkha).</i>
      </font></p>
    </dir>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">4. <b>Sukha</b> - physical happiness should
    be differentiated from <i>somanassa</i> - mental pleasure. So should <i>dukkha</i> -
    physical pain - be differentiated from <i>domanassa</i> - mental displeasure. There is
    only one consciousness accompanied by <i>sukha.</i> Similarly there is only one
    accompanied by <i>dukkha.</i> Both of them are the effects of good and bad actions
    respectively. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When the Buddha, for instance, was injured by

    object. No consciousness arises without an object, either mental or physical. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When a person is fast asleep and is in a
    dreamless state he experiences a kind of consciousness which is more passive than active.
    It is similar to the consciousness one experiences at the initial moment of conception and
    at the final moment of death. This type of consciousness is in Abhidhamma termed <i>bhavanga.</i>
    Like any other consciousness it also consists of three aspects - genesis <i>(uppada),</i>
    static <i>(thiti)</i> and cessation <i>(bhanga).</i> Arising and perishing every moment it
    flows on like a stream not remaining the same for two consecutive moments. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When an object enters this stream through the
    sense-doors, the <i>bhavanga</i> consciousness is arrested and another type of
    consciousness appropriate to the object perceived arises. Not only in a dreamless state
    but also in our waking state we experience <i>bhavanga</i> thought-moments more than any
    other types of consciousness. Hence <i>bhavanga</i> becomes an indispensable condition of
    life. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Mrs. Rhys Davids and Mr. Aung compare <i>bhavanga</i>
    to &quot;Leibniz's state of obscure perception, not amounting to consciousness, in
    dreamless sleep.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One cannot agree because <i>bhavanga</i> is a
    type of consciousness. There is no obscure perception here. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some identify <i>bhavanga</i> with
    sub-consciousness. According to the Dictionary of Philosophy sub-consciousness is ''a
    compartment of the mind alleged by certain psychologists and philosophers to exist below
    the threshold of consciousness.&quot; In the opinion of Western philosophers
    sub-consciousness and consciousness coexist. According to Abhidhamma no two types of
    consciousness coexist. Nor is <i>bhavanga</i> a sub-plane.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Compendium further states that
    &quot;bhavanga denotes a functional state (or moment ) of sub-consciousness. As such it is
    the sub-conscious state of mind - 'below the threshold' of consciousness - by which we
    conceive continuous subjective existence as possible. Thus it corresponds to F. W. Myer's
    'subliminal consciousness'&quot;.(p.266)</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Dictionary of Philosophy explains
    ''subliminal (sub, under + limen, the threshold) as allegedly unconscious mental processes
    especially sensations which lie below the threshold of consciousness.&quot; Strictly
    speaking, it does not correspond to subliminal consciousness either.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There does not seem to be any place for <i>bhavanga</i>
    in Western Psychology.</font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Bhavanga</i> is so called because it is an
    essential condition for continued subjective existence. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Whenever the mind does not receive a fresh
    external object, one experiences a <i>bhavanga</i> consciousness.* Immediately after a
    thought-process, too, there is a <i>bhavanga</i> consciousness. Hence it is called <i>vithimutta</i>
    - process-freed. Sometimes it acts as a buffer between two thought-processes . </font></p>

    it vibrates for one moment. When the <i>bhavanga</i> is arrested a thought-moment arises
    adverting the consciousness towards the object. If it is a physical object, the

    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">25. Javana </b>derived from <i>ju,</i> to
    run swiftly. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This is another important technical term
    which should be clearly understood. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Ordinarily the term is employed in the sense
    of swift. <i>Javanahamsa,</i> for example, means swift swan; <i>javana-pañña</i> means
    swift understanding. In the Abhidhamma it is used in a purely technical sense. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Here Javana means running. It is so called
    because in the course of a thought-process it runs consecutively for seven thought-moments
    or five, hanging on to an identical object. The mental states occurring in all these
    thought moments are similar, but the potential force differs.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When the consciousness perceives a vivid
    object usually seven moments of Javana arise in the particular thought-process. In the
    case of death or when the Buddha performs the Twin Psychic Phenomenon <i>(Yamaka
    Patihariya)</i> only five thought moments arise. In the Supramundane Javana process the
    Path-consciousness arises only for one moment. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This javana stage is the most important from
    a ethical standpoint. It is at this psychological stage that good or evil is actually
    done. Irrespective of the desirability or the undesirability of the object presented to
    the mind, one can make the Javana process good or bad. If, for instance, one meets an
    enemy, a thought of hatred will arise almost automatically. A wise and forbearing person
    might, on the contrary, harbour a thought of love towards him. This is the reason why the
    Buddha has stated in the Dhammapada (V. 165)</font></p>
    <dir>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;By self is evil done,<br>
      By self is one defiled,<br>

      By self is one purified.&quot; </font></p>
    </dir>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">True indeed that circumstances, habitual
    tendencies, environment, etc., condition our thoughts. Then the freewill is subordinated
    to the mechanistic course of events. There is also the possibility to overcome those
    external forces and, exercising one's own freewill, generate either good or bad thoughts. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A foreign element may be instrumental, but we
    ourselves are directly responsible for our own actions.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Of the normal seven Javana thought moments,
    the first is the weakest potentially as it lacks any previous sustaining force. The Karmic
    effect of this thought-moment may operate in this present life itself. It is called the <i>ditthadhammavedaniya
    kamma.</i> If it does not operate, it becomes ineffective <i>(ahosi).</i> The last is the
    second weakest, because the sustaining power is being spent. Its Karmic effect may operate
    in the immediately subsequent life <i>(upapajjavedaniya). </i>If it does not, it also
    becomes ineffective. The effects of the remaining five may operate at any time till one
    attains Parinibbana <i>(aparapariya-vedaniya). </font></p>
    </i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It should be understood that moral and
    immoral <i>javanas</i> <i>(kusalakusala) </i>refer to the active side of life <i>(kamma-bhava).</i>
    They condition the future existence <i>(upapattibhava). </i>Apart from them there are the <i>phala*</i>
    and <i>kriya javanas.</i> In the <i>Kriya javanas,</i> which are experienced only by
    Buddhas and Arahats, the respective <i>cetanas</i> lack Kamma creative power. </font></p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is extremely difficult to suggest a
    suitable rendering for Javana. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">''Apperception'' is suggested by some. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Dictionary of Philosophy defines
    apperception as &quot;the introspective or reflective apprehension by the mind of its own
    inner states. Leibniz, who introduced the term, distinguished between perception (the
    inner state as representing outer things) and apperception (the inner state as
    reflectively aware of itself). In Kant, apperception denotes the unity of
    self-consciousness pertaining to either the empirical ego (empirical apperception) or to
    the pure ego (transcendental apperception).&quot; p. 15. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Commenting on Javana Mrs. Rhys Davids says:- </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;&quot;I have spent many hours over
    Javana, and am content to throw apperception overboard for a better term, or for Javana,
    untranslated and as easy to pronounce as our own 'javelin.' It suffices to remember that
    it is the mental aspect or parallel of that moment in nerve-process, when central function
    is about to become efferent activity or 'innervation.' Teachers in Ceylon associate it
    with the word 'dynamic.' And its dominant interest for European psychologists is the
    fusion of intellect and will in Buddhist Psychology....&quot; -- (Compendium of
    Philosophy, p . 249). </font></p>

    commentators there is no intermediate <i>thiti</i> stage but only the stages of arising
    and passing away. Each thought-moment is followed by another. Time is thus the <i>sine qua
    non</i> of the succession of mental states. The fundamental unit of time is the duration
    of a thought-moment. Commentators say that the rapidity of these fleeting thought moments
    is such that within the brief duration of a flash of lightning there may be billions of
    thought-moments. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Matter, which also constantly changes,

    only for one thought-moment and that slips into the irrevocable past. In one sense there

    to dwell. In its primary sense it means a garden, field, or avenue. In its secondary sense
    it means a cause or condition. <i>Vatthu</i> is also applied to something that exists,
    that is, a substance, object, or thing. Referring to the three objects of worship, the

    flesh' <i>(mamsa cakkhu).</i> The commentary gives an account of the eye, of which the
    following is the substance: First the aggregate organism <i>(sasambhara-cakkhu):</i> a
    ball of flesh fixed in a cavity, bound by the socket bone beneath and by the bone of the
    eyebrow above, by the angles of the eye at the sides, by the brain within and by the
    eyelashes without. There are fourteen constituents: the four elements, the six attributes
    dependent on them, viz., colour, odour, taste, sap of life, form <i>(santhanam),</i> and
    collocation <i>(sambhavo); </i>vitality, sex, body-sensibility <i>(kayappasado),</i> and
    the visual sentient organ. The last four have their source in kamma. When 'the world,
    seeing an obvious extended white object fancies it perceives the eye, it only perceives
    the basis (or seat-<i>vatthu)</i> of the eye. And this ball of flesh, bound to the brain
    by nerve-fibers, is white, black and red, and contains the solid, the liquid, the lambent
    and the gaseous. It is white by superfluity of humour, black by superfluity of bile, red
    by superfluity of blood, rigid by superfluity of the solid, exuding by superfluity of the
    liquid, inflamed by superfluity of the lambent, quivering by superfluity of the gaseous.
    But that sentient organ <i>(pasado)</i> which is there bound, inherent, derived from the
    four great principles - this is the visual sense <i>(pasada-cakkhu).</i> Placed in the
    midst and in the front of the black disc of the composite eye, the white disc surrounding
    it (note that the iris is either not distinguished or is itself the 'black disc') and in
    the circle of vision, in the region where the forms of adjacent bodies come to appear, it
    permeates the seven ocular membranes as sprinkled oil will permeate seven cotton wicks.
    And so it stands, aided by the four elements, sustaining, maturing, moving (samudiranam) -
    like an infant prince and four nurses, feeding, bathing, dressing, and fanning him -
    maintained by nutriment both physical <i>(utu)</i> and mental, protected by the (normal)
    span of life, invested with colour, smell, taste, and so forth, in size the measure of a
    louse's head - stands duly constituting itself the door of the seat of visual cognitions
    etc. For as it has been said by the Commander of the Doctrine (Sariputta): </font></p>

    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">98. Hadayavatthu </b>- heart-base. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to the commentators, <i>hadayavatthu</i>
    is the seat of consciousness. Tradition says that within the cavity of the heart there is
    some blood, and depending on which lies the seat of consciousness. It was this cardiac
    theory that prevailed in the Buddha's time, and this was evidently supported by the
    Upanishads. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha could have adopted this popular
    theory, but He did not commit Himself. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Mr. Aung in his Compendium argues that the
    Buddha was silent on this point. He did not positively assert that the seat of
    consciousness was either in the heart or in the brain. In the Dhammasangani the term <i>hadayavatthu</i>
    has purposely been omitted. In the Patthana, instead of using hadaya as the seat of
    consciousness, the Buddha has simply stated <i>'yam rupain nissaya'</i> - 'depending on
    that <i>rupa.'</i> Mr. Aung's opinion is that the Buddha did not want to reject the
    popular theory. Nor did He advance a new theory that brain is the seat of consciousness as
    is regarded by modern scientists. </font></p>

    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Mano-dhatu </i>- is applied to the two
