        <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is by means of the conceptualized image

        <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Whatever object amongst the earth kasinas and

        meditation is preliminary mental culture. When that sign is perceived by the mind and
        enters the mind-door as if seen by the very (physical) eye then it is called the abstract
        sign. That meditation becomes well established.</font></p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Likewise when a counter-image born of
        mediation, freed from original defects (20) reckoned as a concept, is well established and
        fixed in the mind of one who is well composed and who thereafter, practices meditation on
        the abstract sign by means of preliminary concentration then it is said that the
        conceptualized image has arisen. </font></p>
        <b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Rupa Jhana</font></p>

        free from obstacles, pertaining to the <i>kama</i>-Sphere, arises. Then he who develops
        the conceptualized image by means of 'proximate concentration' attains to the first <i>jhana</i>
        of the <i>rupa</i>-Sphere. </font></p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Thenceforth by bringing that very first <i>jhana</i>
        under one's sway by means of these five kinds of mastery (21) - namely, reflection,

        coarse factors like 'initial application' and so forth, and by developing the subtle
        factors like 'sustained application and so forth attains, by degrees, according to
        circumstances, to the second <i>jhana</i> and so forth. </font></p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Thus with respect to twenty-two subjects of
        mental culture such as the earth kasina, etc., the conceptualized image is obtained. But

        practices concentration on that very first <i>arupa jhana,</i> thinking that 'it is
        infinite', there arises the second <i>arupa jhana.</i> To one who practices concentration
        on the non-existence of the first <i>arupa</i>-consciousness, the thinking 'there is
        naught whatever' - there arises the third <i>arupa jhana.</i> To him who practices

    </b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. <b>Kammatthana</b> - Here this term is
    used in a technical sense. Kamma means the act of meditation or contemplation. <i>Thana,</i>
    literally, station, ground, or occasion, implies subjects or exercises. <i>Kammatthana,</i>
    therefore, means 'subjects of meditation' or 'meditation exercises'. There are forty such
    subjects of meditation. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">2. <b>Samatha</b> derived from Ö <i>sam,</i>
    to lull, to subdue, denotes 'tranquillity' 'quietude', gained by subduing the Hindrances.
    It is synonymous with concentration <i>(samadhi) </i>which leads to the development of <i>jhanas.</i>
    By concentration passions are only temporarily inhibited. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">3. <b>Vipassana,</b> derived from <i>vi + Ö
    dis,</i> to see, literally means perceiving in diverse ways, that is in the light of
    transiency, sorrowfulness, and soullessness. It is rendered by 'insight', 'contemplation',
    'intuition', 'introspection'. The sole object see things as they truly are, in
    Emancipation. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">4. <b>Carita</b> signifies the intrinsic
    nature of a person, which is revealed when one is in a normal state without being
    preoccupied with anything. The temperaments of people differ owing to the diversity of
    their actions or Kammas. Habitual actions tend to form particular temperaments. </font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Raga</i> (lust) is predominant in some,
    while <i>dosa</i> (anger, hatred or ill will), in others. Most people belong to these two
    categories. There are a few others who lack intelligence and are more or less ignorant <i>(moha-carita).</i>
    Akin to the ignorant are those whose minds oscillate, unable to focus their attention
    deliberately on one thing <i>(vitakka-carita).</i> By nature some are exceptionally devout
    <i>(saddha-carita), </i>while others are exceptionally intelligent <i>(buddhi-carita). </font></p>
    </i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, in brief, there are six kinds of
    temperaments.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">By combining them with one another, we get 63
    types. With the inclusion of <i>ditthi-carita</i> (speculative temperament) there are 64. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">5. The preliminary stages of mental
    development are termed <i>parikamma-bhavana</i>. Mental culture, from the moment one
    develops the conceptualized image and temporarily inhibits the Hindrances, until the <i>gotrabhu</i>
    thought-moment in the <i>jhana javana</i> process, is termed <i>upacara-bhavana</i>. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The thought-moment that immediately follows
    the <i>gotrabhu</i> thought-moment is called <i>appana,</i> ecstatic concentration,
    because vitakka (initial application), the foremost <i>jhana</i> constituent, persists as
    if firmly fixed upon the object of concentration. </font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Jhana</i> Thought-Process: <i>manodvaravajjana
    / parikamma, upacara, anuloma, gotrabhu, appana / bhavanga.</font></p>
    </i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">6. Any object, such as a <i>kasina,</i>
    used for preliminary mental culture is termed <i>'parikamma-nimitta'. </font></p>
    </i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The same object, when mentally perceived
    with closed eyes, is termed <i>'uggaha-nimitta'. </font></p>
    </i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The identical visualized image, freed
    from all <i>kasina</i> defects, is termed <i>'patibhaganimitta'</i> when it serves as an
    object of <i>upacara</i> and <i>appana bhavana.</i> </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">7. <b>Kasina</b> means 'whole, 'all,
    'complete'. It is so called because the light issuing from the conceptualized image is
    extended everywhere without any limitation.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the case of <i>pathavi-kasina</i> one
    makes a circle of about one span and four fingers in diameter and, covering it with
    dawn-coloured clay, smoothes it well. If there be not enough clay of dawn-coloured, he may
    put in some other kind of clay beneath. This prepared circle is known as <i>kasina-mandala</i>
    and is also called <i>parikamma-nimitta.</i> Now he places this object two and half cubits
    away from him and concentrates on it, saying mentally or inaudibly - <i>pathavi, pathavi</i>
    or earth, earth. The purpose is to gain one-pointedness of mind. When he does this for
    some time, perhaps weeks, or months, or years, he will be able to close his eyes and
    visualize the object. This visualized object is called <i>'uggaha-nimitta'.</i> Then he
    concentrates on this visualized image until it develops into a conceptualized or
    counter-image free from original <i>kasina</i> faults. This is known as the
    'patibhaganimitta'. As he continually concentrates on this abstract concept he is said to
    be in possession of proximate or neighborhood concentration <i>(upacara-samadhi).</i> At
    this stage the innate five Hindrances are temporarily inhibited. Eventually he gains
    'ecstatic concentration' <i>(appana samadhi). </font></p>
    </i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">For the water-<i>kasina</i> one may take
    a vessel full of colourless water, preferably rain water, and concentrate on it, saying - <i>apo,
    apo,</i> (water, water) until he gains one-pointedness of mind. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To develop the fire-<i>kasina</i> one may
    kindle a fire before him and concentrate on it through a hole, a span and four fingers in
    diameter, in a rush-mat, a piece of leather, or a piece of cloth, saying <i>tejo, tejo,</i>
    (fire, fire). </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One who develops the air-<i>kasina</i>
    concentrates on the wind that enters through window space or a hole in the wall, saying, <i>vayo,
    vayo</i> (air, air). </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To develop the colour-<i>kasinas</i> one may
    take a <i>mandala</i> of the prescribed size, and colour it blue, yellow, red, or white
    and concentrate on it, repeating the name of the colour as in the case of the other <i>kasinas.
    </font></p>
    </i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One may even concentrate on blue, yellow,
    red, or white flowers. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Light <i>kasina</i> may be developed by
    concentrating on the moon, or on an unflickering lamplight, or on a circle of light cast
    on the ground, or on the wall by sunlight or moonlight entering through a wall-crevice or
    hole, saying - <i>aloka, aloka</i> (light, light). </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Space-kasina can be developed by
    concentrating on a hole, a span and four fingers in diameter, in either a well-covered
    pavilion or a piece of leather, or a mat, saying, <i>okasa, okasa</i> (space, space). </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It may be mentioned that light and space <i>kasinas</i>
    are not mentioned in the Texts. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">8. <b>Asubha</b> - Those ten kinds of corpses
    were found in ancient Indian cemeteries and charnel places where dead bodies were not
    buried or cremated and where flesh-eating animals frequented. In modern days they are out
    of the question. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">9. <b>Anussati</b> - literally, means
    repeated reflection or constant mindfulness. </font></p>
    <dir>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">i. <b>Buddhanussati</b> is the reflection on
      the virtues of the Buddha as, for example: &quot;Such indeed is that Exalted One, Worthy,
      Fully Enlightened, Endowed with Wisdom and Conduct, Well-farer, Knower of the Worlds, an
      Incomparable Charioteer for the training of individuals, Teacher of gods and men,
      Omniscient, and Holy&quot;.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">ii. <b>Dhammanussati</b> is reflection on the
      virtues of the Doctrine as, for example: &quot;Well-expounded is the doctrine by the
      Exalted One, to be realized by oneself, of immediate fruit, inviting investigation,
      leading to Nibbana, to be understood by the wise, each one for himself&quot;. </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">iii. <b>Sanghanussati</b> is the reflection
      on the virtues of the pure members of the Noble Celibate Order as follows: &quot;Of good
      conduct is the Order of the disciples of the Exalted One; of upright conduct is the Order
      of the disciples of the Exalted One; of wise conduct is the Order of the disciples of the
      Exalted One; of dutiful conduct is the Order of the disciples of the Exalted One. The four
      pairs of persons constitute eight individuals. This Order of the disciples of the Exalted
      One is worthy of offerings, is worthy of hospitality, is worthy of gifts, is worthy of
      reverential salutation, is an incomparable field of merit for the world&quot;. </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">iv. <b>Silanussati</b> is reflection on the
      one's own virtuous conduct.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">v. <b>Caganussati</b> is reflection on one's
      own charitable nature. </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">vi. <b>Devatanussati</b> - &quot;Deities are
      born in such exalted states on account of their faith and other virtues. I too possess
      them.&quot; Thus when one reflects again and again on one's own faith and others' virtues,
      placing deities as witnesses, it is called Devatanussati.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">vii. <b>Upasamanussati</b> is reflection on
      the attributive qualities of Nibbana, such as the cessation of suffering, etc.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">viii. <b>Marananussati</b> is reflection on
      the termination of psycho physical life.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Contemplation on death enables one to
      comprehend the fleeting nature of life. When one understands that death is certain and
      life is uncertain one endeavors to make the best use of one's life by working for
      self-development and for the development of others, instead of wholly indulging in sensual
      pleasures. Constant meditation on death does not make one pessimistic and lethargic but,
      on the contrary, it makes one more active and energetic. Besides one can face death with
      serenity. </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">While contemplating death, one may think that
      life is like a flame, or that all so-called beings are the outward temporary
      manifestations of the invisible Karmic energy, just as an electric light is the outward
      manifestation of the invisible electric energy. Choosing various similes, one may meditate
      on the uncertainty of life and on the certainty of death. </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">ix. <b>Kayagatasati </b>is reflection on the
      32 impure parts of the body such as hair, hair of the body, nails, teeth, skin, etc. This
      meditation on the loathsomeness of the body, leads to dispassion. Many Bhikkhus in the
      time of the Buddha attained Arahatship by meditating on these impurities. If one is not
      conversant with all the thirty-two parts, one may meditate on one part such as bones. </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Within this body is found a skeleton. It is
      full of flesh which is covered with a skin. Beauty is nothing but skin deep. When one
      reflects thus on the impure parts of the body passionate attachment to this body gradually
      disappears. </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This meditation may not appeal to those who
      are not sensual. They may meditate on the innate creative possibilities of this complex
      machinery of man. </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The thirty-two parts of the body are
      enumerated as follows: </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Hair, hair of the body, nails, teeth,
      skin, flesh, sinew, bones, marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs,
      bowels, mesentery, stomach, faeces, brain, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, lymph, tears,
      grease, saliva, nasal mucus, articular fluid, and urine&quot;. </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">x. <b>Anapanasati</b> is mindfulness on
      respiration. <i>Ana</i> means inhalation and <i>apana</i> exhalation. In some books these
      two terms are explained in the reverse way. Concentration on the breathing process leads
      to one-pointedness of the mind, and ultimately to Insight which leads to Arahatship. </font></p>
    </dir>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">10. This is one of the best subjects of
    meditation, which appeals equally to all. The Buddha also practiced <i>anapanasati</i>
    before His Enlightenment. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A detailed exposition of this meditation is
    found in the Satipatthana Sutta and in the Visuddhi Magga. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A few practical hints are given here for the
    benefit of the average reader. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Adopting a convenient posture, breathe out
    and close the mouth. Then breathe in through the nostrils calmly, without strain. Inhale
    first and count mentally one. Exhale and count two, concentrating on the breathing
    process. In this manner count up to ten, constantly focusing your attention on
    respiration. It is possible for the mind to wander before one counts up to ten. But one
    need not be discouraged. Try again until success is achieved. Gradually one can increase
    the number of series, say five series of ten. Later one can concentrate on the breathing
    process without counting. Some prefer counting as it aids concentration; while others
    prefer not to count. What is essential is concentration, and not counting, which is
    secondary. When one does this concentration exercise one feels light in body and mind and
    very peaceful. One might perhaps feel as if one were floating in the air. When one
    practices this concentration for a certain period, a day may come when one will realize
    that his so-called body is supported by mere breath, and that the body perishes when
    breathing ceases. Thus one fully realizes impermanence. Where there is change there cannot
    be a permanent entity or an immortal soul. Insight might then be developed to gain
    Arahatship. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is now clear that the object of this
    concentration on respiration is not merely to gain one-pointedness but also to cultivate
    Insight in order to obtain Deliverance. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This simple method may be pursued by all
    without any harm. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">For more details readers are referred to the
    Visuddhi Magga. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In some Suttas this simple method of
    respiration is explained as follows: </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Attentively he breathes in, attentively
    he breathes out. </font></p>
    <dir>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. When making a long inhalation he knows, 'I
      make a long inhalation; when making a long exhalation, he knows, 'I make a long
      exhalation'. </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">2. When making a short inhalation he knows,
      'I make a short inhalation'; when making a short exhalation he knows, 'I make a short
      exhalation'. </font></p>

      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">4. 'Calming this breathing process <i>(passam
      bhayam kayasankharam),</i> I will inhale' thus he trains himself; 'calming this breathing
      process, I will exhale': thus he trains himself. </font></p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">11. <b>Brahmavihara</b> - Here Brahma means
    sublime, as in <i>brahmacariya</i> (sublime life). <i>Vihara</i> means mode or 'state of
    conduct' or 'state of living'. They are also termed <i>appamañña</i> (limitless,
    boundless) because these thoughts are radiated towards all beings, without limit or
    obstruction. </font></p>
    <dir>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">i. <b>Metta</b> (Sanskrit: Maitri)
      loving-kindness, benevolence, goodwill - is defined as that which softens one's heart. It
      is not carnal love or personal affection. The direct enemy of Metta is hatred, ill will or
      aversion <i>(kodha); </i>its indirect enemy is personal affection <i>(pema).</i> Metta
      embraces all beings without exception. The culmination of Metta is the identification of
      oneself with all beings <i>(sabbattata).</i> It is the wish for the good and happiness of
      all. Benevolent attitude is its chief characteristic. It discards ill will. </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">ii. <b>Karuna</b> - compassion - is defined
      as that which makes the hearts of the good quiver when others are subject to suffering, or
      that which dissipates the sufferings of others. Its chief characteristic is the wish to
      remove the sufferings of others. Its direct enemy is wickedness <i>(himsa) </i>and its
      indirect enemy is passionate grief <i>(domanassa)</i> Compassion embraces sorrow-stricken
      beings, and it eliminates cruelty. </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">iii. <b>Mudita</b> is not mere sympathy but
      sympathetic or appreciative joy. Its direct enemy is jealousy, and its indirect enemy is
      exhilaration <i>(pahasa).</i> Its chief characteristic is happy acquiescence in others'
      prosperity and success <i>(anumodana).</i> Mudita embraces prosperous beings. It
      eliminates dislike <i>(arati) </i>and is the congratulatory attitude of a person. </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">iv. <b>Upekkha</b> literally, means to view
      impartially, that is, with neither attachment nor aversion. It is not hedonic indifference
      but perfect equanimity or a well-balanced mind. It is the balanced state of mind amidst
      all vicissitudes of life such as praise and blame, pain and happiness gain and loss,
      repute and disrepute. Its direct enemy is attachment<i> (raga)</i> and its indirect enemy
      is callousness. Upekkha discards clinging and aversion. Impartial attitude is its chief
      characteristic. </font></p>
    </dir>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Here Upekkha does not mean mere neutral
    feeling, but implies a sterling virtue. Equanimity, mental equilibrium, are its closest

          2. 'established or ecstatic concentration'. </font></p>

        <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Purity of Views (38) is the understanding of
        mind and matter with respect to their characteristics, function, mode of appearance, and
        proximate cause. </font></p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Purity of Transcending Doubts (39) is the
        comprehension of the causes of those very mind and matter. </font></p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">After comprehending the causes, the
        meditator, considering the methods of aggregates, etc., formulates in groups the
        conditioned things of the triple plane, that have arisen with causes, differing according
        to the past, etc., and that have been comprehended in the foregoing manner. Now he
        meditates on the three characteristics - impermanence in the sense of dissolution,
        suffering in the sense of fearfulness, and soullessness in the sense of unsubstantiality -
        by way of duration, continuity, and momentariness. To him who meditates on the arising and
        passing away of things by means of the knowledge so named with respect to causes and
        momentariness there arise - </font></p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">an aura, joy, quietude, excessive faith,

        <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Purity of Vision in discerning what is the
        Path and what is not the Path (40), is the determining of characteristics of Path and not
        Path by understanding an aura etc., as inimical impediments of insight. </font></p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Getting rid of these inimical impediments,
        the meditator reflects on the three Characteristics. Now to him, starting from the
        knowledge of arising and passing away, and extending up to the knowledge of adaptation,
        there arise in one continuous stream of contemplation, nine kinds of Insight. By Purity of
        Vision that discerns the method (41) is meant these nine kinds of knowledge. </font></p>
        <b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Realization</font></p>
        </b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When he thus practices contemplation,
        owing to the ripening of insight (he feels) 'Now the development (of the path) (42) will
        arise'. Thereupon arresting the life-continuum, arises mind-door consciousness, followed
        by two or three (moments of) insight consciousness having for their object any of the
        Characteristics such as impermanence etc. They are termed 'preliminary', 'proximate', and
        'adaptation' (moments) (43). </font></p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">That knowledge of equanimity towards
        conditioned things, together with knowledge that conforms (to the truths), when perfected,
        is also termed 'Insight of emergence leading to the Path (44). </font></p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There after the <i>gotrabhu</i>-consciousness
        (45), having Nibbana as its object occurs, overcoming the lineage of the worldlings, and

          <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Immediately after that consciousness, the
          Path (of the Stream-Winner)*, realizing the Truth of suffering, eradicating the Truth of
          its cause, realizing the Truth of its cessation, and developing the Truth of the Way to
          its cessation, descends into the (supramundane) <i>appana</i> thought-process. </font></p>
          <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">After that Path-consciousness two or three
          moments of Fruit-consciousness arise and subside into the life-continuum (46). Then,
          arresting the life-continuum, the knowledge of reflection occurs. </font></p>
          <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The wise man reflects (47) on the Path,

    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Notes:</font></p>
    </b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">24. <b>Vipassana</b> or Insight is the
    third and final stage on the Path of Sainthood. The chief object of Insight is to
    understand things as they truly are. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">25. <b>Anicca,</b> i.e., the fleeting nature
    of both mind and matter. Changeableness is a characteristic of everything that is
    conditioned. All conditioned things are constantly changing, not remaining static for two
    consecutive moments. Mind, in fact, changes even faster than matter. Normally matter
    endures only for seventeen thought-moments. Commentators state that, during the time
    occupied by a flash of lightning, billions of thought-moments may arise. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">26. <b>Dukkha</b> - All conditioned things
    are subject to suffering. Birth is suffering, decay is suffering, disease is suffering,
    death is suffering. Union with the unpleasant is suffering. Separation from the pleasant
    is suffering. Not to get what one desires is suffering. In brief, the five aggregates of
    attachment are suffering.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">27. <b>Anatta</b> - Or Soullessness is the
    crux of Buddhism. As there is no permanent entity in matter, so also there is no
    unchanging entity in mind conceived as an 'ego' or soul'. In everything mundane and
    supramundane conditioned and non-conditioned, there is no permanent soul. Hence the Buddha
    in the Dhammapada stated <i>'sabbe dhamma anatta</i> - all dhammas are soulless'. With
    regard to <i>anicca</i> and <i>dukkha</i> the Buddha said <i>'sankhara</i> - conditioned
    things'. With regard to <i>anatta,</i> the Buddha employed the term <i>dhamma</i> to
    include supramundane unconditioned Nibbana as well. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It may be mentioned that it was after hearing
    the 'Anattalakkhana Sutta', the discourse on soullessness, that the first five monks
    attained Arahatship. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The aspirant does not usually meditate on all
    these three characteristics. Of them, he takes only that which appeals to him most.
    Deliverance, gained by meditating on one of them, is named accordingly. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">28. <b>Sammasanañana</b> - Lit.,
    'handling-knowledge', is the investigating of aggregates as composite <i>(kalapavasena). </font></p>
    </i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">29. <b>Patisankhañana</b> is the
    recontemplation of conditioned things in order to find out the means to escape the refrom.
    </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">30. <b>Sankharupekkha-ñana</b> is perfect
    equanimity towards all conditioned things, having neither attachment nor aversion,
    resulting from developing the foregoing different kinds of Insight. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">31. <b>Anuloma-ñana</b> is the 'adaptation
    knowledge' gained by perfecting the foregoing nine kinds of Insight. It is so called
    because it conforms itself to 37 Factors of Enlightenment and qualifies the aspirant for
    the higher path. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">32. <b>Vimokkha</b> - so called because the
    deliver one from the ten Fetters, etc.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">33. <b>Suññata</b> - devoid of a soul.
    Emancipation gained by meditating on soullessness <i>(anatta) </i>is called <i>suññata-vimokkha.</i>
    </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">34. <b>Animitta</b> - free from the signs of
    permanence, etc. Emancipation gained by meditating on 'impermanence' <i>(anicca)</i> is
    called <i>animitta-vimokkha.</i> </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">35. <b>Appanihita</b> - free from the
    hankering of craving. Emancipation gained by meditating on 'suffering' <i>(dukkha) </i>is
    called <i>appanihita-vimokkha.</i> </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">36. <b>Silavisuddhi</b> - Purity of Morals,
    is the first of seven 'Purities'. It consists of four kinds, all pertaining to the life of
    a Bhikkhu.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The first is <i>patimokkhasamvarasila.</i>
    'That which saves one who observes it from woeful states' is the commentarial explanation
    of <i>'patimokkha'.</i> <i>Pa</i> is also explained as the Buddhas Teaching. <i>Atipamokkha</i>
    means extremely important. <i>Patimokkha</i> therefore means &quot;Fundamental
    Teaching&quot; or &quot;Fundamental Precepts&quot;. It deals with 220* disciplinary rules
    which every Bhikkhu is expected to observe. As it restrains one from evil deeds, etc., it
    is termed <i>'samvara'.</i> Sila is used in the sense of 'composure' <i>(samadhana) </i>and
    'support' <i>(upadharana).</i> It is so called because it tends to discipline thoughts,
    words, and deeds, and because it acts as a support for other virtues. <i>Indrivasamvarasila</i>
    the second <i>sila,</i> deals with the control of the six senses. <i>Ajivaparisuddhisila,</i>
    the third <i>sila,</i> deals with the right livelihood of a Bhikkhu. In obtaining the
    necessaries of life, a Bhikkhu should not act in an unbecoming way. <i>Paccayasannissitasila</i>
    the fourth <i>sila,</i> is concerned with the unselfish use of the four requisites -
    robes, alms, lodging, and medicine.</font></p>
    <dir>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">*227 including seven ways of settling
      disputes<i> (adhikarana samatha dhamma).</i></font></p>
    </dir>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">37. <b>Cittavisuddhi</b> - is the second
    'Purity. It is the purity of mind, gained by developing the <i>jhanas,</i> temporarily
    inhibiting the Hindrances. A purified mind is like a polished mirror where everything is
    reflected in its true perspective. With a purified mind one can see things as they truly
    are. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">38. <b>Ditthivisuddhi</b> - is the third
    'Purity'. It is so called because it purifies one from the false theory of a permanent
    soul. This correct comprehension results from investigating mind and matter as regards
    their salient characteristics <i>(lakkhana),</i> function or essential properties <i>(rasa),</i>
    the way of manifestation <i>(paccupatthana),</i> and their immediate cause <i>(padatthana).
    </font></p>
    </i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">39. <b>Kankhavitaranavisuddhi</b> - is
    the fourth 'Purity' which attempts to transcend skeptical doubts as regards cause and
    effect, the past, the present, and the future. This is called a purity because it removes
    the stain of erroneous views of 'chance', causelessness', etc.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To achieve this purity one meditates on the
    various causes that tend to produce present mind and matter, and on the causes that
    sustain them in the present. He understands that present mind and matter at conception
    were conditioned by past ignorance, craving, grasping and Kamma, and, during lifetime,
    matter is conditioned by kamma, mind, seasonal phenomena, and edible food, while mind is
    sustained by the senses and their corresponding objects. Thus he realizes the second noble
    truth of the cause of suffering and rids himself of doubts. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">40. <b>Maggamaggañanadassanavisuddhi</b> -
    This is the fifth 'Purity'. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The aspirant ho has cleared his doubts,
    meditates again with better understanding on the three characteristics of <i>anicca,
    dukkha,</i> and <i>anatta.</i> He realizes that life is a mere flowing, a continuous
    undivided movement. He finds no genuine happiness, for every form of pleasure is only a
    prelude to pain. What is transient is painful, and where change and sorrow prevail there
    cannot be a permanent ego or soul. The arising and passing away of conditioned things
    become very conspicuous to him. As he is thus absorbed in meditation he witnesses an aura <i>(obhaso)</i>
    emanating from his body as a result of his keen insight. He experiences also an
    unprecedented joy <i>(piti), </i>happiness <i>(sukha),</i> and quietude <i>(passaddhi).</i>
    He becomes strenuous <i>(paggaho) </i>and even-minded <i>(upekkha).</i> His religious
    fervour increases <i>(adhimokkha),</i> mindfulness <i>(sati) </i>strengthens, and wisdom <i>(ñana)</i>
    ripens. Laboring under the misconception that he has attained Sainthood, chiefly owing to
    the presence of the aura, he yearns <i>(nikanti)</i> for this state of mind. Soon he
    realizes that these temptations are only impediments <i>(upakkilesa) </i>to Insight, and
    that he has not really attained Sainthood. Accordingly he endeavours to distinguish
    between the right and wrong path <i>(maggamaggañanadassana).</i> It is called a 'purity
    because it clears up the misconception as regards the actual 'path'. He understands, 'This

    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">41. <b>Patipadañanadassanavisuddhi</b> - is
    the sixth 'Purity'. This term is collectively applied to the nine kinds of Insight
    beginning with the knowledge as regards the arising and passing away of conditioned
    things, and ending with the knowledge of adaptation that occurs in the Path thought-moment
    immediately preceding the <i>gotrabhu</i> moment. (See above footnote ) </font></p>

    name given to both <i>sankharupekkha-ñana</i> and <i>anuloma-ñana</i> of the ten kinds
    of Insight. It is so called because it leads to the Path emerging from woeful states and
    signs of conditioned things. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">45. <b>Gotrabhu</b> - lit, means 'overcoming
    the worldly lineage'. The object of this thought-moment is Nibbana, but the actual
    realization of Nibbana by the eradication of passions occurs at the Path thought-moment
    that immediately follows. This particular thought-moment in the three higher stages of
    Sainthood is termed <i>'vodana'</i> (pure) as the aspirant is already an Ariya. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">46. Immediately after the <i>gotrabhu</i>
    thought-moment there arises the Path thought-moment of the Sotapanna. It is at this stage
    that one comprehends the Truth of Suffering, eradicates craving, the cause of suffering,
    and actually realizes Nibbana for the first time in his life. The eight factors that
    constitute the Noble Path are also fully developed at this stage. This particular
    thought-moment is termed <i>'sotapatti-magga'.</i> <i>Sota</i> here means the stream that
    leads to Nibbana. It is the Noble Eightfold Path. <i>Apatti</i> means 'entering for the
    first time'. It is called <i>'magga'</i> because it arises, destroying the passions. This
    Path thought-moment arises only once in the course of one's lifetime, and is immediately
    followed by two or three 'Fruit' <i>(phala)</i> moments before the stream of consciousness
    lapses into <i>bhavanga.</i> This is the reason why the Dhamma is called <i>'akalika'</i>
    (immediately effective). </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">47. <b>Paccavekkhanañanani</b> - As a rule
    after each of the four stages of Sainthood one reflects on the Path and Fruit one has
    attained, on the Nibbana one has realized, on the defilements one has destroyed, and in
    the case of the first three stages, on the defilements one has yet to destroy. An Arahat
    who has no more defilements to destroy knows that he is delivered. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There are altogether 19 kinds of such
    reflective knowledge, 15 pertaining to the first three stages of Sainthood, and 4 to the
    last stage. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Pali phrase - <i>n'aparam itthatthaya</i>
    - No more of this state again - refers to this process of reflection. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">48. <b>Nanadassanavisuddhi</b> is the name
    given to the contemplative knowledge, a mental state of wisdom found in the
    Path-Consciousness. It is called a 'purity', because it is completely free from all stains
    or defilements, resulting from the realization of the four Truths. It is the seventh
    'purity'. </font></p>

    developed, the mind is so purified, that it resembles a polished mirror, where everything
    is clearly reflected in true perspective. Still, there is not complete freedom from
    unwholesome thoughts, for, by concentration, the evil tendencies are only temporarily
    inhibited. They may rise to the surface at quite unexpected moments. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Discipline regulates words and deeds;
    concentration controls the mind; but it is Insight <i>(pañña)</i> the third and the
    final stage, that enables the aspirant to Sainthood to eradicate wholly the defilements
    inhibited by <i>samadhi</i>. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">At the outset he cultivates 'Purity of
    Vision' <i>(ditthi visuddhi)</i> (the third member of the Path of Purity) in order to see
    things as they truly are. With a one-pointed mind he analyses and examines this so-called
    being. This searching examination shows that what he has called 'I', is merely a complex
    compound of mind and matter which are in a state of constant flux. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Having thus gained a correct view of the real
    nature of this so-called being, freed from the false notion of a permanent soul, he
    searches for the causes of this 'I' personality. He realizes that there is nothing in the
    world which is not conditioned by some cause or causes, past or present, and that his
    present existence is due to past ignorance <i>(avijja),</i> craving <i>(tanha),</i>
    attachment <i>(upadana),</i> Kamma, and physical food of the present life. On account of
    these five causes this so-called being has arisen, and as past causes have conditioned the
    present, so the present will condition the future. Meditating thus, he transcends all
    doubts with regard to past, present and future (<i>kankhavitaranavisuddhi,</i> the fourth
    member of the Path of Purity). </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Thereupon he contemplates the truth that all
    conditioned things are transient <i>(anicca), </i>subject to suffering <i>(dukkha),</i>
    and devoid of an immortal soul <i>(anatta).</i> Wherever he turns his eyes he sees naught
    but these three characteristics standing out in bold relief. He realizes that life is a
    flux conditioned by internal and external causes. Nowhere does he find any genuine
    happiness for everything is fleeting. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As he thus contemplates the real nature of
    life, and is absorbed in meditation a day comes, when, to his surprise, he witnesses an
    aura <i>(obhasa)</i> emitted by his body. He experiences an unprecedented pleasure
    happiness and quietude. He becomes even-minded, his religious fervour increases,
    mindfulness becomes clear and insight keen. Mistaking this advanced state of moral
    progress for Sainthood, chiefly owing to the presence of the aura, he develops a liking
    for this mental state. Soon the realization comes that these new developments are
    impediments to moral progress and he cultivates the purity of knowledge with regard to the
    Path and Non-Path (<i>maggamaggañanadassanavisuddhi,</i> the fifth member of the Path of
    Purity).</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Perceiving the right path, he resumes his
    meditation on the arising <i>(udaya ñana)</i> and passing away <i>(vaya ñana)</i> of all
    conditioned things. Of these two states the latter becomes more impressed on his mind
    since change is more conspicuous than becoming. Therefore he directs his attention to
    contemplation of the dissolution of things <i>(bhanga ñana).</i> He perceives that both
    mind and matter which constitute this so-called being are in a state of constant flux, not
    remaining the same for two consecutive moments. To him then comes the knowledge that all
    dissolving things are fearful <i>(bhaya ñana).</i> The whole world appears to him like a
    pit of burning embers, a source of danger. Subsequently he reflects on the wretchedness
    and vanity <i>(adinava ñana) </i>of the fearful and deluded world, and develops a feeling
    of disgust <i>(nibbida ñana),</i> followed by a strong will for deliverance from it <i>(muñcitukamyata
    ñana). </font></p>
    </i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">With this object in view, he resumes his
    meditation on the three characteristics of transiency, sorrow, and soullessness <i>(patisankha
    ñana),</i> and thereafter develops complete equanimity towards all conditioned things,
    having neither attachment nor aversion for any worldly object <i>(upekkha ñana).*</i></font></p>

    </dir>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Reaching this point of spiritual culture, he

    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">On attaining this first stage of Sainthood he

    namely: </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. <b>Sakkaya-ditthi</b> - <i>sati + kaye +
    ditthi,</i> literally, view when a group exists. Here <i>kaya</i> refers to the five
    Aggregates of matter, feeling, perception, mental states, and consciousness, or, in other
    words, to the complex-compound of mind and matter. The view that there is one unchanging
    entity, a permanent soul, when there is a complex-compound of psycho physical aggregates
    is termed <i>sakkaya-ditthi.</i> Dhammasangani enumerates twenty kinds of such soul
    theories (see Dhammasangani Translation, pp. 257-259). <i>Sakkaya-ditthi</i> is usually
    rendered by self-illusion, theory of individuality, illusion of individualism. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">2. <b>Vicikiccha</b> - Doubts. They are
    doubts about 1. the Buddha, 2. the Dhamma, 3. the Sangha, 4. the disciplinary rules <i>(sikkha),
    </i>5. the past, 6. the future, 7. both the past and the future, and 8. Dependent Arising <i>(paticca-samuppada).</i>
    (see Dhammasangani Translation p. 239)</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">3. <b>Silabbataparamasa</b> - Adherence to
    (wrongful) rites and ceremonies. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Dhammasangani explains it thus: &quot;It is
    the theory held by ascetics an Brahmins outside this doctrine, that purification is
    obtained by rules of moral conduct, or by rites, or by both rules of moral conduct and
    rites&quot;. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">For the eradication of the remaining seven
    Fetters a Sotapanna is reborn seven times at most. He gains implicit confidence in the
    Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. He would not for any reason violate any of the five
    precepts. He is not subject to states of woe as he is destined for Enlightenment. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">With fresh courage as a result of this
    distant glimpse of Nibbana, the noble pilgrim makes rapid progress, and perfecting his
    Insight, becomes a Sakadagami - Once-Returner - reaching the second stage of Sainthood by
    attenuating two other Fetters, namely, sense-desires <i>(kamaraga)</i> and ill will <i>(patigha).</i>
    </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now he is called a Once-Returner because he
    is born in the human realm only once, should he not attain Arahatship in that birth
    itself. It is interesting to note that the Ariya Saint who has attained the second stage
    of Sainthood can only weaken these two powerful Fetters with which he is bound from a
    beginningless past. At times, though to a slight extent, he harbours thoughts of lust and
    anger. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is by attaining the third State of
    Sainthood, that of the Anagami (Never-Returner), that he completely eradicates these two
    Fetters. Thereafter he neither returns to this world nor is he born in the celestial
    realms, since he has rooted out the desire for sensual gratification. After death he is
    reborn in the Pure Abodes (Suddhavasa), an environment exclusively reserved for Anagamis
    and Arahats. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A layman may become an Anagami, provided he
    leads a celibate life. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Anagami Saint now makes his final advance
    and destroying the remaining five Fetters, namely, attachment to Realms of Form <i>(ruparaga)</i>
    attachment to Formless Realms <i>(aruparaga),</i> pride <i>(mana), </i>restlessness <i>(uddhacca),
    </i>and ignorance <i>(avijja), </i>attains Arahatship the final state of Sainthood. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Stream-Winners, Once-Returners,
    Never-Returners are called Sekhas because they have yet to undergo training. Arahats are
    called Asekhas because they no longer need any training. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">An Arahat, literally, a Worthy One, is not

        <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In this case, one attains successively to the
        great ecstasies like the first <i>jhana,</i> etc., and emerging therefrom contemplates on
        the conditioned things in each of those <i>jhanas.</i> Thus he proceeds up to 'the State
        of Nothingness'. Then, having attended to the preliminary duties such as resolving, etc.,
        he attains to the state of Neither-Perception nor Non-Perception'. Now after two ecstatic <i>javana</i>
        thought-moments his stream of consciousness is suspended. Thereafter he attains to
        (Supreme) 'Cessation'. </font></p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">At the time of rising, if to a
        Never-Returner, an Anagami Fruit consciousness or to an Arahat, an Arahat Fruit

    </b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">56. <b>Nirodhasamapatti</b> - Lit.,
    'attainment to cessation'. It is so called because during this period the stream of
    consciousness temporarily ceases to flow. Mind is suspended, but vitality persists. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is only an Anagami or an Arahat who has
    developed the <i>rupa</i> and <i>arupa</i> <i>jhanas</i> who can attain to this supreme
    state of ecstasy. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When such a person wishes to attain to <i>nirodhasamapatti,</i>
    he first attains to the first <i>jhana</i> and, emerging from it, he meditates on the
    transiency, sorrowfulness, and soullessness of conditioned states found in that particular
    <i>jhana.</i> Likewise, he attains, in order, to the remaining <i>jhanas</i> and meditates
    in the same way until the <i>arupaj jhana</i> of 'Nothingness'.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Emerging from this <i>jhana,</i> he makes the
    following four resolutions: </font></p>
    <dir>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">(i) that his fourfold requisites be not
      destroyed, </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) that he should arise in time when his
      services are needed by the Sangha, </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) that he should arise in time when he is
      summoned by the Buddha, </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">(iv) whether he will live for more than seven
      days from that moment. </font></p>
    </dir>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">He has to think of his age-limit as this
    ecstatic state normally extends to seven days. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">After making these resolutions, he attains to
    the last <i>arupaj jhana</i> of 'Neither Perception nor Non-Perception', and remains in
    that state for two <i>javana</i> thought moments. Immediately after, he attains to <i>nirodha-samapatti</i>
    when his stream of consciousness, is temporarily suspended. After seven days he emerges
    from this state and experiences for a single moment an Anagami Phala consciousness in the
    case of an Anagami, or an Arahat Phala consciousness in the case of an Arahat. Thereafter
    arises the <i>bhavanga citta. </font></p>
