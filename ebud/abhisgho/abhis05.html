    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. Bhumi. </b>derived from <i>bhu,</i> to be,
    lit., means a place where beings exist. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to Buddhism the earth, an almost
    insignificant speck in the universe, is not the only habitable world, and humans are not
    the only living beings, Infinite are world systems and so are living beings. Nor is
    &quot;the impregnated ovum the only route to rebirth&quot; &quot;By traversing one cannot
    reach the end of the world,&quot; says the Buddha.</font></p>
    <dir>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">* &quot;There are about 1,000,000 planetary
      systems in the Milky Way in which life exists.&quot; See Fred Hoyle, The Nature of the
      Universe, pp. 87-89.</font></p>
    </dir>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">2. <b>Apaya</b> = <i>apa + aya.</i> That
    which is devoid of happiness is apaya. It is viewed both as a mental state and as a place.
    </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">3. States where sense-pleasures abound. See
    Chapter I. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">4. and 5. See Chapter I. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">6. <b>Niraya</b> = <i>ni + aya;</i> devoid of
    happiness. According to Buddhism there are several woeful states where beings atone for
    their evil kamma. They are not eternal hells where beings are subject to endless
    suffering. Upon the exhaustion of the evil Kamma there is a possibility for beings born in
    such states to be reborn in good states as the result of their past good actions. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">7. <b>Tiracchana</b> = <i>tiro,</i> across; <i>acchana,</i>
    going. Animals are so called because as a rule quadrupeds walk horizontally. Buddhist
    belief is that beings are born as animals on account of evil Kamma. There is, however, the
    possibility for animals to be born as human beings. Strictly speaking, it should be said
    that an animal may manifest itself in the form of a human being, or <i>vice versa,</i>
    just as an electric current can be manifested in the forms of light, heat, and motion
    successively - one not necessarily being evolved from the other. An animal may be born in
    a blissful state as a result of the good Kamma accumulated in the past. There are at times
    certain animals, particularly dogs and cats, who live a more comfortable life than even
    human beings. It is also due to their past good Kamma. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is one's Kamma that determines the nature
    of one's material form, which varies according to the skill or unskilfulness of one's
    actions. And this again depends entirely on the evolution of one's understanding of
    reality. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">8. <b>Peta</b> = <i>pa + ita;</i> lit.,
    departed beings, or (those) absolutely devoid of happiness. They are not disembodied
    spirits or ghosts. Although they possess material forms, generally they are invisible to
    the physical eye. They have no plane of their own, but live in forests, dirty
    surroundings, etc. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">9. <b>Asura</b> - lit., those who do not
    sport or those who do not shine. These Asuras should be distinguished from another class
    of Asuras who are opposed to Devas, and who live in the Tavatimsa plane (see note 12). </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">10. <b>Manussa</b> - lit., those who have an
    uplifted or developed mind <i>(mano ussannam etesam). </i>Its Sanskrit equivalent is <i>Manushya,</i>
    which means the sons of <i>Manu.</i> They are so called because they became civilized
    after <i>Manu</i> the seer. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The human realm is a mixture of both pain and
    happiness. Bodhisattas prefer the human realm, as they get a better opportunity to serve
    the world and perfect the requisites for Buddha hood. Buddhas are always born as human
    beings. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">11. <b>Catummaharajika</b> - This is the
    lowest of the heavenly realms where the four Guardian Deities reside with their followers.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">12. <b>Tavatimsa</b> - lit., thirty-three.
    Sakka, the king of the gods, resides in this celestial plane. The origin of the name is
    attributed to a story which states that thirty-three selfless volunteers led by Magha,
    having performed charitable deeds, were born in this heavenly realm. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">13. <b>Yama </b>- derived from <i>yam,</i> to
    destroy. That which destroys pain is <i>yama.</font></p>
    </i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">14. <b>Tusita</b> - lit., happy-dwellers.
    Traditional belief is that the future Bodhisatta dwells at present in this celestial
    plane, awaiting the right opportunity to be born as a human being and become a Buddha. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">15. <b>Nimmanarati</b> - Those who delight in
    the created mansions. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">16. <b>Paranimmitavasavatti</b> - lit., those
    who bring under their sway things created by others. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These are the six Celestial planes - all
    temporary blissful abodes - where beings are supposed to live happily enjoying fleeting
    pleasures of sense. Superior to these Sensuous planes are the Brahma realms where beings
    delight in jhanic bliss, achieved by renouncing sense-desires. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">17. These are the three Brahma realms where
    beings who have developed the first jhana are born. The lowest of these three is Brahma
    Parisajja, which, literally, means &quot;Those who are born amongst the attendants of
    Maha-Brahmas.&quot; The second is Brahma Purohita which means Brahma's Ministers. The
    highest of the first three is Maha Brahma. It is so called because these beings exceed
    others in happiness, beauty and age-limit, owing to the intrinsic merit of their mental
    development. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Those who develop the first jhana to a normal
    extent are born in the first plane; those who have developed to a medium degree are born
    in the second; and those who have perfect control of the first jhana are born amongst the
    Maha Brahmas in the third plane. The three divisions of the other jhanic planes should be
    similarly understood. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">18. <b>Asasññasatta</b> - This is supposed
    to be a plane where beings are born without a consciousness. Here only a material flux
    exists, normally both mind and matter are inseparable. By the power of meditation it is
    possible, at times, to separate matter from mind as in this particular case. When Arahat
    attains the <i>Nirodha</i> <i>Samapatti,</i> his consciousness ceases to exist
    temporarily. Such a state is almost inconceivable to us. But there may be many
    inconceivable things which are actual facts. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">19. Suddhavasa - Only Anagamis and Arahats
    are found in these planes. Those who attain Anagami in other planes are born in these Pure
    Abodes. Later, they attain Arahatship and live in those planes till their life-term is
    over. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">20. See Chapter I. All these four are
    immaterial planes. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It should be remarked that the Buddha did not
    attempt to expound any cosmological theory. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The essence of the Buddha's teaching is not
    affected by the existence or non-existence of these planes. No one is bound to believe
    anything if it does not appeal to his reason. Nor is it right to reject anything just
    because it cannot be conceived by one's limited knowledge. </font></p>

    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Notes: </font></p>
    </b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">29. <b>Kamma,</b> Sanskrit Karma, lit.
    means action, of doing. Strictly speaking, Kamma means all moral and immoral volition
    (cetana). It covers all that is included in the phrase - &quot;thought, word and
    deed&quot;. It is the law of moral causation. In other words, it is action and reaction in
    the ethical realm, or &quot;action influence&quot; as Westerners say. It is not fate or
    predestination. It is one's own doing reacting on oneself. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Every volitional action, except that of a
    Buddha or of an Arahat, is called Kamma. The Buddhas and Arahats do not accumulate fresh
    Kamma as they have eradicated ignorance and craving, the roots of Kamma. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Kamma is action, and Vipaka, fruit or result,
    is its reaction. It is the cause and the effect. Like a seed is Kamma. Vipaka (effect) is
    like the fruit arising from the tree. As we sow, we reap somewhere and sometime in this
    life or in a future birth. What we reap today is what we have sown either in the present
    or in the past. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Kamma is a law in itself, and it operates in
    its own field without the intervention of an external independent ruling agency. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Inherent in Kamma is the potentiality of
    producing its due effect. The cause produces the effect; the effect explains the cause.
    The seed produces the fruit; the fruit explains the seed; such is their relationship. Even
    so are Kamma and its effect: &quot;the effect already blooms in the cause&quot;. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to Abhidhamma, Kamma constitutes
    the twelve types of immoral consciousness, eight types of moral consciousness pertaining
    to the Sense-sphere <i>(kamavacara),</i> five types of moral consciousness pertaining to
    the Realms of Forms <i>(rupavacara), </i>and four types of moral consciousness pertaining
    to the Formless Realms <i>(arupavacara). </font></p>
    </i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The eight types of supramundane
    consciousness <i>(lokuttara citta)</i> are not regarded as Kamma and <i>vipaka,</i>
    because they tend to eradicate the roots of Kamma that condition rebirth. In the
    supramundane consciousness wisdom <i>(pañña)</i> is predominant, while in the ordinary
    types of consciousness volition <i>(cetana)</i> is predominant. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These twenty-nine types of consciousness are
    called Kamma because the reproductive power is inherent in them. Just as every object is
    accompanied by a shadow, even so every volitional activity is accompanied by its due
    effect. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These types of consciousness that are
    experienced as inevitable consequences of good and bad thoughts, are called resultant
    consciousness <i>(vipaka).</i> The 23 types (7+8+8) of resultant consciousness pertaining
    to the Sense-sphere, the five types of resultant consciousness pertaining to the Realms of
    Form, and the four types of resultant consciousness pertaining to the Formless Realms, are
    called <i>vipaka</i> or fruition of Kamma. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">See The Life of the Buddha and his Teachings,
    pp. 333-391, and Manual of Buddhism, pp. 19-88. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">30. Every birth is conditioned by a past good
    or bad Kamma which predominates at the moment of death. The Kamma that conditions the
    future birth is called Reproductive (Janaka) Kamma. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The death of a person is merely &quot;the
    temporary end of a temporary phenomenon&quot;. Though the present form perishes, another
    form which is neither the same nor absolutely different, takes its place according to the
    potential thought-vibrations generated at the death moment, as the Kammic force which
    propels the life-flux still survives. It is this last thought, which is technically called
    Reproductive Kamma, that determines the state of a person in his subsequent birth. This
    may be either a good or bad Kamma. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to the commentary, Janaka Kamma is
    that which produces mental aggregates and material aggregates at the moment of conception.
    The initial consciousness, which is termed the <i>patisandhi viññana</i>
    (rebirth-consciousness), is conditioned by this Janaka Kamma. Simultaneous with the
    arising of the rebirth-consciousness there arise the body-decad, sex-decad, and base-decad
    <i>(kaya-bhava-vatthu dasaka). </font></p>
    </i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The body-decad is composed of the four
    elements - namely, the element of extension <i>(pathavi),</i> the element of cohesion <i>(apo),
    </i>the element of heat <i>(tejo),</i> the element of motion <i>(vayo);</i> their four
    derivatives <i>(upadarupa) </i>- namely, colour <i>(vanna),</i> odour <i>(gandha),</i>
    taste <i>(rasa),</i> nutritive essence <i>(oja);</i> vitality <i>(jivitindriya),</i> and
    body <i>(kaya). </i>The sex-decad and the base-decad also consist of the first nine plus
    sex <i>(bhava)</i> and seat of consciousness <i>(vatthu) </i>respectively.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">From this it is evident that the sex is
    determined at the very conception of a being. I t is conditioned by Kamma and is not a
    fortuitous combination of sperm and ovum cells. Pain and happiness, which one experiences
    in the course of one's lifetime, are the inevitable consequences of Janaka Kamma. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">31. <b>Upatthambhaka</b> - that which comes
    near the Reproductive Kamma and supports it. It is either good or bad, and it assists or
    maintains the action of the Reproductive Kamma in the course of one's lifetime.
    Immediately after the conception till the death moment, this Kamma steps forward to
    support the Reproductive Kamma. A moral Supportive Kamma assists in giving health, wealth,
    happiness, etc., to the person concerned. An immoral Supportive Kamma, on the other hand,
    assists in giving pain, sorrow, etc., to the person born with an immoral Reproductive
    Kamma as, for instance, to a beast of burden. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">32. <b>Upapidaka</b> - Obstructive or
    Counteractive Kamma which, unlike the previous one, tends to weaken, interrupt and retard
    the fruition of the Reproductive Kamma. For instance, a person born with a good
    Reproductive Kamma maybe subject to various ailments, etc., thus preventing him from
    enjoying the blissful results of his good action. An animal, on the other hand, who is
    born with a bad Reproductive Kamma, may lead a comfortable life by getting good food,
    lodging, etc., as a result of his good Counteractive Kamma preventing the fruition of the
    evil Reproductive Kamma. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">33. <b>Upaghataka</b> - According to the Law
    of Kamma the potential energy of the Reproductive Kamma could be nullified by a more
    powerful opposing Kamma of the past, which, seeking an opportunity, may quite unexpectedly
    operate, just as a counteractive powerful force can obstruct the path of a flying arrow
    and bring it down to the ground. Such an action is called Destructive Kamma, which is more
    effective than the previous two in that it not only obstructs but also destroys the whole
    force. This Destructive Kamma also may be either good or bad. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As an instance of the operation of all four,
    the case of Devadatta, who attempted to kill the Buddha and who caused a schism in the
    Sangha, may be cited. His good Reproductive Kamma conditioned him a birth in a royal
    family. His continued comforts and prosperity were due to the action of the Supportive
    Kamma. The counteractive Kamma came into operation when he was subject to much humiliation
    as a result of his being excommunicated from the Sangha. Finally the Destructive Kamma
    brought his life to a miserable end. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">34. <b>Garuka</b> - which means either
    weighty or serious, may be either good or bad. It produces its results in this life, or in
    the next for certain. If good, it is purely mental as in the case of the <i>jhanas.</i>
    Otherwise it is verbal or bodily. The five kinds of immoral Weighty Kamma according to
    their gravity are: - (i) the creation of a schism in the Sangha, (ii) the wounding of a
    Buddha, (iii) the murder of an Arahat, (iv) matricide, and (v) parricide. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These are also known as Anantariya Kamma
    because they definitely produce their effects in the subsequent life. Permanent Skepticism
    <i>(niyata micchaditthi)</i> is also termed one of the Weighty Kammas. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If, for instance, any person were to develop
    the <i>jhanas</i> and later were to commit one of these heinous crimes, his good Kamma
    would be obliterated by the powerful evil Kamma. His subsequent birth would be conditioned
    by the evil Kamma in spite of his having gained the <i>jhanas</i> earlier. Devadatta lost
    his psychic powers and was born in an evil state, because he wounded the Buddha and caused
    a schism in the Sangha. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">King Ajatasattu would have attained the first
    stage of sainthood if he had not committed parricide. In this case the powerful evil Kamma
    acted as an obstacle to his gaining sainthood. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">35. <b>Asanna,</b> or Death-proximate Kamma,
    is that which one does or remembers immediately before the dying moment. Owing to its
    significance in determining the future birth, the custom of reminding the dying person of
    his good deeds and making him do good acts on his death-bed still prevails in Buddhist
    countries. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes a bad person may die happily and
    receive a good birth if fortunately he remembers or does a good act at the last moment. A
    story runs that a certain executioner, who casually happened to give some alms to the
    Venerable Sariputta, remembered this good act at the dying moment and was born in a state
    of bliss. This does not mean that although he enjoys a good birth he will be exempt from
    the effects of the evil deeds accumulated during his lifetime. They will have their due
    effects as occasions arise. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">At times a good person may die unhappily by
    suddenly remembering an evil act of his or by harbouring some unpleasant thought,
    perchance compelled by unfavourable circumstances. Queen Mallika, the consort of King
    Pasenadi, led a righteous life, but as a result of remembering, at her death moment, a lie
    which she had uttered, she had to suffer for about seven days in a state of misery. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These are only exceptional cases. Such
    reverse changes of birth account for the birth of virtuous children to vicious parents and
    of vicious children to virtuous parents. As a rule the last thought-process is conditioned
    by the general conduct of a person. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">36. <b>Acinna Knnamma</b> is that which one
    habitually performs and recollects and for which one has a great liking. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Habits, whether good or bad, become second
    nature. They tend to form the character of a person. At leisure moments we often engage
    ourselves in our habitual thoughts and deeds. In the same way at the death-moment, unless
    influenced by other circumstances, we, as a rule, recall to mind such thoughts and deeds. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Cunda, a butcher, who was living in the
    vicinity of the Buddha's Monastery, died squealing like a pig because he was earning his
    living by slaughtering pigs. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">King Dutthagamani of Ceylon was in the habit
    of giving alms to the Bhikkhus before he took his meals. It was this habitual Kamma that
    gladdened him at the dying moment and gave him birth in the Tusita Realm.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">37. <b>Katatta</b> - Reserve or Cumulative
    Kamma. Literally, it means &quot;because done&quot;. All actions that are done once and
    soon forgotten belong to this category. This is as it were the reserve fund of a
    particular being. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">38. <b>Ditthadhammavedanaya Kamma</b> is that
    which is experienced in this particular life. <i>Ditthadhamma</i> means this present life.
    </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to Abhidhamma one does both good
    and evil during the <i>javana</i> process which usually lasts for seven thought-moments.
    The effect of the first thought-moment, being the weakest, one may reap in this life
    itself. This is called the Immediately Effective Kamma. If it does not operate in this
    life, it is called Defunct or Ineffective <i>(ahosi).</i> The next weakest is the seventh
    thought-moment. Its evil effect one may reap in the subsequent birth. This is called <i>Upapajjavedaniya
    Kamma.</i> This, too, becomes ineffective if it does not operate in the second birth. The
    effects of the intermediate thought-moments may take place at any time until one attains
    Nibbana. This type of Kamma is known as Aparapariyavedaniya - Indefinitely Effective. No
    one, not even the Buddhas and Arahats, is exempt from this class of Kamma, which one may
    experience in the course of one's wanderings in Samsara. There is no special class of
    Kamma known as <i>ahosi,</i> but when such actions that should produce their effects in
    the present life or in a subsequent life do not operate, they are termed Ineffective. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">39. <b>Bahullavuttito</b> - This term is used
    because these actions may be done through the other doors as well. </font></p>

    intention through bodily movements. </font></p>

    immoral consciousness are the seven types of rootless resultant consciousness. They may

    are the eight types of Rootless resultant consciousness and the eight types of Beautiful
    resultant consciousness. The effects of the eight types of moral consciousness may not
    only serve as rebirth consciousness but also give rise to different types of resultant
    consciousness in the course of one's lifetime. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">46. <b>Ukkattha</b> - lit., up <i>(u)</i>
    drawn <i>(kas). </i>A highest class of moral Kamma is that which is attended with good
    causes before and after the commission of the act. For instance, alms given to the most
    virtuous with righteously obtained wealth, with no later repentance, is considered a
    'highest' moral Kamma.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">47. <b>Omaka</b> - Inferior. While giving
    alms one may experience a moral consciousness with the three good roots. But, if he were
    to give to the vicious with unrighteously obtained wealth, and with later repentance, it
    is regarded as an inferior Kamma. </font></p>

        <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now, to those who are about to die, at the
        moment of death, by the power of Kamma, one of the following presents itself through any
        of the six doors: </font></p>
        <dir>
          <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">i. a Kamma that produces rebirth in the
          subsequent birth enters (the mind-door) according to circumstances (56); </font></p>
          <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">ii. an object (51) such as a pre-perceived
          form and the like, or anything that was instrumental in the performance of the Kamma. </font></p>
          <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">iii. a symbolic destiny sign (58) that should
          be got and experienced in the subsequent birth-place. </font></p>
        </dir>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Thereafter attending to that object thus
        presented (59), the stream of consciousness, in accordance with the Kamma that is to be
        matured, whether pure or corrupted, and in conformity with the place where one is to be
        born, continually flows, inclining mostly towards that state. Or that birth-reproductive
        Kamma presents itself to a sense-door in the way of renewing. </font></p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">§ 12. To one who is nearing death, either at
        the end of a thought-process or at the dissolution of bhavanga, the decease-consciousness,
        the consummation of the present life, arises and ceases in the way of death. </font></p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Immediately after that (death-consciousness)
        has ceased, a rebirth consciousness arises and is established in the subsequent existence,
        based on the object thus obtained, either with or without the heart-base (60) as is
        appropriate, generated by Kamma <i>(sankhara)</i> that is enveloped by latent ignorance
        and rooted in latent craving. That rebirth (or relinking) consciousness, so called because
        it links together the two consecutive existences, is conjoined with its mental
        co-adjuncts, and acts as the fore-runner to the conascent states as their locus (or
        foundation - <i>adhitthanabhavena). </font></p>
        </i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">§ 13. Herein in the dying
        thought-process only five feeble moments (normally seven thought-moments), of <i>javana</i>
        should be expected. </font></p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore when death occurs while the present
        object is being presented to the avenues (i.e., <i>kamma nimitta</i> to one of the five
        sense-doors or <i>gati nimitta</i> to the mind-door) then the rebirth-consciousness and
        the <i>bhavanga</i>-consciousness take a present object. </font></p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Thus in rebirth in a Sense-Sphere the <i>kamma
        nimitta</i> taken by (any of) the six doors, or the <i>gati nimitta,</i> may be past or
        present. </font></p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">But Kamma is perceived by the mind-door only
        as a past object. </font></p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">All these should be regarded as lesser
        objects (i.e., belonging to the <i>kama</i>-sphere). </font></p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In rebirth in the Realms of Forms the Kamma
        symbol which is a concept (such as earth device, etc.) becomes the object. </font></p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So, too, in rebirth in Formless Realms, only
        a Kamma symbol which is a sublimated concept (such as a visualized space) becomes an
        object, according to circumstances. </font></p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To the mindless beings only the vital nonad*
        establishes itself in the way of rebirth. Hence they are called materially reborn. Those
        born in Formless Realms are called mentally reborn. The rest are called materially and
        mentally reborn. </font></p>

        <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">§ 14. After one passes away from a Formless

    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Notes: </font></p>
    </b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">51. &quot;Death is the temporary end of a
    temporary phenomenon.&quot; By death is meant the extinction of psychic life <i>(jivitindriya),</i>
    heat <i>(usma = tejodhatu),</i> and consciousness <i>(viññana),</i> of one individual in
    a particular existence. Death is not the complete annihilation of a being. Death in one
    place means birth in another place, just as, in conventional terms, the rising of the sun
    in one place means the setting of the sun in another place. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">52. What are commonly understood to be
    natural deaths due to old age may be classed under this category. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To each of the various planes of existence is
    naturally assigned a definite age-limit, irrespective of the potential energy of the
    Reproductive Kamma that has yet to run. One must, however, succumb to death when the
    maximum age-limit is reached. It may also be said that if the Reproductive Kamma is
    extremely powerful, the Karmic energy rematerializes itself on the same plane, or on some
    higher plane as in the case of the devas. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">53. As a rule the thought, volition, or
    desire, which was extremely strong during lifetime becomes predominant at the moment of
    death, and conditions the subsequent birth. In this last thought-moment is present a
    special potentiality. When the potential energy of this Reproductive Kamma is exhausted,
    the organic activities of the material form, in which is corporealized the life-force,
    cease even before the approach of old age. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">54. If a person is born at a time when the
    age-limit is 80 years, and he dies at 80 owing to the exhaustion of the potential force of
    his Reproductive Kamma, his death is due to the simultaneous expiration of both age and
    Kamma. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">55. There are powerful actions which suddenly
    cut off the force of the Reproductive Kamma, even before the expiration of the life-term.
    A more powerful opposing force, for instance, can check the path of a flying arrow and
    bring it down to the ground. Similarly, a very powerful Kammic force of the past is
    capable of nullifying the potential energy of the dying reproductive <i>(janaka)</i>
    thought-moment, and thus destroy the life of a being. The death of Devadatta was due to an
    <i>upacchedaka</i> <i>kamma</i> which he committed during his lifetime. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The first three types of death are
    collectively called <i>kalamarana</i> (timely death), and the last one is known as
    akalamarana (untimely death). </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">An oil lamp, for instance, may be
    extinguished owing to any of the following four causes, namely, the exhaustion of the
    wick, the exhaustion of oil, simultaneous exhaustion of both wick and oil, and some
    extraneous cause like the gust of a wind. Death of a person may similarly be caused by any
    of the aforesaid four ways.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">56. As a person is about to die, a good or
    bad action may present itself before his mind's eye. It may be either a meritorious or a
    demeritorious Weighty action <i>(garuka kamma), </i>such as <i>jhanas</i> (ecstasies), or
    parricide etc. They are so powerful that they totally eclipse all other actions, and
    appear very vividly before the mental eye. If there is no Weighty action, he may take for
    his object of the dying thought a Kamma done or remembered immediately before death <i>(asanna
    kamma). </font></p>
    </i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If it is a past action, strictly
    speaking, it is the good or bad thought experienced at the moment of performing the
    action, that recurs at the death-moment. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">57. <b>Kamma nimitta</b> is any sight, sound,
    smell, taste, touch or idea which was obtained at the time of the commission of the Kamma,
    such as knives in the case of a butcher, patients in the case of a physician, flowers in
    the case of a devotee, etc. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">58. By <b>gati nimitta</b> is meant some sign
    of the place where he is to take birth, an event which invariably happens to dying
    persons. When these indications of the future birth occur, and if they are bad, they can
    be turned into good. This is done by influencing the thoughts of the dying person, so that
    his good thoughts may now act as the Proximate Kamma and counteract the influence of the
    Reproductive Kamma which would otherwise affect his subsequent birth. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These symbols of one's destiny may be hellish
    fires, forests, mountainous regions, mother's womb, celestial mansions, etc. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Kamma is presented to the mind-door. <i>Kamma
    nimitta</i> may be presented to any of the six doors according to circumstances. <i>Gati
    nimitta,</i> being always a physical sight, is presented to the mind-door as a dream. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">59. Taking one of the aforesaid objects, a
    thought-process runs its course even if the death be an instantaneous one. It is said that
    even the fly which is crushed by a hammer on the anvil also experiences such a
    thought-process before it actually dies. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Let us imagine for the sake of convenience
    that the dying person is to be reborn in the human plane and that his object is some good
    Kamma. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">His <i>bhavanga</i> consciousness,
    interrupted, vibrates for one thought-moment and passes away. Thereafter the mind-door
    apprehending consciousness <i>(manodvaravajjana)</i> arises and passes away. Then comes
    the psychologically important stage - the <i>javana</i> process - which here runs only for
    five thought-moments by reason of its weakness, instead of the normal seven. As such it
    lacks all reproductive power; its main function being the mere regulation of the new
    existence - <i>abhinavakarana.</i> The object in the present case being desirable, the
    consciousness he experiences is a moral one - automatic or prompted, accompanied by
    pleasure, and associated with wisdom or as the case may be. The <i>tadalambana</i>
    consciousness which has for its function a registering or identifying for two moments of
    the object so perceived, may or may not follow. After this occurs death consciousness <i>(cuti
    citta), </i>the last thought-moment to be experienced in this present life. (See Diagram
    XI). </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There is a misconception amongst some that
    the subsequent birth is conditioned by this last decease-thought. What actually conditions
    rebirth is not this decease-thought, which in itself has no special function to perform,
    but that which is experienced during the <i>javana</i> process. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">With the ceasing of the decease-consciousness
    death actually occurs. Then no material qualities born of mind and food <i>(cittaja</i>
    and <i>aharaja rupa)</i> are produced. Only series of material qualities born of heat <i>(utuja)</i>
    goes on till the corpse is reduced to dust. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now, immediately after the dissolution of the
    decease consciousness <i>(cuti citta)</i> there arises in a fresh existence the relinking
    consciousness <i>(patisandhi viññana).</i> This is followed by sixteen <i>bhavanga</i>
    thought-moments. Thereafter the mind-door apprehending consciousness <i>(manodvaravajjana)</i>
    arises, to be followed by seven <i>javana</i> thought-moments, developing a liking to the
    fresh existence <i>(bhavanikanti javana). </i>Then the <i>bhavanga</i> consciousness
    arises and perishes, and the stream of consciousness flows on ceaselessly (see Diagram
    XII). </font></p>

        thought-process, uninterruptedly like a stream (62), until the arising of the
        decease-consciousness (63). Being an essential factor of life, this consciousness is known
        as <i>bhavanga.</i> At the end, in the way of dying, it arises as decease-consciousness
        (64) and perishes. Thereafter the relinking-consciousness and others, revolving according
