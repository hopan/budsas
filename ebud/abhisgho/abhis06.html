    </b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>[The first Edition comprised 2
    Volumes. The first Volume contained Chapter I to V and the second Volume, Chapter VI to
    IX.]</i></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The first five chapters of the Abhidhammattha
    Sangaha deal with the 89 and 121 types of consciousness, 52 mental states, various
    thought-processes in the course of one's lifetime and at rebirth, 31 planes of existence,
    and classification of Kamma. In one sense they form one complete book. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The remaining four chapters are devoted to <i>rupa</i>
    (matter), Nibbana, <i>paticca-samuppada</i> (the Law of Dependent Arising), <i>patthana
    naya</i> (Causal Relations), Categories of Good and Evil, Mental Culture, Path of Purity,
    and Great Attainments. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The sixth chapter is confined mainly to <i>rupa</i>
    and Nibbana.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Twenty-eight species of Rupa are enumerated.
    What they are, how they arise, persist, and perish, are also explained. <i>Rupa</i> is the
    third <i>paramattha</i> mentioned in the Abhidhamma, and is one of the two composite
    factors of this so-called being - the other being <i>nama</i> (mind). As <i>nama,</i> so <i>rupa</i>
    too has been microscopically analysed. But no logical definition of <i>rupa</i> is found
    either in the Text or in the Commentaries. </font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Rupa</i> is derived from <i>rup, </i>to
    break up, to perish<i> (nasa). </font></p>
    </i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to the Vibhavini Tika, <i>rupa</i>
    is that which transforms or assumes a different mode owing to the adverse physical
    conditions of cold heat, etc. <i>(sitonhadi virodhippaccayehi vikaram apajjati). </font></p>
    </i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">From a Buddhist standpoint <i>rupa</i>
    not only changes but also perishes <i>(khaya, vaya).</i> It endures only for seventeen
    thought-moments. <i>Rupa</i> changes so rapidly that one cannot strike an identical place
    twice. </font></p>
    <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Rupa</i> is also explained as that which
    manifests itself <i>(rup - pakasane).</i> </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Scholars suggest various renderings for <i>rupa.</i>
    It is generally rendered by 'form', 'body', 'matter', 'corporeality', etc. meanings differ
    according to the context. One particular meaning is not universally applicable. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">From a philosophical standpoint, 'matter' is
    the nearest equivalent for <i>rupa,</i> although scientists too find it difficult to
    define matter. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It should be noted that the atomic theory
    prevailed in India in the time of the Buddha. <i>Paramanu</i> was the ancient term for the
    modern atom. According to the ancient belief one <i>ratharenu</i> consists of 36 <i>tajjaris;</i>
    one <i>tajjari,</i> 36 <i>anus;</i> one <i>anu,</i> 36 <i>paramanus.</i> The minute
    particles of dust seen dancing in the sunbeam are called <i>ratharenus.</i> One <i>paramanu</i>
    is therefore, 1/46, 656th part of a <i>ratharenu.</i> This <i>paramanu</i> was considered
    indivisible. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">With His supernormal knowledge the Buddha
    analysed this so-called <i>paramanu</i> and declared that it consists of <i>paramatthas</i>
    - ultimate entities which cannot further be subdivided. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The <i>paramatthas</i> are <i>pathavi, apo,
    tejo,</i> and <i>vayo.</i> One must not understand that these elements are earth, water,
    fire and air, as some Greek thinkers believed in the past. </font></p>
    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Pathavi</b> means the element of
    extension, the substratum of matter. Without it objects cannot occupy space. The qualities
    of hardness and softness which are purely relative are two conditions of this particular
    element. It may be stated that this element is present in earth, water, fire and air. For
    instance, the water above is supported by water below. It is this element of extension in
    conjunction with the element of motion, that produces the upward pressure. Heat or cold is
    the <i>tejo</i> element, while fluidity is the <i>apo</i> element </font></p>
    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Apo</b> is the element of cohesion. Unlike
    pathavi it is intangible. It is this element that makes scattered particles of matter
    cohere, and gives rise to the idea of 'body'. When solid bodies are melted, this element
    becomes more prominent in the resulting fluid. This element is found even in minute
    particles when solid bodies are reduced to powder. The elements of extension and cohesion
    are so closely interrelated that when cohesion ceases extension disappears. </font></p>
    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Tejo</b> is the element of heat. Cold is
    also a form of <i>tejo.</i> Both heat and cold are included in <i>tejo</i> because they
    possess the power of maturing bodies, Tejo, in other words, is the vitalizing energy.
    Preservation and decay are also due to this element. Unlike the other three essentials of
    matter, this element has the power to regenerate matter by itself. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Inseparably connected with heat is <b>vayo,</b>
    the element of motion. Movements are caused by this element. Motion is regarded as the
    force or the generator of heat. &quot;Motion and heat in the material realm correspond
    respectively to consciousness and Kamma in the mental.&quot; </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These four elements coexist and are
    inseparable, but one may preponderate over another as, for instance, <i>pathavi</i> in
    earth, <i>apo</i> in water, <i>tejo</i> in fire, and <i>vayo</i> in air. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">They are also called Mahabhutas, or Great
    Essentials because they are invariably found in all material substances ranging from the
    infinitesimally small cell to the most massive object. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Dependent on them are the four subsidiary
    material qualities of colour <i>(vanna),</i> smell <i>(gandha),</i> taste <i>(rasa),</i>
    and nutritive essence <i>(oja).</i> These eight coexisting forces and qualities constitute
    one material group called <i>'suddhatthaka rupa kalapa</i> - pure-octad material group'. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The remaining twenty kinds of <i>rupa</i> are
    equally important. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It should be noted that physical
    life-principle <i>(rupa jivitindriya)</i> and sex are also conditioned by Kamma. Life in
    inorganic matter should be differentiated from life in animate beings. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The fact that <i>rupas</i> arise in four ways
    such as Kamma, mind, seasonal phenomena, and food, will be a novel idea to modern
    thinkers. All these four sources can, to a great extent, be brought under one's control. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To some extent we are responsible for the
    creation of our own material phenomena, desirable or undesirable. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The accumulated Karmic tendencies created by
    persons in the course of their previous lives, play at times a greater role than the
    hereditary parental cells and genes, in the formation of physical characteristics.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha, for instance, inherited like
    every other person, the reproductive cells and genes from His parents. But physically
    there was none comparable to Him in His long line of honorable ancestors. In the Buddha's
    own words, He belonged not to the royal lineage, but to that of the Aryan Buddhas. He was
    certainly a superman, an extraordinary creation of His own Kamma.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to the Lakkhana Sutta (D. 30) the
    Buddha inherited these exceptional features, such as the 32 major marks, as the result of
    his past meritorious deeds. The ethical reason for acquiring each physical feature is
    clearly explained in the Sutta. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the sixth chapter only a few lines are
    devoted to the fourth <i>paramattha</i> - Nibbana - the <i>summum bonum</i> of Buddhism.
    But the path to Nibbana is described in detail in the ninth chapter. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The seventh chapter enumerates all ethical
    states and classifies them into various groups. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The two most profound philosophical teachings
    of Buddhism - namely, the Law of Dependent Arising <i>(paticca-samuppada)</i> and the
    twenty-four Causal Relations<i> (Patthana) </i>are described in the eighth chapter. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The last chapter is the most important and
    the most interesting, as it deals with Mental Culture <i>(bhavana)</i> and Emancipation,
    the quintessence of Buddhism. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To understand the intricacies of Abhidhamma
    one should critically read and reread the Abhidhammattha Sangaha patiently and carefully,
    pondering at the same time on the profound teachings embodied therein. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One who understands the Abhidhamma well can
    fully comprehend the Word of the Buddha and thereby realize one's ultimate goal. </font></p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">6. <b>Kalapa</b> - the group compositions of
    rupa, such as body-decad, sex-decad. etc. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">7. <b>Pavattikkama</b> - i.e., how <i>rupas</i>
    take place in accordance with the states of existence, time, and classes of beings. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">8. <b>Mahabhutani</b> - lit ., those that
    have grown great. The four Great Essentials are the fundamental material elements which
    are inseparable. Every material substance, ranging from the minutest particle to the most
    massive object, consists of these four elements which possess specific characteristics. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">9. <b>Upadaya-rupani</b> - Derivative or
    secondary material properties dependent on the Great Essentials. Like the earth are the
    Essentials; the Derivatives are like trees that spring therefrom. The remaining 24 <i>rupas</i>
    are regarded as Derivatives. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">10. <b>Pathavi-dhatu</b> - The Pali term <i>dhatu</i>
    means that which bears its own characteristic marks. Element is the closest equivalent for
    <i>dhatu. Pathavi dhatu,</i> literally, means the earth-element. It is so called because
    like the earth it serves as a support or foundation for the other coexisting <i>rupas.</i>
    <i>Pathavi</i> (Sanskrit: <i>prthivi),</i> also spelt <i>pathavi, puthavi, puthuvi,
    puthuvi</i> - is derived from <i>puth, </i>to expand, to extend. So far, though not very
    satisfactory, the closest equivalent for <i>pathavi-dhatu</i> is 'the element of
    extension'. Without it objects cannot occupy space. Both hardness and softness are
    characteristics of this element. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">11. <b>Apo-dhatu</b> - lit., the fluid
    element . Apo is derived from <i>ap,</i> to arrive, or from <i>a + pay, </i>to grow, to
    increase. It is 'the element of cohesion . According to Buddhism it is this element that
    makes different particles of matter cohere, and thus prevents them from being scattered
    about. Both fluidity and contraction are the properties of this element. It should be
    understood that cold is not a characteristic of this element. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">12. <b>Tejo-dhatu</b> - lit., the
    fire-element, is explained as 'the element of heat'. <i>Tejo</i> is derived from<i> tij,</i>
    to sharpen, to mature. Vivacity and maturity are due to the presence of this element. Both
    heat and cold are the properties of <i>tejo.</i> Intense <i>tejo</i> is heat, and mild <i>tejo</i>
    is cold. It should not be understood that cold is the characteristic of <i>apo</i> and
    heat is that of <i>tejo;</i> for, in that case, both heat and cold should be found
    together, as <i>apo</i> and <i>tejo</i> coexist. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">13. <b>Vayo-dhatu</b> - lit., 'the
    air-element', is explained as the element of motion. <i>Vayo</i> is derived from <i>vay,</i>
    to move, to vibrate. Motion, vibration, oscillation, and pressure are caused by this
    element. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">14. <b>Pasada-rupa</b> - They are the
    sensitive parts of the five organs - eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body. They tend to
    clarify the coexisting material qualities. The perceptible physical eye, for instance, is
    the <i>sasambhara cakkhu</i> or composite eye, which consists of the four <i>bhuta-rupas,</i>
    four <i>upada-rupas</i> (colour, odour, taste, and sap), and <i>jivitindriya</i>
    (vitality). The sensitive part which lies at the center of the retina and which enables
    one to see objects is, the <i>cakkhu pasada.</i> This is the basis of the
    eye-consciousness <i>(cakkhu-viññana)</i> and becomes the instrument for the eye-door
    thought-process <i>(cakkhu-dvaravithi).</i> The desire to see tends to develop the sense
    of sight. The eye, therefore, consists of ten material qualities of which <i>pasada</i> is
    one.</font></p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is clear that the Buddha did not
    definitely assign a specific seat for consciousness, as He has done with the other senses.
    It was the cardiac theory (the view that heart is the seat of consciousness) that
    prevailed in His time, and this was evidently supported by the Upanishads. The Buddha
    could have accepted this popular theory, but He did not commit Himself. In the Patthana,
    the Book of Relations, the Buddha refers to the basis of consciousness in such indirect
    terms as <i>&quot;yam rupam nissaya''</i> &quot;depending on that material thing&quot;,
    without positively asserting whether that <i>rupa</i> was either the heart <i>(hadaya)</i>
    or the brain. But, according to the views of commentators like Venerable Buddhaghosa and
    Anuruddha, the seat of consciousness is definitely the heart. It should be understood that
    the Buddha has neither accepted nor rejected this ancient popular cardiac theory. See
    Compendium p. 156, n. 1, and p. 277. </font></p>

    characteristics of this so-called being. Psychic life is one of the seven universals and
    physical life is associated with almost every material group except in dead matter.
    Simultaneous with the arising of the rebirth-consciousness, physical life also springs up

    derive <i>akasa</i> from <i>a + kas,</i> to plough. Since there is no ploughing as on
    earth, space is called <i>akasa</i>. According to Sanskrit, <i>akasa</i> is derived from <i>a
    + kas, </i>to view, to recognize. In Ledi Sayadaw's opinion it is derived from <i>a + kas,
    </i>to shine, to appear. <i>Akasa</i> is space which in itself is nothingness. As such it
    is eternal. <i>Akasa</i> is a dhatu in the sense of a non-entity <i>(nijjiva),</i> not as
    an existing element like the four Essentials. By <i>akasa,</i> as one of the 28 <i>rupas,</i>
    is meant not so much the outside space as the intra-atomic space that 'limits' or
    separates material groups <i>(rupakalapas).</i> Hence in Abhidhamma it is regarded as a <i>'pariccheda-rupa'.</i>
    Although <i>akasa</i> is not an objective reality, as it is invariably associated with all
    material units that arise in four ways, Abhidhamma teaches that it, too, is produced by
    the same four causes such as Kamma, mind, seasonal changes. and food. Simultaneous with
    the arising and perishing of the conditioned <i>rupas, akasa rupa</i> also arises and
    perishes. See Compendium p. 226. </font></p>

    is done both by action and speech - <i>kaya-viññatti</i> and <i>vaci-viññatti.</i> The
    former is caused by the 'air-element' <i>(vayo-dhatu) </i>produced by mind <i>(cittaja);</i>
    the latter by the 'earth-element produced by the mind. The duration of <i>viññatti</i>

    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Upacaya</b> means the first heaping-up or

    conception, is regarded as <i>upacaya.</i> The subsequent arising of the three decads from
    the static stage of rebirth-consciousness throughout lifetime is regarded as <i>santati.</i>
    Both <i>upacaya</i> and <i>santati</i> are sometimes treated as <i>jati</i> - birth. Then
    the number of <i>rupas</i> amounts to 27 instead of 28. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The life term of conditioned <i>rupa</i> is

    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Notes: </font></p>
    </b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">52. <b>Rhupasamutthana</b> - Buddhism
    does not attempt to solve the problem of the ultimate origin of matter. It takes for
    granted that matter exists and states that <i>rupa</i> develops in four ways. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">53. <b>Kammaja</b> - Strictly speaking, by
    Kamma are meant past moral and immoral types of consciousness. It is only those classes of
    consciousness pertaining to the <i>kama</i> and <i>rupa</i>-spheres that tend to produce <i>rupa.</i>
    They are 12 types of immoral consciousness, 8 types of moral consciousness, and the 5
    moral <i>rupa jhanas.</i> A moral or immoral birth-reproductive Kamma generated at the
    dying moment of a person, conditions the rebirth-consciousness <i>(patisandhi-citta)</i>
    in a subsequent birth. Simultaneous with the arising of the rebirth-consciousness, <i>rupas</i>
    conditioned by past Kamma spring up at every instant, like the flame of a lamp, up to the
    17th thought-moment reckoned from the dying moment of the person. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">At the very moment of conception there arise,
    as a result of the reproductive Karmic force, three <i>dasakas</i> or 'decads' - namely,
    the <i>kaya, bhava,</i> and <i>vatthu</i> - body, sex, and base decads. The body decad is
    composed of the four elements, four derivatives, vitality and the <i>kayapasada.</i> The
    sex-decad and the base-decad are similarly constituted. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">54. <b>Cittaja</b> - Mind, the invisible but
    more powerful composite factor of the so-called being, has the potentiality to produce <i>rupa.</i>
    In other words, good and bad thoughts produce desirable and undesirable material
    phenomena. This is apparent from the physical changes that result from thoughts generated
    by a person. According to Abhidhamma, it is from the arising moment of the first <i>bhavanga,</i>
    that is, immediately after the rebirth-consciousness, that material phenomena arising from
    mind spring up. The rebirth-consciousness does not produce mind-born <i>rupas,</i> since
    Kamma does that function, and since it is a newcomer to the fresh existence. No mind-born <i>rupas</i>
    arise at the static and perishing thought-moments, as they are weak. The ten
    sense-cognitives lack the potentiality to produce <i>rupa.</i> The four <i>arupa vipaka</i>
    <i>jhanas</i> do not produce <i>rupa,</i> as they are developed through non-attachment to <i>rupa.
    </font></p>
    </i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is stated that <i>jhana</i> factors
    are essential to produce mind-born <i>rupa.</i> One who possesses <i>jhanas</i> can
    therefore produce powerful <i>rupas</i> which would enable him to live even without edible
    food. The mentally alert do not lack vitality. One who experiences Nibbanic bliss could
    live without any food for a considerable period. For instance, the Buddha fasted 49 days
    immediately after His Enlightenment. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Of the 75 types of consciousness, 26 <i>javanas</i>
    (10 <i>rupa kusala</i> and <i>kriya,</i> 8 <i>arupa kusala</i> and <i>kriya</i> and 8 <i>lokuttaras)</i>

    Kamma produces, at the moment of rebirth, three decads <i>kaya, bhava,</i> and <i>vatthu.</i>
    The internal <i>tejo</i> element, found in these three groups, combined with the external <i>tejo</i>
    element, produces material phenomena caused by seasonal conditions at the static stage of
    the rebirth-consciousness. At the genetic stage Kamma-born <i>tejo</i> element takes the
    place of mind-born <i>tejo</i> element. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is clear that the term <i>utu</i> has been
    used in the sense of <i>tejo</i> which constitutes both heat and cold. Strictly speaking,
    it is the internal and external <i>tejo</i> elements which produce <i>rupa.</i> It should
    be understood that <i>rupas</i> produced by climatic conditions are also included in the <i>utuja</i>
    class. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">56. <b>Aharaja</b> - By Ahara are meant the
    nutritive essence present in physical food and the sap <i>(oja)</i> contained in the
    material groups born of Kamma, mind, and seasonal conditions. The internal <i>oja,</i>
    supported by the external nutritive essence, produces <i>rupa</i> at the static stage
    which endures for 49 minor thought-instants. <i>Rupas</i> arise when the <i>oja</i>
    diffuses the body. Internal sap is alone incapable of producing <i>rupa</i> without the
    aid of external nutritive essence. </font></p>
    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Hadaya</b> and 8 <i>indriya rupas</i>
    (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, masculinity, feminity, and vitality) are wholly produced by
    Kamma. Thus <i>jivitindriya</i> or the life-principle present in animate beings such as
    men and animals should be differentiated from the inanimate life of plants and inorganic

        But at conception, to moisture-born beings and to those of spontaneous birth, there arise
        at most the seven decads - eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, sex and base. As a minimum
        sometimes, eye, ear, nose, and sex decads are not obtained. This is how deficiencies of

        from the time of the diffusion of nutritive essence - uninterruptedly flows on in the <i>kama</i>-sphere

        static stage of consciousness, kamma-born material phenomena no longer arise. Kamma-born
        material qualities that arose earlier exist till the decease-moment and then cease.
        Following that, the consciousness-born and nutriment-born material phenomena come to
        cessation. Thereafter a continuity of material qualities produced by physical changes

    </b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">57. <i>Rupas</i> do not arise singly but
    collectively in groups. There are 21 such material groups. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As all mental states possess four common
    characteristics, so <i>rupas</i> found in the aforesaid groups possess four salient
    characteristics. For instance, in the 'eye-decad' all the ten associated <i>rupas</i>
    arise and cease together <i>(ekuppada-ekanirodha). </i>The earth-element, which is one of
    the ten, acts as a basis for the remaining nine <i>(ekanissaya).</i> All these ten coexist
    <i>(sahavutti). </i>It should be understood that the earth-element of the 'eye-decad' does
    not serve as a basis for the associated <i>rupas</i> of the 'ear-decad'. These four
    characteristics apply only to the associated <i>rupas</i> of each particular group.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">58. This section deals with the manner in
    which these material groups come into being and how they exist during lifetime, at the
    moment of conception, and in different states of birth.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to Buddhism there are four kinds of
    birth - namely, egg-born beings <i>(andaja),</i> womb-born beings <i>(jalabuja),</i>
    moisture-born beings <i>(samsedaja), </i>and beings having spontaneous births <i>(opapatika).</i>
    </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Embryos that take moisture as nidus for their
    growth, like certain lowly forms of animal life, belong to the third class. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes moisture-born beings lack certain
    senses and have no sex. They all must possess a consciousness as they are all endowed with
    the base-decad, that is, the seat of consciousness. Beings having a spontaneous birth are
    generally invisible to the physical eye. Conditioned by their past Kamma, they appear
    spontaneously, without passing through an embryonic stage. Petas and Devas normally, and
    Brahmas belong to this class.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some of those who have spontaneous birth in
    the <i>kama</i>-sphere are asexual. But all beings who are Spontaneously born in the <i>rupa</i>-sphere
    are not only asexual but are also devoid of sensitive nose, tongue, and body, though they
    possess those physical organs. The sensitive material qualities <i>(pasadarupas) </i>of
    those particular organs are lost as they are not of any practical use to Brahmas. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Egg-born beings are also included among
    womb-born beings. At the moment of conception they all obtain the three decads of body,
    sex, and the seat of consciousness. At times some are devoid of both masculinity and
    femininity. From this it is seen that even eggs are constituted with a consciousness.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">59. <b>Nibbana</b>, Sanskrit Nirvana, is
    composed of <i>ni</i> and <i>vana.</i> <i>Ni + vana </i>= Nivana = Nibana = Nibbana. <i>Ni</i>
    is a particle implying negation. <i>Vana</i> means weaving or craving. It is this craving
    which acts as a cord to connect the series of lives of any particular individual in the
    course of his wanderings in Samsara.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As long as one is entangled by craving or
    attachment, one accumulates fresh Karmic forces which must materialize in one form or
    other in the eternal cycle of birth and death. When all forms of craving are extirpated,
    Karmic forces cease to operate, and one, in conventional terms, attains Nibbana, escaping
    the cycle of birth and death. The Buddhist conception of Deliverance is this escape from
    the ever-recurring cycle of birth and death, and is not merely an escape from 'sin and
    hell'. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Etymologically, Nibbana, derived from <i>ni +
    vu,</i> to weave, means non-craving or non-attachment , or 'departure from craving'.
    Strictly speaking, Nibbana is that Dhamma which is gained by the complete destruction of
    all forms of craving. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Nibbana is also derived from <i>ni + va,</i>
    to blow. In that case Nibbana means the blowing out, the extinction, or the annihilation
    of the flames of lust, hatred, and ignorance. It should be understood that the mere
    destruction of passions is not Nibbana <i>(khayamattam eva na nibbananti vattabbam). </i>It
    is only the means to gain Nibbana, and is not an end in itself. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Nibbana is an ultimate reality <i>(vatthu-dhamma)</i>
    which is supramundane <i>(lokuttara), </i>that is, beyond the world of mind and body or
    the five 'aggregates'. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Nibbana is to be understood by intuitive
    knowledge and inferential knowledge <i>(paccakkha or pativedha ñana and anumana or
    anubodha ñana). </i>To express both ideas it is stated that Nibbana is to be realized by
    means of the wisdom pertaining to the four Paths of Sainthood and that it becomes an
    object to the Paths and Fruits. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Intrinsically <i>(sabhavato)</i> Nibbana is
    peaceful (santi). As such it is unique <i>(kevala).</i> This single Nibbana is viewed as
    twofold according to the way it is experienced before and after death. The text uses a
    simple but recondite Pali phrase - <i>karanapariyayena.</i> The Ceylon Commentary explains
    the cause for naming it as such with respect to its having or not having the aggregates as
    the remainder <i>(sa-upadisesadivasena paññapane karanabhutassa upadisesabhavabhavassa
    lesena).</i> Adding a note on this term S. Z. Aung writes: &quot;The Ceylon Commentaries
    explain it by <i>paññapane karanassa lesena</i> - by way of device of the means (of
    knowing) in the matter of language.&quot; - Compendium, p. 168, n. 6.</font></p>
    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Saupadisesa</b> - <i>Sa</i> = with; <i>upadi</i>
    = aggregates (mind and body); <i>sesa</i> = remaining. <i>Upadi</i>, derived from<i> upa +
    a + da,</i> to take, means the five aggregates as they are firmly grasped by craving and
    false views. It also signifies passions <i>(kilesas). </i>According to the text and the
    Commentarial interpretations, Nibbana, experienced by Sotapannas, Sakadagamis, and
    Anagamis, is <i>saupadisesa-nibbanadhatu</i> as they have the body and some passions still
    remaining. Nibbana of the Arahats is also <i>saupadisesa-nibbanadhatu</i> as they have the
    body still remaining. It is only the Nibbana of the Arahats after their death that is
    termed <i>anupadisesa-nibbanadhatu</i> because the aggregates and the passions are
    discarded by them. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Itivuttaka refers to these two kinds of
    Nibbana, but mention is made only of Nibbana comprehended by Arahats. It states: </font></p>
    <dir>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;These two Nibbana-states are shown by
      Him <br>
      Who seeth, who is such and unattached. <br>
      One state is that in this same life possessed<br>
      With base remaining, tho' becoming's stream <br>
      Be cut off. While the state without a base <br>
      Belongeth to the future, wherein all<br>
      Becomings utterly do come to cease.&quot;<br>
      -- (Itivuttaka p. 38; Woodward - As it was said p. 143; See &quot;The Buddha and His
      Teachings&quot;)</font></p>
    </dir>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">60. <b>Suññata</b> - Devoid of lust,
    hatred, and ignorance or of all conditioned things. Void here does not mean that Nibbana
    is 'nothingness'. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">61. <b>Animitta</b> - Free from the signs of
    lust, etc., or from the signs of all conditioned things. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">62. <b>Appanihita</b> - Free from the
    hankerings of lust, etc., or because it is not longed for with any feelings of craving. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">63. <b>Padam</b> - Here the term is used in
    the sense of an objective reality <i>(vatthu-dhamma).</i> 'State' does not exactly convey
    the meaning of the Pali term. It may be argued whether Nibbana could strictly be called
    either a state or a process. In Pali it is designated as a 'Dhamma'. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">64. <b>Asankhata</b> - Nibbana is the only
    Dhamma which is not conditioned by any cause. Hence it is eternal and is neither a cause
    nor an effect. </font></p>
