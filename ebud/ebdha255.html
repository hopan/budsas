      <TD WIDTH="100%"><FONT SIZE="6">T</FONT>here has sometimes been a 
      tendency, particularly in the Western world, to confuse Buddhism with 
      Hinduism, a confusion that has not always been confined to the 
      ill-informed and the ignorant. This stems in part from the historical 
      accident that the Buddha was born and lived his whole life in India, a 
      country which today has come to be identified almost exclusively with 
      Hinduism. The habit of many students of religion in the West of lumping 
      all &quot;Eastern Religions&quot; (by which term is often meant only Hinduism and 
      Buddhism) into one category, for the purpose of comparison with the 
      Judeo-Christianity of the West, has tended to perpetuate this confusion,. 
      It forgets that unlike Hinduism, which in a sense has been an ethnic 
      religion, Buddh ism was a universal doctrine from its inception and cannot 
      be confined to a particular nation or geographical locale. Then there is 
      the tendency of some modern &quot;enlightened&quot; Hindus to look upon the Buddha's 
      teaching as reducing ultimately to one or the other of the doctrines 
      contained in the Vedas, the Upanishads, or the classic systems of Hindu 
      philosophy (the <I>dharshanas</I>), not to mention the misguided attempt 
      by their forebears to transform the Buddha into an &quot;avatar&quot; of Vishnu. In 
      these circumstances it is useful to examine the fundamentals of Hinduism 
      and Buddhism in order to demonstrate their basic incompatibility, despite 
      the sharing of a common terminology (itself a source of confusion). A 
      couple of preliminary issues will have to be considered first. One is a 
      purely terminological question, viz. the appropriateness of the term 
      &quot;Hinduism&quot; to cover all the changing phases of India's traditional 
      religion; and the other a chronological one, viz. to relate the emergence 
      of the main doctrines of Hinduism and Buddhism to each other in a purely 
      historical way.
      <P>The word Hinduism was coined by the Muslim scholar Alberuni in the 11th 
      century C.E. and while its appropriateness to describe the dominant system 
      of religious belief in the India of his time (and of ours) is 
      unquestionable, its use to describe the oldest religious beliefs in India 
      (some scholars even applying the term to describe the pre-Aryan 
      civilization represented by the Harappan culture), is clearly suspect. In 
      this respect the practice of the earlier scholars to use the term 
      &quot;brahmanism&quot; to designate the system which prevailed amongst the Aryan 
      invaders before the Buddha's time, and to confine the word &quot;Hinduism&quot; to 
      designate the system which was synthesised in the Bhagavadgîta, a work 
      compiled centuries after the Buddha, which became the foundation of almost 
      the whole of later Hinduism, could be commended. This terminology will be 
      used here as far as possible, except that the word &quot;Hinduism&quot; will 
      sometimes have to be used to designate the combined systems of Brahmanism 
      and Hinduism proper, the actual context hopefully making clear what usage 
      is meant. </P>
      <P>The question of chronology has usually been considered a difficult one. 
      Hany students of Hinduism after proclaiming the impossibility of ascribing 
      dates to early Brahmanical works, then not only proceed to do so, but give 
      them very ancient ones with little or no justification. This is true not 
      only of Hindu traditionalists, but also of many Western orientalists, who 
      in the words of Nirud C. Chauduri &quot;have succumbed to Hindu chronological 
      fantasies&quot; [<I>Hinduism</I> (1979), p.33]. It may be mentioned that the 
      antiquity claimed for the Hindu texts contrasts strongly with the lateness 
      of all extant epigraphcial, iconographical and archelogical evidence. In 
      contrast to this morass of uncertainty the dates of the Buddha (563 - 483 
      BCE) have been established with little or no error. In fact the Buddha is 
      perhaps the first truly historical figure to emerge in India, just as the 
      Buddhist remains are the earliest religious archeological evidence 
      unearthed. And the earliest Buddhist literature contain abundant 
      information on the rival systems of belief prevalent in the India of that 
      time. These references cover both the main Brahmanical religion based on 
      the Vedas, and the emerging dissentient views proclaimed by the new 
      sramana philosopher-teachers of the time (the &quot;gymnosophists&quot; of the later 
      Greek observers of the Indian scene). </P>
      <P>The Brahmanical literature to which there is clear reference in the 
      Buddhist literature are the &quot;Three Vedas&quot;, and the Brahmanas based on 
      these three sa.mhitas (the latter only insofar as the practices 
      recommended by them are castigated). The three Vedas are, of course, the 
      Rig, the Sâma, and the Yagur. The absence of any references to the fourth 
      Veda (the Artharva) is an indication that this was not then known as an 
      independent one. This is borne out by an inspection of this Veda which 
      shows that it is quite different to the other three, being closer to the 
      Upanishads in some parts, and to a more primitive magic and sorcery in 
      others. It is therefore a polygot compilation of later times. </P>
      <P>It is now generally recognized that the religion of the Vedas with its 
      deification of the forces of nature, its constantly professed awe at the 
      basic human functions of breath and speech, its blending of sacrifice, 
      ritual and magic, its confounding of states of intoxication (produced by 
      imbibing the Soma libation) with states of mysticism, and so on, relate to 
      a very primitive stage in the development of the religious consciousness 
      (and scientific knowledge) of man. The so-called &quot;Vedic wisdom&quot; exhibited 
      is of a very rudimentary kind, and explicable more in anthropological 
      terms rather than in metaphysical or philosophical ones. Likewise its 
      &quot;eternal truths&quot; are no more than the simple hypotheses inspired by the 
      general ignorance of the times. It is also well-known that the 
      characteristic doctrines of later Hinduism (like the soul-theory, 
      re-incarnation, karman, moksha, devotion to some concrete manifestation of 
      an omnipotent Godhead, etc) are either totally absent or present in a very 
      rudimentary form. While the beginnings of the caste system are traceable 
      it had not yet assumed the rigid religious form of the later 
      Dharmashastras. Yet the Vedas contained the potential for all these 
      developments. </P>
      <P>By the Buddha's time this potential had already manifested itself, e.g. 
      in the growth of a greedy priestly caste, and the extravagance of the 
      sacrificial ceremonies (particularly the ashvamedha with its cruelty and 
      sexual connotations, and even human sacrifice). It was the Buddha who 
      showed that these were not accidental outgrowths, but were a consequence 
      of the basic Vedic outlook itself. The Vedic seers thought that they could 
      answer questions relating to the nature of the human condition, and 
      proceeded to do so in terms of the conventional ignorance of the times, on 
      which was established a whole system of religious practice and social 
      conduct. </P>
      <P>It is however not to the Vedas and the Brahmanas that the modern 
      exponents of Hinduism turn to as repositories of &quot;Vedic&quot; knowledge, but to 
      the Upanishads. It was on the basis of these treatises that elaborate 
      systems of &quot;Vedantist&quot; philosophy came to be constructed later by 
      philosophers like Samkara, Ramanuja and Madhva; but this was after the 9th 
      Century CE, long after Buddhism had vanished from Indian soil. </P>
      <P><A NAME="txt1"></A>It is therefore the doctrines in the original 
      Upanishads and their relationship to the Dhamma that must concern us. Once 
      again the chronological problem assumes some importance. The Indian 
      philosopher Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan <A HREF="#note1">[1]</A> (who can be 
      considered as the typical representative, indeed the leading spokesman, of 
      the &quot;enlightened&quot; Hindu approach to Buddhism) has claimed that &quot;the 
      Buddha's teaching is derived from the Upanishads&quot;. This presumes that not 
      only were the doctrines of the Upanishads well known in the Buddha's day, 
      but that the Buddha's system is actually contained in them. The first is 
      highly conjectural; the second is definitely false. </P>
      <P>There are over. a hundred Upanishads in existence. and of these about a 
      dozen could be traced to pre-Christian times. Some of these contain 
      references to the Buddha's doctrines and to the Sangha (e.g. Maithri 
      Upanishad 7.7 - 7.10); others are attached to the later Artharva Veda 
      (e.g. the Mundaka and the Pra.sna); so all these are post-Buddhist. In 
      fact only a very few, if any, can claim to be pre-Buddhist, but these 
      include the most original of the Upanishads, like the B.rihadâranyaka, the 
      Chândogya, and the Taittirîya The absence of any direct and explicit 
      reference to any of them in the Buddhist texts may mean that they were not 
      known as such. We know that the Upanishads were treated as esoteric 
      knowledge given out in forest fastnesses to selected students who were 
      urged to treat this knowledge as highly secret. But even if particular 
      Upanishads were not known, the general ideas behind them were. The 
      Buddha's refutation of some of these (e.g. the âtman doctrine) is evidence 
      that some Upanishadic doctrines were then known, even if not the actual 
      documents as we have them today. If they did have any influence on the 
      Buddha it was purely in a negative way, by providing examples of the 
      &quot;false views&quot; which it was the task of the Dhamma to refute. </P>
      <P><A NAME="txt2"></A>Most of Upanishadic doctrine is a restatement of 
      Vedic lore, and constitutes in Monier William's words &quot;a labyrinth of 
      mystical ideas and puerile conceit&quot;, and these need not concern us here. 
      Only in three distinct areas could any definite progress be discerned over 
      the earlier Vedic documents. These were: (a) the theory of the Brahman as 
      an impersonal principle of the absolute; (b) the elaboration of the 
      âtman-doctrine, and (c) the doctrine of karman, reincarnation and 
      sa.msâra. Of these the last mentioned has been dealt with elsewhere.<A HREF="#note2">[2]</A> 
      So we shall deal with only the other two here. </P>
      <P>&quot;Brahman&quot; constitutes the ultimate reality in the &quot;higher&quot; view of the 
      Upanishads. It is never explained in any rationally comprehensible way. In 
      the short Taittirîya Upanishad, to the question &quot;Declare Brahman, sir&quot; the 
      seer answers as follows: &quot;That, verily, whence beings here are born, that 
      by which when born they live, that into which on deceasing they enter&quot;; 
      then it is further identified with food, breath, mind, understanding and 
      bliss (3.1 - 3.8). The very use of a neuter impersonal term to designate 
      &quot;Brahman&quot; constitutes an advance over the concept of Brahmâ who was always 
      conceived as a supreme personal creator-god (Ishvara). If properly 
      interpreted and developed this Brahman-concept could even lead to a 
      non-theistic world-view. There is little evidence that this was the 
      interpretation favoured by the original Upanishadic seers, and it was 
      certainly not the way in which it was subsequently developed. In the 
      conventional usage it becomes a methphysical substitute for the &quot;unknown&quot;; 
      in reality a repository for ignorance and nescience. </P>
      <P>Now the use of undefined concepts is not necessarily wrong; the basic 
      axioms of many logical systems are based on intuitive concepts that defy 
      precise definition. The Buddhist concept of Nibbâna is also essentially 
      undefinable. But specific notions about it are not necessary for the 
      practice of the Buddha's way and the elimination of suffering, as these 
      are based on empirically verifiable laws,. Infact a sceptical attitude to 
      Nibbâna is not necessarily incompatible with the Dhamma. The. same is not 
      the case with the Brahman-concept, which in the last analysis has to be 
      equated to the divine principle, and becomes a form of theism even if it 
      is a non-personal and non-anthropomorphic theism. Without such a specific 
      interpretation of &quot;Brahman&quot; there cannot be a rationale for the 
      Brahmanical and Hindu modes of conduct and way of life. Such activity 
      cannot be grounded on an undefinable and non-cognizable &quot;something&quot;. </P>
      <P>It is well-known that there are no references to the impersonal Brahman 
      in the Buddha's discourses. None of the Buddha's interlocuters seem to 
      have raised this question, a further proof that to the minds of the age 
      there was hardly any difference between Brahman and Brahmâ. Brahman as an 
      undefined and undefinable concept may be immune to logical criticism, but 
      at the same time it cannot provide the basis for a meaningful ontology. If 
      the Brahman-concept escapes the Buddha's direct critique it is because of 
      this very characteristic that it could not provide a consistent 
      alternative world-view in its pure form. The Buddha would have included it 
      amongst the systems of sophistry (or &quot;eel-wriggling&quot;) described in the 
      Brahmajâla Suttanta as amarâvikkhepikâ. In its concrete form this 
      Upanishadic doctrine reduces, to something quite different, and this is, 
      of course, consistently criticised by the Buddha. </P>
      <P>The Atman (&quot;soul&quot;) was conceived by the Upanishadic seers as the 
      personal subjective counterpart of the impersonal objective Brahman. The 
      older Vedic theory had identified it more closely with the functioning of 
      the human person, and this view too continues to prevail in the Upans 
      shads; but it is the identification with the Brahman that was the unique 
      contribution of the Upanishads. Now it was this &quot;non-dualist&quot; view that 
      was propagated by Samkara as &quot;advaitya&quot;, but it remained a minority view 
      and was not compatible with the strictly devotional forms of Hinduism. The 
      identification of the Atman with the Brahman was seen by the monists as 
      the &quot;elevation of the human to the devine&quot;, but it could equally be looked 
      upon as the &quot;degradation&quot; of God to the human level; indeed it could be 
      interpreted in a way similar to the Buddhist view of God as the creation 
      of the human mind. It was because of these implications that the orthodox 
      devotional Hindus charged that Sankara had absorbed Buddhist views 
      (whereas he is well known as the persecutor of Buddhists in medieval 
      India). </P>
      <P>The Upanishads had the potentiality to break away from the theistic 
      mold of thinking; and had this happened the Upanishadic seer's fervent 
      plea, &quot;Lead me from darkness to light&quot;, may have been partly fulfilled. 
      All that happened was a retreat to a conventional theism. This retreat is 
      clearly seen in the Bhagavadgîta, which established the pattern of 
      Hinduism which has survived to this day. Here the theistic pantheon is 
      re-established, but now interpreted as the manifestations of an 
      all-powerful deity in its various aspects. Some of the cruder excesses of 
      the sacrificial system are eliminated or transmuted into symbolic form. 
      The âtman is again seen as the indestructible essence of man, originating 
      with God and seeking final union with its creator. Dharma becomes the 
      divinely ordained system of (caste) duty. The ideas of karman and 
      reincarnation were fitted into this mould. </P>
      <P>The clearest differences between Hinduism and Buddhism can be seen by 
      comparing the Hindu path with that of the Buddha. Since the Bhagavadgita 
      three valid methods of salvation have come to be recognized in Hinduism. 
      These are: bhaktiyoga (the way of faith), Karmayoga (the way of action), 
      and Jñânayoga (the way of knowledge). These may be compared to the three 
      components of the Buddha's path: paññâ (wisdom), sîla (morality) and 
      bhâvanâ (mental development). </P>
      <P>Bhaktiyoga and paññâ stand in stark contrast to each other. The former 
      is an appeal to divine grace by completely eliminating all human 
      potentiality for independent thinkmg and the evaluation of moral action; 
      paññâ is the attempt to understand the human predicament by individual 
      effort and to see reality &quot;as it truly is&quot;. Bhakti is nescience and 
      resignation; paññâ is (scientific) investigation and purposive action 
      based on it. The difference between karmayoga and sîla is that the former 
      is ritualistic action and the performance of duty simply because it is so 
      ordained in an authoritative source; sîla is the accomplishment of moral 
      acts (by word, deed, or thought) on the empirical ground that it is 
      condusive to the good of oneself and others. The five great sins according 
      to the code of Manu (the most authoritative of the Hindu law books) are: 
      killing of a brahmin (i.e. a member of the priestly caste), stealing gold 
      from one, adultery with the wife of a religious teacher, association with 
      one guilty of these four rules, and the partaking of liquor. These may be 
      compared with the pañca-sîla of Buddhism. (It is interesting that nowhere 
      in Hinduism is there an outright condemnation of murder as generally 
      wrong, in contrast to the numerous taboos relating to the partaking of 
      various kinds of food). Jñânayoga might give the impression that it is 
      concerned with the pursuit of knowledge. In fact the &quot;knowledge&quot; that is 
      meant here is that of God and of the undefined concepts of the Upanishads; 
      this is the very antithesis of what is meant by &quot;knowing&quot; in the 
      scientific-rationalist sense. In Buddhism, however, paññâ can include the 
      acquisition of discursive scientific knowledge even though some exponents 
      of the Dhamma deny it. The third component of the Buddha's path is 
      meditation, which is simply mental and psychological development, and has 
      nothing to do with reaching &quot;mystical&quot; states of mind which is the object 
      of Hindu meditation. A word may be said about the Darshanas, because of 
      the claim that Buddhism is derived from some of them. This involves 
      claiming for them an antiquity which they do not possess. Furthermore, of 
      the six classic systems, the Mimamsâ, the Yoga, and the Vedanta are too 
      theistic to warrant any consideration; the Nyâya and the Vaisheshika too 
      concerned with logic and taxonomy, and only the sa.mkya has seriously been 
      considered as having any affinity with Buddhism. But even here the 
      similarity has been exaggerated, and any influence would have been <I>from</I> 
      rather than <I>to</I> Buddhism. </P>
      <P>Buddhism deals with the three laws of anicca (impermanence), dukkha 
      (unsatisfactoriness) and anatta (&quot;no soul&quot;), but of these it is only the 
      last which is really the essence or bedrock of the Dhamma. By contrast the 
      single unique doctrine common to all forms of Hinduism is that of âtman or 
      &quot;soul&quot; asserted by even the most atheistic and monist of Hindus. Now the 
      incompatibility between these two doctrines goes beyond the fact that they 
      are linguistically opposites of one another. They imply different 
      world-views and different kinds of human action. Those who seek to 
      minimise the distance between Buddhism and Hinduism assert that in his 
      anatta doctrine the Buddha only referred to the &quot;selfishness&quot; of people, 
      which they referred to as the &quot;small ego&quot; in contrast to the &quot;Grand Ego&quot; 
      (which is equated to the âtman). Thus when Radhakrishnan states that the 
      Buddha was &quot;silent about the soul&quot; (<I>Indian Philosophy</I>, I, p.385) he 
      interprets all the references to atta (soul) in the Pali Cannon as 
      referring to this &quot;small ego&quot;. </P>
      <P>Even Mahâyâna Buddhism which has some similarities with Hinduism, is 
      also basically incomaptible with it because its doctrine of <I>sunyâta</I> 
      has no counterpart in Hinduism. </P>
      <P>Some common ground is shared between Hinduism and Buddhism, and these 
      seperate them from the monotheisms of the Middle East. These include the 
      notion that each person should seek his/her salvation independent of 
      socially organized authorities like &quot;established churches&quot;, that tolerance 
      is an essential ingredient in the search for spiritual truth, that forced 
      or induced &quot;conversion&quot; is invalid, and so on, not to mention specific 
      views in the areas of cosmology and the like. But these should not blind 
      us to the fundamental differences that seperate them.<BR>

      <OL>
        <LI><A NAME="note1"></A>Radhakrishnan's interpretation of Buddhism could 
        be gleaned from his <I>Indian Philosophy</I> (1923) and the 1938 Annual

        Academy. His later writings do not contain any progress from the views 
        expressed in these works. It must be mentioned that Radhakrishnan treats 
        the Buddha with respect and fairness, and was particularly impressed by
