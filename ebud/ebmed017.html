<i>The following explanation of the Buddhist practice of mindfulness has been
drastically abridged from the begining of the text <strong>SATIPATTHANA VISPASSANA
MEDITATION by The Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw Agga Maha Pandita</strong>.</i>

<p><HR width="30%"><P>
The method of developing Wisdom is to observe matter and mind which are
the two sole elements existing in a body with a view to know them in their
true form. At present times experiments in the analytical observation of
matter are usually carried out in laboratories with the aid of various kinds
of instruments; yet these methods cannot deal with mindstuff. The Buddhist
method of does not, however, require any kind of instruments or outside aid.
It can successfully deal with both matter and mind. It makes use of one's own
mind for analytical purpose by fixing bare attention on the activities of
matter and mind as they occur in the body. By continually repeating this form
of exercise the necessary Concentration can be gained and when the
Concentration is keen enough, the ceaseless course of arising and passing
away of matter and mind will be vividly perceptible. 
<p>
The body consists solely of the two distinct groups of matter and mind. The
solid substance of body a mass of matter. Matter changes its form under
physical conditions of heat, cold, etc., and because of this fact of
changeableness under contrary physical conditions it is called Form
(<strong>rupa</strong>).
It does not possess any faculty of knowing an object. In the Abhidhamma, the
proper name for the third division of the Buddhist scriptures, dealing with
the metaphysical and psychological, the elements of mind and matter are
classified differently as Things Which Possess Consciousness and Things Which
Lack Consciousness (<strong>sarammana dhamma</strong> and <strong>anarammana
dhamma</strong>) respectively. The
element of mind has an object, or holds an object, or knows an object while
that of matter does not have an object, nor holds an object, nor knows an
object. There is no faculty of knowing an object in the element of matter. 
<p>
A Yogi [meditator] also perceives in like manner, that is,
"material element has no faculty of knowing." Logs and.,pillars, bricks and
stones and lumps of earth are a mass of matter; they do not possess any
faculty of knowing. It is the same case with material elements consisting in
a living body; they have no faculty of knowing. The material elements in a
dead body are like those,of a living body; they are without the faculty of
knowing. But people have a general idea that material elements of a living
body the faculty of knowing an object irrespective of the fact whether, it is
in a dead or a living body. 
<p>
Then what is that which knows the objects now? It is the element of mind
which comes into being depending on matter. It is called Mind
(<strong>nama</strong>) because
it inclines to an object. Mind is also spoken of as "thought" or
"consciousness." Mind-arises depending on matter as will be described
hereafter. Depending on the eyes, eye consciousness (seeing) arises; depending on
the ears, ear-consciousness (hearing) arises; depending on the nose, nose-
consciousness (smelling) arises; depending on the tongue, tongue-consciousness
(taste) arises; depending on the body, body-consciousness (sense of touch)
arises. There are many kinds, either good or bad, of the sense of touch.
<p>
While it has a wide field of action by running throughout the whole length of
body, inside and outside, the sense of sight, hearing, smell, or taste can on
the other hand come into being respectively in its own particular sphere,
such as eye, ear, nose, and tongue, which occupies a very small and limited
space of the body. These senses of touch, sight, etc. are nothing but the
elements of mind. Also there comes into being the mind-consciousness (i.e.,
thoughts, ideas, imaginations, etc.) depending on mind-base. All of these are
elements of mind. Mind as a rule knows an object while matter does not know. 
People generally believe that, in the case of seeing, it is the eye which
actually sees. They think that seeing and eye are one and the same thing.
They also think, "Seeing is I: I see things: eye and seeing and I are one and
the same person." In actual fact this is not so. Eye is one thing and seeing
is another and there is no separate entity such as "I" or "Ego." There is
only the fact of "seeing" coming into being depending on eye. 
<p>
People who are without the training and knowledge of the Meditational
Development of Insight (<strong>vipassana bhavana</strong>) hold the view 
that seeing belongs
to or is "self, or ego, or living entity, or person." They believe that
"Seeing is 1; or I am seeing; or I am knowing." This kind of view or belief
is called the Erroneous View That There is a <A NAME="Self">Self</A>
(</strong>sakkaya-ditthi</strong>). Sakkaya
means the group of matter (<strong>rupa</strong>) and mind 
(<strong>nama</strong>) as they exist
distinctively. <strong>Ditthi</strong> means to hold a wrong view of belief. 
The compound word
of <strong>Sakkaya-ditthi</strong> means to hold a wrong view or belief on the dual set of
Matter and Mind which are in real existence. For more clarity it will be
explained further as to the manner of holding the wrong view or belief. At
the moment of seeing, the things that are in actual existence are the eye and
visual object of material group, and the seeing which belongs to mental
group. These two kinds are in actual existence. Yet people hold the view that
this group of elements is "self, or ego, or living entity." They consider
that "seeing is I; or what is seen is I; or I see my own body." Thus this
mistaken view is taken on the simple act of seeing as "self," which is
<strong>Sakkaya-ditthi</strong>.

<P>

One should practice by constantly noting or observing every act of seeing,
hearing, etc., which are the constituent physical and mental processes of the
body, till one is freed from <strong>Sakkaya-ditthi</strong>. For these reasons advice is
always given here to take up the practice of Vipassana Meditation. 
<p>
In this respect the exercise is simply to note or observe the existing
elements in every act of seeing. It should be noted as "seeing, seeing," on
every act of seeing. (By the terms of note or observe or contemplate it means
the act of keeping the mind fixedly on the object with a view to knowing
clearly.) Because of this fact of keeping the mind fixedly by noting as
"seeing, seeing," at times a visual object is noticed, at times consciousness
of seeing is noticed, or at times it is noticed as eye-base or as a place
from which it sees. It will serve the purpose if one can notice distinctly
any one of the three. If not, basing on this act of seeing there will arise
the erroneous view of self which will view it in the form of a person or
belonging to a person and in the sense of Permanence, Happiness and Selfhood
(<strong>nicca</strong>, <strong>sukha</strong> and <strong>atta</strong>), which will arouse
attachment and craving. The
Defilements will in turn prompt deeds, and the deeds will bring forth rebirth
of new existence. Thus the process of dependent origination operates and the
vicious circle of Samsara revolves incessantly. In order to prevent this from
the source of seeing, it is necessary to note as "seeing, seeing" on every
occasion of seeing.
<p>
Similarly, in the case of hearing, there are only two distinct elements of
matter and mind. The sense of hearing arises depending on ear. While ear and
sound are two elements of matter, the sense of hearing is an element of mind.
In order to know clearly any one of these two kinds of matter and mind it
should be noted as "hearing, hearing" on every occasion of hearing. So also
it should be noted as smelling, smelling" on every occasion of smelling, and
as "knowing, knowing" on every occasion of knowing the taste. 
<p>
Similarly, case of knowing or feeling the sensation of touch in the body.
There is a kind of material element known as Nerve Tissue (kaya-pasada)
throughout the body which receives every impression of touch. Every kind of
touch, either agreeable or disagreeable, usually comes in collision with
Nerve Tissue and there arises a Touch Consciousness (kaya-vinnana) which
feels or knows the touch on each occasion. It will now be seen that at every
time of touching there are two elements of matter, viz, sense-organ and
impression of touch, and one element of mind, viz, knowing of touch. In order
to know these things distinctly at every time of touch the practice of noting
as "touching, touching" has to be carried out. This merely refers to the
common form of sensation of touch. There are special forms which accompany
painful or disagreeable sensations, such as, to feel stiff or tired in the
body or limbs, to feel hot, to feel pain, to feel numb, to feel ache, etc.
Because Feeling (<strong>vedana</strong>) predominates in these cases,
it should be noted as
"feeling hot, feeling tired, painful, etc." as the case may be. 
<p>
It may also be mentioned that there occur many sensations of touch in hands
and legs, etc., on each occasion of bending, stretching, or moving. Because
of mind wanting to move, stretch or bend, the material activities of moving,
stretching, or bending, etc., occur in series. (It may not be possible to
notice these incidents for the present. They can only be noticed after some
time on gaining practice. It is mentioned here for the sake of Knowledge.)
All activities in movements and in changing, etc., are done by these minds.
When the mind wills to bend, there arises a series of inward movements of
hand or leg; when the mind wills to stretch or move, there arises a series of
outward movements or movements to and fro respectively. They disappear or are
lost soon after they occur and at the very point of occurrence. (One will
notice these incidents later on.) 
<p>
In every case of bending, stretching or other activities, there arises in the
foremost a series of intending or willing minds, and on account of which
there occur in the hands and legs a series of material activities, such as
stiffening (or being hard), bending, stretching, or moving to and fro. These
activities.ties come up against other material elements, nerve tissue, and on
every occasion of collision between material activities and sensitive
qualities, there arises Touch Consciousness, which feels or knows the
sensation of touch. It is, therefore, clear that material activities are the
predominating factors in these cases. It is necessary to notice these
predominating factors. If not, there will surely arise the wrong view of
holding these activities in the sense of "I or I am bending, or I am
stretching, or My hands, or My legs." This practice of noting as "bending,
stretching, moving" is being carried out for the purpose of removing such a
wrong view. 
<p>
As regards "thoughts, imaginations, etc." it may be mentioned that depending
on mind-base there arise a series of mental activities, such as thinking,
imagining, etc., or to speak in a general sense, a series of mental
activities arise depending on this body. In reality each case is a
composition of matter and mind; mind-base or body is matter, while thinking,
imagining, etc. are mind. In order to be able to notice matter and mind
clearly, it should be noted as "thinking, imagining, etc." in each case. 
After having carried out the practice in the manner indicated above for a
time, there may be an improvement in Concentration. One will notice that the
mind no longer wanders about but remains fixedly on the object to which it is
directed. At the same time the power of noticing has considerably developed.
On every occasion of noting he notices only two processes of matter and mind.
A dual set of object and mind, which makes note of. the object, is thus
coming into existence. 
<p>
Again on proceeding further with the practice of contemplation for some time,
one notices that nothing remains permanent but everything is in a state of
flux. New things arise each time: each of them is noted every time as it
arises; it then vanishes. Immediately another arises, which is again noted
and which then vanishes. Thus the process of arising and vanishing goes on,
which clearly shows that nothing is permanent. One is therefore convinced
that "things are not permanent" because it is noticed that they arise and
vanish at every time of noting. This is Insight into impermanence
(<strong>aniccanupassana-nana</strong>). 
<p>
Then one is also convinced that arising and vanishing are not desirable. This
is Insight into Suffering (<strong>dukkhanupassana-nana</strong>). Besides, one
usually experiences many painful sensations in the body, such as tiredness,
feeling hot, painful, aching, and at the time of noting these sensations he
generally
feels that this body is a collection of sufferings. This is also Insight into
Suffering. Then at every time of noting it is found that elements of matter
and mind occur according to their respective nature and conditioning, and not
according to one's wish. One is therefore convinced that they are elements:
they are not governable: they are not person or living entity. This is
Insight into the Absence of a Self (<strong>anattanupassana-nana</strong>). 
On having fully
acquired these knowledges of Impermanence, Suffering, Absence of Self
(<strong>anicca, dukkha, anatta</strong>), the maturity of 
Spiritual Knowledge of the Path and
Spiritual Knowledge of its Fruition (<strong>magga nana</strong> and 
<strong>phala nana</strong>) takes place and realization of Nirvana is won. 
By winning the realization of  Nirvana in
the first stage, one is freed from the round of rebirth in the unhappy life
of lower existence. Everyone should, therefore, endeavor to reach the first
stage as a minimum measure.
<P>
It has already been explained that the actual method of practice in Vipassana
Meditation is to note or to observe or to contemplate the successive
occurrences of seeing, hearing, etc., at six points or sense doors. However,
it will not be possible for a beginner to follow up all successive incidents
as they occur because his Mindfulness, Concentration and Spiritual Knowledge
(sati, samadhi and nana) are still very weak. The incidents of seeing,
hearing, etc. occur very swiftly. Seeing seems to occur at the time of
hearing; hearing seems to occur at the time of seeing; it seems that both
seeing and healing occur simultaneously. It seems that three or four
incidents of seeing, hearing, thinking, and imagining usually occur
simultaneously. It is not possible to distinguish which occurs first and
which follows next because they occur so swiftly. In actual fact, seeing does
not occur at the time of hearing nor does hearing occur at the time of
seeing. Such incidents can occur one only at a time. A Yogi who has just
begun the practice and who has not sufficiently developed Mindfulness,
Concentration and Spiritual Knowledge will not, however, be in a position to
observe all these incidents singly as they occur in serial order. A beginner
need not therefore follow up many things, but should instead start with a few
things. Seeing or hearing occurs only when due attention is given. If one
does not pay heed to any sight or sound, one may pass the time mostly without
any occasion of seeing or hearing. Smelling occurs rarely. Experience of
taste occurs only at the time of eating. In the cases of seeing, hearing,
smelling and tasting, the Yogi can note them when they occur. 
<p>
However, body impressions are ever present: they usually exist quite
distinctly all the time. During the time that one is sitting, the body
impressions of stiffness or the sensation of hardness, in this position are
distinctly felt. Attention should therefore be fixed on the sitting posture
and a note made as "sitting, sitting, sitting." 
<p>
Sitting is an erect posture of body consisting of a series of physical
activities which are induced by the consciousness consisting of a series of
mental activities. It is just like the case of an inflated rubber ball which
maintains its round shape through the resistance of the air inside it: so is
the posture of sitting, in which the body is kept in an erect posture through
the continuous process of physical activities. A good deal of energy will be
required to pull up and keep in an erect position such a heavy load as this
body. People generally assume that the body is lifted and kept in the
position by means of sinews. This assumption is correct in a sense because
sinews, blood, tlesh, bones are nothing but material elements. The element of
stiffening which keeps the body in an erect posture belongs to the material
group and arises in the sinews, flesh, blood, etc. throughout the body like
the air in a rubber ball. The element of stiffening is vayo-dhatu, the air
element. The body is kept in the erect position by the presence of the Air
Element in the form of stiffening, which is continually coming into
existence. At the time of heavy drowsiness one may drop flat, because the
supply of new materials in the form of stiffening is cut off. The state of
mind in heavy drowsiness or sleep is Unconsciousness (<strong>bhavana</strong>). During the
course of Unconsciousness mental activities are absent, and for this reason
the body lies flat during sleep or heavy drowsiness. During waking hours
strong and active mental activities are continually arising, and because of
these there arises a series of Air Elements in the form of stiffening. In
order to know these facts it is essential to note attentively as "sitting,
sitting, sitting." This does not necessarily mean that the body impressions
of stiffening should be particularly searched and noted. Attention need only
be fixed on the whole form of sitting posture, that is, the lower portion in
a bending circular forin and the upper portion in an erect posture.
<P>
It will be found that the exercise of observing a single object of sitting
posture is too easy and does not require much effort. In the circumstances
Vigor (<strong>viriya</strong>) is less and Concentration is in excess, and one would
generally feel lazy to carry on the noting as "sitting, sitting, sitting,"
repeatedly for a considerable time. Laziness generally occurs when there is
excess of Concentration and less Vigor. It is nothing but a state of Torpor
(<strong>thina-midha</strong>). More Vigor should be developed, and for this purpose the
number of objects for noting should be increased. After noting as "sitting,"
the attention should be. directed to a spot in the body where the sense of
touch is felt and a note made as "touching." Any spot in the leg or hand or
hip where a sense of touch is distinctly felt will serve the purpose. 
For example, after noting the sitting posture of the body as "sitting," the
spot where the sense of touch is felt should be noted as "touching." The
noting should thus be repeated on these two objects of sitting posture and
the place of touching alternately, as "sitting, touching; sitting, touching;
sitting, touching." 
<p>
The terms noting or observing or contemplating are used here to indicate the
fixing of attention on an object. The exercise is simply to note or observe
or contemplate as "sitting, touching." Those who already have experience in
the practice of meditation may perhaps find this exercise easy to begin with,
but those without any previous experience may find it rather difficult to
begin with. 
<p>
The more simplified and easy form of exercise for a beginner is this: At
every time of breathing there occur movements in the form of rising and
falling of one's abdomen. A beginner should start with this exercise of
noting or observing these movements. It is easy to observe these movements
because they are coarse and prominent and are more suitable for a beginner.
As in schools where simple lessons are easy to learn so is the case in the
practice of Vipassana Meditation. A beginner will find it easier to develop
Concentration and Spiritual Knowledge with a simple and easy exercise. Again,
the purpose of the Vipassana Meditation is to begin the exercise by
contemplating prominent factors in the body. Of the two factors of mind and
matter, the mental element is subtle and less prominent while the material
element is coarse and more prominent.
<p>
Therefore the usual procedure for one who practices the Vipassana insight
meditation (<strong>vipassana-yanika</strong>) is to begin the exercise
by contemplating the
material elements at the outset. As regards material elements it may be
mentioned here that Etheric Matter (<strong>upada-rupa</strong>) is subtle and less prominent
while Dense Physical Matter (<strong>maha-buta</strong>), the four primary physical elements
of Earth, Water, Fire and Air are coarse and more prominent and should
therefore have the priority of being placed first in the order of objects for
contemplation. In the case of rising and falling the outstanding factor is
the Air Element. The process of stiffening and the movements of abdomen
noticed during the contemplation are nothing but the functions of this
element. Thus it will be seen that the Air Element is perceptible at the
beginning. According to the instructions of Satipatthana Sutra, the discourse
of the Buddha, dealing with the practice of mindfulness, one should be
mindful of the activities of walking while walking, of those of standing,
sitting, and lying down while standing, sitting, and lying down,
respectively. One should also be mindful of other bodily activities as each
of them occurs. In this connection it is stated in the commentaries that one
should be mindful primarily of the Air Element in preference to the other
three. As a matter of fact, all four elements of Dense Physical Matter are
dominant in every action of the body, and it is essential to perceive any one
of these. At the time of sitting, either of the two movements of rising and
falling occurs conspicuously at every time of breathing, and a beginning
should be made by noting one of these movements.
