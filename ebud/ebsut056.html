      <P>T</FONT><FONT FACE="VU Times">he Tripiṭaka, or parts of it, survives in 
      several languages. The Sutra and Vinaya sections are generally accepted to 
      be its oldest portions, and most scholars have assumed that they contain 
      the oldest sources for the study of Indian Buddhism. In more recent times, 
      however, this assumption has been much debated: the antiquity of the 
      canonical texts, and their reliability as a source of historical 
      information, has been called into question. In the following, I will 
      consider the evidence for the dating of the Pali canon, particularly the 
      Suttapiṭaka, and I will assess the extent to which it can be taken to 
      include information about early Indian Buddhism. Although the results of 
      this investigation will have implications for the dating of all the early 
      sectarian literature, I am concerned more or less exclusively with the 
      early Pali literature and its history.</P>
      <P>According to the Sinhalese chronicles, the Pali canon was written down 
      in the reign of King Vaṭṭagamiṇi (29-17 B.C.).[1] It has been generally 
      accepted, therefore, that the canon contains information about the early 
      history of Indian Buddhism, from the time of the Buddha (c.484-404 B.C.) 
      until the end of the first century B.C. [2] That the canonical texts are a 
      record of the period of Buddhism before they were written down in Sri 
      Lanka seems to be confirmed by the fact that their language, Pali, is 
      north Indian in origin. Thus the Pali canon shows &#39;no certain evidence for 
      any substantial Sinhalese additions ... after its arrival in Ceylon.&#39; [3] 
      If the language of the Pali canon is north Indian in origin, and without 
      substantial Sinhalese additions, it is likely that the canon was composed 
      somewhere in north India before its introduction to Sri Lanka, and is 
      therefore a source for the period of Buddhism in northern India before 
      this. The Sinhalese chronicles state that the canon was brought to Sri 
      Lanka by Mahinda during the reign of Aśoka, implying that it predates the 
      middle of the third century B.C. [4] According to this history, the Pali 
      canon, particularly the Vinaya and Sutta portions, is a reliable source 
      for the early history of Indian Buddhism in the period before Aśoka. [5]</P>
      <P>This version of events is not accepted by all, however. Gregory Schopen 
      in particular has argued against the view that the canonical texts can be 
      taken as accurate historical sources for the earliest period:</P>
      <I>
      <P>Scholars of Indian Buddhism have taken canonical monastic rules and 
      formal literary descriptions of the monastic ideal preserved in very late 
      manuscripts and treated them as if they were accurate reflections of the 
      religious life and career of actual practising Buddhist monks in early 
      India. </I>[6]</P>
      <P>This point of view has two aspects to it. On the one hand, normative 
      religious literature must not be taken at face value, as if it contains 
      evidence of real historical events. As Schopen puts it:</P>
      <I>
      <P>Even the most artless formal narrative text has a purpose, and that in 
      &quot;scriptural&quot; texts, especially in India, that purpose is almost never 
      &quot;historical&quot; in our sense of the term. </I>[7] On the other hand, Schopen 
      doubts that texts preserved in &#39;very late manuscripts&#39; contain accurate 
      historical evidence -- he wishes us to believe that the canonical texts 
      cannot be taken as evidence for the period before the fifth century A.D.:</P>
      <I>
      <P>We know, and have known for some time, that the Pali canon as we have 
      it -- and it is generally conceded to be our oldest source -- cannot be 
      taken back further than the last quarter of the first century B.C.E, the 
      date of the Alu-vihara redaction, the earliest redaction that we can have 
      some knowledge of, and that -- for a critical history -- it can serve, at 
      the very most, only as a source for the Buddhism of this period. But we 
      also know that even this is problematic since, as Malalasekera has pointed 
      out: &quot;...how far the Tipiṭaka and its commentaries reduced to writing at 
      Alu-vihara resembled them as they have come down to us now, no one can 
      say.&quot; In fact, it is not until the time of the commentaries of 
      Buddhaghosa, Dhammapala, and others -- that is to say, the fifth to sixth 
      centuries C.E. -- that we can know anything definite about the actual 
      contents of this canon. </I>[8]</P>
      <P>A central theme running through Scopen&#39;s work is his claim that we 
      cannot know anything for sure about Indian Buddhism from its texts that 
      were redacted in the fifth century A.D. (for the Pali canon), or the 
      fourth century A.D. (approximately, for the canonical material of various 
      sects preserved in Chinese translations). Consequently, Schopen believes 
      that the only way we can find out anything about Buddhism before this time 
      is through accurately dated epigraphical and archaeological material. It 
      is clear from Schopen&#39;s work that this evidence has not been given the 
      attention it deserves; it is vitally important to study the material 
      remains, which tell us something concrete about what Buddhists were doing 
      at particular places in particular times. But does this mean that we 
      should concentrate exclusively on the material remains? Should we throw 
      out the texts, or merely allow their evidence to be restricted and 
      subordinated to the material evidence? The impression given by Schopen&#39;s 
      work is that the study of early Buddhism can only progress by 
      subordinating the literary evidence to the material evidence, an approach 
      which seems to have become standard in some quarters. But before we 
      consign ourselves to a radical reorientation in the study of early 
      Buddhism, we should critically examine some of the presuppositions of this 
      approach. There seem to be three questions of importance here:</P>
      <P>1) How old are the canonical texts?</P>
      <P>2) Are the canonical texts purely normative, or do they include 
      descriptive material which can be used to reconstruct historical events?</P>
      <P>3) And finally, how much importance is to be assigned to the 
      epigraphical and archaeological evidence?</P>
      <P>I radically disagree with Schopen&#39;s answers to each of these questions. 
      In what follows, I hope to show why Schopen&#39;s views are untenable, and I 
      will argue that the only way of knowing anything about early Buddhism is 
      through its texts. I will begin with the last point first: it seems to me 
      that the worth of the epigraphical and archaeological evidence has been 
      overstated by Schopen. This is not to deny its great importance for the 
      study of Indian Buddhism -- without it, the historian is fumbling in the 
      dark, and his conclusions will lack verisimilitude. Be that as it may, the 
      material evidence has its own limitations, and the fact is that it does 
      not tell us that much about the thought and practices of Buddhists in 
      ancient India. So although Schopen has used this evidence to draw 
      attention to hitherto neglected aspects of Indian Buddhism (e.g. that 
      monks and nuns probably instigated the cult of the image, or that monks 
      and nuns were involved in the <I>stupa </I>cult from the earliest times), 
      he does not acknowledge the fact that this does not tell us very much 
      about Indian Buddhism as it was practised. It does not allow us to probe 
      very far into the beliefs and practices of Buddhist monks and nuns in 
      India; its content is limited, much more limited than the content of the 
      early texts, which seem to me to contain a wealth of information on the 
      diverse beliefs current in early Buddhism.</P>
      <P>According to Schopen, the epigraphical material &#39; tells us what a 
      fairly large number of Indian Buddhists actually did, as opposed to what 
      -- according to our literary sources -- they might or should have done.&#39;9 
      What exactly Schopen has in mind when he says &#39;a fairly large number of 
      Indian Buddhists&#39; is unclear, but certainly misleading: the relevant 
      inscriptions number only a few thousand, which is evidence, surely, for 
      the activity of a small minority of monks and nuns. They can hardly be 
      taken as indicative of the activity of the Buddhist populace at large -- 
      just over a couple of thousand inscriptions does not, to my mind, 
      represent a large number of Indian Buddhists, considering that this must 
      have been a tiny fraction of the number of Indian Buddhists from about 400 
      B.C. to 500 A.D.</P>
      <P>In other words, there is a tendency in Schopen&#39;s work to make 
      generalisations about Indian Buddhism based on a very small amount of 
      evidence. Even if the generalisations were true in every respect, it would 
      only reveal the historical reality of a tiny part of Indian Buddhism. 
      Perhaps if there were epigraphical evidence representing every Buddhist 
      who existed in ancient India, it would be similar to the evidence of the 
      extant inscriptions. But we cannot presume what is not there. For all we 
      know, the inscriptions might represent only a small minority of the 
      ancient Indian Saṅgha, the minority who had personal wealth and who could 
      endow Buddhist institutions in different ways.</P>
      <P>In this situation, we should not underestimate the worth of the textual 
      evidence, even if its antiquity cannot be established accurately. For 
      example, Schopen records that two inscriptions at Mathura record the 
      donations of monks who are called <I>prahaṇika-s</I>, &#39;practisers of 
      meditation&#39;.[10] But without consulting the evidence of the Pali canon for 
      the word <I>padhana </I>or the Buddhist Sanskrit evidence for the word <I>
      pradhana/prahaṇa </I>(or variations on them), we would have absolutely no 
      idea what the term signified for the two monks, and why they used it. The 
      fact is that the texts are indispensable: the literary evidence, even if 
      only normative, and even if it was periodically revised until the rather 
      late redactions, is most certainly a useful record, not to be used as 
      subsidiary to the material evidence, as Schopen believes, but in tandem 
      with it, so that the two sorts of evidence are used equally. In short, if 
      the inscriptions are to have any significance for the study of early 
      Indian Buddhism, they must be considered alongside the canonical evidence, 
      as has been argued by Hallisey:</P>
      <I>
      <P>It will only be after we have learned to combine our interest in &quot;what 
      really happened&quot; with a sensitivity to the changing thought-worlds of the 
      Theravada that we will begin to discern the historical reality behind the 
      literary and archaeological traces of ancient Buddhist monasticism</I>.[11]</P>
      <P>It seems to me that Schopen&#39;s work is most convincing when he follows 
      this method, and uses the literary, epigraphical and archaeological 
      sources equally, [12] instead of just dismissing the literary evidence out 
      of hand. [13] Unfortunately, in his eagerness to point out that the 
      studies of previous generations of Buddhist scholars were one-sided, 
      Schopen has created another one-sided version of history. What is needed 
      is a balanced approach that gives both sets of evidence, the literary and 
      material, their due worth. But what is the worth of the literary evidence? 
      This brings me to two of the questions posed above, viz. the age and 
      nature of the canonical texts. Schopen&#39;s position on these two points is 
      quite clear, as we have seen, although it is strange that he does not give 
      any evidence to support his view that the narrative Buddhist literature is 
      &#39;almost never historical&#39;, as if this were a self-evident fact. As for his 
      point that we cannot know if the canonical material is old, he attempts to 
      demonstrate this by claiming that the general method of higher criticism 
      -- the method which is often used to prove the antiquity of canonical 
      texts -- is inapplicable. He sums up this method of higher criticism as 
      follows: &#39;If all known sectarian versions of a text or passage agree, that 
      text or passage must be very old; that is, it must come from a 
      presectarian stage of the tradition.&#39; [14] </P>
      <P>The alternative explanation of the agreement of &#39;all known sectarian 
      versions of a text or passage&#39; is that the agreement was produced by the 
      different sects sharing literature at a later date. It is this hypothesis 
      which Schopen attempts to prove by showing that the similar versions of 
      the story of the <I>stupa </I>of Kaśyapa at Toyika, found in Mahasaṅghika, 
      Mahiśasaka, Dharmaguptaka and Theravadin texts, are later than versions 
      found in the Mulasarvastivadin Vinaya and in the Divyavadana. [15] The 
      former group of texts claim that the Buddha manifested a <I>stupa </I>
      momentarily, after which a <I>stupa </I>was built (by monks) or appeared. 
      The version of the story in the Mulasarvastivadin Vinaya and in the 
      Divyavadana, however, is described by Schopen as follows: &#39;Firstly, it has 
      none of the various subplots found in the other versions -- a fairly sure 
      sign of priority -- and, second, it knows absolutely nothing about a <I>
      stupa </I>at Toyika or its construction.&#39; [16] Schopen&#39;s main argument 
      then is that the story in the Mulasarvastivadin Vinaya and the Divyavadana 
      is earlier because it does not mention a <I>stupa</I>: &#39;This version, in 
      short, reflects a tradition -- apparently later revised -- that only knew 
      a form of the relic cult in which the <I>stupa </I>did not yet have a 
      part.&#39; [17]</P>
      <P>The first thing which I find odd about Schopen&#39;s assessment of this 
      story is his claim that, on the basis of the evidence in the 
      Mulasarvastivadin Vinaya and Divyavadana, there was a form of the relic 
      cult that did not include the <I>stupa</I>. The narratives in these texts 
      mention <I>caitya-s</I>, and although Schopen states that this term has 
      nothing to do with <I>stupa-s</I>, this is not at all clear. In his 
      article &#39;The <I>Stupa </I>Cult and the Extant Pali <I>Vinaya</I>&#39;, [18] he 
      has in fact argued that in the Pali literature, the word <I>cetiya </I>is 
      equivalent to <I>stupa</I>. [19] It could easily be the case that the word 
      has the same meaning in the Mulasarvastivadin Vinaya and the Divyavadana. 
      But even if not, are we to accept a form of relic worship without a <I>
      stupa</I>? If we take the canonical texts seriously, it is hard to imagine 
      that this could ever have been the case. The <I>Mahaparinibbana Sutta</I>, 
      for example, states that the Buddha&#39;s relics are to be contained in a <I>
      stupa</I>, [20] which suggests that the <I>stupa </I>goes back to the very 
      beginning of Buddhism. The <I>stupa </I>was certainly a feature of 
      Buddhism by the time of Aśoka, who records in his Nigali Sagar Pillar 
      Edict that twenty years into his rule, he had the <I>thuba </I>of 
      Konakamana doubled in size. [21] Moreover, Aśoka seems to have known a 
      portion of the text found in the Sanskrit version of the <I>
      Mahaparinirvaṇa Sutra </I>-- in his Rummindei inscription, he records that 
      he visited Lumbini and worshipped there saying &#39;Here the Blessed One was 
      born&#39;, [22] which corresponds to the Sanskrit version of the <I>
      Mahaparinirvaṇa Sutra </I>(41.8: <I>iha bhagavaṭ jataḥ</I>). [23] This 
      part of the text is close to the parts in the Pali and Sanskrit versions 
      which mention <I>stupa-s</I>, and so it seems natural to conclude that <I>
      stupa </I>worship was not only a part of Buddhism at this date, but also 
      that it was mentioned in canonical Buddhist texts at this point. This is 
      an important point, for according to the most plausible theory of sect 
      formation (the theory proposed by Frauwallner), some of the Sthavira sects 
      formed as a result of the Aśokan missions in 250 B.C. (see below p.11ff). 
      If the Aśokan evidence suggests that by about this time the <I>stupa </I>
      was a feature of Buddhism and its texts, a presectarian period that did 
      not relate relic worship to the construction of <I>stupa-s </I>is hardly 
      plausible. It seems that there are no obvious reasons for taking the story 
      in the Mulasarvastivadin Vinaya and Divyavadana to be older than the 
      versions in the Mahasaṅghika, Mahiśasaka, Dharmaguptaka and Theravadin 
      texts.</P>
      <P>However, even if Schopen has got it right and his argument is valid, it 
      actually shows that the Pali canon was closed to material received from 
      other sects. What Schopen fails to mention is that the method of higher 
      criticism used to establish old strata in the Buddhist literature usually 
      compares the canonical literature of different sects: he is reluctant to 
      note that the Pali version of the story of the <I>stupa </I>of Kaśyapa at 
      Toyika is found in the <I>Dhammapada-aṭṭhakatha </I>-- this information is 
      conveniently confined to footnote 28. This means that if Schopen is 
      correct, it seems then that whereas some of the other sects periodically 
      shared literature and changed their canonical material in the sectarian 
      period, the Theravadins of Sri Lanka did not: they confined the received 
      material to non-canonical books. It seems that Schopen might have 
      inadvertently proved that the Pali canon was relatively closed after its 
      redaction at an early date. This depends of course on whether or not he 
      has interpreted the different versions of the story about the <I>stupa </I>
      at Toyika correctly, and this is far from clear. A thorough study of the 
      different versions of the story is surely necessary. However, it is worth 
      taking a short digression to show that another inadvertent proof of the 
      antiquity of at least the Suttapiṭaka is given by Schopen in the very same 
      article (&#39;Two Problems in the History of Indian Buddhism: The Layman/Monk 
      Distinction and the Doctrines of the Transference of Merit&#39;).</P>
      <P>In this article, Schopen shows that the belief in the transference of 
      merit was widespread in India from the third century B.C. onwards 
      (pp.34-42). Thus, a late Mauryan/early Śuṅga inscription from Pauni, a few 
      inscriptions from third century B.C. Sri Lanka, a singular early 
      inscription from Bharhut, as well as a significant number of later 
      Hinayana inscriptions from various parts of India all record the idea. If 
      the idea was a standard belief of Buddhists in early times, even in Sri 
      Lanka, and if the Suttapiṭaka was not finally closed until the Alu-vihara 
      recension in the fifth century A.D., then it is reasonable to expect that 
      it should be well attested in the Suttapiṭaka. But this is not the case -- 
      although much is said on the subject of meritorious activity, the idea of 
      the transference of merit is found in only two separate occurrences in the 
      four principle Nikaya-s. [24] How can we explain the fact that Theravada 
      Buddhists of Sri Lanka did not compose more texts which included the idea 
      of merit transference? There can only be one answer -- the texts were 
      closed in an earlier period, when the belief was marginal in Buddhist 
      circles. This is surely the only answer to the problem. Even if this does 
      not definitely prove that the canon was closed at an earlier date, the 
      fact that the ancient guardians of the Suttapiṭaka did not compose texts 
      on the transference of merit shows that they must have had some idea of 
      canonical orthodoxy, which means that the canon must have been relatively 
      fixed. By attempting to show that the canonical texts are not reliably 
      old, and that we must turn to the epigraphic evidence to gain any idea 
      about the historical reality of ancient Indian Buddhism, Schopen has 
      inadvertently shown that some collections of texts must indeed be old and 
      contain evidence for the period before most of the inscriptions.</P>
      <P>Exactly the same fact emerges from Schopen&#39;s article &#39;The <I>Stupa </I>
      Cult and the Extant Pali Vinaya&#39;. He attempted to show that &#39;the total 
      absence of rules regarding <I>stupas </I>in the Pali <I>Vinaya </I>would 
      seem to make sense only if they had been systematically removed&#39;, [25] 
      meaning that the Pali canon was altered &#39;at a comparatively recent date&#39;, 
      after the supposed recensions made in the first century B.C. and the fifth 
      century A.D.</P>
      <P>This argument is based upon the fact that all the other extant Vinayas 
      include rules concerning the construction and cult of the <I>stupa</I>, 
      whereas the Pali Vinaya does not. There are two possible explanations for 
      this fact. Either it is because the Pali Vinaya was closed before these 
      rules were formulated, or it is because these sections were written out of 
      the Pali Vinaya, accidentally or on purpose; Schopen chooses the latter 
      option. But Gombrich and Hallisey have shown that this interpretation is 
      based on a mistranslation of the twelfth century Sinhalese inscription, 
      the <I>Maha-Parakramabahu Katikavata</I>. [26] It therefore seems likely 
      that the other solution to the problem is correct -- the Pali Vinaya was 
      closed before this section was composed and added to the other Vinayas. 
      Gombrich notes: &#39;One does not have to posit that it received no further 
      additions after the first century B.C., merely that the Pali tradition had 
      left the mainstream and naturally failed to record later developments on 
      the Indian mainland.&#39; [27] But because we know that the Pali tradition 
      remained in contact with the Indian mainstream (it received texts from 
      north India after the first century B.C.), I think it more likely that no 
      further additions were made after the first century B.C.</P>
      <P>The points Schopen makes about the post-canonical sharing of 
      literature, the transference of merit, and the Pali Vinaya&#39;s evidence on
      <I>stupa-s</I>, if correctly interpreted, suggest that the Pali canon was 
      relatively fixed from at least the first century B.C. onwards. This is 
      despite the fact that the Pali tradition remained in contact with other 
      Buddhist sects in India, as has been noted already by scholars such as 
      Oldenberg and Norman. According to Norman, &#39;some of the best known stories 
      in Buddhism ... are known in the Theravadin tradition only in the 
      commentaries, although they are found in texts which are regarded as 
      canonical in other traditions.&#39; [28] Such stories must have reached Sri 
      Lanka before Buddhaghosa, for he includes them in his commentaries. But 
      why were they not inserted into the canon? Norman thinks that it was 
      because &#39;at least the Vinaya- and Sutta-piṭaka had been closed at an 
      earlier date.&#39; [29] Norman has also pointed out that certain Pali works 
      for which a North Indian origin is supposed, such as the <I>Milindapaṭha</I>, 
      the <I>Peṭakopadesa </I>and the <I>Nettipakaraṇa,</I> are highly respected 
      by the commentators but are not given canonical status by them. They even 
      contain &#39;a number of verses and other utterances ascribed to the Buddha 
      and various eminent theras, which are not found in the canon ... There was 
      no attempt made to add such verses to the canon, even though it would have 
      been a simple matter to insert them into the Dhammapada or the 
      Theragatha.&#39; [30] The point that the Pali tradition received literature 
      from other sects but excluded it from the canon had been made already by 
      Oldenberg in 1879: &#39;These additions are by no means altogether unknown to 
      the Singhalese church, but they have been there placed in the Aṭṭhakathas, 
      so that the text of the Tipiṭaka, as preserved in Ceylon, has remained 
      free from them.&#39; [31] This suggests that they arrived in Sri Lanka &#39;after 
      the closure of the Canon&#39;.</P>
      <P>If we remind ourselves of Norman&#39;s point that the Pali canon contains 
      no definite evidence for a substantial amount of Sinhalese prakrit (see 
      above p.1), it seems quite clear that after the Tipiṭaka was written down 
      in the first century B.C., it was not substantially altered, at least in 
      content, and as such, it must have been very similar to the extant Pali 
      Canon. This means that the Suttapiṭaka in existence today can be taken as 
      an accurate record of Buddhist thought from the time of the Buddha (c. 
      484-404 B.C.) until the first century B.C. at the latest . [32] This is 
      significantly older than Schopen is willing to acknowledge, but the <I>
      terminus ante quem </I>can be pushed back even further; it depends upon 
      the date when the Pali texts reached Sri Lanka, i.e. the date at which the 
      sectarian period began.</P>
      <P>According to Schopen, &#39;we do not actually know when the sectarian 
      period began.&#39; [33] To support this view he cites Bareau&#39;s work which 
      points out that the Buddhist sects all give different dates for the 
      schisms. [34] But he does not make any mention of what is probably the 
      most convincing work on the subject. Erich Frauwallner, in <I>The Earliest 
      Vinaya and the Beginnings of Buddhist Literature</I>, used a mixture of 
      epigraphical and literary sources to argue that some of the Sthavira sects 
      owed their origination to the missions said to have taken place in the 
      reign of Aśoka, c.250 B.C. Firstly, there are records in the Sinhalese 
      chronicles (and the <I>Samantapasadika</I>) of a series of Buddhist 
      missions which went out to different parts of India and neighbouring 
      kingdoms in the reign of Aśoka. Although these Pali accounts as we have 
      them do not seem plausible -- they might have been embellished to trump up 
      the monastic lineage from which the Pali texts issued [35] -- the missions 
      are confirmed by the inscriptions found on a couple of reliquaries 
      unearthed in the ancient Buddhist centre of Vidiśa. According to 
      Frauwallner, these reliquaries contain the remains of the Hemavata masters 
      Dudubhisara, Majjhima and Kassapagotta, names which he identified with the 
      missionaries Durabhisara, Majjhima and Kassapagotta, all of whom travelled 
      to the Himavanta according to the chronicles. [36] Willis has recently 
      pointed out that Frauwallner misread this evidence slightly by mistaking 
      the relics of Gotiputa, heir of Dudubhisara, for Dudubhisara himself, [37] 
      but at the same time he has argued that all five names on the two 
      different reliquaries correspond to the five names in the chronicles. [38] 
      It strongly implies that the missionaries to the Himavanta hailed from 
      Vidiśa and that some of their relics were returned there some time after 
      their death. The chronicles also record that Mahinda&#39;s mother was from 
      Vidiśa, and that he stayed there before journeying to Sri Lanka. [39] This 
      is an impressive correspondence of epigraphical and literary evidence, and 
      it makes it almost certain that the account of the missions in the Pali 
      chronicles contains some historical truth.</P>
      <P>Frauwallner equated this epigraphic and literary evidence with further 
      epigraphic evidence from Aśoka&#39;s thirteenth Rock Inscription: on pp.15-17 
      of <I>The Earliest Vinaya</I>, he noted that the areas mentioned in this 
      edict, to which he despatched emissaries, correspond to the areas of 
      missionary activity mentioned in the Pali chronicles. Both sources, 
      according to him, mention the North-West, West and South but omit the 
      East, and he comments &#39;This is certainly no freak chance.&#39; Lamotte&#39;s table 
      (p.302) shows at least a superficial agreement between the places 
      mentioned in both sources, but Gombrich is probably correct in commenting: 
      &#39;The geographical identifications are too uncertain to help us&#39;. [40] With 
      the geographical identifications uncertain, Lamotte was sceptical of the 
      notion that there was one concerted missionary effort in Aśokan times. He 
      argued that the Buddhists were natural missionaries and would have spread 
      Buddhism throughout India from the beginning. [41] Thus he concluded his 
      study of the early Buddhist missions by stating &#39;Whatever might have been 
      said, Aśoka was not directly involved in Buddhist propaganda.&#39; [42] 
      Gombrich, on the other hand, agrees with Frauwallner, and notes:</P>
      <I>
      <P>While Lamotte is right to point out that some of the areas visited, 
      notably Kashmir, had Buddhists already, that does not disprove that 
      missions could not be sent there. The chroniclers, as so often happens, 
      had no interest in recording a gradual and undramatic process, and allowed 
      history to crystallize into clear-cut episodes which could be endowed with 
      edifying overtones; but this over-simplification does not prove that 
      clear-cut events never occurred</I>.[43]</P>
      <P>The notion that there was a clear-cut missionary episode in the spread 
      of Buddhism across India seems to be confirmed by the epigraphical record. 
      L. S. Cousins has surveyed the references to the sects in inscriptions 
      (pp.148-51), and noted that the related Vibhajjavadin sects (the 
      Vibhajjavadin-s made up a subset of the ancient Sthaviras) were most 
      widespread of all Buddhist sects in the first few centuries C.E. On the 
      other hand, the other sects were distributed randomly across India. This 
      is exactly what is to be expected if there was a gradual diffusion of 
      Buddhism throughout India, as well as a concerted missionary effort by one 
      ancient monastic community, which thereafter separated into separate sects 
      due to the geographical dispersal. Cousins comments on the tradition of 
      the Buddhist missions as follows:</P>
      <I>
      <P>It seems clear that whatever the traditions about these missions may or 
      may not tell us about events in the third or second century BCE, they do 
      certainly correspond to what we know of the geographical spread of the 
      schools early in the first millennium CE. They must then have some 
      historical basis. Vibhajjavadins really were the school predominant in 
      Ceylon and Gandhara at an early date, as well as being present, if not 
      predominant, in other parts of Central Asia, China, South India and 
      South-East Asia by around the turn of the third century CE at the latest. 
      No other school has a comparable spread at this date.</I>[44]</P>
      <P>It seems then that there is no reason to doubt that there was some sort 
      of mission in the third century B.C. which set out from Vidiśa to the far 
      North-West, West and South of India. Frauwallner thought that this 
      missionary activity founded the Sarvastivadin sect in the North-West, as a 
      result of Majjhantika&#39;s mission to Kaśmir and Gandhara,[45] whereas 
      Cousins considers only the Vibhajjavada sects in the North-West and South. 
      Was the Sarvastivadin sect of the North-West produced by a missionary 
      effort that otherwise seems to have produced only Vibhajjavadin sects? 
      This is certainly possible. Frauwallner made it quite clear that the 
      formation of distinct communities ought to be distinguished from schools 
      of thought: &#39;from the first we have stressed the principle that the 
      foundation of communities and the rise of dogmatic schools are two quite 
      separate things.&#39; [46] This led him to conclude that the dogmatic 
      affiliation of the Mulasarvastivadin and Sarvastivadin sects came later 
      than the original foundation of these two as monastic communities.[47] It 
      is possible then that different dogmatic affiliations could have been 
      produced in the sects founded by missionary activity, and that the 
      dogmatic affiliation to <I>sarvastivada </I>ideas by the community that 
      came to be known as the &#39;Sarvastivadin&#39; sect came about later. This seems 
      to be shown by the fact that the literature of the Sarvastivadin sect is 
      in many regards similar to the literature of the other Vibhajjavadin 
      sects.</P>
      <P>In the beginning of <I>The Earliest Vinaya</I>, Frauwallner notes that 
      the Skandhaka section of the Sarvastivadin, Dharmaguptaka, Mahiśasaka and 
      Pali Vinaya-s are &#39;strikingly close&#39;; the Skandhaka of the Kaśyapiya 
      school is not considered because it has not survived. [48] According to 
      Frauwallner then, the Sarvastivadin Skandhaka is closer to the Skandhaka-s 
      of sects known to be Vibhajjavadin in affiliation than it is to the 
      Mulasarvastivadin Skandhaka. Elsewhere, Frauwallner has noted that the 
      Sarvastivadin Abhidharma contains much that &#39;was held in common with the 
      Pali school.&#39; [49] And the Śariputrabhidharma, which according to 
      Frauwallner is a Dharmaguptaka text, is also a development of the same 
      material inherited by the Sarvastivadin and Pali schools. [50] This is 
      again in contrast with the Abhidharma of the Mulasarvastivadins, which 
      according to Frauwallner &#39;possessed only one Matṛka.&#39; [51] The canonical 
      literature of the sect in the North-West that came to be known as the 
      Sarvastivadin-s is therefore closer to the Vibhajjavadin sects, 
      particularly the literature of the Pali tradition.</P>
      <P>It seems likely that all these sects share a common antecedent, which 
      we can think of as the ancient Sthavira community of Vidiśa. Nevertheless, 
      it is striking that only one of the sects produced by the missions adopted
      <I>sarvastivada </I>ideology, whereas the others seem to have been 
      affiliated to the <I>vibhajjavada</I>. I think the best explanation of the 
      evidence is that this <I>sarvastivadin </I>development must have occurred 
      later on within the community founded by Majjhantika in Kaśmir-Gandhara. 
      Originally, the Abhidharma literature of the missionary community was less 
      fixed than its Sutra and Vinaya sections. It allowed considerable room for 
      development. In Aśokan times the dogmatic outlook of the missionary 
      community was <I>vibhajjavada</I>, but at a later date, <I>sarvastivada
      </I>ideology came to dominate in Kaśmir. Incidentally, the 
      Mulasarvastivadin school, originally from Mathura according to 
      Frauwallner, came to exist in the North-West and claimed that it 
      originated from the mission of Madhyantika.[52] It is plausible to think 
      that this claim -- almost certainly an interpolation into the 
      Mulasarvastivadin Vinaya, as Frauwallner has shown -- was taken from the 
      old Sarvastivadin-s of the North-West, and used as part of the 
      Mulasarvastivadin strategy of claiming supremacy in the North-West. This 
      claim would only have been borrowed if it was thought to be true, so it 
      seems that yet another piece of evidence supports the accuracy of the 
      Theravadin tradition of the missions.</P>
      <P>The evidence for a Sthavira mission taking place in the third century 
      B.C., probably from a school that was <I>vibhajjavadin </I>in the dogmatic 
      sense, is very good. But was this mission related to Aśoka? Despite 
      Lamotte&#39;s doubts, I think that the Aśokan inscriptions show that this must 
      have been the case. The confusion on this point seems to have been caused 
      by a failure of previous scholars, especially Lamotte, to distinguish 
      Aśoka&#39;s references to his &#39;Dharma<I>-</I>ministers&#39; (<I>dhamma-mahamatta</I>) 
      from the evidence contained in the thirteenth Rock Edict. Lamotte&#39;s table 
      on the sources of the missions (p.302) sums up the evidence, presented on 
      the previous page, of the second Rock Edict, the fifth Rock Edict and the 
      thirteenth Rock Edict. But RE II has nothing to do with missionary 
      activity -- nor does RE V, which mentions the <I>dhamma-mahamatta</I>. In 
      fact every mention of the <I>dhamma-mahamatta </I>limits them to Aśoka&#39;s 
      Kingdom, and so they should have been, for according to the inscriptions 
      they were involved in all sorts of activities which might be called 
      &#39;social welfare&#39;, and which cannot have been carried out in other 
      kingdoms.[53] Socially beneficial activity in other kingdoms is mentioned 
      in RE II, which states that Aśoka provided medicines and medical herbs for 
      men and cattle, and had wells dug, [54] but this falls well short of the 
      activities of the <I>dhamma-mahamatta</I>. Whether or not Aśoka really 
      carried out such beneficial acts in neighbouring kingdoms -- it might have 
      been an exaggeration of his own righteous endeavours -- this activity can 
      hardly have been carried out by his <I>dhamma-mahamatta</I>. In the same 
      way, any missionary activity initiated by Aśoka cannot have been 
      undertaken by his <I>dhammamahamatta.</I> This brings us to RE XIII: Aśoka 
      tells us that he has achieved a &#39;Dharmavictory&#39; (<I>dhamma-vijaya</I>) in 
      his own kingdom as well as others, and even in places where his &#39;envoys&#39; (<I>duta-s</I>) 
      have not gone. [55] From this we can see that this victory must have been 
      achieved by his envoys -- <I>duta-s</I>, not <I>dhamma-mahamatta</I>. Who 
      were these envoys then, sent by Aśoka to the border areas of this kingdom, 
      as well as to neighbouring kingdoms, through which he attained his victory 
      of <I>dhamma</I>?</P>
      <P>The obvious answer is that they were the people responsible for taking 
      medicines and medicinal herbs to other Kingdoms, and for having wells dug 
      there, mentioned in RE II. Supporting this idea is the fact that the areas 
      outside Aśoka&#39;s Kingdom mentioned in RE XIII and RE II are almost 
      identical: in RE XIII the kingdoms mentioned are those of Aṃtiyoka, the 
      Yonaraja, and his four neighbours in the North-West, as well as the 
      Choḍa-s, Paṃda-s and Taṃbapaṇṇiya-s in the South; in RE II, the 
      Satiyaputra-s and Keraḍaputra-s are added to the list of southern 
      kingdoms, and the neighbours of Aṃtiyoka are not named. This is almost an 
      identical correspondence. Nevertheless, it is problematic think that the
      <I>duta-s </I>mentioned in RE XIII were merely carriers of medicines and 
      supervisors of well-digging. After all, Aśoka says that through them he 
      has achieved his <I>dhamma-vijaya</I>: can a &#39;Dharma-victory&#39; have been 
      achieved by the implementation of some social policies? In other words, 
      would socially beneficial acts undertaken by Aśoka in his kingdom and 
      elsewhere have induced him to claim that he had achieved a Dharma-victory? 
      One might think that this is possible, because the sort of <I>dhamma </I>
      promoted by the Dharma-ministers was exactly this sort of socially 
      beneficial action. But against this idea is the fact that in PE VII at 
      Delhi-Topra, the same sort of socially beneficial deeds are declared to be 
      &#39;of little consequence&#39;. For with various comforts have the people been 
      blessed both by former kings and by myself.&#39; [56] After this declaration, 
      Aśoka states that he has merely provided material needs so that the people 
      will conform to the practice of <I>dhamma</I>. [57] We have then a 
      distinction between Aśoka&#39;s ideal of <I>dhamma </I>and socially beneficial 
      policies which might be called <I>dhamma</I>. Which of the two meanings of
      <I>dhamma </I>did Aśoka mean by the word in the compound <I>dhammavijaya</I>? 
      I find it unlikely that Aśoka would have proclaimed a <I>dhamma-vijaya </I>
      because of his social policies, which in PE VII he claims are of little 
      value. It is much more likely that when Aśoka spoke of his <I>
      dhamma-vijaya</I>, he had in mind a victory of <I>dhamma </I>in its higher 
      meaning of a set of ethical practices and attitudes. In the Delhi-Topra 
      edict, this ideal of <I>dhamma </I>is outlined as follows:</P>
      <I>
      <P>- King Devanaṃpriyadarśin speaks thus:</P>
      <P>- Whatsoever good deeds have been performed by me, those the people 
      have imitated, and to those they are conforming. </P>
      <P>- Thereby they have made progress and will (be made to) progress in 
      obedience to mother and father, in obedience to elders, in courtesy to the 
      aged, in obedience to Brahmaṇas and Śramaṇas, to the poor and distressed, 
      (and) even to slaves and servants. </I>[58]</P>
      <P>This ideal of the <I>dhamma </I>is outlined in more or less the same 
      fashion by Aśoka in RE III, IV, IX, XI, and crucially, in RE XIII, the 
      edict in which he claims his <I>dhammavijaya</I>. [59] This &#39;victory&#39; was 
      the spread of ideals such as respect to <I>śramaṇa-s </I>and <I>brahmaṇa-s</I>, 
      obedience to mother and father, courtesy to slaves and servants etc. If 
      the envoys who took these ideals to the distant corners of Aśoka&#39;s kingdom 
      and beyond were not Dharma-ministers, who were they? Are we to believe 
      that Aśoka had a class of officials who went out and taught what are 
      essentially religious ideals? This is hardly likely. The more plausible 
      answer is that the <I>duta-s </I>included the professional religious men 
      and women to whom Aśoka was partial, i.e. the Buddhists. In other words, 
      it is likely that the envoys who spread Aśoka&#39;s ideals included Buddhist 
      monks and nuns. [60] There is even some indication in the Sinhalese 
      chronicles that is indeed what happened. In chapter XI, the Mahavaṃsa 
      describes how envoys were sent by Aśoka to King Devanaṃpiyatissa of Laṅka:</P>
      <I>
      <P>- The Lord of Men [Aśoka], having given a palm-leaf message (paṇ</I>ṇ<I>akaraṃ) 
      at the appropriate time for his friend [Devanaṃpiyatissa], sent envoys 
      (dute) and this palm-leaf message concerning the true doctrine 
      (saddhammapaṇṇakaraṃ), [which said:]</P>
      <P>- &quot;I have taken refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Saṅgha, I have 
      indicated that I am a lay disciple in the instruction of the Son of the 
      Sakya-s.&quot;</P>
      <P>- &quot;O Best of Men, you too, having satisfied your mind with faith, 
      should take refuge in these supreme jewels.&quot;</P>
      <P>- Saying: &quot;Carry out the consecration of my friend once more,&quot; having 
      honoured his friend&#39;s ministers, he despatched them</I>. [61]</P>
      <P>There is no mentions of Buddhist monks and nuns in the imperial embassy 
      of <I>duta-s</I>, but the implication is that if there were contacts such 
      as this between Aśoka and his neighbouring kings, then Buddhists must have 
      been involved, or would have followed soon afterwards. This is also 
      indicated by the Dipavaṃsa which, although including a standard account of 
      the missions sent by Moggaliputta (at VIII.4-13), also includes three 
      accounts of the <I>duta-s </I>sent to Laṅka by Aśoka, each account 
      describing how Mahinda arrived in Laṅka soon after the envoys, without any 
      mention of Moggaliputta. These accounts imply that the envoys paved the 
      way for the Buddhist monks who followed. In the most elaborate account, 
      Dip XII.8ff, after describing how Aśoka sent gifts and a request that 
      Devanaṃpiya of Laṅka should have faith in the triple jewel, it says that 
      the <I>thera-s </I>of the Asokarama requested that Mahinda establish the 
      faith in Laṅka. [62] And at Dip XI.41 and Dip XVII.91-92, it says that 
      Mahinda arrived in Laṅka one month after the Aśokan envoys, without any 
      mention of Moggaliputta. [63] It seems that the author of the Sinhalese 
      chronicles, as well as Buddhaghosa, had various sources available to them 
      recording different versions of the mission to Sri Lanka. [64]</P>
      <P>The version that eventually became the orthodox account was of course 
      the one that had Moggaliputta as the organiser of the missions. But the 
      accounts in the Dipavaṃsa that do not mention Moggaliputta seem much more 
      plausible in the light of the evidence from RE XIII. It is clear that some 
      of the information in the chronicles is accurate: the name of the 
      missionary monks, for instance, as the evidence at Saṭchi indicates. But 
      the Sthavira tradition from which the missions came could hardly have made 
      the monks merely part of Aśoka&#39;s ministerial envoys, or even following in 
      the wake of these envoys -- they probably felt that they had to exaggerate 
      the prominence of their tradition with the idea that Moggaliputta sent 
      them. [65] We can conclude that the imperial envoys (<I>duta-s</I>) of 
      Aśoka, which for him had effected a <I>dhamma-vijaya</I>, probably did 
      include Buddhist monks. By welcoming these envoys, and heeding Aśoka&#39;s 
      written requests that they take refuge in the triple jewel, the 
      neighbouring kings maintained good relations with the mighty Indian 
      emperor, and Aśoka himself propagated <I>dhamma</I>.[66]</P>
      <P>The result of this long digression into the evidence for the Aśokan 
      missions is that it appears that Frauwallner was correct to relate the 
      evidence of the Sinhalese chronicles and inscriptions of Vidiśa to Aśoka&#39;s 
      RE XIII. We can therefore date the arrival of the canonical texts in Sri 
      Lanka to the middle of the third century B.C. Frauwallner has shown, 
      however, that the lower limit of the early Buddhist literature can be 
      pushed back even further. He noted that the Mahasaṅghikas had a version of 
      the old <I>Skandhaka</I>, meaning that it must have been composed before 
      the schism between themselves and the Sthaviras, which certainly occurred 
      before the Aśokan missions. The Mahasaṅghika Vinaya also includes the 
      account of the second council at Vaiśali: the old <I>Skandhaka </I>must 
      have been composed, or at least redacted, after this council, and before 
      the schism between the Sthaviras and Mahasaṅghikas.[67] Frauwallner 
      thought that the old Skandhaka was probably composed shortly before or 
      after this council, [68] which Gombrich reckons that it took place about 
      60 years after the Buddha&#39;s death, c. 345 B.C. [69] If this is correct, it 
      means that very sophisticated literary tracts were being composed little 
      more than half a century after the Buddha&#39;s death.</P>
      <P>There is great significance in these investigations for the date of 
      texts contained in the Suttapiṭaka. According to Frauwallner:</P>
      <I>
      <P>At the time of the compilation of the old Skandhaka work ...</I>[70] <I>
      the Buddhist tradition had already reached an advanced stage of 
      development. A collection of sacred scriptures, including Dharma and 
      Vinaya, was already in existence. The Vinaya included the Praṭimokṣa, 
      narratives of the type of the Vibhaṅga and much material on the monastic 
      rules, which the Buddha was said to have communicated to his disciples. 
      The collection of Sutra, which existed on its side, was handed down by a 
      regular machinery of transmission, and we can ascertain a number of texts 
      which belonged to it already in that period. </I>[71]</P>
      <P>One Sutra text which Frauwallner singles out is the <I>Aṭṭhakavagga </I>
      (Sn IV), for the same story mentioning it is preserved in all the extant 
      Vinayas; it probably belonged to the old Sutra collection. It is therefore 
      possible that much of what is found in the Suttapiṭaka is earlier than 
      c.250 B.C., perhaps even more than 100 years older than this. If some of 
      the material is so old, it might be possible to establish what texts go 
      back to the very beginning of Buddhism, texts which perhaps include the 
      substance of the Buddha&#39;s teaching, and in some cases, maybe even his 
      words. I have no intention of going into the important but complex 
      question of what the Buddha did or did not teach. In the following, I will 
      address the two questions posed on p.3, but I will at least attempt to 
      show that some of the details of the Buddha&#39;s biography, namely those 
      which record some of his activities as a Bodhisatta, have recorded 
      accurate historical information about events that happened in the fifth 
      century B.C. This will show that a careful use of textual sources is the 
      only way to know anything about Buddhism in the pre-Aśokan period, and 
      will lead to the conclusions that, contrary to what Schopen thinks, some 
      material in the Suttapiṭaka is historically accurate and extremely old.</P>
      <P>Various Suttas describe the Buddha&#39;s visits to the sages Aḷara Kalama 
      and Uddaka Ramaputta, although the source for the account is probably the
      <I>Ariyapariyesana Sutta </I>(APS, M no.26). [72] Andre Bareau has 
      translated a Chinese Sutra that corresponds to the APS as well as an 
      account found in the Chinese version of the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya.[73] 
      There are also versions of the narrative in the Mahasaṅghika Mahavastu 
      [74] and the Mulasarvastivadin Saṅghabhedavastu.[75] It seems that the 
      account of the training under the two teachers was embedded in the 
      pre-sectarian Buddhist tradition, that is, if one accepts the idea that 
      corresponding parts of the sectarian literature are likely to be 
      pre-sectarian. There is also material on the two teachers scattered 
      throughout the Suttapiṭaka. Scholars have generally accepted Bareau&#39;s 
      opinion that the tradition of the two teachers&#39; instruction to the 
      Bodhisatta was a fabrication,[76] but more recently, Zafiropulo has shown 
      that Bareau&#39;s arguments are fallacious.[77] If we are to take the 
      tradition seriously, as we must do in the light of Zafiropulo&#39;s comments, 
      we must also take into consideration the fragmentary information about the 
      two teachers that is scattered throughout the Suttapiṭaka. I hope to show 
      that a re-evaluation of the data on the two teachers makes two things 
      quite clear. Firstly, some of the information on the two teachers cannot 
      have been shared at a later date -- it must reflect a presectarian 
      tradition. And secondly, a peculiar detail in the account of the 
      Bodhisatta&#39;s training under the teachers shows that the two men must have 
      existed. They must have been teachers of some repute in the fifth century 
      B.C. in northern India, teachers of meditation who probably taught the 
      Bodhisatta.</P>
      <P>To show the former point, I will consider the information found in 
      various sources concerning the location of Uddaka Ramaputta. Hsṃan tsang 
      mentions some legendary evidence that relates Udraka Ramaputta to 
      Rajagṛha; it seems that this represents the local tradition of the 
      Buddhists living in the area of Rajagṛha.[78] This tradition is confirmed 
      by the account of the Bodhisatta&#39;s training in the Mahavastu, which also 
      places Udraka Ramaputra in Rajagṛha.[79] The coincidence between these two 
      sources might have been reached in the sectarian period. There is, 
      however, similar evidence in the Suttapiṭaka which makes it almost certain 
      that the tradition must be presectarian. In the <I>Vassakara Sutta</I>, 
      the Brahmin Vassakara, chief minister of Magadha, is said to visit the 
      Buddha in Rajagaha and tell him that the <I>raja </I>Eḷeyya has faith in 
      the <I>samaṇa </I>Ramaputta; the commentary names him as Uddaka 
      Ramaputta.[80] Vassakara also appears in the <I>Mahaparinibbana Sutta </I>
      as the chief minister of King Ajatasattu of Magadha.[81] Vassakara&#39;s 
      connection with Rajagaha and Magadha suggest that the <I>raja </I>Eḷeyya<I>
      </I>was a local chieftain in Magadha, probably situated somewhere near to 
      Rajagaha. If so, it is likely that Uddaka Ramaputta was situated in the 
      vicinity of Rajagaha. </P>
      <P>The coincidence of this different evidence from the Theravadin and 
      Mahasaṅghika sources, as well as the information of Hsṃan tsang, is not to 
      be overlooked. It is inconceivable that this correspondence was produced 
      by a later leveling of texts, for it is entirely coincidental -- different 
      source materials, not corresponding Suttas, state or imply the same thing. 
      It is hardly likely that a Mahasaṅghika monk or nun gained knowledge of 
      obscure Pali Suttas, from which he deduced that Uddaka Ramaputta must have 
      been based in Rajagaha, and after which he managed to insert this piece of 
      information into the biographical account in the Mahavastu. And it is even 
      more unlikely that a Theravadin Buddhist, in the early centuries A.D., 
      studied the Mahasaṅghika Vinaya, from which he learnt that Udraka 
      Ramaputra was based in Rajagṛha, following which he fabricated Suttas 
      which contained circumstantial evidence which indirectly related Ramaputta 
      to Rajagaha. Anyone who believes this version of textual history is living 
      in cloud-cuckooland. It is clear that the information on the geographical 
      situation of Uddaka Ramaputta must precede the Aśokan missions, and even 
      the schism between Sthavira-s and Mahasaṅghika-s. This implies that the 
      biographical tradition of the training under the two teachers goes back to 
      the very beginning of Buddhism. It surely means that accurate historical 
      information has been preserved, and suggests that Uddaka Ramaputta was 
      based in Rajagaha, no doubt as a famous sage of Magadha. Incidentally, it 
      is clear that this material has no normative value whatsoever, and so 
      rebuts Schopen&#39;s claim that &#39;even the most artless formal narrative text&#39; 
      has a normative agenda.</P>
      <P>Another detail, found in almost all the sectarian accounts of the 
      training under the two teachers, can hardly have been produced by a later 
      leveling of the Buddhist literature; it occurs in the account of the 
      training under Uddaka Ramaputta. This account is identical in almost all 
      regards to the description of the training under Aḷara Kalama. It tells us 
      that the Bodhisatta first of all mastered the teaching, i.e. he gained an 
      intellectual understanding of it,[82] after which he attained the direct 
      realisation of the sphere of &#39;neither perception nor non-perception&#39; 
      through understanding (<I>abhiṭṭa</I>).[83] But the account of the 
      training under Uddaka Ramaputta makes it clear that it was not Uddaka 
      Ramaputta who had attained the sphere of neither perception nor 
      non-perception, but Rama, the father or spiritual teacher of Uddaka.[84] 
      This is seen in the following exchange. The Bodhisatta is said to have 
      contemplated that Rama (not Ramaputta) did not proclaim (<I>pavedesi</I>) 
      his attainment through mere faith, but because he dwelt (<I>vihasi</I>) 
      knowing and seeing himself.[85] The corresponding passage in the account 
      of the training under Aḷara uses the same verbs in the present tense (<I>pavedeti</I>,
      <I>viharati</I>), indicating that Aḷara was living and Rama was dead, and 
      that Ramaputta had not attained and realised the <I>dhamma </I>he taught.</P>
      <P>The same phenomenon is found in the rest of the passage. Thus the 
      Bodhisatta is said to have asked Ramaputta: &#39;The venerable Rama proclaimed 
      (<I>pavedesi</I>) [his attainment], having himself realised this <I>dhamma
      </I>to what extent (<I>kittavata</I>)?&#39; [86] The reply, of course, is as 
      far as <I>nevasaṭṭanasaṭṭayatana</I>. The Bodhisatta is then said to have 
      contemplated that not only did Rama have faith, energy, mindfulness, 
      concentration and insight, but that he too possesses these virtues. And at 
      the end of the episode, Uddaka Ramaputta is reported to have said: &#39;Thus 
      the <I>dhamma </I>that Rama knew (<I>aṭṭasi</I>), that <I>dhamma </I>you 
      [the Bodhisatta] know; the <I>dhamma </I>you know, that <I>dhamma </I>Rama 
      knew.&#39; [87] This is different from the corresponding speech that Aḷara is 
      reported to have made to the Bodhisatta: &#39;Thus the <I>dhamma </I>I know (<I>janami</I>), 
      that <I>dhamma </I>you know; the <I>dhamma </I>you know, that I know.&#39; 
      [88] And whereas Aḷara is willing to establish the Bodhisatta as an equal 
      to him (<I>samasamaṃ</I>), so that they can lead the ascetic group 
      together (<I>imaṃ</I> <I>gaṇaṃ</I> <I>pariharama ti</I>),[89] Uddaka 
      acknowledges that the Bodhisatta is equal to Rama, not himself (<I>iti 
      yadiso ramo ahosi tadiso tuvaṃ</I>), and asks the Buddha to lead the 
      community alone (<I>imaṃ</I> <I>gaṇaṃ</I> <I>parihara ti</I>).[90]</P>
      <P>The distinction between Uddaka Ramaputta and Rama is also found in the 
      Sarvastivadin, Dharmaguptaka, and Mahasaṅghika accounts of the 
      Bodhisattva&#39;s training.[91] Although the Saṅghabhedavastu (plus parallel 
      Tibetan translations) and the Lalitavistara fail to distinguish Ramaputta 
      from Rama,[92] this must be because of a later obfuscation of the 
      tradition. Exactly the same mistake has been made by I. B. Horner, the PTS 
      translator of the Majjhima Nikaya, who has been duped, by the repetitive 
      oral style, into believing that the accounts of the training under Aḷara 
      and Uddaka must be the same apart from the difference between the names of 
      the two men and their meditative attainments.[93]</P>
      <P>It hardly needs to be pointed out that there is no need to trouble over 
      these details in an oral tradition where adjacent passages are often 
      composed in exactly the same way, one passage frequently being a verbatim 
      repetition of the previous one with a minor change of one or two words. 
      The tendency for reciters of this autobiographical episode would have been 
      to make the two accounts identical bar the substitution of Uddaka&#39;s name 
      for Aḷara&#39;s. A conscious effort has been made to distinguish Uddaka 
      Ramaputta from Rama, and not to let the repetitive oral style interfere 
      with this. This effort must surely go back to the beginning of the 
      pre-sectarian tradition of composing biographical Suttas, and the 
      distinction can only be explained if Rama and Ramaputta were two different 
      people. Otherwise, it is part of an elaborate hoax, and there is no reason 
      for such a hoax.</P>
      <P>Bareau maintained that the correspondence between the two descriptions 
      of the training under each of the teachers proved their artificial (i.e. 
      unhistorical) nature.[94] But repetition is normal in Pali oral 
      literature. And it seems that the two parallel accounts, having preserved 
      the important distinction between Ramaputta and Rama, rather than leaving 
      an impression of &#39;contrivance&#39;, have preserved valuable historical 
      information. The conclusion is that the three men were real.[95] It is 
      hardly likely that Buddhists got together a few hundred years after the 
      Buddha&#39;s death and decided to make up the idea that Rama and not Ramaputta 
      had attained the state of neither perception nor non- perception, and then 
      had such an influence that the idea found its way into recensions of texts 
      being made in regions as far apart as central Asia and Sri Lanka. The idea 
      must have been in the Buddhist tradition from the beginning, and can only 
      be explained as an attempt to remember an historical fact. There is no 
      other sensible explanation. It is also worth pointing out that if this 
      biographical material is so old and really does represent an attempt to 
      record historical facts, then it means that this portion of the 
      Bodhisatta&#39;s biography is most likely to be true. It is likely that the 
      Bodhisatta really was taught by Aḷara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta.</P>

      <P>Conclusion</P>
      </B></FONT><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="6">
      <P>A</FONT><FONT FACE="VU Times">t the beginning of this paper, I argued 
      that no matter how necessary the epigraphical and archaeological evidence 
      is, it has its own limitations, a fact which ought not to be overlooked by 
      exaggerating its worth at the expense of the literary evidence. I 
      attempted to demonstrate this by pointing out what seem to me to be a few 
      flaws in the work of Gregory Schopen, a scholar who pursues exactly this 
      line of thought. I argued that some of the epigraphical sources cited by 
      him show that the Pali Canon must have been closed at a relatively early 
      date. After that, I considered the arguments put forward by Frauwallner 
      and others about the tradition that there was an expansion of Buddhism 
      during Aśoka&#39;s reign. I argued that Lamotte conflated the evidence of RE 
      XIII with that of RE II and V, and confused the activity of the <I>
      dhamma-mahamatta </I>with activity of Aśoka&#39;s envoys (<I>duta-s</I>) 
      mentioned in RE XIII. After reconsidering the evidence of RE XIII, and the 
      evidence from the eleventh chapter of the Mahavaṃsa, I concluded that the 
      tradition of the Buddhist missions in Aśoka&#39;s time is relatively accurate. 
      This means that much of the material in the Pali Canon, especially the 
      Sutta and Vinaya portions, reached Sri Lanka at around 250 B.C. </P>
      <P>And finally, I attempted to show that some of the information preserved 
      in the literature of the various Buddhist sects shows that historical 
      information about events occurring in the fifth century B.C. has been 
      accurately preserved. The corresponding pieces of textual material found 
      in the canons of the different sects (especially the literature of the 
      Pali school, which was more isolated than the others) probably go back to 
      pre-sectarian times. It is unlikely that these correspondences could have 
      been produced by an endeavour undertaken in the sectarian period, for such 
      an endeavour would have required organisation on a scale which was simply 
      inconceivable in the ancient world. We can conclude that a careful 
      examination of the early Buddhist literature can reveal aspects of the 
      pre-Aśokan history of Indian Buddhism. The claim that we cannot know 
      anything about early Indian Buddhism because all the manuscripts are late 
      is vacuous, and made, I assume, by those who have not studied the textual 
      material properly.</P>

      </B></FONT><FONT FACE="VU Times" SIZE="6">
      <P>T</FONT><FONT FACE="VU Times">he name &#39;Mulasarvastivadin&#39; is most 
      peculiar -- as far as I know, no other Buddhist sects in India sect 
      prefixed the word <I>mula- </I>to their sect name. There were no 
      &#39;Mula-Dharmaguptaka-s&#39; or &#39;Mula-pudgalavadin-s&#39;, for example. It is hard 
      to explain why any community would have prefixed the word <I>mula </I>to 
      their sect name: it seems to me that this peculiarity can only have arisen 
      in the context of a sectarian debate, for which there are only two 
      possible scenarios. Either the two communities were originally unrelated: 
      one community who accepted <I>sarvastivada </I>ideas, and who were 
      probably known as &#39;Sarvastivadin-s&#39;, had an argument with another 
      Sarvastivadin group. Prefixing the word <I>mula- </I>to their sect name by 
      one of the groups would have been part of a strategy of claiming that 
      their community was the real source of <I>sarvastivada </I>ideology, part 
      of their argument that they were the original or &#39;root&#39; Sarvastivadin-s. 
      Alternatively, the Mulasarvastivadin-s were an offshoot from the 
      Sarvastivadin-s, a sort of reforming group who used the prefix <I>mula-
      </I>for the same reason.</P>
      <P>Étienne Lamotte, however, proposed a different solution: he dismissed 
      Frauwallner&#39;s theory about the difference between Sarvastivadin and 
      Mulasarvastivadin, by claiming, without presenting any corroborating 
      evidence, that the Mulasarvastivadin Vinaya was simply the version of the 
      Sarvastivadin Vinaya completed at a later date in Kaśmir (p.178). This 
      explanation, however, leaves too many questions unanswered. For example, 
      if the Mulasarvastivadin Vinaya was a later recension of an earlier 
      Sarvastivadin Vinaya, then why is it so different? And why did the sect 
      who revised the work change their name from Sarvastivadin to 
      &#39;Mulasarvastivadin&#39;? The only answer to the last objection to Lamotte&#39;s 
      thesis is that the name was changed to &#39;Mulasarvastivadin&#39; by the 
      reforming sect who expanded the old Sarvastivadin Vinaya, and who thus 
      used the prefix <I>mula </I>in order to differentiate themselves from the 
      old Sarvastivadin-s and create a new sect, i.e. an explanation which 
      corresponds to the second of my proposed solutions above. But there is no 
      clear evidence for the theory that the Mulasarvastivadin Vinaya is an 
      expansion of the Sarvastivadin Vinaya and that the Mulasarvastivadin-s 
      were an offshoot of the Sarvastivadin-s.[96] </P>
      <P>We must therefore look for a different answer to the problem, an answer 
      along the lines of my proposed first solution above, i.e. that two 
      Sarvastivadin groups came into contact and had a dispute. Such an 
      explanation would simply be a reworking of Frauwallner&#39;s hypothesis -- he 
      proposed two different communitites, one from Kaśmir and one from Mathura, 
      both of whom came to accept <I>sarvastivadin </I>ideas, but he did not 
      state that they had a dispute.[97] I am proposing that the Mathura school 
      moved to Kaśmir and disputed with the existing community there, and I 
      think we can detect such a dispute in the Chinese works mentioned by 
      Lamotte pp.174- 75. First of all, however, I will show that these works 
      cited by Lamotte support Frauwallner&#39;s theory.</P>
      <P>Lamotte did not offer any explanation of the peculiar fact that 
      Kumarajiva, the fifth century translator of the <I>
      Mahaprajṭaparamitopadeśa</I>, knew of the existence of two different 
      Vinaya-s, one from Mathura and one from Kaśmir. According to Kumarajiva, 
      the Vinaya of Kaśmir contained 10 sections, and we can deduce that this 
      was the Sarvastivadin Vinaya, for he was himself from Kaśmir and 
      translated the Sarvastivadin Vinaya into Chinese in 404-05 A.D. (Lamotte 
      p.168). Moreover, the Sarvastivadin Vinaya was also known as the &#39;Vinaya 
      in ten sections&#39; (<I>Daśadhyaya</I>, Lamotte p.168). This means that it is 
      likely that what he calls the Vinaya of Mathura in 80 sections was the 
      Mulasarvastivadin Vinaya, that is, if the information of Kumarajiva and 
      the two other Chinese authors mentioned by Lamotte (p.175) definitely 
      concerns the Sarvastivadin and Mulasarvastivadin traditions of Kaśmir in 
      the fifth century A.D. All three Chinese works mentioned by Lamotte 
      (pp.174-75) knew that the original Vinaya (of Upali/Kaśyapa) consisted of 
      80 sections. Sêng yu and Hui Chao related this Vinaya to the patriarchal 
      lineage ending in Upagupta, the fifth patriarch of the Buddhist community 
      of Mathura.[98] Kumarajiva went further and stated that the Vinaya in 80 
      sections was that of the community in Mathura. So we have good reasons to 
      suppose that two Vinaya-s -- and therefore two monastic communities, in 
      some way similar -- were known in Kaśmir, and that one had come from 
      Mathura. Lamotte&#39;s theory simply brushes over this fact, whereas 
      Frauwallner adduces good evidence to show that the Mulasarvastivadin 
      sect&#39;s connection with Kaśmir is late, and written onto an earlier church 
      history of Mathura (1956 pp.26-36).</P>
      <P>The dispute between the adherents of these two Vinaya-s is just about 
      detectable in the words of Kumarajiva and Sêng yu. Kumarajiva, taught in 
      the tradition of the Sarvastivadin Vinaya, tells us that the Vinaya of 
      Kaśmir (i.e. the Sarvastivadin Vinaya) had only ten sections, but that it 
      also had a Vibhaùa consisting of 80 sections. Why did he do this? Why did 
      he state that the Vinaya has a commentary consisting of 80 sections? It 
      might be a redundant statement, but I think that the evidence suggests 
      otherwise. From his words (Lamotte p.174), it seems that he was aware of 
      the claim that the original Vinaya consisted of 80 sections. He was also 
      aware of the fact that the Vinaya of Mathura, probably the Vinaya of a 
      very old Buddhist community, consisted of 80 sections. Surely his 
      statement is that of an apologist, forced into making it because there 
      were others who criticised the Sarvastivadin Vinaya of Kaśmir for lacking 
      the full 80 sections.</P>
      <P>We can see the nature of such a critique in Sêng yu&#39;s <I>Ch&#39;u san tsang 
      chi chi</I>: he states that the Vinaya with 10 sections was a reduction of 
      the Vinaya in 80 sections, undertaken by Upagupta for the sake of those 
      with &#39;weak faculties&#39;. Sêng yu is blatantly polemical, arguing against the 
      worth of the Sarvastivadin tradition. Thus, Kumarajiva stated that there 
      is nothing amiss with the fact that one Vinaya (his Vinaya) had only 10 
      sections, whereas Sêng yu said that there was something deficient in it -- 
      it was an offshoot of the Vinaya in 80 sections for those with a weaker 
      disposition. Kumarajiva was the apologist, asserting the antiquity of his 
      Kaśmirian Vinaya in the face of a rival, whereas Sêng yu was the 
      inclusivist, attempting to include the Vinaya of Kaśmir and its tradition 
      within the tradition of Mathura. It seems that in fifth century Kaśmir, 
      there was some quarrel between the adherents of two different communities 
      -- one original to Kaśmir, which defended its position, and the other more 
      recently arrived community which arguing that the Kaśmir tradition was an 
      offshoot of itself.</P>
      <P>Why would two groups have clashed in this way? Surely there would have 
      been no need for one community, when moving to another area, to attempt to 
      usurp the position of the resident community. I suggest that everything 
      makes sense if we accept that the disputed issue concerned the ownership 
      of the <I>sarvastivada </I>idea: one group accepting <I>sarvastivada </I>
      ideas had moved from Mathura to Kaśmir, and there encountered another 
      community which at some point adopted a similar <I>sarvastivada </I>
      ideology. In response to this, and considering itself to be the original 
      source of the <I>sarvastivada</I>, it labelled itself the 
      &#39;Mulasarvastivada&#39;. If this argument, which I claim can be detected in the 
      words of Kumarajiva and Sêng yu, was still fresh in the fifth century 
      A.D., then it seems that the dispute broke out some time after the two 
      groups had co-existed in the same area: Frauwallner noted that 
      interpolations into the Mulasarvastivadin Bhaisajyavastu (indicating a 
      relocation from Mathura to the North West) were probably made between 
      c.150-300 A.D.[99] Therefore, we can posit a period in which <I>
      sarvastivada </I>ideas circulated between the two groups. But it is more 
      likely that the sect to whom the idea belonged at the beginning of this 
      contact was the sect from Mathura: the mission that led to the origination 
      of Majjhantika&#39;s community in Kaśmir/Gandhara was probably <I>
      vibhajjavadin </I>in the early period, and we can guess, from the name of 
      the sect itself, as well as from Sêng yu&#39;s aggressive stance and 
      Kumarajiva&#39;s seemingly defensive position, that the Mulasarvastivadin 
      community was more irked by the dispute. All this is of course highly 
      speculative, but if we are to explain the Mulasarvastivadin/Savastivadin 
      distinction as the result of sectarian dispute, then some explanation must 
      be found.</P>
      <P>It seems to me as if the Chinese works mentioned by Lamotte support 
      Frauwallner&#39;s theory and the reworking of it I suggest here. At the least, 
      they show that there was a problem in the Buddhist traditions of Kaśmir 
      concerning two different Vinaya-s, whereas Lamotte failed even to notice 
      that this is a historical problem; Frauwallner&#39;s theory seems to be the 
      best explanation of the evidence. More recently, Enomoto has recently 
      argued that the Sarvastivadin sect was no different from the 
      Mulasarvastivadin -- he argues that the two words mean the same thing, but 
      this does not explain the odd facts: two different Vinaya-s, two similar 
      names, and two explanations of their relationship in fifth century Chinese 
      works. However, Enomoto&#39;s argument is flawed: it begins with the late and 
      unreliable evidence of the fanciful etymology of the word <I>
      mulasarvastivadin </I>in Śakyaprabha&#39;s <I>Prabhavati </I>(c.8th century), 
      as well as equally unreliable evidence in the colophons of this work and 
      others by Śakyaprabha -- all are inconsistent in the use of the prefix <I>
      mula-</I>.[100] He then attempts to show that Yi-jing used the words 
      Sarvastivada and Mulasarvastivada interchangeably.[101] But it seems to me 
      that the section of Yi-jing translated by him does not support such a 
      view. The important section reads:</P>
      <I>
      <P>What are treated in this work </I>[102] <I>mostly resemble the 
      Shi-song-lu. The three different sects divided from the Sarvastivada sect 
      -- 1. Dharmaguptaka; 2. Mahiśasaka; 3. Kaśyapiya -- are not prevalent in 
      the five parts of India... However, the Shi-song-lṃ does not belong to the 
      &#39;Mula-sarvastivada&#39; sect, either.</I>[103]</P>
      <P>The proximity of the title <I>Shi-song-lu </I>and the Sarvastivada sect 
      in sentences one and two suggest that the former is the work of the 
      latter, and from the last sentence, we know that this was not a work of 
      the Mulasarvastivada sect. The translation of Enomoto certainly does not 
      say that &quot;the &#39;Mulasarvastivada&#39; sect was divided into four sects: 
      Dharmaguptaka, Mahiśasaka, Kaśyapiya and &#39;Mulasarvastivada&#39; itself&quot;, or 
      that &quot;what is here called the &#39;Sarvastivada&#39; sect is the same as the 
      Mulasarvastivada sect.&quot;[104] On the contrary, it relates sects which, I 
      have argued, originated from the same missionary endeavour, and 
      distinguishes them from the Mulasarvastivadin-s. Enomoto&#39;s theory does not 
      make sense and it does not explain the difficulties. It seems then that 
      Frauwallner&#39;s explanation of the difference between Sarvastivadin and 
      Mulasarvastivadin explains most of the facts while leaving fewer 
      unresolved problems. Some of the remaining problems I have attempted to 
      solve by showing that the name &#39;Mulasarvastivadin&#39; originated in the 
      course of sectarian debate, and this seems to offer the best explanation 
      of the various facts.</P>

      died 136 years before Aśoka&#39;s inauguration, which means in 404 B.C.&#39; (1992 
      p.246). Gombrich estimates the margin of error to be 7 years before to 5 
      years after this date, i.e. 411-399 B.C. (p.244). But he also notes that 
      uncertainty about the date of Aśoka widens the margin of error, making the 
      upper limit 422 B.C. K.R. Norman comments: &#39;If we take an average, then

      his thought on the dogmatic affiliation of all the sects resulting from 
      the missions.</P>

      <P>[51] Frauwallner 1956 p.39.</P>
      <P>[52] Frauwallner 1956, pp.26-31, especially p.31: &#39;We come thus to the 
      conclusion that the episode of Madhyantika and of the conversion of Kaśmir 
      represents a late interpolation in the Vinaya of the Mulasarvastivadin.&#39; 
      In the light of Frauwallner&#39;s work, the Sarvastivada inscriptions of 
      Mathura mentioned by Lamotte, p.523, might be those of the school that in 
      the North-West came to be known as the Mulasarvastivadin-s. See the 
      appendix for a further consideration of the 
      Sarvastivadin/Mulasarvastivadin issue.</P>
      <P>[53] They are mentioned in RE V, RE XII and PE VII; it would have been 
      beyond the jurisdiction of a visitor to another kingdom to carry out some 
      of these duties. ś</P>

      <P>[59] In RE XIII, the crucial passage outlining his <I>dhamma </I>is 
      found in section G, Hultzsch p.67/208.</P>
      <P>[60] Erich Frauwallner related the Buddhist missions to Aśoka precisely 
      because of the reference to <I>duta-s </I>in RE XIII (1956 p.15 n.1). He 
      did not mention the evidence in the chronicles for the <I>duta-s </I>of 
      Aśoka, however.</P>

      <P>[64] As Norman points out (1983 p.118).</P>
      <P>[65] Although there is every possibility that Mogalliputta, thera of 
      the Asokarama, aided Aśoka in organising the missions.</P>
      <P>[66] On the idea that Moggaliputta sent out the missions, Frauwallner 
      states: &#39;...we must remember that the data of the Sinhalese chronicles are 
      uncertain on this point.&#39; (1956 p.17). He concludes: &#39;The mother community 
      tried apparently to enhance the glory of its patriarch by putting on his 
      merit the sending out of the missions.&#39; (1956 p.18).</P>
      <P>[67] Frauwallner 1956 p.54.</P>
      <P>[68] Frauwallner 1956 p.67: &#39;It must have been composed shortly before 
      or after the second council&#39;.</P>
      <P>[69] Gombrich 1992 p. 258: &#39;We may thus date the Second Council round 
      60 A.B. or round 345 B.C.; the dates are very approximate and the precise 
      margin of error incalculable...&#39;.</P>
      <P>[70] At this point Frauwallner dates the old Skandhaka according to 
      older views about the date of the second council, c.100 years after the 
      Buddha&#39;s death. More recent research has modified this date somewhat; I 
      follow Gombrich&#39;s date of c.345 B.C. for the second council.</P>

      <P>[76] Vetter p.xxii, Bronkhorst p.86; Bareau sums up his view as

      deux mystérieux personnages et l&#39;on en déduisit aisément qu&#39;ils n&#39;avaient

      <P>I leave <I>dhammaṃ</I> untranslated here because it indicates the

      Buddha is said to have mastered the <I>dhamma </I>intellectually (165.24 = 
      164.4-5; see n.68), which can hardly mean a meditative attainment and must

      <P>[93] Horner pp.209-10. Jones (p.117), translator of the Mahavastu, 
      preserves the distinction between Rama and Ramaputra, but fails to notice 
      that in the Mahavastu, Ramaputra does not establish the Bodhisattva as an 
      equal to him: it says that he established the Bodhisattva as the teacher 
      (Mhv II 120.15: <I>acaryasthane sthapaye</I>). Jones translates: &#39;Udraka 
      Ramaputra ... would make me a teacher on an equal footing with himself&#39; 
      (p.117).</P>
      <P>[94] Bareau p.20: &#39;Mais le parallélisme avec l&#39;épisode suivant, l&#39;ordre 
      trop logique et le choix trop rationnel des points de doctrine d&#39;Aḷara 
      Kalama et d&#39;Udraka Ramaputra nous laissent un arrière-goût d&#39;artifice qui 
      nous rend ces récits suspects.&#39;</P>
      <P>[95] Zafiropulo (p.25) does not point out the difference between Rama 
      and Ramaputta, but on the stereotyped description of the training under 
      the two teachers he comments: &#39;Justement cela nous semblerait plutôt un 
      signe d&#39;ancienneté, caractéristique de la transmission orale primitive par 
      récitations psalmodiées&#39;.</P>
      <P>[96] According to Frauwallner, &#39;the Vinaya of the Sarvastivadin largely 
      agrees with the Vinaya of the other missionary schools and forms with them 
      a close group, while the Vinaya of the Mulasarvastivadin shows 
      considerable differences.&#39; (1956 p.38).</P>
      <P>[97] Frauwallner 1956 p.40: &#39;They were at first two independent 
      communities of different origin... Later on both communities grew into one 
      school throught their accepting of the theories of the 
      philosophicaldogmatic school; but they never completlely lost their 
      individualities.&#39;</P>
