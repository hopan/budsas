    <blockquote>
        <h4>On March 29-31, 1996, Sister Siripannà, from the
        Amaravati monastic community in England, assisted by
        Sister Thaniyà, offered a weekend program at the Barre
        Center for Buddhist Studies entitled &quot;Renunciation:
        The Highest Happiness.&quot; These are just a few
        excerpts from that rich and diverse program. </h4>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I once saw a cartoon strip about a little character called
    Hagar the Horrible. It really summed up for me what so many
    people seem to feel about the theme of renunciation. Hagar is
    climbing a very steep mountain, and in the first frame you
    see him going up, laboring away. In the second frame you see
    this very wise-looking sage with a long white beard sitting
    on the top of this mountain. And Hagar says to him &quot;Oh
    great sage, please teach me the secret of happiness.&quot; In
    the third frame, the sage says, &quot;Simplicity,
    self-restraint, renunciation.&quot; And in the fourth frame
    you can see Hagar pausing, and saying &quot;Is there anyone
    else up here I can speak to?&quot; In a way, I think that
    says it all, doesn't it? </p>
    <p>When we find out what the spiritual path involves it
    sounds to our worldly mind like a deprivation. There is a
    part of us that feels renunciation means to lose everything
    we love; having to deprive ourselves of what is pleasant and
    enjoyable in life. This is understandable, for this is really
    the only way that the worldly mind can conceive of letting go
    of seeking fulfillment in pleasant experience.</p>
    <p>Yet I'm sure that within all of you there is also
    something else, something beyond that mind that is always
    wanting and craving and trying to hold on to our identity and
    experiences, that recognizes and resonates to this word
    renunciation. Whenever I've talked about this theme with
    other people, often they say that although the word horrifies
    them in a way, there is also a fascination, an echo of
    something we intuitively long for. This is the aspect of
    renunciation that I hope to tap into as we explore this very
    deep theme. As the contemporary Indian thinker Raimundo
    Panikkar says, &quot;Not everyone has the inclination to take
    up the vocation of monasticism, but all of us have some part
    of us which is a monk or a nun; and that should be
    cultivated.&quot; So as we consider these teachings and
    reflections that speak to that part of all of us which is a
    monk or a nun, it is not necessarily something that involves
    having a shaved head or wearing a robe. It is an attitude, a
    way of approaching life, which essentially boils down to
    giving up seeking our fulfillment from the experiences of our
    life, of needing them to have a particular quality, and
    giving our energy instead to understanding experience itself.
    </p>
    <p>When we understand this, we can start to glimpse that
    renunciation is not a matter of doing something or having to
    create something, or getting rid of something or
    exterminating something in life. Rather it is moving towards
    non-contention, a sense of rest and relaxation -- not having
    constantly to try and manipulate and control and evade and
    maneuver any more. We are able to open in a fearless way and
    relax into the experience of the moment, whatever its quality
    may be. In opening to receive life, we still engage in the
    conventional level of reality -- the social level of moral
    values, identities, mother and father, livelihood and
    mortgages. If we grasp these things and expect complete
    fulfillment from them, we will always be disappointed. But if
    we see our life as an opportunity to understand Dhamma -- the
    way things are -- that is renunciation. This letting go is
    very freeing. Whatever comes to us is Dhamma, and there is a
    joy in being in contact with Truth, whatever its particular
    flavor. Renunciation can sound like passivity, a &quot;door
    mat&quot; philosophy, but actually it is the opposite. True
    response-ability -- the ability to respond wisely and
    compassionately to life -- naturally arises in the
    non-attached mind. There can be both activity and letting go.
    </p>
    <p>The theme of renunciation is not very widely talked about,
    and even less widely understood. Obviously one cannot come to
    a complete understanding of such a topic in one weekend -- it
    is really a lifetime's endeavor for each of us. But we may be
    able to give you some meaningful food for thought, some
    building materials that you can take away with you. At the
    Amaravati monastery we have quite a lot of study groups, and
    we have quite a lot of familiarity with the Buddhist
    scriptures. But our investigation of the tradition is always
    coming from a very experiential point of view, which
    interests us far more than scholarship for its own sake. My
    own study has always been of the heart. We are always
    encouraged to talk about our own experience and our own
    practice. It seems to me that's really the only way that it's
    worth using the teachings -- that is what the Buddha offered
    them for. He was always encouraging people to think for
    themselves and to develop their own understanding. It is from
    this perspective that I draw your attention to certain texts
    and quotations from the Buddhist tradition. Reading the text
    is actually only a small part of the enterprise of study --
    it is far more important to try and understand for yourself
    what the Buddha is saying, and to try to bring this
    understanding alive in your lives. </p>
    <p>The Buddha offered some quite specific and very practical
    teachings on the subject of renunciation in the Pali
    Tipitaka. One of these is called the Sabbàsava Sutta (MN 2).
    Sabbàsava means &quot;all the àsavas,&quot; a word often
    translated as 'taints'. Perhaps, though, a more immediately
    understandable translation of àsavas would be &quot;outflows
    of self,&quot; the way our sense of being someone tends to
    flow out and collide with the world. The sutta is a useful
    examination of how we can let go of -- how we can renounce --
    these aspects which are sometimes described as &quot;the
    states that defile, that bring renewal of being, give
    trouble, ripen in suffering and lead to future birth, aging
    and death.&quot; The text gives a simple outline of various
    areas of our life and how we can work to free ourselves from
    the trouble that comes when we don't really understand the
    way things are. It starts by examining the insight into the
    unsatisfactoriness of attachment to any form of identity, to
    any form of self, to conditions -- to any experience at all.
    This arises as a natural consequence of seeing into and
    starting to understand the transience of the experiences we
    have. I think each one of us has had some glimpse of that
    unsatisfactoriness. And yet for most of us it is a very
    different thing to move on from that -- to really live in a
    way which expresses that understanding. The Sabbàsava Sutta
    shows us how to take this insight, which is quite accessible
    to anyone who looks carefully at life, and to really put it
    into action so that we can start to free ourselves. It's
    putting it into practice that's the difficult thing, not the
    actual insight itself. </p>
    <p>After the sutta considers the insight, seeing clearly,
    which is the foundation of all our practice, it goes on to
    explore very practical ways in which we can support and
    actually put into practice letting go, abandoning that which
    is hindering our life in everyday situations: 1) restraining
    -- a wise use of the senses that does not give rise to
    outflows of self. One manifestation of the insight into
    impermanence is that one starts quite naturally to restrain
    oneself; 2) using -- how we use the things of our life, the
    material objects, our homes, our clothes, our food, and more
    subtly, how we use the time in our life; 3) and 4) enduring
    and avoiding how to bring insight and clarity into the more
    unbearable aspects of our life. We have to endure some things
    and we have to avoid some others. We consider carefully which
    things are worth enduring and which things are best avoided.
    5) removing -- how we can actually remove and free ourselves
    from things which are unwholesome or harmful in our life; and
    6) developing -- how, through letting go of what is
    unwholesome, we move toward what is supporting enlightenment,
    freedom, peace, and what is supporting wholesome, beautiful
    mind-states.</p>
    <p>Let us start by reflecting a little bit around one
    particular aspect which supports renunciation, restraining --
    both restraining the senses and moral restraint. Until we
    have at least a glimpse of the futility of grasping -- of
    constantly seeking and manipulating and chasing after
    pleasure as an end in itself -- then sense restraint doesn't
    actually make much sense. And if it doesn't make much sense,
    obviously we're not going to do it. And yet, the Buddha
    repeatedly pointed out that restraint is the absolute bedrock
    of the practice of letting go of the world, of renunciation.
    If we are just completely lost in the flow of desire, there's
    no possibility of finding perspective, of understanding more
    deeply. There has to be a reining-in -- a turning against the
    stream, before there can be any sense of perspective or
    clarity. </p>
    <p>In the Sutta Nipàta there is a verse which
    says:&quot;Those who leave one thing to take up another, and
    follow attachment, never relinquish desire. They are like
    monkeys who let go of one branch only to grasp another, only
    to let it go in turn.&quot; (Sn 791) This mad monkey mind
    swings through the trees, endlessly chasing after sweet
    fruits, on and on and on, and never ever ever gets enough.
    This is what we must start to look at, find out for
    ourselves. In many texts the Buddha explains the danger
    inherent in sensual pleasures and the blessing of
    renunciation. What do we make of this phrase, &quot;The
    danger of sensual pleasures?&quot; The Buddha's only concern
    in all the teachings he gave over 45 years was with two
    things: he was addressing the issue of dis-ease or suffering
    (dukkha) and the end of suffering. This was his only
    interest. So, when he talks about the danger of sensual
    pleasures, he's talking about it in relation to suffering.
    It's not the danger that sensual pleasures are bad in
    themselves, or evil; but if we have the wrong relationship to
    the sense realm, then we'll all find (if we reflect on our
    own experience) that just reacting to the sensual world is a
    continual experience of unsatisfactoriness. </p>
    <p>After pointing to the dangers of sensual pleasures, the
    Buddha next speaks of the blessings of renunciation. My own
    experience, in a monastic life where by necessity there has
    been a lot of sense restraint, is a tremendous sense of
    freedom and relief. There is a real ease and relief in not
    having to be obliged to run after the world all the time. It
    really has to be experienced to be believed -- how wonderful
    it is, what a privilege it is. And yes, there is sometimes
    this little wanting voice that whispers (and sometimes
    screams!) &quot;I want that. I want it.&quot; Believe me,
    it's there. But it is not something I trust anymore. It is
    just not something I want to follow. It is a liar! This
    becomes clearer and clearer over time. </p>
    <p>In monastic life we stop just following desire because we
    want to understand it rather than be deluded by it. The
    attention has to turn inward so that we can start to
    understand the very mechanism of how we grasp the sense realm
    itself. With this understanding we can learn to let go. </p>
    <p>Now, we talk a lot in this kind of way, but when you come
    down to real life, how do you actually do it? The Buddha gave
    some very simple but clear suggestions -- ways that we can
    begin to ground ourselves more in our experience, to have
    some kind of anchor from which to contemplate this constant
    driving force in the mind that is always moving towards sense
    experience. One of them I find so clear and simple, and is
    probably well known to most of you: mindfulness of the body.
    &quot;<em>This is how a monk trains himself in restraint: A
    monk seeing objects with the eye is not drawn to attractive
    objects, is not repelled by unattractive objects. He remains
    with firmly established mindfulness of the body, his mind
    being unrestricted.</em>&quot;<em> (SN 35.206)</em></p>
    <p>This is very useful training as to how we can anchor
    ourselves more amidst sense experience without being drawn in
    to it. The body, being the first foundation of mindfulness,
    is the most easy within which to sustain attention -- and the
    least deceptive. Our body is a very honest thing. It doesn't
    tell us lies, like the mind that rationalizes and tries to
    convince us it has good reasons for following its wishes and
    whims. So the body is a very good place to use as a first
    base for our expeditions into the more hair-raising spheres
    of the mind, and it's where attention should gravitate
    towards as a kind of anchoring post. </p>
    <p>The image is often used of this post firmly stuck in the
    ground. When there's something fixed in one place, and you
    start pulling against it, you notice there's a tugging. But
    if you have no reference point, then the mind is just
    constantly shooting off here and there and -- oops, there we
    are again swinging through the trees. And we haven't noticed
    because there was nothing to refer to, there's no contrast to
    movement. Anchoring the attention within the breathing (when
    we are in a situation where it is possible to be that
    refined), or as we sit here, feeling the body pressing
    against the seat; feeling the whole body, the posture,
    sitting, standing, walking, lying down--this is anchoring the
    mind in the body. A very simple thing, and yet it does start
    to give us a tremendous possibility; now the mind hasn't been
    drawn out, grabbing hold of something -- but has a space
    within it. A space within which it can see what's going on. </p>
    <p>So we start to contemplate sense experience with an inner
    questioning: &quot;How am I seeing this?&quot;instead of just
    seeing something and &quot;Oh, I want it!&quot; Your whole
    energy has shot out through your eyes and you've completely
    lost that post, that centeredness. Instead, turning inwards,
    we notice &quot;Ah, the eye has seen something
    attractive.&quot; We can reflect on that. This is something
    that can be known. We can notice our habitual response to a
    pleasant sight, for example, or a particular sound, or a
    memory, or the way someone speaks to us, the tone of voice, a
    thought: &quot;How am I receiving this? How does it
    feel?&quot; This very simple awareness is in itself
    restraint. And it's the beginning of a true renunciation.
    When we step back a little there comes to be this sense of
    detachment, which allows the mind to begin to reflect. This
    allows a clarity to begin to arise in the mind, a sense of
    brightness. And within that brightness we can start to
    understand when it is appropriate to follow -- when a desire
    is valid and it's going to help and be something useful to
    follow -- and when it's going to just lead to these vexations
    and fevers that are so unsatisfying.</p>
    <p>One of the joys of the Buddhist path is that it is
    something we are taking upon ourselves. Nobody is judging us
    except ourselves. And there is room to experiment. It's a
    gradual teaching, a gradual path. So if we have a little bit
    of insight we can let go of a little. And we see the result.
    And then maybe it's three steps forward and two steps back.
    But if we always have this attitude of inquiry, of interest,
    we avoid falling into this trap of coming from the
    &quot;should&quot; position. </p>
    <p>Just reining in our impulses in an attempt to conform to
    an ideal is a willful restraint that does not necessarily
    lead to renunciation. Renunciation is an inner freedom, a
    sense of ease. There are people who grasp hold of the idea
    that we should be restrained, we shouldn't have too much fun
    and we shouldn't do this, and we shouldn't do that. &quot;A
    proper Buddhist, a real meditator wouldn't do that.&quot;
    People come into the monastery and they say things like
    &quot;Oh, I know I shouldn't have, but I had fish and chips
    last night. And I did enjoy it.&quot; Well, for goodness
    sake, if you are going to have them, enjoy them! There is
    this little voice in us that grabs hold of the idea and is
    trying to live to an ideal, whereas in fact we still want to
    do it. </p>
    <p>You really have got two choices: you can want to do it and
    do it, or you can want to do it and not do it. But don't want
    to do it, do it, and then feel guilty about it. Do one or the
    other, do it tally, and determine to learn from it. If you
    are caught by guilt and judgement and self-hatred because you
    think you shouldn't be doing it, then there's no opportunity
    for understanding. That's a very contracted mind-state; it
    can't reflect. We have to be clear enough and compassionate
    enough to allow ourselves to indulge sometimes -- but really
    watch the effect. Be clear enough to notice how you feel.
    Does it feel as good as you thought? Was it worth it? What
    are the consequences to yourself and to others?</p>
    <p>The restraint of mindfulness leads to understanding, and
    understanding leads to peace. This is the middle way, falling
    between two extremes: not constant indulgence, nor on the
    other side a kind of &quot;shouldn't&quot; accompanied by the
    guilt and the clamping down and tightening up that says,
    &quot;I'm going to get my act together.&quot; This is
    actually falling into the other extreme of repression, or
    self-hatred--which is really a form of self-mortification. </p>
    <p>A very useful simile for understanding our relationship
    with sensual pleasures is offered by a wise layman called
    Citta. In this story from the Samyutta Nikàya he is speaking
    to some senior monks: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;Venerable Sirs, it is just as if a black ox and
        a white were joined together with a single collar or
        yoke. If someone were to say, 'The black ox is the fetter
        of the white ox, the white ox is the fetter of the black'
        -- speaking in this way, would he be speaking
        right?&quot; And the elder monks reply: &quot;No,
        householder, the black ox is not the fetter of the white
        ox, nor is the white ox the fetter of the black. The
        single collar or yoke by which they are joined -- that is
        the fetter there.&quot; And Citta replies: &quot;In the
        same way, friend, the eye is not the fetter of forms, nor
        are forms the fetter of the eye. Whatever desire and
        passion arises in dependence on the two of them -- that
        is the fetter there. [The same is said for the ear, nose,
        tongue, body and mind] The mind is not the fetter of
        ideas. Nor are ideas the fetter of the mind. Whatever
        desire or passion arises in dependence on the two of them
        -- that is the fetter there.&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Reflecting on this, one realizes that something very
    important is being said here. The problem does not lie in
    sense experience -- in alluring or unattractive sights or
    sounds or tastes or thoughts or emotions. Nor does it lie
    within the fact that we have to see and hear and taste and
    touch and smell and think. If we're not careful, we can start
    to make some mistaken assumptions. When we start to wake up
    to the dis-ease inherent in the constant bombardment of
    sensory experience, we can start to feel that the experience
    itself is the problem. </p>
    <p>Sometimes you see this amongst people who meditate, or are
    very committed to a spiritual path, when it seems they want
    to withdraw more and more from strong, difficult, or complex
    experience. And it can become a very contracted, fearful,
    un-alive form of living if one is not careful. One becomes
    more and more frightened of being stimulated too much by
    life, and from a kind of weariness of strong experience one
    wants to get away from it. We can do this in meditation, too,
    except we call it something nice: we call it 'getting
    concentrated' or focusing the mind. But sometimes the
    attitude behind that, if we are not honest and careful, can
    be a sense of wanting to shut things down, to &quot;get away
    from.&quot; Or, alternatively, sometimes we can start feeling
    averse to being a sensitive creature which has eyes that see
    and ears that hear and a mind that thinks, thinks, thinks.
    Sometimes we can wish to not exist, to somehow not have to
    feel, not have to think. </p>
    <p>Actually there is no problem with the sense realm when we
    are firmly established in knowing that it is just as it is.
    The sense realm has its own quality of suchness. Some of it
    is ghastly, some of it is wonderful, some of it is blissful,
    some of it is terrible and tragic. This is the way it is. And
    we are sensitive beings -- we are always going to feel the
    world. Rather than feel it less and less, as we become more
    open we actually feel it more and more. And if we practice
    correctly, more and more deeply, we allow the world to enter
    us. But the escape in the case of sense pleasures is not
    poking out our eyes or stuffing wax in our ears. And it's not
    blaming &quot;it&quot; or &quot;them&quot; out there for our
    sense of unsatisfactoriness. Unpleasant people and things and
    experiences are always going to exist--but where is the
    actual problem? The problem lies in the grasping of the
    desire to get rid of, the desire to have, the desire and
    passion that arise in dependence on having senses and upon
    sense objects. The beautifully simple image of two oxen yoked
    together says a lot, doesn't it? Where is the fetter? </p>
