      <TD WIDTH="100%"><FONT SIZE="6">U</FONT>pasampada is the highest Bhikkhu ordination replete with higher
      morality, and it is bestowed upon a 'Samanera' (Novice) ceremonially, only
      when he completes his 20th birth day.
      <p>However, under exceptional circumstances, the gestation period (from
      the time of conception in the mother's womb), is also taken into
      consideration, in calculating the age, if it becomes necessary to hold the
      ordination ceremony earlier. This is normally done when the mother or
      father or guardian of the child is too old and on the verge of death, and
      is keen to witness the ceremony before death.
      <p align="center"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><b>A Bhikkhu's seniority</b>
      </FONT>
      <p>A Bhikkhu's seniority is reckoned from his date of receiving the 'Upasampada'
      ordination, and not by his age. An old person entering the order, by
      wearing the yellow garb, is known as 'samanera', and there may be Bhikkhus
      younger to him who had received the higher ordination.
      <p>Only Bhikkhus can deliver discourses (preaching 'Bana') to the laity,
      and participate in any 'Sanghika Dana' (alms offered to Bhikkhus), where
      the number present should not be less than four. Under the 'Vinaya' (Code
      of Discipline), a Bhikkhu is bound to observe the 'Patimokkha' precept, on
      full moon and new moon days, without a breach, before an assembled
      community of Bhikkhus. (This rule is hardly observed today by the 'Gramavasi'
      Bhikkhus).
      <p>The higher Dhamma intended for Bhikkhus is absolute transcendentalism.
      On receiving the 'Upasampada', the Bhikkhu has to lead a perfect life of a
      saint, control his senses, keep aloof from the lifestyles of the worldly
      man, and discipline himself in keeping with the Vinaya Code. His garment
      is the robe.
      <p>He has to obtain his meals by begging ('Pindapatha'), because the
      nearest interpretation of the word 'Bhikkhu' is 'Mendicant monk'. As a
      Bhikkhu, having received the highest ordination, must lead a holy life,
      devoid of anger, passionate desires, pride revengefulness, conceit,
      arrogance, stubbornness, slothfulness etc. which pollute desires and
      retard mental purity.
      <p align="center"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><b>No vows for Bhikkhus</b> </FONT>
      <p>A Bhikkhu is expected to observe four kinds of higher morality, such
      as, 'Patomokkhala Sila' (Fundamental Moral Code), 'Indiriyasamwara Sila'
      (Morality by sense restraint), 'Ajivaparisuddhi Sila' (Moral purity of
      livelihood) and 'Paccayasannissita Sila' (Morality in the use of life's
      necessary requirements).
      <p>These four are conjointly called 'Sila Visuddhi' (Moral purities).
      There are no vows for Bhikkhus, but they are bound to observe 220 rules of
      conduct ('Adhikarana Sammatha Dhamma'), apart from other minor offences ('Avat').
      Under the Vinaya, a Bhikkhu ceases to be one, if he were to commit the
      four defeats (Parajikas') i.e., adultery, stealing, murder and
      pseudo-claims of possessing higher spiritual powers ('Dhyanas'). For
      various reasons, the 'Bhikkhu Sasana' in Sri Lanka, began to wane from
      time to time, and there were no qualified Bhikkhus, who had received the 'Upasampada'
      ordination, and who could ordain the 'Samaneras'.
      <p>King Vijayabahu I (1058-1114) of Polonnaruwa, felt the need, and took
      steps to ordain the 'Samaneras' qualifying to be Bhikkhus, by getting down
      priests who had received the 'Upasampada' from Aramana (Ramannadesa) in
      the present Myanmar (old Burma). He requested king Anuruddha of Aramana
      for assistance. Accordingly, 20 Bhikkhus were sent to Sri Lanka, to bestow
      the defunct 'Upasampada', by ordaining the 'Samaneras'. The ceremony was
      conducted at the 'Udakukkhepa Sima' (shelter with boundaries for
      ordination on water) by the Dastota Ferry.
      <p>During the Kotte period (1412-1580), when Bhuvanekabahu VI was the King
      of Kotte, a group of Bhikkhus, on the invitation of the King, came to Sri
      Lanka from Ramannadesa, as bidden by King Dhammacetiya of that country to
      restore the 'Upasampada'. The ordination ceremony was conducted by the
      Kelani ford by the Ven. Mangala Maha Thera of Ramannadesa, assisted by Ven.
      Vidagama Maha Thera of Sri Lanka who headed the ceremony.
      <p>During the reign of Wimaladharmasuriya I (1592-1604), there was a close
      contact, between Sri Lanka and Rakkhangadesa (modern Arakan), a natural
      division of Myanmar with its old capital at Myohaung. The majority of
      Bhikkhus had been influenced by the Hindu-Mahayana traditions and were not
      orthodox Buddhists (Theravadins), but were a heretical sect, opposed to
      Mahaviharavasins. The Bhikkhus were received by the King, and the 'Upasampada'
      ceremony was conducted at the Getambe Ferry by the Mahaveli River.
      <p align="center"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><b>Protective chants</b> </FONT>
      <p>These Bhikkhus brought with them protective chants ('Pirith'), which
      people, even today, chant on occasions to ward off evil and other malefic
      influences. The &quot;Jalanandana' is one of them. Some consider it to be
      a Buddha 'Mantra' (incantation), because it contains Sanskrit words as is
      a common feature in Mahayana books, e.g., the words 'Sarva Bhandana
      Cedanam.... iti sri loka Buddhehi... Sarva bhaya vinnassanam etc. 'Jinapanjaraya',
      'Atavisi Piritha', Gini Piritha', 'Jala Piritha' and other subsidiary 'Piriths'
      have Mahayana influence.
      <p>As the 'Gramavasi' Bhikkhus began to deplete by getting lured to
      domestic life and there was not a single Bhikkhu, who had received the
      ordination. King Wimaladharamsuriya II (1684-1707), taking a serious view
      of the situation, sent two missions, one to Arakan (Rakkhangadesa) and the
      other to Siam (modern Thailand). The fist mission was led by Dodanwela
      Herath Mudiyanse, Beminwatte Dissanayaka Mudiyanse and Sivagama Pandita
      Mudiyanse. They left by the Dutch vessel Bomba in 1694, but their mission
      proved a failure.
      <p align="center"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><b>The second mission</b> </FONT>
      <p>The second mission included Gampola Wijetunga Mudiyanse and Galagama
      Mohottala. This time the King welcomed the mission and after enquiries,
      sent to the island Ven. Santata and Ven. Lokaraga with instructions to
      meet the King and make arrangements to ordain the 'Samaneras' as Bhikkhus.
      <p>The Siamese Bhikkhus Sankicca, Pancaloka, Gunameja, Akapanna and
      Dharmananda, who were accustomed in carrying out 'Upasampada' ordinations,
      did their job in keeping to tradition.
      <p>These Bhikkhus did not follow the orthodox Buddhism and were a
      heretical sect with Mahayana principles. Even today, when Buddhists
      worship the Buddha, they say &quot;Ye ca Buddha atitaca, ye ca Buddha
      anagatha, paccupannaca ye Buddha, Aham Vandami Sabbada&quot;.
      <p>Here there is reference to present Buddhas. Unlike in the Mahayana
      Buddhism, the Theravada has only one Buddha and not a host of Buddhas.
      <p>Due to the deterioration of the Sasana, during the Kotte period, the
      Bhikkhus were more or less immoral in their behaviour and led a life of
      sensuous pleasures given to luxury and emotional feelings. In view of this
      situation, the laity ignominiously called them as 'Ganai' or 'Ganinnanses'.
      They had never received 'Upasampada', and were not fluent to deliver
      discourses ('Bana' preaching), but only read passages from the Jataka
      Stories, when devotees assembled at the temple on 'Poya Days'.
      <p>Some of these Bhikkhus practised sorcery and exercised exorcism, and
      earned a living by reading horoscopes and making 'Yantras' (talismans), to
      ward off evil, when requested by the laity. After the funeral of a person
      in the village, these 'Ganai' spent the night in the house to listen to
      what the deceased had to say to his close relatives.
      <p>Suddenly, he will make a cry in the night, disturbing the sleep of
      others, by saying &quot;The dead person tells me to you all (the inmates
      of the house) that the departed wishes that a portion of their land be
      given to the temple&quot;. The people in the house, through fear of any
      malignant influence by the dead did what was told.
      <p align="center"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><b>The voyage to Thailand</b>
      </FONT>
      <p>Once again, during the reign of Vijaya Rajasinha (1739-1747) of Kandy
      it became necessary to restore the 'Upasampada' ceremony that had become
      defunct. Welcoming Bhikkhus from Siam for the purpose, he directed
      Doranegama Muhandiram Rala and Matara Rala, to go to Thailand and bring
      Bhikkhus qualified to ordain the 'Samaneras'.
      <p>For the voyage, the Dutch government in Batavia (now Jakarta), provided
      a vessel. On the way, the vessel faced disaster and the men on board died.
      <p>When King Kirthi Sri Rajasinha ascended the throne of Kandy in 1747,
      he, on the advice of Ven. Asarana Sarana Saranankara Thera (yet a 'Samanera'
      though he was above 50 years in age), again sent an embassy to Siam which
      included Pattapola Mohottala, Ellepola Mohottala, Aitthaliyadde Muhandiram,
      Eriyagama Muhandiram and Wilbagedera Rala, who had once gone to Siam
      earlier, acted as the guide.
      <p>The Dutch again provided a vessel for the journey. They left
      Trincomalee on board the 'Vel Trek', along with physicians, astrologers,
      soldiers etc.
      <p align="center"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><b>The King of Siam</b> </FONT>
      <p>The King of Siam welcomed the people and agreed to send enough Bhikkhus
      to Sri Lanka, to hold the 'Upasampada' ceremony.
      <p>A number of Bhikkhus came to the island headed by Pra Buddhadhamma
      Upali Maha Thera, and the others were Pra Aryamurti Maha Thera, and Theras
      Maha Indasuvanna, Maha Brahamaswara, Maha Suvanna, Maha Manisara, Maha
      Dhammajotha, Maha Muni, Maha Candasuvanna, Maha Assami, Maha Pannasa, Maha
      Sara Candana, Maha Punnajatha, Maha Candasara, Maha Indajotha, Maha
      Brahmajotha, Maha Ratta and Maha Candajotha. Six Ministers also arrived
      with them. They were Prasudanta Mestri, Luwang Seneho, Kum Vaca Piron, Kum
      Maha Pon and Kum Racana Vicin. They arrived in the Dutch vessel 'Oscarbel'
      in 1753.
      <p>Ehelepola Maha Adikaram went to meet these Bhikkhus and Ministers,
      whose vessel dropped anchor in the Trincomalee harbour, and they were
      brought to Kandy, as the King Kirthi Sri Rajasinha was impatiently waiting
      their arrival.
      <p>Their arrival coincided with the Kandy Esala Perahera held to appease
      the gods, and the King being a Malabari Hindu, made arrangements to have
      the perahera. In the most grandiloquent way. When these alien Bhikkhus
      heard the sound of the jingles, they inquired from the King as to what it
      all meant.
      <p>When the King said that the devale peraheras are getting ready to go in
      procession, they took umbrage at it, and expressed their wonder why a
      Buddhist country is encouraging Hindu practices. The King in order to
      satisfy the Bhikkhus, told them that the Dalada Perahera would be joining
      the Devale Peraheras taking the foremost position.
      <p align="center"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><b>The first ordination ceremony</b>
      </FONT>
      <p>The first ordination ceremony bestowing 'Upasampada' on the novices was
      held on the Full Moon Day in the month Esala in 1753 within the 'Sima'
      (boundary) known as 'Visungama' of the Malwatte Vihara.
      <p>The first to ordain was a novice who came along with the Siamese
      Bhikkhus. It was to set an example to the 'Samaneras' who were ready to
      undergo the ceremony.
      <p>Malwatte Vihara was earlier known as Pushparamaya and those ordained
      belonged to the Siyam Nikaya (&quot;Shyamopali Maha Nikaya&quot;) The Maha
      Thera Upali established two Chapters known as 'Malwatta' and 'Asgiriya' to
      prevent a repetition of what happened earlier.
      <p>The first Maha Nayaka Thera of the Malwatte Vihara was Ven. Tibbotuwawe
      Siri Siddhattha Buddharakhitha (1753-1773) and of the Asgiriya Vihara was
      Ven. Urulewatte Siri Piyadassi Dhammadassi (1753-1778). These two Chapters
      still exist as the two Buddhist fraternities eligible to carry out 'Upasampada'
      ceremonies.
      <p align="center"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><b>The Sri Lanka Ramanna Nikaya</b>
      </FONT>
      <p>The Sri Lanka Ramanna Nikaya was established in 1864, when the 'Samanera'
      Ambagahawatte Saranankara returned to the island, having received the 'Upasampada'
      from the Ven. Gneiyadharma Sangharaja of Ratnapunna Vihara in Myanmar. He
      was not ordained by the Malwatta Vihara Bhikkhus, as he was of Salagama
      caste.
      <p>The Amarapura Nikaya came into existence in 1803, when the 'Samanera'
      Ambaghapitiye Gnanawimalatissa went to Myanmar and received the ordination
      from Gnanabhivamsa Dhammasenapathi Sangharaja, as he too was not absorbed
      to the Siyam Nikaya due to caste difference. These Nikayas later came to
      be sub-divided under different names, but maintained the principal names.
