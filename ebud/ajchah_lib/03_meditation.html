      <P><FONT SIZE="6">S</FONT>eekers of goodness, who have gathered here, 
      please listen in peace. Listening to the Dhamma in peace means to listen 
      with a one-pointed mind, paying attention to what you hear and then 
      letting go. Listening to the Dhamma is of great benefit. While listening 
      to the Dhamma we are encouraged to firmly establish both body and mind in
      <I>samadhi</I>, because it is one kind of Dhamma practice. In the time of 
      the Buddha people listened to Dhamma talks intently, with a mind aspiring 
      to real understanding, and some actually realized the Dhamma while 
      listening.</P>
      <P>This place is well suited to meditation practice. Having stayed here a 
      couple of nights I can see that it is an important place. On the external 
      level it is already peaceful, all that remains is the internal level, your 
      hearts and minds. So I ask all of you to make an effort to pay attention.</P>
      <P>Why have you gathered here to practise meditation? It is because your 
      hearts and minds do not understand what should be understood. In other 
      words, you don’t truly know how things are, or what is what. You don’t 
      know what is wrong and what is right, what it is that brings you suffering 
      and causes you to doubt. So first you have to make yourselves calm. The 
      reason that you have come here to develop calm and restraint is that your 
      hearts and minds are not at ease. Your minds are not calm, not restrained. 
      They are instead swayed by doubting and agitation. This is why you have 
      come here today and are now listening to the Dhamma.</P>
      <P>I would like you to concentrate and listen carefully to what I say, and 
      I ask permission to speak frankly because that’s how I am. Please 
      understand that even if I do speak in a forceful manner, I am doing so out 
      of good will. I ask your forgiveness if there is anything I say that 
      upsets you, because the customs of Thailand and those of the West are not 
      the same. Actually, speaking a little forcefully can be good because it 
      helps to stir up people who might otherwise be sleepy or drowsy, and 
      rather than rousing themselves to hear the Dhamma, allow themselves to 
      drift instead into complacency and so never understand anything.</P>
      <P>In practice, although there may appear to be many ways really there is 
      only one. As with fruit trees, it is possible to get fruit quickly by 
      planting a cutting, but the tree would not be resilient or long lasting. 
      Another way is to cultivate a tree right from the seed, which produces a 
      strong and resilient tree. Practice is the same.</P>
      <P>When I first began to practise I had problems understanding this. As 
      long as I still didn’t know what’s what, sitting meditation was a real 
      chore, even bringing me to tears on occasion. Sometimes I would be aiming 
      too high, at others not high enough, never finding the point of balance. 
      To practise in a way that’s peaceful means to place the mind neither too 
      high nor too low, but at the point of balance.</P>
      <P>I can see that it’s very confusing for you, coming from different 
      places and having practised in different ways with different teachers. 
      Coming to practise here you must be plagued with all kinds of doubts. One 
      teacher says you must practise in one way, another says you should 
      practise another way. You wonder which method to use, unsure of the 
      essence of the practice. The result is confusion. There are so many 
      teachers and so many teachings that nobody knows how to harmonize their 
      practice. As a result there is a lot of doubt and uncertainty.</P>
      <P>So you must try not to think too much. If you do think, then do so with 
      awareness. But so far your thinking has been done with no awareness. First 
      you must make your mind calm. Where there is knowing there is no need to 
      think, awareness will arise in its place, and this will in turn become 
      wisdom <I>(panna)</I>. But the ordinary kind of mental proliferation is 
      not wisdom, it is simply the aimless and unaware wandering and thinking of 
      the mind, which inevitably results in agitation. This is not wisdom.</P>
      <P>At this stage you don’t need to think. You’ve already done a great deal 
      of thinking at home, haven’t you? It just stirs up the heart. You must 
      establish some awareness. Obsessive thinking can even bring you to tears, 
      just try it out. Getting lost in some train of thought won’t lead you to 
      the truth, it’s not wisdom. The Buddha was a very wise person, he’d 
      learned how to stop thinking. In the same way you are practising here in 
      order to stop thinking and thereby arrive at peace. There must be calm 
      first, if there is only thinking wisdom will not arise, there will be no 
      awareness of the truth. All that will arise will be endless proliferation. 
      If you are already calm it is not necessary to think, wisdom will arise in 
      its place. As long as you are thinking wisdom will not arise.</P>
      <P>To meditate you do not have to think much more than to resolve that 
      right now is the time for training the mind and nothing else. Don’t let 
      the mind shoot off to the left or to the right, to the front or behind, 
      above or below. Our only duty right now is to practise mindfulness of the 
      breathing. Fix your attention at the head and move it down through the 
      body to the tips of the feet, and then back up to the crown of the head. 
      Pass your awareness down through the body, observing with wisdom. We do 
      this to gain an initial understanding of the way the body is. Then begin 
      the meditation, noting that at this time your sole duty is to observe the 
      inhalations and exhalations. Don’t force the breath to be any longer or 
      shorter than normal, just allow it to continue easily. Don’t put any 
      pressure on the breath, rather let it flow evenly, letting go with each 
      in-breath and out-breath.</P>
      <P>You must understand that you are letting go as you do this, but there 
      should still be awareness. You must maintain this awareness, allowing the 
      breath to enter and leave comfortably. There is no need to force the 
      breath, just allow it to flow easily and naturally. Maintain the resolve 
      that at this time you have no other duties or responsibilities. Thoughts 
      about what will happen, what you will know or see during the sitting may 
      arise from time to time, but once they arise just let them cease by 
      themselves, don’t be concerned over them.</P>
      <P>During the meditation there is no need to pay attention to sense 
      impressions. Whenever the mind is affected by sense impingement, wherever 
      there is a feeling or sensation in the mind, just let it go. Whether those 
      sensations are good or bad is unimportant. It is not necessary to make 
      anything out of those sensations, just let them pass away and return your 
      attention to the breath. Maintain the awareness of the breath entering and 
      leaving. Don’t create suffering over the breath being too long or too 
      short, simply observe it without trying to control or suppress it in any 
      way. In other words, don’t attach. Allow the breath to continue as it is, 
      and the mind will become calm. As you continue the mind will gradually lay 
      things down and come to rest, the breath becoming lighter and lighter 
      until it becomes so faint that it seems like it’s not there at all. Both 
      the body and the mind will feel light and energized. All that will remain 
      will be a one-pointed knowing. You could say that the mind has changed and 
      reached a state of calm.</P>
      <P>If the mind becomes agitated, set up mindfulness and inhale deeply till 
      there is no space left to store any air, then release it all completely 
      until none remains. Follow this with another deep inhalation until you are 
      full, then release the air again. Do this two or three times, then 
      re-establish concentration. The mind should be calmer. If any more sense 
      impressions cause agitation in the mind, repeat the process on every 
      occasion. Similarly with walking meditation. If, while walking, the mind 
      becomes agitated, then stop still, calm the mind, re-establish the 
      awareness with the meditation object and then continue walking. Sitting 
      and walking meditation are in essence the same, differing only in terms of 
      the physical posture used.</P>
      <P>Sometimes there may be doubt, so you must have sati, to be the one who 
      knows, continually following and examining the agitated mind in whatever 
      form it takes. This is to have <I>sati</I>. <I>Sati</I> watches over and 
      takes care of the mind. You must maintain this knowing and not be careless 
      or wander astray, no matter what condition the mind takes on.</P>
      <P>The trick is to have sati taking control and supervising the mind. Once 
      the mind is unified with <I>sati</I> a new kind of awareness will emerge. 
      The mind that has developed calm is held in check by that calm, just like 
      a chicken held in a coop ... the chicken is unable to wander outside, but 
      it can still move around within the coop. Its walking to and fro doesn’t 
      get it into trouble because it is restrained by the coop. Likewise the 
      awareness that takes place when the mind has <I>sati</I> and is calm does 
      not cause trouble. None of the thinking or sensations that take place 
      within the calm mind cause harm or disturbance.</P>
      <P>Some people don’t want to experience any thoughts or feelings at all, 
      but this is going too far. Feelings arise within the state of calm. The 
      mind is both experiencing feelings and calm at the same time, without 
      being disturbed. When there is calm like this there are no harmful 
      consequences. Problems occur when the ‘chicken’ gets out of the ‘coop’. 
      For instance, you may be watching the breath entering and leaving and then 
      forget yourself, allowing the mind to wander away from the breath back 
      home, off to the shops or to any number of different places. Maybe even 
      half an hour may pass before you suddenly realize you’re supposed to be 
      practising meditation and reprimand yourself for your lack of <I>sati</I>. 
      This is where you have to be really careful, because this is where the 
      chicken gets out of the coop – the mind leaves its base of calm.</P>
      <P>You must take care to maintain the awareness with <I>sati</I> and try 
      to pull the mind back. Although I use the words ‘pull the mind back’, in 
      fact the mind doesn’t really go anywhere, only the object of awareness has 
      changed. You must make the mind stay right here and now. As long as there 
      is sati there will be presence of mind. It seems like you are pulling the 
      mind back but really it hasn’t gone anywhere; it has simply changed a 
      little. It seems that the mind goes here and there, but in fact the change 
      occurs right at the one spot. When sati is regained, in a flash you are 
      back with the mind without it having to be brought from anywhere.</P>
      <P>When there is total knowing, a continuous and unbroken awareness at 
      each and every moment, this is called presence of mind. If your attention 
      drifts from the breath to other places then the knowing is broken. 
      Whenever there is awareness of the breath the mind is there. With just the 
      breath and this even and continuous awareness you have presence of mind.</P>
      <P ALIGN="center">* * *</P>
      <P>There must be both <I>sati</I> and <I>sampajañña</I>. <I>Sati</I> is 
      recollection and <I>sampajañña</I> is self-awareness. Right now you are 
      clearly aware of the breath. This exercise of watching the breath helps <I>
      sati</I> and <I>sampajañña</I> develop together. They share the work. 
      Having both <I>sati</I> and <I>sampajañña</I> is like having two workers 
      to lift a heavy plank of wood. Suppose there are two people trying to lift 
      some heavy planks, but the weight is so great, they have to strain so 
      hard, that it’s almost unendurable. Then another person, imbued with 
      goodwill, sees them and rushes in to help. In the same way, when there is
      <I>sati</I> and <I>sampajañña</I>, then <I>panna</I> (wisdom) will arise 
      at the same place to help out. Then all three of them support each other.</P>
      <P>With <I>panna</I> there will be an understanding of sense objects. For 
      instance, during the meditation sense objects are experienced which give 
      rise to feelings and moods. You may start to think of a friend, but then
      <I>panna</I> should immediately counter with ‘It doesn’t matter,’ ‘Stop’ 
      or ‘Forget it’. Or if there are thoughts about where you will go tomorrow, 
      then the response should be ‘I’m not interested, I don’t want to concern 
      myself with such things’. Maybe you start thinking about other people, 
      then you should think ‘No, I don’t want to get involved,’ ‘Just let go’ or 
      ‘It’s all uncertain and never a sure thing.’ This is how you should deal 
      with things in meditation, recognizing them as ‘not sure, not sure’, and 
      maintaining this kind of awareness.</P>
      <P>You must give up all the thinking, the inner dialogue and the doubting. 
      Don’t get caught up in these things during the meditation. In the end all 
      that will remain in the mind in its purest form are <I>sati</I>, <I>
      sampajañña</I> and <I>panna</I>. Whenever these things weaken doubts will 
      arise, but try to abandon those doubts immediately, leaving only <I>sati</I>,
      <I>sampajañña</I> and <I>panna</I>. Try to develop <I>sati</I> like this 
      until it can be maintained at all times. Then you will understand <I>sati</I>,
      <I>sampajañña</I> and <I>samadhi</I> thoroughly.</P>
      <P>Focusing the attention at this point you will see <I>sati</I>, <I>
      sampajañña</I>, <I>samadhi</I> and <I>panna</I> together. Whether you are 
      attracted to or repelled by external sense objects, you will be able to 
      tell yourself ‘It&#39;s not sure’. Either way they are just hindrances to be 
      swept away till the mind is clean. All that should remain is <I>sati</I>, 
      recollection; <I>sampajañña</I>, clear awareness; <I>samadhi</I>, the firm 
      and unwavering mind; and <I>panna</I>, consummate wisdom. For the time 
      being I will say just this much on the subject of meditation.</P>
      <P>Now about the tools or aids to meditation practice – there should be <I>
      metta</I> (goodwill) in your heart, in other words, the qualities of 
      generosity, kindness and helpfulness. These should be maintained as the 
      foundation for mental purity. For example, begin doing away with <I>lobha</I>, 
      or selfishness, through <I>dana</I>, giving. When people are selfish they 
      aren’t happy. Selfishness leads to a sense of discontent, and yet people 
      tend to be very selfish without realizing how it affects them.</P>
      <P>You can experience this at any time, especially when you are hungry. 
      Suppose you get some apples and you have the opportunity to share them 
      with a friend; you think it over for a while, and, sure, the intention to 
      give is there all right, but you want to give the smallest one. To give 
      the big one would be ... well, such a shame. It’s hard to think straight. 
      You tell them to go ahead and take one, but then you say, “Take this one!” 
      ... and give them the smallest apple! This is one form of selfishness that 
      people usually don’t notice. Have you ever been like this?</P>
      <P>You really have to go against the grain to give <I>dana</I>. Even 
      though you may really only want to give the smallest apple, you must force 
      yourself to give away the biggest one. Of course once you have given it to 
      your friend you feel really good. Training the mind by going against the 
      grain in this way requires self-discipline – you must know how to give and 
      how to give up, not allowing selfishness to stick. Once you learn how to 
      give to others your mind will be joyful. If you still don’t know how to 
      give, if you are still hesitating over which fruit to give, then while you 
      are deliberating you will be troubled, and even if you give the biggest 
      one there will still be a sense of reluctance. But as soon as you firmly 
      decide to give the biggest one the matter is over and done with. This is 
      going against the grain in the right way.</P>
      <P>Doing this you win mastery over yourself. If you can’t do it you will 
      be defeated by yourself and continue to be selfish. All of us have been 
      selfish in the past. This is a defilement, which needs to be cut off. In 
      the Pali scriptures, giving is called <I>‘dana’</I>, which means bringing 
      happiness to others. It is one of those conditions, which help to cleanse 
      the mind from defilement. Reflect on this and develop it in your practice.</P>
      <P>You may think that practising like this involves hounding yourself, but 
      it doesn’t really. Actually it’s hounding craving and the defilements. If 
      defilements arise within you you have to do something to remedy them. 
      Defilements are like a cat. If you give it as much food as it wants it 
      will always be coming around looking for more food, but if you stop giving 
      it any food after a couple of days it’ll stop coming around. It’s the same 
      with the defilements, they won’t come to disturb you, they’ll leave your 
      mind in peace. So rather than being afraid of defilement, make the 
      defilements afraid of you. To make the defilements afraid of you, you must 
      see the Dhamma within your minds right now.</P>
      <P>Where does the Dhamma arise? It arises with our knowing and 
      understanding in this way. Everyone is able to know and understand the 
      Dhamma. It’s not something that has to be found in books, you don’t have 
      to do a lot of study to see it, just reflect right now and you can see 
      what I am talking about. Everybody can see it because it exists right 
      within our hearts. Everybody has defilements, don’t they? If you are able 
      to see them then you can understand. In the past you’ve looked after and 
      pampered your defilements, but now you must know your defilements and not 
      allow them to come and bother you.</P>
      <P>The next constituent of practice is moral restraint <I>(sila)</I>. Sila 
      watches over and nurtures the practice in the same way as parents look 
      after their children. Maintaining moral restraint means not only to avoid 
      harming others but also to help and encourage them. At the very least you 
      should maintain the five precepts, which are:</P>
      <OL TYPE="1">
        <LI>Not only not to kill or deliberately harm others, but to spread 
        goodwill towards all beings. </LI>
      </OL>
      <OL TYPE="1" START="2">
        <LI>To be honest, refraining from infringing on the rights of others; in 
        other words, not stealing. </LI>
      </OL>
      <OL TYPE="1" START="3">
        <LI>Knowing moderation in sexual relations: In the household life there 
        exists the family structure, based around husband and wife. Know who 
        your husband or wife is, know moderation, know the proper bounds of 
        sexual activity. Generally people don’t know the limits. One husband or 
        wife isn’t enough, they have to have a second or third. The way I see 
        it, you can’t consume even one partner completely, so to have two or 
        three is just plain indulgence. You must try to cleanse the mind and 
        train it to know moderation. Knowing moderation is true purity, without 
        it there are no limits to your behaviour. Eating delicious food, don’t 
        dwell too much on how it tastes, think of your stomach and consider how 
        much is appropriate to its needs. If you eat too much you get trouble, 
        so you must know moderation. Moderation is the best way. Just one 
        partner is enough; two or three is an indulgence and will only cause 
        problems. </LI>
      </OL>
      <OL TYPE="1" START="4">
        <LI>To be honest in speech – this is also a tool for eradicating 
        defilements. You must be honest and straight, truthful and upright. </LI>
      </OL>
      <OL TYPE="1" START="5">
        <LI>To refrain from taking intoxicants. You must know restraint and 
        preferably give these things up altogether. People are already 
        intoxicated enough with their families, relatives and friends, material 
        possessions, wealth and all the rest of it. That’s quite enough already 
        without making things worse by taking intoxicants as well. These things 
        just create darkness in the mind. Those who take large amounts should 
        try to gradually cut down and eventually give it up altogether. Maybe I 
        should ask your forgiveness, but my speaking in this way is out of a 
        concern for your benefit, so that you can understand that which is good. 
        You need to know what is what. What are the things that are oppressing 
        you in your everyday lives? What are the actions which cause this 
        oppression? Good actions bring good results and bad actions bring bad 
        results. These are the causes. </LI>
      </OL>
      <P>Once moral restraint is pure there will be a sense of honesty and 
      kindness towards others. This will bring about contentment and freedom 
      from worries and remorse. Remorse resulting from aggressive and hurtful 
      behaviour will not be there. This is a form of happiness. It is almost 
      like a heavenly state. There is comfort, you eat and sleep in comfort with 
      the happiness arising from moral restraint. This is the result; 
      maintaining moral restraint is the cause. This is a principle of Dhamma 
      practice – refraining from bad actions so that goodness can arise. If 
      moral restraint is maintained in this way, evil will disappear and good 
      will arise in its place. This is the result of right practice.</P>
      <P>But this isn’t the end of the story. Once people have attained some 
      happiness they tend to be heedless and not go any further in the practice. 
      They get stuck on happiness. They don’t want to progress any further; they 
      prefer the happiness of ‘heaven’. It’s comfortable but there’s no real 
      understanding. You must keep reflecting to avoid being deluded. Reflect 
      again and again on the disadvantages of this happiness. It’s transient, it 
      doesn’t last forever. Soon you are separated from it. It’s not a sure 
      thing; once happiness disappears suffering arises in its place and the 
      tears come again. Even ‘gods’ and ‘goddesses’ end up crying and suffering.</P>
      <P>So the Lord Buddha taught us to reflect on the disadvantages, that 
      there exists an unsatisfactory side to happiness. Usually when this kind 
      of happiness is experienced there is no real understanding of it. The 
      peace that is truly certain and lasting is covered over by this deceptive 
      happiness. This happiness is not a certain or permanent kind of peace, but 
      rather a form of defilement, a refined form of defilement to which we 
      attach. Everybody likes to be happy. It’s happiness because of the very 
      attraction to it. If at any time there is no attraction then suffering 
      arises. We must reflect on this happiness to see its uncertainty and 
      limitation. Once things change suffering arises. This suffering is also 
      uncertain, don’t think that it is fixed or absolute. This kind of 
      reflection is called <I>adinavakatha</I>, the reflection on the inadequacy 
      and limitation of the conditioned world. It is to reflect on happiness 
      rather than accepting it at face value. If you see that it is uncertain 
      you shouldn’t cling fast to it. You should take hold of it but then let it 
      go, seeing both the benefit and the harm of happiness. To meditate 
      skilfully you have to see the disadvantages inherent within happiness. 
      Reflect in this way. When happiness arises, contemplate it thoroughly 
      until the disadvantages become apparent.</P>
      <P>When you see that things are inadequate [1] your heart will come to 
      understand the <I>nekkhammakatha</I>, the reflection on renunciation of 
      sensuality. The mind will become disinterested and seek for a way out. 
      Disinterest comes from having seen the way forms really are, the way 
      tastes really are, the way love and hatred really are. By disinterest we 
      mean that there is no longer the desire to cling to or attach to things. 
      There is a withdrawal from clinging, to a point where you can abide 
      comfortably, observing with an equanimity that is free of attachment. This 
      is the peace that arises from practice.</P>
