      <P><I>Q: Is it advisable to read a lot or study the scriptures as a part 
      of practice?</I></P>
      <P>A: The Dhamma of the Buddha is not found in books. If you want to 
      really see for yourself what the Buddha was talking about, you don’t need 
      to bother with books. Watch your own mind. Examine to see how feelings 
      come and go, how thoughts come and go. Don’t be attached to anything. Just 
      be mindful of whatever there is to see. This is the way to the truths of 
      the Buddha. Be natural. Everything you do in your life here is a chance to 
      practice. It is all Dhamma. When you do your chores, try to be mindful. If 
      you are emptying a spittoon or cleaning a toilet, don’t feel you are doing 
      it as a favour for anyone else. There is Dhamma in emptying spittoons. 
      Don’t feel you are practicing only when sitting still, cross-legged. Some 
      of you have complained that there is not enough time to meditate. Is there 
      enough time to breathe? This is your meditation: mindfulness, naturalness 
      in whatever you do.</P>
      <P><I>Q: What can I do about doubts? Some days I’m plagued with doubts 
      about the practice or my own progress, or the teacher.</I></P>
      <P>A: Doubting is natural. Everyone starts out with doubts. You can learn 
      a great deal from them. What is important is that you don’t identify with 
      your doubts. That is, don’t get caught up in them. This will spin your 
      mind in endless circles. Instead, watch the whole process of doubting, of 
      wondering. See who it is that doubts. See how doubts come and go. Then you 
      will no longer be victimized by your doubts. You will step outside of them 
      and your mind will be quiet. You can see how all things come and go. Just 
      let go of what you are attached to. Let go of your doubts and simply 
      watch. This is how to end doubting.</P>
      <P><I>Q: What about other methods of practice? These days there seem to be 
      so many teachers and so many different systems of meditation that it is 
      confusing.</I></P>
      <P>A: It is like going into town. One can approach from the north, from 
      the southeast, from many roads. Often these systems just differ outwardly. 
      Whether you walk one way or another, fast or slow, if you are mindful, it 
      is all the same. There is one essential point that all good practice must 
      eventually come to – not clinging. In the end, all meditation systems must 
      be let go of. Neither can one cling to the teacher. If a systems leads to 
      relinquishment, to not-clinging, then it is correct practice. </P>
      <P>You may wish to travel, to visit other teachers and try other systems. 
      Some of you have already done so. This is a natural desire. You will find 
      out that a thousand questions asked and knowledge of many systems will not 
      bring you to the truth. Eventually you will get bored. You will see that 
      only by stopping and examining your own mind can you find out what the 
      Buddha talked about. No need to go searching outside yourself. Eventually 
      you must return to face your own true nature. Here is where you can 
      understand the Dhamma.</P>
      <P><I>Q: I still have very many thoughts. My mind wanders a lot even 
      though I am trying to be mindful.</I></P>
      <P>A: Don’t worry about this. Try to keep your mind in the present. 
      Whatever there is that arises in the mind, just watch it. Let go of it. 
      Don’t even wish to be rid of thoughts. Then the mind will reach its 
      natural state. No discriminating between good and bad, hot and cold, fast 
      and slow. No me and no you, no self at all. Just what there is. When you 
      walk on alms-round, no need to do anything special. Simply walk and see 
      what there is. No need to cling to isolation or seclusion. Wherever you 
      are, know your self by being natural and watching. If doubts arise, watch 
      them come and go. It’s very simple. Hold on to nothing.</P>
      <P>It is as though you are walking down a road. Periodically you will run 
      into obstacles. When you meet defilements, just see them and just overcome 
      them by letting go of them. Don’t think about the obstacles you have 
      passed already. Don’t worry about those you have not yet seen. Stick to 
      the present. Don’t be concerned about the length of the road or about the 
      destination. Everything is changing. Whatever you pass, do not cling to 
      it. Eventually the mind will reach its natural balance where practice is 
      automatic. All things will come and go of themselves.</P>
      <P><I>Q: You have said that samatha and vipassana or concentration and 
      insight are the same. Could you explain this further?</I></P>
      <P>A: It is quite simple. Concentration (samatha) and wisdom (vipassana) 
      work together. First the mind becomes still by holding on to a meditation 
      object. It is quiet only while you are sitting with your eyes closed. This 
      is samatha and eventually this samadhi-base is the cause for wisdom or 
      vipassana to arise. Then the mind is still whether you sit with you eyes 
      closed or walk around in o busy city. It’s like this: once you were a 
      child, now you are an adult. Are the child and the adult the same person? 
      You can say that they are, or looking at it another way, you can say that 
      they are different. In this way samatha and vipassana could also be looked 
      at as separate. Or it is like food and faeces. Food and faeces could be 
      called the same and they can be called different. Don’t just believe what 
      I say, do your practice and see for yourself. Nothing special is needed. 
      If you examine how concentration and wisdom arise, you will know the truth 
      for yourself. These days many people cling to the words. They call their 
      practice samatha. It is essential to do samatha before vipassana, they 
      say. All this is silly. Don’t bother to think about it in this way. Simply 
      do the practice and you’ll see for yourself.</P>
      <P><I>Q: I feel sleepy a great deal. It makes it bard to meditate.</I></P>
      <P>A: There are many ways to overcome sleepiness. If you are sitting in 
      the dark, move to a lighted place. Open your eyes. Get up and wash your 
      face or take a bath. If you are sleepy, change postures. Walk a lot. Walk 
      backwards. The fear of running into things will keep you awake. If this 
      fails, stand still, clear the mind and imagine it is full daylight. Or sit 
      on the edge of a high cliff or deep well. You won’t dare sleep! If nothing 
      works, then just go to sleep. Lay down carefully and try to be aware until 
      the moment you fall asleep. Then as you awaken, get right up. Don’t look 
      at the clock or roll over. Start mindfulness from the moment you awaken.</P>
      <P>If you find yourself sleepy everyday, try to eat less. Examine 
      yourself. As soon as five more spoonfuls will make you full, stop. Then 
      take water until just properly full. Go and sit. Watch your sleepiness and 
      hunger. You must learn to balance your eating. As your practice goes on 
      you will feel naturally more energetic and eat less. But you must adjust 
      yourself.</P>
      <P><I>Q: I have been meditating many years now. My mind is open and 
      peaceful in almost all circumstances. Now I would like to try to backtrack 
      and practice high states of concentration or mind absorption.</I></P>
      <P>A: This is fine. It is beneficial mental exercise. If you have wisdom, 
      you will not get hung up on concentrated states of mind. It is the same as 
      wanting to sit for long periods. This is fine for training, but really, 
      practice is separate from any posture. It is a matter of directly looking 
      at the mind. This is wisdom. When you have examined and understood the 
      mind, then you have the wisdom to know the limitations of concentration, 
      or of books. If you have practiced and understand not-clinging, you can 
      then return to the books. They will be like a sweet dessert. They can help 
      you to teach others. Or you can go back to practice absorption. You have 
      the wisdom to know not to hold on to anything.</P>
