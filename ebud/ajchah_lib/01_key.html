      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="6">I</FONT>n Buddhism, the 
      primary reason we study the Dhamma (the Truth) is to find the way to 
      transcend suffering and attain peace. Whether you study physical or mental 
      phenomena, the <I>citta</I> (mind or consciousness) or <I>cetasika</I> 
      (mental factors), it is only when you make liberation from suffering your 
      ultimate goal, rather than anything else, that you will be practising in 
      the correct way. This is because suffering and its causes already exist 
      right here and now.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As you contemplate the cause of suffering, 
      you should understand that when that which we call the mind is still, it&#39;s 
      in a state of normality. As soon as it moves, it becomes <I>sankhara</I> 
      (that which is fashioned or concocted). When attraction arises in the 
      mind, it is <I>sankhara;</I> when aversion arises, it is <I>sankhara.</I> 
      If there is desire to go here and there, it is <I>sankhara.</I> As long as 
      you are not mindful of these <I>sankharas,</I> you will tend to chase 
      after them and be conditioned by them. Whenever the mind moves, it becomes
      <I>sammuti-sankhara –</I> enmeshed in the conditioned world – at that 
      moment. And it is these <I>sankharas –</I> these movements of the mind – 
      which the Buddha taught us to contemplate.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Whenever the mind moves, it is <I>aniccam</I> 
      (impermanent), <I>dukkham</I> (suffering) and <I>anatta</I> (not-self). 
      The Buddha taught us to observe and contemplate this. He taught us to 
      contemplate <I>sankharas</I> which condition the mind. Contemplate them in 
      light of the teaching of <I>paticcasamuppada</I> (Dependent Origination):
      <I>avijja</I> (ignorance) conditions <I>sankhara</I> (karmic formations);
      <I>sankhara</I> conditions <I>viññana</I> (consciousness); <I>viññana</I> 
      conditions <I>nama</I> (mentality) and <I>rupa</I> (materiality); and so 
      on.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">You have already studied and read about 
      this in the books, and what&#39;s set out there is correct as far as it goes, 
      but in reality you&#39;re not able to keep up with the process as it actually 
      occurs. It&#39;s like falling out of a tree: in a flash, you&#39;ve fallen all the 
      way from the top of the tree and hit the ground, and you have no idea how 
      many branches you passed on the way down. When the mind experiences an <I>
      arammana</I> [1] (mind-object) and is attracted to it, all of a sudden you 
      find yourself experiencing a good mood without being aware of the causes 
      and conditions which led up to it. Of course, on one level the process 
      happens according to the theory described in the scriptures, but at the 
      same time it goes beyond the limitations of the theory. In reality, there 
      are no signs telling you that now it&#39;s <I>avijja,</I> now it&#39;s <I>
      sankhara,</I> then it&#39;s <I>viññana,</I> now it&#39;s <I>nama-rupa</I> and so 
      on. These scholars who see it like that, don&#39;t get the chance to read out 
      the list as the process is taking place. Although the Buddha analysed one 
      moment of consciousness and described all the different component parts, 
      to me it&#39;s more like falling out of a tree – everything happens so fast 
      you don&#39;t have time to reckon how far you&#39;ve fallen and where you are at 
      any given moment. What you know is that you&#39;ve hit the ground with a thud, 
      and it hurts!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What takes place in the mind is similar. 
      Normally, when you experience suffering, all you really see is the end 
      result, that there is suffering, pain, grief and despair present in the 
      mind. You don&#39;t really know whore it came from – that&#39;s not something you 
      can find in the hooks. There&#39;s nowhere in the books where the intricate 
      details of your suffering and it&#39;s causes are described. The reality 
      follows along the same course as the theory outlined in the scriptures, 
      but those who simply study the books and never get beyond them, are unable 
      to keep track of these things as they actually happen in reality.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Thus the Buddha taught to abide as &#39;that 
      which knows&#39; [2] and simply bear witness to that which arises. Once you 
      have trained your awareness to abide as &#39;that which knows&#39;, and have 
      investigated the mind and developed insight into the truth about the mind 
      and mental factors, you&#39;ll see the mind as <I>anatta</I> (not-self).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">You&#39;ll see that ultimately all mental and 
      physical formations are things to be let go of and it&#39;ll be clear to you 
      that it&#39;s foolish to attach or give undue importance to them.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha didn&#39;t teach us to study the 
      mind and mental factors in order to become attached to them, he taught 
      simply to know them as <I>aniccam, dukkham, anatta.</I> The essence of 
      Buddhist practice then, is to let them go and lay them aside. You must 
      establish and sustain awareness of the mind and mental factors as they 
      arise. In fact, the mind has been brought up and conditioned to turn and 
      spin away from this natural state of awareness, giving rise to <I>sankhara</I> 
      which further concoct and fashion it. It has therefore become accustomed 
      to the experience of constant mental proliferation and of all kinds of 
      conditioning, both wholesome and unwholesome. The Buddha taught us to let 
      go of it all, but before you can begin to let go, you must first study and 
      practise. This is in accordance with nature – the way things are. The mind 
      is just that way, mental factors are just that way – this is just how it 
      is.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Consider <I>magga</I> (the Noble Eightfold 
      Path), which is founded on <I>panna</I> or Right View. If there is Right 
      View it follows that there will be Right Intention, Right Speech, Right 
      Action, Right Livelihood and so on. These all necessarily involve mental 
      factors which arise out of the knowing. The knowing is like a lantern. If 
      there is Right Knowing it will pervade every aspect of the path, giving 
      rise to Right Intention, Right Speech and so on, just like the light from 
      a lantern illuminating the path along which you have to travel. In the 
      end, whatever the mind experiences, it must arise from the knowing. If 
      this mind didn&#39;t exist, the knowing couldn&#39;t exist either. These are the 
      essential characteristics of the mind and mental factors.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">All these things are mental phenomena. The 
      Buddha taught that the mind is the mind – it&#39;s not a living being, a 
      person, a self, an &#39;us&#39; or a &#39;them&#39;. The Dhamma is simply the Dhamma – 
      it&#39;s not a living being, a person, a self, an &#39;us&#39; or a &#39;them&#39;. There&#39;s 
      nothing which is substantial. Whatever aspect of this individual existence 
      you choose, whether it&#39;s <I>vedana</I> (feelings) or <I>sañña</I> 
      (perception), for example, it all comes within the range of the five <I>
      khandhas</I> [3] (aggregates). So it should be let go of.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Meditation is like a plank of wood. Lets 
      say <I>vipassana</I> (insight) is one end of the plank and <I>samatha</I> 
      (calm) is the other. If you were to pick the plank up, would just one end 
      come up or would both of them? Of course, when you pick up the plank, both 
      ends come up together. What is <I>vipassana?</I> What is <I>samatha?</I> 
      They are the mind itself. At first the mind becomes peaceful through the 
      practice of <I>samatha,</I> through <I>samadhi</I> (firmness of mind). By 
      developing <I>samadhi</I> you can make the mind peaceful. However, if the 
      peace of <I>samadhi</I> disappears, suffering arises. Why does suffering 
      arise? Because the kind of peace which comes through <I>samatha</I> is 
      itself <I>samudaya</I> (the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering). It&#39;s 
      a cause for suffering to arise. Even though a certain state of peace has 
      been attained, the practice is not yet finished. The Buddha saw from his 
      own experience, that this isn&#39;t the end of the practice. The process of 
      becoming is not yet completely exhausted; the conditions for continued 
      birth still exist; the practice of the Holy Life is still incomplete. Why 
      is it incomplete? Because suffering still exists. He thus took up the calm 
      of <I>samatha</I> and continued to contemplate it, investigating to gain 
      insight until he was no longer attached to it. Such calm is one kind of <I>
      sankhara</I> and is still part of the world of conditions and conventions. 
      Attaching to the calm of <I>samatha</I> means attaching to the world of 
      conditions and conventions and as long as you are attached to conditions 
      and conventions, you are attached to becoming and birth. That act of 
      taking delight in the tranquillity of <I>samatha</I> is becoming and 
      birth. When that restless and agitated thinking disappears through the 
      practice of <I>samatha,</I> the mind attaches to the resultant peace, but 
      it&#39;s another form of becoming. It still leads to further birth.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The cycle of becoming and birth arose 
      again and, of course, the Buddha was immediately aware of it. The Buddha 
      went on to contemplate the causes behind becoming and birth. As long as he 
      was unable to completely comprehend the truth of this matter, he continued 
      to use the tranquil mind as a means to penetrate deeper and deeper with 
      his contemplation. He reflected upon all formations that arose, whether 
      peaceful or agitated, until eventually he saw that all conditions are like 
      a lump of red-hot iron. The five <I>khandhas</I> are just like this. When 
      a piece of iron is glowing red hot all over, is there any part of it you 
      can touch without getting burnt? Can there be anywhere at all which is 
      cool? If you tried touching it on the top, the sides, underneath, or 
      anywhere, would you be able to find a single spot which was cool? 
      Obviously there wouldn&#39;t be a cool place anywhere, because that lump of 
      iron is red-hot all over. Similarly, each of the five <I>khandhas</I> is 
      as if red hot to the touch. It&#39;s a mistake to attach to calm states of 
      mind, or think that the calm is you or that there is a self which is calm. 
      If you presume that the calm is you or that there is someone who is calm, 
      this only reinforces the idea that there&#39;s a solid entity, a self or <I>
      atta.</I> But this sense of self is just conventional reality. If you 
      attach to the thought &#39;I&#39;m peaceful&#39;, &#39;I&#39;m agitated&#39;, &#39;I&#39;m good&#39;, &#39;I&#39;m 
      bad&#39;, &#39;I&#39;m happy&#39; or &#39;I&#39;m suffering&#39;, it means you are caught in more 
      becoming and birth. It&#39;s more suffering. When happiness disappears it 
      changes to suffering. If the suffering disappears it becomes happiness. 
      And you get caught endlessly spinning around between happiness and 
      suffering, heaven and hell, unable to put a stop to it.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha observed that his mind was 
      conditioned in this way and reflected that the causes for becoming and 
      birth were still present and the practice was still unfinished. As a 
      result, he deepened his contemplation of the true nature of <I>sankharas</I> 
      – because a cause exists, there is accordingly birth and death and these 
      characteristics of movement back and forth in the mind. He contemplated 
      this repeatedly to see clearly the truth about the five <I>khandhas.</I> 
      All physical and all mental phenomena and everything that the mind thinks 
      are <I>sankharas.</I> The Buddha taught that once you have discerned this, 
      you&#39;ll let them go, you&#39;ll naturally give them up. These things should he 
      known as they are in reality. As long us you don&#39;t know things in 
      accordance with the truth you have no choice but to suffer. You can&#39;t let 
      go of them. But once you have penetrated the truth and understand how 
      things are, you see these things as deluding. This is what the Buddha 
      meant when he explained that really, the mind which has seen the truth of 
      the way things are is empty, it is inherently unentangled with anything. 
      It isn&#39;t born belonging to anyone and it doesn&#39;t die as anyone&#39;s. It is 
      free. It is bright and radiant, free from any involvement with external 
      affairs and issues. The reason it gets entangled with external affairs is 
      because it&#39;s deluded by <I>sankharas</I> and the very sense of self.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha thus taught us to look 
      carefully at the mind. In the beginning what was there? There was really 
      nothing there. The process of birth and becoming and these movements of 
      mind weren&#39;t born with it and they don&#39;t die with it. When the Buddha&#39;s 
      mind encountered pleasant mind-objects, it didn&#39;t become delighted with 
      them, contacting disagreeable mind-objects, he didn&#39;t become averse to 
      them – because he had clear knowledge and insight into the nature of the 
      mind. There was the penetrating knowledge that all such phenomena have no 
      real substance or essence to them. He saw them as <I>aniccam, dukkham, 
      anatta</I> and maintained this deep and profound insight throughout his 
      practice.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is the knowing which discerns the truth 
      of the way things are. The knowing doesn&#39;t become delighted or sad with 
      things. The condition of being delighted is &#39;birth&#39; and the condition of 
      being distressed is &#39;death&#39;. If there is death there must be birth, if 
      there is birth there must be death. This process of birth and death is <I>
      vatta</I> - the cycle of birth and death which continues on endlessly.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As long as the mind of the practitioner 
      gets conditioned and moved around like this, there need be no doubt as to 
      whether the causes for becoming or rebirth still remain; there is no need 
      to ask anyone. The Buddha thoroughly contemplated the characteristics of
      <I>sankharas</I> and as a result could let go of <I>sankharas</I> and each 
      of the five <I>khandhas.</I> He became an independent observer, simply 
      acknowledging their existence and nothing more. If he experienced pleasant 
      mind-objects, he didn&#39;t become infatuated with them, but simply watched 
      and remained aware of them. If he experienced unpleasant mind-objects, he 
      didn&#39;t become averse towards them. Why was that? Because he had discerned 
      the truth and so the causes and conditions for further birth had been cut 
      off. The conditions supporting birth no longer existed. His mind had 
      progressed in the practice to the point where it had gained its own 
      confidence and certainty in its understanding. It was a mind which was 
      truly peaceful – free from birth, ageing, sickness and death. It was that 
      which was neither cause nor effect, nor dependent on cause and effect; it 
      was independent of the process of causal conditioning. There were no 
      causes remaining, they were exhausted. His mind had transcended birth and 
      death, happiness and suffering, good and evil. It was beyond the 
      limitations of words and concepts. There were no longer any conditions 
      which would give rise to attachment in his mind. Anything to do with 
      attachment to birth and death and the process of causal conditioning, 
      would be a matter of the mind and mental factors.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The mind and mental factors do exist as 
      part of reality. They truly exist in conventional reality, but the Buddha 
      saw that however much we know about them or believe in them, it&#39;s of 
      little real benefit. It is not the way to find real peace. He taught that 
      once you know them, you should put them down, renounce them, let them go. 
      Because the mind and mental factors are the very things which lead you to 
      both that which is wrong and that which is right in life. If you are wise, 
      they can lead you to what is right; if you are foolish they lead you to 
      what is wrong. The mind and mental factors are the world. The Buddha used 
      the things of the world to observe the world. Having observed the way 
      things are, he came to know the world and described himself as being <I>
      lokavidu</I> – one who clearly knows the world.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>Samatha</I> and <I>vipassana</I> must 
      be developed in yourself before you can really know the truth. It&#39;s 
      possible to study from the books to gain theoretical knowledge of the mind 
      and mental factors, but you can&#39;t use that kind of knowledge to actually 
      cut off greed, hatred and delusion. You have only studied about the 
      external characteristics of greed, hatred and delusion and are simply 
      describing the different features of the defilements... greed is like 
      this, hatred is like that and so on. You only know as much as their 
      external qualities and superficial appearance, and can only talk about 
      them on that level. You might have developed some awareness and insight, 
      but the important thing is that when the defilements actually arise in the 
      mind, does it fall under their control and take on their features? For 
      instance, when you encounter an undesirable mind-object, a reaction will 
      occur which leads to the mind taking on certain qualities. Do you attach 
      to that reaction? Can you let go of your reaction? Once you become aware 
      of aversion that has arisen, does &#39;that which knows&#39; store that aversion 
      in the mind, or having seen it, is &#39;that which knows&#39; able to let it go 
      immediately?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If, having experienced something you 
      dislike, you still store up aversion in the mind, you must take your 
      practice back to square one. Because you are still at fault; the practice 
      is still not perfect. If it reaches the point of perfection, the mind will 
      automatically let things go. Look at the practice in this way. You really 
      have to look deeply into your mind for the practice to become <I>paccatam</I> 
      [4]. If you tried to describe the mind and mental factors in terms of the 
      number of separate moments of consciousness and their different 
      characteristics in accordance with the theory, it still wouldn&#39;t be nearly 
      enough. The truth has much more to it than this. If you are really going 
      to learn about these things, you must gain clear insight and direct 
      understanding to penetrate them. If you don&#39;t have any true insight, how 
      will you ever get beyond the theory? There&#39;s no end to it. You would have 
      to keep studying it indefinitely.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Thus the practice is thus the most 
      important thing. In my own practice, I didn&#39;t spend all my time studying 
      all the theoretical descriptions of the mind and mental factors – I 
      watched &#39;that which knows&#39;. When the mind had thoughts of aversion I 
      asked, &#39;Why is there aversion?&#39; If there was attraction I asked, &#39;Why is 
      there attraction?&#39; This is the way to practise. I didn&#39;t know all the 
      finer points of theory or go into a detailed analytical break down of the 
      mind and mental factors. I just kept prodding at that one point in the 
      mind, until I was able to settle the whole issue of aversion and 
      attraction and make it completely vanish. Whatever happened, if I could 
      bring my mind to the point where it stopped liking and disliking, it had 
      gone beyond suffering. It had reached the point where it could remain at 
      ease, whatever it was experiencing. There was no craving or attachment ... 
      it had stopped. This is what you&#39;re aiming for in the practice. If other 
      people want to talk a lot about the theory that&#39;s their business. In the 
      end, though, however much you talk about it, the practice has to come back 
      to this point. Even if you don&#39;t talk much about it, the practice still 
      comes back to this point. Whether you proliferate a lot or a little, it 
      all comes back to this. If there is birth, it comes from this. If there is 
      extinction, this is where the extinction occurs. However much the mind 
      proliferates, it doesn&#39;t make any difference. The Buddha called this place 
      &#39;that which knows&#39;. It has the function of knowing according to the truth 
      of the way things are. Once you have really discerned the truth, you 
      automatically know the way the mind and the mental factors are.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The mind and the mental factor constantly 
      deceive you, never letting up for a moment. When studying the books, you 
      are merely studying the external form of&#39; this deception. At the same time 
      as you are studying about those things, they&#39;re deceiving you – there&#39;s no 
      other way of putting it, Even though you are aware of them, they are still 
      deluding you right at that moment. This is the way it is. The Buddha 
      didn&#39;t intend that you should only know about suffering and the 
      defilements by name, his aim was for you to actually find the way of 
      practice which will lead you to transcend suffering. He taught to 
      investigate and find the cause of suffering from the most basic to the 
      most refined level. As for myself, I have been able to practise without a 
      great amount of theoretical knowledge. It&#39;s enough to know that the Path 
      begins with <I>sila</I> (moral restraint). <I>Sila</I> is that which is 
      beautiful in the beginning. <I>Samadhi</I> is that which is beautiful in 
      the middle. <I>Panna</I> (wisdom) is that which is beautiful in the end. 
      As you deepen your practice and contemplation of these three aspects, they 
      merge and become one thing, although you can still see them as three 
      separate parts of the practice.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As a prerequisite for training in <I>sila, 
      panna</I> must actually be there, but we usually say that the practice 
      begins with <I>sila.</I> It&#39;s the foundation. It&#39;s just that <I>panna</I> 
      is the factor that determines just how successful and complete the 
      practice of <I>sila</I> is. You need to contemplate your speech and 
      actions and investigate the process of cause and effect – which is all a 
      function of <I>panna.</I> You have to depend on <I>panna</I> before <I>
      sila</I> can be established.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">According to the theory, we say that it&#39;s
      <I>sila, samadhi</I> and then <I>panna;</I> but I&#39;ve reflected on this and 
      found that <I>panna</I> underlies all the other aspects of the practice. 
      You need to fully understand the effects of your speech and actions on the 
      mind and how it is that they can bring about harmful results. Through 
      reasoned reflection you use <I>panna</I> to guide, control and thereby 
      purify your actions and speech. If you know the different characteristics 
      of your actions and speech which are conditioned by both wholesome and 
      unwholesome mental states, you can see the place of practice. You see that 
      if you&#39;re going to cultivate <I>sila,</I> it involves giving up evil and 
      doing good; giving up that which is wrong and doing that which is right. 
      Once the mind has given up doing wrong and has cultivated doing what is 
      right, it will automatically turn inwards to us upon itself and become 
      firm and steady. When it&#39;s free from doubt and uncertainty about speech 
      and actions, the mind will be steadfast and unwavering, providing the 
      basis for becoming firmly concentrated in <I>samadhi.</I> This firm 
      concentration forms the second and more powerful source of energy in the 
      practice, allowing you to more fully contemplate the sights, sounds and 
      other sense objects which you experience. Once the mind is established 
      with firm and unwavering calm and mindfulness, you can engage in the 
      sustained contemplation of form, feeling, perception, thought and 
      consciousness, and with the sights, sounds, smells, tastes, tactile 
      sensations and mind-objects, and see that all of these are constantly 
      arising. As a result you will gain insight into the truth of these 
      phenomena and how they arise according to their own nature. When there is 
      continuous awareness, it will be the cause for <I>panna</I> to arise. Once 
      there is clear knowledge in accordance with the true nature of the way 
      things are, your old <I>sañña</I> and sense of self will gradually be 
      uprooted from it&#39;s former conditioning and will be transformed into <I>
      panna.</I> Ultimately, <I>sila</I>, <I>samadhi</I> and <I>panna</I> will 
      merge in the practice, as one lasting and unified whole.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As <I>panna</I> strengthens, it acts to 
      develop <I>samadhi</I> which becomes steadier and more unshakeable. The 
      firmer <I>samadhi</I> becomes, the more resolute and complete <I>sila</I> 
      becomes. As <I>sila</I> is perfected, it nurtures <I>samadhi,</I> and the 
      strengthening of <I>samadhi</I> leads to a maturing of <I>panna.</I> These 
      three aspects of the practice are pretty much inseparable – they overlap 
      so much. Growing together, they combine to form what the Buddha called <I>
      magga,</I> the Path. When <I>sila</I>, <I>samadhi</I> and <I>panna</I> 
      reach their peak, <I>magga</I> has enough power to destroy the <I>kilesa</I> 
      [5]<I>. </I>Whether it be greed, hatred or delusion which arises, it is 
      only the strength of <I>magga</I> which is capable of destroying it.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The four Noble Truths taught by the Buddha 
      as a framework for practice are: <I>dukkha</I> (suffering), <I>samudaya</I> 
      (the cause of suffering), <I>nirodha</I> (the end of suffering) and <I>
      magga</I> (the path leading to the end of suffering) which consists of <I>
      sila</I>, <I>samadhi</I> and <I>panna</I> – modes of training which exist 
      the mind. Although I say these three words <I>sila, samadhi, panna</I> out 
      loud, they don&#39;t exist externally, they are rooted in the mind itself.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is the nature of <I>sila</I>, <I>
      samadhi</I> and <I>panna</I> to be at work continuously, maturing all the 
      time. If <I>magga</I> is strong in the mind, whatever objects are 
      experienced – whether they are forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tactile 
      sensations or thoughts – it will be in control. If m<I>agga</I> is weak, 
      the <I>kilesa</I> can take control. If <I>magga </I>is strong it will 
      destroy the <I>kilesa.</I> When it&#39;s weak and the <I>kilesa</I> are 
      strong, <I>magga</I> will be destroyed. The <I>kilesa</I> can destroy your 
      very heart. If mindfulness isn&#39;t fast enough as forms, feelings, 
      perceptions and thoughts arise into consciousness, they can destroy you.
      <I>Magga</I> and the <I>kilesa</I> thus proceed side by side. The place 
      where you put effort into the practice is the heart. You have to keep 
      sparring with the <I>kilesa</I> every step of the way. It&#39;s as if there 
      are two separate people arguing inside your mind, but it&#39;s just <I>magga</I> 
      and the <I>kilesa</I> struggling with each other. <I>Magga</I> functions 
      to control the mind and fosters your ability to contemplate the Dhamma. As 
      long as you are able to contemplate, the <I>kilesa</I> will be losing the 
      battle. But if at any time your practice weakens and the <I>kilesa</I> 
      regain their strength, <I>magga</I> will disappear and the <I>kilesa</I> 
      will take its place. Necessarily, the two sides continue their struggle 
      like this, until eventually there is a winner and the whole affair is 
      settled. If you centre your efforts on developing <I>magga,</I> it will 
      continue to destroy the defilements. Ultimately, <I>dukkha, samudaya, 
      nirodha</I> and <I>magga</I> will come to exist in your heart – that&#39;s 
      when you will have really practised with and penetrated the Four Noble 
      Truths.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Whatever suffering arises, in whatever 
      form, it must have a cause – that is <I>samudaya,</I> the second Noble 
      Truth. What is the cause? The cause is that your practice of <I>sila</I>,
      <I>samadhi</I> and <I>panna</I> is weak. When <I>magga</I> is weak, the <I>
      kilesa</I> can take hold of the mind. When they do take over the mind, 
      they become <I>samudaya</I> and inescapably give rise to different kinds 
      of suffering. If suffering arises it means that the aspect which is able 
      to extinguish suffering has disappeared. The factors which give rise to <I>
      magga</I> are <I>sila, samadhi</I> and <I>panna.</I> When they have 
      reached their full strength, the practice of <I>magga</I> will advance 
      inexorably, and will destroy <I>samudaya</I> – that which is able to cause 
      suffering in the mind. It is then – when suffering is in abeyance, unable 
      to arise because the practice of <I>magga</I> is in the process of cutting 
      through the <I>kilesa</I> – that suffering actually dies out in the mind. 
      Why are you able to extinguish suffering? Because the practice of <I>sila</I>,
      <I>samadhi</I> and <I>panna</I> has reached its highest level, which means 
      that <I>magga</I> has reached the point where its progress has become 
      unstoppable. I say that if you can practice like this, it will no longer 
      matter where you have got to in studying the theoretical knowledge of the 
      mind and mental factors, because in the end everything unifies in this one 
      place. If the mind has transcended conceptual knowledge, it will be very 
      confident and certain in the practice, having gone beyond all doubt. Even 
      if it starts to wander off, you won&#39;t have to chase it very far to bring 
      it back onto the path.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What are leaves of the mango tree like? 
      It&#39;s enough just to pick up one leaf and look at it to know. Even if you 
      look at ten thousand leaves, you won&#39;t see much more than you do looking 
      at one. Essentially they are all the same. By looking at one leaf, you can 
      know all mango leaves. If you look at the trunk of the mango tree, you 
      only have to look at the trunk of one tree to know them all. All the other 
      mango tree trunks are the same. Even if there were a hundred thousand of 
      them, I would just have to look at one to really see them all. The Buddha 
      taught to practise Dhamma in this way.</FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">S</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>ila</I>,
      <I>samadhi</I> and <I>panna</I> are what the Buddha called <I>magga</I>, 
      but <I>magga is</I> still not the heart of the Buddha&#39;s teaching. It&#39;s not 
      an end in itself and wasn&#39;t really what the Buddha wanted, just by itself. 
      But it is the way which leads inwards. It would be like travelling from 
      Bangkok to this monastery, Wat Nong Pah Pong. What you want is to reach 
      the monastery, you don&#39;t actually want the road or the tarmac itself, but 
      you&#39;d need to use the road for the journey to the monastery. The road and 
      the monastery are not the same thing the road is simply the way to the 
      monastery – but you have to follow the road if you want to reach the 
      monastery.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">You could say that neither <I>sila, 
      samadhi</I> nor <I>panna</I> form the heart of Buddhism, but they do form 
      the pathway by which the heart of Buddhism can be reached. Once you have 
      practised with <I>sila</I>, <I>samadhi</I> and <I>panna</I> to the highest 
      level, peace arises as a result. This is the ultimate aim of the practice. 
      Once the mind is calm, even if you hear a sound it doesn&#39;t disturb it. 
      Having attained such calm, you no longer create anything in the mind. The 
      Buddha taught letting go. So whatever you experience, you don&#39;t have to 
      fear or worry. The practice reaches the point where it is truly paccatam 
      and because you have direct insight, you no longer simply have to believe 
      what other people say.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Buddhism is not founded on anything 
      strange or unusual. It doesn&#39;t depend on different kinds of miraculous 
      displays of psychic powers or super human abilities. The Buddha did not 
      praise or encourage those things. Such powers might exist and with your 
      practice of meditation it might be possible to develop them, but the 
      Buddha didn&#39;t praise or encourage them because they are potentially 
      deluding. The only people he did praise were those beings who were able to 
      free themselves from suffering. To do this they had to depend on the 
      practice – our tools which are <I>dana</I> (generosity), <I>sila, samadhi</I> 
      and <I>panna.</I> These are what we have to train with.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">These things form the way which leads 
      inwards, but in order to reach the final destination, there must first be
      <I>panna</I> to ensure the development of <I>magga. Magga</I> or the 
      Eightfold Noble Path means <I>sila, samadhi</I> and <I>panna.</I> It 
      cannot grow if the mind is covered over with <I>kilesa.</I> If <I>magga</I> 
      is strong it can destroy the <I>kilesa;</I> if the <I>kilesa</I> are 
      strong, they destroy <I>magga.</I> The practice simply involves these two 
      things battling it out until the end of the path is reached. They have to 
      struggle continuously, not ceasing, until the goal is reached.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The tools and supports of the practice are 
      things which involve hardship and difficulty. We must depend on patience 
      and endurance, restraint and frugality. We must do the practice for 
      ourselves, so that it arises from within and really has transforms our own 
      minds.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Scholars however, tend to doubt a lot. 
      When they are sitting in meditation, as soon as there is a little bit of 
      calm they start to wonder if perhaps they have reached first <I>jhana</I> 
      [6]. They tend to think like this. But as soon as they start 
      proliferating, the mind turns away from the object and they become 
      completely distracted from the meditation. In a moment they&#39;re off again, 
      thinking that it&#39;s second <I>jhana</I> already. Don&#39;t start proliferating 
      about such matters. There aren&#39;t any signposts that tell you which level 
      of concentration you have reached; it&#39;s completely different. There are no 
      signs which sprout up and say, &#39;This way to Wat Nong Pah Pong&#39;. There 
      isn&#39;t anything for you to read along the way. There are many famous 
      teachers who have given descriptions of the first, second, third and 
      fourth <I>jhana</I>, but this information exists externally in the books. 
      If the mind has really entered into such deep levels of calm, it doesn&#39;t 
      know anything about such descriptions. There is awareness, but this is not 
      the same as the knowledge you gain from studying the theory. If those who 
      have studied the theory hang on to what they have learnt when they sit 
      meditation, taking notes on their experience and wondering whether they 
      have reached <I>jhana</I> yet, their minds will be distracted right there 
      and turn away from the meditation. They won&#39;t gain real understanding. Why 
      is that? Because there is desire. As soon as <I>tanha</I> (craving) 
      arises, whatever the meditation you are doing, it won&#39;t develop because 
      the mind withdraws. It is essential that you learn how to give up all 
      thinking and doubting, give it up completely, all of it. You should just 
      take body, speech end mind as it is, as the basis for the practice and 
      nothing else. Contemplate the conditions of the mind, and don&#39;t lug the 
      textbooks along with you. There are no textbooks within where you are 
      doing the practice. If you try to take them in there with you, everything 
      goes to waste, because they won&#39;t be able to describe how things are as 
      you actually experience them.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">People who have studied a lot and have all 
      the theory down pat, tend not to succeed with meditation because they get 
      stuck at the level of information. In actuality, the mind isn&#39;t something 
      which you can really measure using external standards or textbooks. If 
      it&#39;s really getting calm, allow it to become calm. In this way it can 
      proceed to reach the very highest levels of tranquillity. My own knowledge 
      of the theory and scriptures was only modest. I&#39;ve already told some of 
      the monks about the time I was practising in my third rains retreat; I 
      still had many questions and doubts about <I>samadhi</I>, I kept trying to 
      work it out with my thoughts and the more I meditated, the more restless 
      and agitated the mind became. In fact it was so bad that I would actually 
      feel more peaceful when I wasn&#39;t meditating. It was really difficult. But 
      even though it was difficult, I didn&#39;t give up. I kept on practising, just 
      the same. If I simply did the practice without having many expectations 
      about the results, it was fine. But if I determined to make my mind calm 
      and one-pointed, it would just make things worse. I couldn&#39;t work it out. 
      &#39;Why is it like this?&#39; I asked myself.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Later on I began to realise that it&#39;s the 
      same as with the matter of breathing. If you determine to take only short 
      breaths, or to take ‘ only medium size breaths, or to take only long 
      breaths, it seems like a difficult thing to do. On the other hand, when 
      you are walking around, unaware of whether the breath is going in or going 
      out, you are comfortable and at ease. I realised that the practice is 
      similar. Normally, when people are walking around and not meditating on 
      the breath, do they ever suffer because of their breathing? No. It&#39;s not 
      really such a problem. But if I sat down and determined to make my mind 
      calm, it would automatically become <I>upadana</I> (attachment), there was 
      clinging in there too. I became so determined to force the breath to be a 
      certain way, either short or long, that it became uneven and it was 
      impossible to concentrate or keep my mind on it. So then I was suffering 
      even more than I had been before I started meditating. Why was that? 
      Because my determination itself became attachment. It shut off awareness 
      and I couldn&#39;t get any results. Everything was burdensome and difficult 
      because I was taking craving into the practice with me.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">On one occasion I was walking <I>cankama</I> 
      [7] sometime after eleven o&#39;clock at night. There was a festival going on 
      in the village, which was about half a mile from the forest, monastery 
      where I was staying. I was feeling strange, and had been feeling like that 
      since the middle of the day. I was feeling unusually calm and wasn&#39;t 
      thinking very much about anything. I was tired from walking meditation, so 
      I went to sit in my small grass-roofed hut. Then just as I was sitting 
      down, I found I had barely enough time to tuck my legs in before my mind 
      went into this deep place of calm. It happened just by itself. By the time 
      I got myself into the sitting posture the mind was already deeply calm and 
      I felt completely firm and stable in the meditation. It wasn&#39;t that I 
      couldn&#39;t hear the sounds of people singing and dancing in the village; I 
      could still hear them. But at the same time, I could turn my attention 
      inwards so that I couldn&#39;t hear the sounds as well. It was strange. When I 
      paid no attention to the sounds there was silence, I couldn&#39;t hear 
      anything. But if I wanted to I could hear them and without feeling 
      disturbed. It was as if inside my mind there were two different objects 
      placed side by side, but not connected to one another. I could see that 
      the mind and the object were separate and distinct, just like the water 
      kettle and the spittoon here. As a result I understood that when the mind 
      is calm in <I>samadhi</I>, if you direct your attention towards sounds, 
      you can hear them, but if you remain with the mind, in its emptiness, it 
      remains quiet. If a sound arises into consciousness and you watch what 
      happens, you see that the knowing and the mind-object are quite separate.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So I reflected: &#39;If this isn&#39;t it, then 
      what else could be. This is the way it is – the two phenomena aren&#39;t 
      connected at all.&#39; I continued to contemplate until I realised the 
      importance of this point: when <I>santati</I> (the continuity of things) 
      was broken, the result was <I>santi</I> (peace of mind). Formally there 
      was <I>santati</I> and now <I>santi</I> had emerged from it. The 
      experience of this gave me energy to persist with my meditation. I put 
      intense effort into the practice and was indifferent to everything else, 
      the mind didn&#39;t lose its mindfulness even for an instant. If I&#39;d wanted to 
      stop meditating, however, I would have easily done so. And once I did stop 
      formal practice, was there any laziness, tiredness or irritation? None at 
      all. The mind was completely free from such defilements. What was left was 
      the sense of complete balance or &#39;just-rightness&#39; in the mind. If I was 
      going to stop, it would just have been to rest the body, not for anything 
      else.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Virtually I did take a break. I just 
      stopped sitting so formally, but the mind didn&#39;t stop. It remained in the 
      same state and continued with the meditation as before. I pulled over my 
      pillow and prepared to rest. As I lay down, my mind was still just as 
      calm. As I was about to lay my head on the pillow, the mind inclined 
      inwards – I didn&#39;t know where it was headed, but it kept moving deeper and 
      deeper within. It was as if someone had turned on a switch and sent an 
      electric current along a cable. With a deafening bang, the body exploded 
      from the inside. The awareness inside the mind at that moment was at it&#39;s 
      most refined. Having passed beyond a certain point, it was as if the mind 
      was cut loose and had penetrated to the deepest, quietest spot inside. It 
      settled there in a realm of complete emptiness. Absolutely nothing could 
      penetrate it from outside. Nothing could reach it. Having stayed in there 
      for a while, awareness then withdrew. I don&#39;t mean to say that I made it 
      withdraw; I was merely watching – just witnessing what was going on. 
      Having experienced these things, the mind gradually withdrew and returned 
      to its normal state.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Once the mind had returned to normal, the 
      question arose: &#39;What happened?&#39; The reply that came to it was, &#39;These 
      things are natural phenomena which occur according to causes and 
      conditions; there&#39;s no need to doubt about them.&#39; I only needed to reflect 
      a little like this and the mind accepted it. Having paused for a while, it 
      inclined inwards again. I didn&#39;t make any conscious effort to direct the 
      mind, it went by itself. As it continued to move deeper and deeper 
      inwards, it hit the same switch like before. This time the body shattered 
      into the most minute and refined particles. Again, the mind was cut loose 
      and slipped deep inside itself. Silence. It was at an even deeper level of 
      calm than before – nothing could penetrate it. Following it&#39;s own 
      momentum, the mind stayed like that some time and then withdrew as it 
      wished. Everything was happening automatically. There was no one 
      influencing or directing events; I didn&#39;t try to make things happen, to 
      enter that state or withdraw from it in any particular way. I was simply 
      keeping with the knowing and watching. Eventually, the mind withdrew to a 
      state of normality, without stimulating any more doubts. I continued to 
      contemplate and the mind inclined inwards again. The third time I had the 
      experience of the whole world completely disintegrating. The earth, 
      vegetation, trees, mountains, in fact the entire planet appeared as <I>
      akasa-dhatu</I> (the space element). There were no people or anything else 
      left at all. At this last stage there was complete emptiness.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The mind continued to dwell within on it&#39;s 
      own peacefully, without being forced. I don&#39;t know how to explain how it 
      happened like that, or why. It&#39;s difficult to describe the experience or 
      talk about it in a way that anyone else could understand. There&#39;s nothing 
      you can compare it with. The last time the mind stayed in that state far 
      longer and then when its time was up, it withdrew. Saying that the mind 
      withdrew, doesn&#39;t mean that I was controlling it and making it withdraw – 
      it withdrew by itself. I simply watched as it returned to normal. Who 
      could say what happened on these three occasions? Who could describe it? 
      Maybe there&#39;s no need to describe it?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="6">W</FONT>hat I have been telling you about here concerns 
      the pure nature of mind as it is experienced in reality. This hasn&#39;t been 
      a theoretical analysis of the mind or mental factors. There isn&#39;t any need 
      for that. The things which really are needed are confidence in the 
      teachings and the sincerity to keep deepening the practice. You have to 
      put your life on the line. When the time comes, the whole world turns 
      upside down. Your view and understanding of reality is completely 
      transformed. If other people see you at that time, they might think that 
      you&#39;re insane. If it happened to someone who couldn&#39;t maintain their 
      mindfulness and rationality, they might really go crazy, because after 
      such an experience, nothing is the same as before. The way you view people 
      in the world is no longer the same, but you are the only one who has seen 
      things like this. Your whole sense of reality changes. The way you think 
      about things alters – when other people think in one way, you think in 
      another. They talk about things one way, you another. While they go up 
      that way, you go down this way. You are no longer the same as other human 
      beings. From then on you have this experience often and it can last for a 
      long time.</P>
      <P>Try it out for yourselves. If you have this kind of experience in your 
      practice, you won&#39;t have to go looking for anything far away; just keep 
      observing the mind. At this level, the mind is at its boldest and most 
      confident. This is the power and energy of the mind. It&#39;s much more 
      powerful than you&#39;d ever expect.</P>
      <P>This is the power of <I>samadhi</I>. At this stage it is still just the 
      power that the mind derives from <I>samadhi</I> alone. If <I>samadhi</I> 
      reaches this level, it is at it&#39;s deepest and strongest. It&#39;s no longer a 
      matter of controlling the mind through suppression or momentary periods of 
      concentration. It has reached its peak. If you were to use such 
      concentration as a basis for practising <I>vipassana</I>, you would be 
      able to contemplate fluently. From here onwards it could also be used in 
      other ways, such as to develop psychic powers or perform miraculous feats. 
      Different ascetics and religious practitioners use such concentration in 
      various ways, such as casting spells and making Holy Water, charms and 
      talismans. Having reached this point, the mind can be used and developed 
      in many different ways and each might be good in it&#39;s own way, but it&#39;s 
      the kind of good like a good drink: once you&#39;ve had it you become 
      intoxicated. That kind of good is ultimately of little use.</P>
      <P>The calm mind is like a resting place for the practitioner. The Buddha 
      rested here as it forms the base from which to practise <I>vipassana</I> 
      and to contemplate the truth. At this point you only need to maintain a 
      modest level of <I>samadhi</I>, your main function is to direct your 
      attention to observing the conditions of the world around you. You 
      contemplate steadily the process of cause and effect. Using the clarity of 
      the mind, you reflect on all the sights, sounds, smells, tastes and 
      tactile sensations you experience, and how they give rise to different 
      moods: good, bad, pleasant or unpleasant. It&#39;s as if someone were to climb 
      up a mango tree and shake the fruit down while you wait underneath to 
      collect up all those that fall. You reject any mangoes which are rotten, 
      keeping only the good ones. That way, you don&#39;t have to expend much 
      energy, because rather than climbing the tree yourself, you simply wait to 
      collect the mangoes at the bottom.</P>
      <P>This means that when the mind is calm, all the mind-objects you 
      experience bring you knowledge and understanding. Because there is 
      awareness you are no longer creating or proliferating around these things. 
      Success and failure, good reputation and bad reputation, praise and 
      criticism, happiness and suffering, all come and go by themselves. With a 
      clear, still mind that is endowed with insight it&#39;s interesting to sift 
      through them and sort them out. All these mind-objects which you 
      experience – whether it&#39;s the praise, criticism or things that you hear 
      from other people, or any of the other kinds of happiness and suffering 
      which you experience – become a source of benefit for you. Because someone 
      else has climbed up the mango tree and is shaking it to make the mangoes 
      fall down to you. You can gather them up at your leisure. You don&#39;t have 
      to fear anything – why should you fear anything when it&#39;s someone else who 
      is up the tree, shaking the mangoes down for you? All forms of gain and 
      loss, good reputation and bad reputation, praise and criticism, happiness 
      and suffering, are like the mangoes which fall down to you. The calm mind 
      forms the basis for your contemplation, as you gather them up. With 
      mindfulness, you know which fruits are good and which are rotten. This 
      practice of reflection, based on the foundation of calm, is what gives 
      rise to <I>panna</I> or <I>vipassana</I>. It&#39;s not something that has to 
      be created or concocted – if there is genuine insight, then the practice 
      of <I>vipassana</I> will follow automatically, without you having to 
      invent names or labels for it. If there is a small amount of clarity, this 
      gives rise to small <I>vipassana</I>; if it&#39;s deeper insight, it is 
      &#39;medium <I>vipassana</I>&#39;. If there is complete knowledge and insight into 
      the truth of the way things are, it is &#39;complete <I>vipassana&#39;.</I> The 
      practice of <I>vipassana</I> is a matter of <I>panna</I>. It&#39;s difficult. 
      You can&#39;t do it just like that. It must proceed from a mind that already 
      has achieved a certain level of calm. Once this is established, <I>
      vipassana</I> develops naturally with the use of <I>panna</I> – it&#39;s not 
      something you can force on the mind.</P>
      <P>As a result of his experience, the Buddha taught that the practice has 
      to develop naturally, according to conditions. Having reached this level, 
      you allow things to develop according to your accumulated wholesome <I>
      kamma</I> [8] and <I>parami</I> [9]. This doesn&#39;t mean you stop putting 
      effort into the practice, but that you continue with the understanding 
      that whether you progress swiftly or slowly, it&#39;s not something you can 
      force. It&#39;s like planting a tree, it knows by itself the appropriate pace 
      to grow at. If you crave to get quick results, see that as delusion. Even 
      if you want to it to grow slowly, see that as delusion also. As with 
      planting the tree, only when you do the practice will you get the result. 
      If you plant a chilli bush for instance, your duty is simply to dig the 
      hole, plant the seedling, give it water and fertiliser and protect it from 
      insects. This is your job, your part of it. Then it&#39;s a matter of trust. 
      For the chilli plant, how it grows is it&#39;s own affair – it&#39;s not your 
      business. You can&#39;t go pulling at it to make it grow faster. Nature 
      doesn&#39;t work like that. Your job is just to water it and give it 
      fertiliser.</P>
      <P>When you practice like this, there&#39;s not much suffering. Whether you 
      reach enlightenment in this lifetime or the next, is not important. If you 
      have faith and confidence in the efficacy of the practice, then whether 
      you progress quickly or slowly, can be left up to your accumulated good <I>
      kamma</I>, spiritual qualities and <I>parami</I>. If you see it this way, 
      you feel at ease with the practice. It&#39;s like when you are driving a horse 
      and cart, you don&#39;t put the cart before the horse. Before you were putting 
      the cart before the horse. Or if you were ploughing a field, you would be 
      walking ahead of the buffalo, in other words, the mind would have been 
      restless and impatient to get quick results. But once you reflect like 
      this and are practising accordingly, you no longer walk ahead of the 
      buffalo, you walk behind.</P>
      <P>So, with the chilli plant you bring water and fertiliser and chase away 
      any ants or termites that come. Just that much is enough for it to grow 
      into a beautiful bush all by itself. Once the plant is flourishing, it&#39;s 
      not your business to try and force it to flower right away. Don&#39;t practice 
      that way. It&#39;s just creating suffering for no reason. The chilli plant 
      grows according to it&#39;s own nature. Once it flowers, don&#39;t try to force it 
      to produce seeds right away. It won&#39;t work and you&#39;ll just suffer. That&#39;s 
      really suffering. When you understand this, it means you know your own 
      part in the practice and you know the part of the mind-objects and 
      defilements. Each has it&#39;s own separate part to play. The mind knows its 
      role and the work it has to do. As long as the mind doesn&#39;t understand 
      what it&#39;s job is, it will always try and force the chilli plant to grow 
      up, flower and produce chilli peppers, all in the same day. That is 
      nothing other than <I>samudaya</I> – the Noble Truth of the Cause of 
      Suffering.</P>
      <P>If you have had insight into this, it means you know when the mind is 
      deluded and goes off. Once you know the correct way to practice, you can 
      let go and allow things to follow naturally in accordance with your 
      accumulated wholesome <I>kamma</I>, spiritual qualities and <I>parami</I>. 
      You simply keep practising without having to worry about how long it will 
      take. You don&#39;t have to worry whether it will take one hundred or one 
      thousand lives before you get enlightened. Whichever life it will be, it 
      doesn&#39;t really matter, you just continue practising at whatever pace you 
      can be at ease with.</P>
      <P>Once the mind has entered the stream it cannot turn back. It has gone 
      beyond even the smallest evil action. The Buddha taught that mind of the
      <I>sotapanna</I> (stream-enterer) has inclined or entered into the stream 
      of Dhamma and cannot return. Those who have practised to this point can no 
      longer fall back and be born into the <I>apaya</I> [10] realms or the hell 
      realms again. How could they possibly fall back when, having clearly seen 
      the harm and danger, they have already cut off the roots of all 
      unwholesome <I>kamma</I>. They are no longer able to commit unwholesome 
      acts of body and speech. Once they have refrained from committing 
      unwholesome acts of body and speech, how can they possibly fall into the
      <I>apaya</I> realms or the hell realms? Their minds have entered the 
      stream. Once the mind has entered the stream through meditation, you know 
      your duty and the work you have to do. You know the path of practice and 
      how it progresses. You know when to exert and when to relax in the 
      practice. You know the body and you know the mind. You know materiality 
      and mentality. Those things which should be let go of and abandoned, you 
      let go of and abandon them, without getting caught in doubt and 
      uncertainty.</P>
      <P>In the past, I didn&#39;t use such a great amount of detailed knowledge and 
      refined theory in my practice. The important thing was to gain clear 
      understanding and refine the practice within the mind itself. If I looked 
      at my own or anyone else&#39;s physical form and found there was attraction to 
      it, I would seek out the cause for that attraction. I contemplated the 
      body and analysed it into its component parts: <I>kesa</I> (hair of the 
      head), <I>loma</I> (hair of the body), <I>nakha</I> (nails), <I>danta</I> 
      (teeth), <I>taco</I> (skin) and so on. The Buddha taught to contemplate 
      the different parts of the body, over and over again. Separate them, pull 
      them apart, peel the skin off and incinerate it all. Keep meditating like 
      this, until the mind is still, firm and unwavering in its meditation on 
      the unattractiveness of the body. When you are walking on alms round, for 
      instance, and see other monks or lay people ahead, visualise them as 
      corpses, tottering along the road in front of you. As you walk, keep 
      putting effort into this practice, taking the mind deeper and deeper into 
      the contemplation on the impermanence of the body. If you see a young 
      woman and are attracted by her, contemplate the image of a corpse which is 
      rotten and putrid from the process of decomposition. Contemplate like this 
      on every occasion, so that the mind maintains a sense of distance, not 
      becoming infatuated with that attractiveness. If you practise in this way, 
      the attraction will not last long, because you see the truth very clearly, 
      no longer doubting the truth that the body is really something, which is 
      rotting and decomposing.</P>
      <P>Use this kind of reflection until the perception of unattractiveness 
      becomes clearly fixed in the mind, and it goes beyond doubt. Wherever you 
      go it won&#39;t be wasted. You must really determine to do this practice to 
      the point where whenever you see someone, it&#39;s exactly the same as if you 
      were actually looking at a corpse. When you see a woman, you see her as a 
      corpse; when you see a man you see him as a corpse; and you see yourself 
      as a corpse in just the same way. In the end, everybody becomes a corpse. 
      You have to put as much effort into this contemplation as you can. Train 
      yourself until it becomes part of the mind. It&#39;s actually quite enjoyable 
      – if you really do it. But if you just become absorbed in reading lots of 
      books, it&#39;s difficult to get results. You have to practice sincerely and 
      with real determination so that the <I>kammatthana</I> [11] becomes 
      established as an integral part of the mind.</P>
      <P>Studying the Abhidhamma can be beneficial, but you have to do it 
      without getting attached to the books. The correct way to study is to make 
      it clear in the mind that you are studying for the realisation of truth 
      and to transcend suffering. These days there are many different teachers 
      of <I>vipassana</I> and many different methods to choose from, but 
      actually, the practice of <I>vipassana</I> isn&#39;t such an easy thing to do. 
      You can&#39;t go and do it just like that; it has to develop out of a strong 
      foundation in <I>sila</I>. Try it out. Moral line, training rules and 
      guidelines for behaviour are a necessary part of the practice – if your 
      actions and speech are untrained and undisciplined, it&#39;s like skipping 
      over part of <I>magga</I> and you won&#39;t meet with success. Some people say 
      you don&#39;t need to practise <I>samatha</I>, you can go straight into <I>
      vipassana</I>, but people who speak like that tend to be lazy and want to 
      get results without expanding any effort. They say that keeping <I>sila</I> 
      isn&#39;t important to practice, but really, practising <I>sila</I> in itself 
      is already quite difficult and not something you can do casually. If you 
      were to skip the <I>sila</I>, then of course the whole practice would seem 
      comfortable and convenient. It would be nice if whenever the practice 
      involved a bit of difficulty you could just skip over it – everybody likes 
      to avoid the difficult bits.</P>
      <P>There was once a monk who came here and asked permission to stay with 
      me, saying that he was interested in the practice. He inquired about the 
      monastic regulations and discipline here, so I explained that in this 
      monastery we practise according to the Vinaya (Code of Discipline) and 
      that the monks can&#39;t keep personal funds of money or stores of requisites. 
      He said that he practised non-attachment. I said that I didn&#39;t know how he 
      practised or what he meant by that. Then he asked whether he could use 
      money, if he didn&#39;t attach or giving any special importance to it. I said 
      he could use it, in the same way as he could use any salt which he could 
      find that wasn&#39;t salty. The monk was really just trying to impress people 
      with the way he talked, but actually, he was too lazy to bother practising 
      with what he saw as lots of trifling and unnecessarily meticulous rules 
      which to him just made life difficult. If ever he could find some salt 
      which didn&#39;t taste salty, I would be ready to believe him. If it really 
      wasn&#39;t salty, he should bring a whole basket full and try eating it! Could 
      it really not be salty? Non-attachment is not something which can be 
      experienced simply through talking about it or trying to guess what it&#39;s 
      like. It&#39;s not like that. Having displayed his views on the practice in 
      that way, it became clear that the monk would be unable to live here, so 
      he left and went his own way.</P>
      <P>You have to keep putting forth effort into the practise of <I>sila</I> 
      and the various <I>dhutanga</I> [12] practices. It&#39;s not different for lay 
      people either. Even if you are living at home, at the least very keep the 
      five precepts&nbsp;[13]. Try to compose and discipline your speech and actions. 
      Keep putting forth your best effort, and your practice will gradually 
      progress.</P>
      <P>Don&#39;t give up the practice of <I>samatha</I> just because you have 
      tried it a few times and found that the mind doesn&#39;t get calm. That&#39;s the 
      wrong way to go about it. You really have to train yourself over a long 
      period of time. Why does it have to take so long? Think about it. How many 
      years have you let pass by without practising? When thoughts arise pulling 
      the mind in one direction, you rush after them, when they start pulling it 
      in another, you still rush after them with your mental proliferation. If 
      you are going to try and stop the flow of the mind and make it stay still, 
      right there in the present moment, a couple of months is just not long 
      enough. Contemplate this. Think about what it might take to have a mind 
      which is at peace with the flow of the different issues and events which 
      affect it and is at peace with the mind-objects it experiences. When you 
      first start to practise, the mind has so little steadiness that as soon as 
      it comes into contact with a mind-object, it gets agitated and confused. 
      Why does it get agitated? Because it&#39;s under the influence of <I>tanha</I>. 
      You don&#39;t want it to think. You don&#39;t want to experience any mind-objects. 
      This not wanting is a form of craving. It&#39;s <I>vibhava-tanha</I> (craving 
      for non-existence). The more you desire not to experience any agitation 
      and confusion, the more you encourage and usher it in. &#39;I don&#39;t want this 
      impingement, why does it come? I don&#39;t want the mind to be agitated, why 
      is it like this?&#39; That&#39;s it – there&#39;s craving for the mind to be in a 
      peaceful state. It&#39;s because you don&#39;t know your own mind. That&#39;s all. You 
      persist in getting caught up with the mind and its craving, and yet it 
      takes an incredibly long time before you realise where you are going 
      wrong. When you think about it clearly, you can see that all this 
      distraction and agitation comes because you tell it to come! There is 
      craving for it to be otherwise; there is craving for it to be peaceful; 
      there is craving for the mind not to be restless and agitated. That&#39;s the 
      point – it&#39;s all craving, the whole mass of it.</P>
      <P>Well, never mind! Just get on with your own practice. Whenever you 
      experience a mind-object, contemplate it. Throw it into one of the three 
      &#39;pits&#39; of <I>aniccam, dukkham, anatta</I> in your meditation and reflect 
      on it. Generally, when we experience a mind-object it stimulates thinking. 
      The thinking is in reaction to the experience of the mind-object. The 
      nature of ordinary thinking and <I>panna</I> is very different. The nature 
      of ordinary thinking is to carry on without stopping. The mind-objects you 
      experience lead you off in different directions and your thoughts just 
      follow along. The nature of <I>panna</I> is to stop the proliferation, to 
      still the mind, so that it doesn&#39;t go anywhere. You are simply the knower 
      and receiver of things. As you experience different mind-objects, which in 
      turn give rise to different moods, you maintain awareness of the process 
      and ultimately, you can see that all the thinking and proliferating, 
      worrying and judging, is entirely devoid of any real substance or self. It 
      is all <I>aniccam, dukkham</I> and <I>anatta</I>. The way to practise is 
      to cut off all the proliferation right at its base and see that it all 
      comes under the headings of the three characteristics. As a result it will 
      weaken and lose its power. Next time when you are sitting in meditation 
      and it comes up, or whenever you experience agitation like that you 
      contemplate it, you keep observing and checking the mind.</P>
      <P>You can compare it with looking after water buffalo. There is a 
      buffalo, its owner and some rice plants. Now normally, buffaloes like to 
      eat rice plants; rice plants are buffalo food. Your mind is like the 
      buffalo, the mind-objects which you experience are like the rice plants, 
      That part of the mind which is &#39;that which knows&#39; is like the owner of the 
      buffalo, The practice isn&#39;t really any different from this. Consider it. 
      What do you do when you are looking after a water buffalo? You let it 
      wander freely, but try to keep an eye on it the whole time. If it walks 
      too near the rice plants, you shout a warning and when the buffalo hears, 
      it should stop and come back. However, you can&#39;t be careless. If it&#39;s 
      stubborn and doesn&#39;t take heed of you warnings you have to take a stick 
      and give it a good whack, then it won&#39;t dare to go anywhere near the rice 
      plants. But don&#39;t get caught taking a siesta. If you can&#39;t resist taking a 
      nap, the rice plants will be finished for sure.</P>
      <P>Practice is similar. When you are watching your mind, it&#39;s &#39;that which 
      knows&#39; that actually does the watching. &#39;Those who watch over their minds 
      will free themselves from <I>Mara&#39;s</I> [14] trap.&#39; But it&#39;s puzzling: the 
      mind is the mind so who is it who watches over the mind then? The mind is 
      one thing, &#39;that which knows&#39; is another. This knowing emerges from within 
      the very same mind. It&#39;s the knowing of the state of mind; knowing as the 
      mind experiences mind-objects; and knowing of the mind that is separate 
      from mind-objects. This aspect of the mind which knows is what the Buddha 
      referred to as &#39;that which knows&#39;. The knowing is the one who watches over 
      the mind. It is from the knowing that <I>panna</I> arises. The mind 
      manifests as thinking and ideas. If it meets a mind-object, it will stop 
      off and spend some time with it. If it meets another object then it will 
      spend some time with that, just like that buffalo stopping off to nibble 
      some rice plants. Wherever it wanders to, you have to keep an eye on it 
      the whole time, ensuring that it won&#39;t slip away from your sight. If it 
      strays near the rice plants and doesn&#39;t take any notice when you shout a 
      warning, you must show it the stick right away, with no messing about. To 
      train it, you have to give it a hard time and make it go against the flow 
      of its desires.</P>
      <P>Training the mind is the same. Normally, when it contacts a 
      mind-object, the mind will immediately grab hold of it. As it grabs hold 
      of mind-objects, &#39;that which knows&#39; has to teach it. Using wise 
      reflection, you have to train the mind to contemplate each object in the 
      light of whether it is wholesome or unwholesome. When you experience other 
      mind-objects, because you see them as desirable, your mind rushes to grasp 
      at them. So &#39;that which knows&#39; has to teach it over and over again, using 
      wise reflection, until it is able to cast them aside. This is how you can 
      develop the calmness of the mind. You will come to see that whatever you 
      grasp hold of is inherently undesirable. The result is that the mind stops 
      right there without any further proliferation. It loses any desire to 
      pursue such objects, because it has come under a constant barrage of 
      insults and criticism. You really have to give it a hard time. You have to 
      torture it until the words penetrate to your very heart. That is the way 
      to train the mind.</P>
      <P>Ever since I went into the forest to practise, I trained in that way. 
      Whenever I teach the monastic community, I teach that way – because I want 
      you to see the truth. I don&#39;t want you just to see what&#39;s in the books. I 
      want you to see for yourselves, in your own minds, whether you have been 
      liberated from your defiled thoughts or not. Once you have been liberated, 
      you know. As long as you have still not freed yourself, you must use wise 
      reflection to penetrate and understand the truth. If you really have 
      insight into the true nature of thoughts, you will automatically transcend 
      them. If later on something else comes up and you get stuck on that, you 
      must reflect on that and as long as you haven&#39;t transcended it, you can&#39;t 
      give up, otherwise there can be no progress. You must keep working with 
      the problem over and over again and not let the mind get away. This is the 
      way I practise with my own mind. The Buddha taught: <I>paccatam veditabbo 
      viññuhi</I> – the wise ones are those who know for themselves. It means 
      that you have to do the practice yourself and gain insight from your own 
      experience. You must know and understand this very self.</P>
      <P>If you have confidence in and trust yourself, you can feel at ease. 
      Both when people are criticising you, and when they are praising you, your 
      mind remains at ease. Whatever they say about you, you remain calm and 
      untroubled. Why can you stay so relaxed? Because you know yourself. If 
      other people praise you when you are actually worthy of criticism, are you 
      really going to believe what they say? No you don&#39;t simply believe what 
      other people say, you do your own practice and judge things for yourself. 
      When people who have no foundation in practice get praised, it puts them 
      in a good mood. They get intoxicated with it. Likewise, when you receive 
      criticism, you have to look inwards and reflect for yourself. It might not 
      be true. Maybe they say you are wrong, but actually, they are mistaken and 
      you aren&#39;t really at fault at all. If so, there&#39;s no need to get angry 
      with them, because they aren&#39;t speaking according to the truth. On the 
      other hand, if what they say is the truth and you really are wrong, then 
      again there&#39;s no reason to be angry with them. If you can reflect in this 
      way, you can feel completely at ease, because you are seeing everything as 
      Dhamma, rather than blindly reacting to your opinions and preferences. 
      This is the way I practise. It&#39;s the shortest most direct way to practise. 
      Even if you were to come and try to argue with me about theories of the 
      Dhamma or Abhidhamma, I wouldn&#39;t join in. Rather than argue, I would just 
      give you reasoned reflection.</P>
      <P>The important thing is to understand the Buddha&#39;s teaching that the 
      heart of practice is letting go. But it&#39;s letting go with awareness, not 
      letting go without awareness, like buffaloes and cows who don&#39;t pay much 
      attention to anything. That&#39;s not the right way. You let go because you 
      have insight into the world of conventions and concepts and you have 
      insight into non-attachment.</P>
      <P>The Buddha taught that in the beginning you should practise a lot, 
      cultivate a lot and attach a lot. You should attach to the Buddha, Dhamma, 
      Sangha as firmly as you can. He taught to begin practice in this way. 
      Attach with sincerity and determination and keep attaching. It&#39;s similar 
      to his teaching on not envying others. He said that when making a living 
      people should depend on the fruits of their own labours. You should 
      support yourself from your own stock of cows and buffaloes, and from your 
      own land and fields – there&#39;s no unwholesome <I>kamma</I> to be made when 
      you do this. If you earn o living by taking other peoples property, you 
      make bad <I>kamma</I>. Many people heard this teaching and believed it, so 
      they made their living working their own property to its full extent. But 
      of course this involved some difficulty and suffering. There was suffering 
      because they had to work with their own sweat on their own property. So 
      then they went to the Buddha and recounted their tale of suffering, 
      complaining that if you own anything it&#39;s just a source of complications 
      and unhappiness. Previously, he taught them that their difficulties and 
      hassles arose from competitiveness, trying to acquire things which really 
      belonged to other people. So they understood that if they followed the 
      teaching that they should make a living from their own resources rather 
      than exploiting those of others, then all their problems would be solved. 
      However, when they tried doing this, they found that in fact their hassles 
      and difficulties still existed. So then the Buddha shifted his teaching to 
      a different level. He said that in fact, if you attach to and give undue 
      importance to things of any kind, it doesn&#39;t matter whose they are, 
      suffering is the result. If you touch fire in someone else&#39;s house it&#39;s 
      hot; if you touch fire in your own house it&#39;s also hot – that is the 
      nature of attachment.</P>
      <P>The Buddha could only teach according to the level of understanding and 
      wisdom of each individual, because it was like having to teach crazy 
      people. That&#39;s the way you teach crazy people – sometimes it&#39;s appropriate 
      to give them an electric shock, so you do it. As long os people&#39;s minds 
      are at such a coarse level, they don&#39;t have the mindfulness or wisdom to 
      understand the teaching. Having finished his own practice, the Buddha got 
      to grips with our problems and would come up with various skilful means or 
      teach people according to their circumstances.</P>
      <P>In my own practice I tried every possible means of reflection and 
      investigation to gain insight. I staked my whole life on the practice, 
      because I had confidence in the Buddhist teaching that <I>magga</I>, <I>
      phala</I> and <I>nibbana</I> (enlightenment) actually exist. These things 
      actually do exist, just as it says in the teaching, and they actually do 
      arise through good practice. They arise from a mind that is bold enough to 
      give the defilements a hard time; bold enough to reflect and train; bold 
      enough to fundamentally change; bold enough to do the practice.</P>
      <P>What does doing the practice mean? It means going against the 
      tendencies of your mind. When your mind starts thinking this way, the 
      Buddha has it go that way; it starts thinking that way, he has it go this 
      way. Why did the Buddha teach about going against the grain? Because in 
      the past, for so long, your mind has been covered with defilement. He 
      taught that the mind is unreliable because it&#39;s still untrained and has 
      not yet been transformed by the Dhamma. Because of this, he said you can&#39;t 
      trust it. As long as it hasn&#39;t merged with <I>sila</I> and Dhamma – 
      because it&#39;s still not pure and lacks clear insight – how can you trust 
      it? He taught not to rely on the unenlightened mind because it&#39;s defiled. 
      At first it&#39;s the servant of the defilements, but over time it gradually 
      gets polluted and becomes defilement itself. So, he taught not to trust 
      the mind.</P>
      <P>Look at all our monastic regulations and training guidelines, they all 
      make you go against the grain. When you go against the grain there is 
      suffering. Of course, as soon as there is some suffering, you complain 
      that the practice is too difficult and troublesome. You say you can&#39;t do 
      it, but the Buddha didn&#39;t think that way. He saw that if there is 
      suffering, it&#39;s a sign that you are practicing in the correct way. But you 
      understand that you are practising in the wrong way and that this is the 
      cause of all the difficulty and hardship. When you begin practice and 
      start to experience some suffering, you assume that you must be doing, 
      something wrong. Everyone wants to feel good, but they&#39;re not usually 
      concerned about whether it’s the right way or wrong way to practise. As 
      soon as you start going against the <I>kilesa</I> and the stream of <I>
      tanha</I>, it brings up suffering and you want to stop because you think 
      you must be doing something wrong. But the Buddha taught that actually you 
      are practising correctly. Having stimulated the <I>kilesa</I> they get 
      heated and stirred up, but you can misunderstand and think that it is you 
      who have been stirred up.</P>
      <P>The Buddha said that it&#39;s the <I>kilesa</I> that get stirred up. It&#39;s 
      because you don&#39;t like going against the defilements that it&#39;s difficult 
      to progress in the practice – you don&#39;t reflect on things. In general you 
      tend to get stuck in one of the two extremes of <I>kamasukhallikanuyogo</I> 
      (sensual indulgence) or <I>attakilamathanuyogo</I> (self-torture). Sensual 
      indulgence means you want to follow all your mind&#39;s desires: whatever you 
      want to do, you do it. You want to follow your craving, which means you 
      want to sit comfortably, sleep as much as you want and so on. Whatever you 
      do, you want to be comfortable – that&#39;s the nature of sensual indulgence. 
      If you are attached to pleasant feelings how can you progress in the 
      practice?</P>
      <P>If you aren&#39;t indulging in sensuality or are unable to obtain 
      satisfaction through attaching to pleasant feelings, then you tend towards 
      the other extreme of aversion, becoming angry and dissatisfied and then 
      suffering because of it. That is the extreme of self-torture. But this is 
      not the way of one who is training to be peaceful and aloof from the 
      defilements.</P>
      <P>The Buddha taught not to follow these two extreme ways. He taught that 
      when you experience pleasant feelings, you should just take note of them 
      with awareness. If you indulge in anger or hatred, you aren&#39;t walking in 
      the footsteps of the Buddha. It&#39;s following the way of ordinary 
      unenlightened beings, not the way of the <I>samana</I>. One who is 
      peaceful no longer moves in that direction, they walk the middle way. This 
      is <I>sammapatipada</I> (right practice), which means the extreme of 
      sensual indulgence is off to your left and the extreme of self-torture is 
      off to your right.</P>
      <P>So if you take up the life of a practising monastic, you should follow 
      the middle way. That means you don&#39;t pay too much attention to happiness 
      and suffering – you let them go. But at the same time you can&#39;t avoid 
      feeling pushed around by these two extremes: one moment you are struck 
      from this side, another moment pulled from that side. It&#39;s like being the 
      clapper of a bell. They hit you from this direction and you swing in that 
      one, back and forth, over and over. It is these two things which push you 
      around. In his first teaching, the Buddha talked about these two extremes 
      because this is where attachment has taken root. Half the time, desire for 
      pleasant things hits you from this side and the rest of the time, 
      dissatisfaction and suffering hit you from the other side. It is just 
      these two things which bully us and push us around the whole time.</P>
      <P>Walking the middle way means you let go of both the pleasant and the 
      suffering. To practise correctly – <I>samma patipada</I> – you must follow 
      the middle way. To walk the middle way, following the path of the Buddha, 
      is difficult and involves some suffering. If you don&#39;t find satisfaction 
      when your mind craves pleasant feelings, it&#39;s just suffering. It seems 
      that all that exists is just these two extremes of happiness and suffering 
      and as long as you still believe in these things, you&#39;ll tend to attach to 
      them and get involved with them. It means that when you become angry with 
      someone, you immediately start looking for a piece of wood to go and hit 
      them with – there&#39;s no patience or endurance. If you like someone, then 
      you like to spend your whole time with them, getting lost completely. 
      That&#39;s right isn&#39;t it? You always tend towards these two ends, the middle 
      way never gets a look in. But the Buddha didn&#39;t teach us to follow the 
      extremes. He said that we should gradually let them go. This is the way of
      <I>samma patipada</I> – the way out of becoming and birth. It&#39;s the way 
      without becoming or birth, without happiness or sadness and without good 
      or bad. As ordinary unenlightened human beings who are still subject to 
      becoming, each time you fall into this process of becoming, you fail to 
      see that middle point of balance. You go rushing by, on and on, as if 
      you&#39;re falling headlong and you end up attaching to the extreme of 
      happiness. If you don&#39;t get what you want, you still meet suffering from 
      the other direction, missing the mid point time and time again. Rushing 
      back and forth, you don&#39;t see that point of balance where peace and 
      equanimity exists. You don&#39;t come to rest of that point in the middle 
      which is free from becoming and birth. Why? It&#39;s because you don&#39;t like 
      it. Getting tangled in becoming is like falling into a realm where you get 
      savaged by ferocious dogs, and then, though you try climbing upwards to 
      get away, your head gets pecked and torn apart by the iron beaks of 
      demonic vultures and crows. It&#39;s like being caught into a never-ending 
      hell-realm. That&#39;s what the true nature of becoming is like.</P>
      <P>So the place where there is no becoming and birth, humans don&#39;t really 
      notice. The unenlightened mind fails to see it and consequently just 
      passes back and forth over it. <I>Samma patipada</I> is the middle way 
      which the Buddha followed until he was liberated from becoming and birth. 
      It is <I>abayakata</I> dhamma – neither good nor had because the mind has 
      let everything go. This is the way of the <I>samana</I>. One who doesn&#39;t 
      follow this way cannot be a true <I>samana</I>, because they won&#39;t 
      experience true inner peace. Why is that? Because they are still involved 
      in becoming and birth, they are still caught up in the cycle of birth and 
      death. But the middle way is beyond birth and death, high and low, 
      happiness and suffering, good and bad. It is the straight way and the way 
      of calm and restraint. It is a calm that lies beyond happiness and 
      suffering, good moods and bad moods. This is the nature of the practice. 
      If your heart has experienced this true peace, it means you are able to 
      stop. You are able to stop asking questions. There&#39;s no longer any need to 
      ask anybody. This is why the Buddha taught that the Dhamma is <I>paccattam 
      veditabbo viññuhi</I> – it&#39;s something which each individual has to know 
      clearly for themselves. You see how it all accords exactly with what the 
      Buddha taught and then you&#39;ve no need to ask anybody else.</P>
      <P>So I have talked briefly about my own experience and practice: I didn&#39;t 
      have so much external knowledge or study the scriptures that much. By 
      experimenting and investigating, I learned from my own mind in a natural 
      way. Whenever liking arose, I observed it and watched where it led the 
      mind. All it does is drag you towards suffering. So what you do is keep 
      practising with your own mind until you gradually develop awareness and 
      understanding ... until you see the Dhamma for yourself. But you must be 
      utterly sincere and really determine your heart and mind to do it.</P>
      <P>If you truly want to practise, you must make a determined effort not to 
      proliferate or think too much. If you start meditating with craving to 
      have a certain kind of experience or gain some kind of state, then it&#39;s 
      better to stop. When you start to experience some calm, if you start 
      thinking, &#39; Is this it?&#39; or &#39; Have I attained that?&#39; you should take a 
      break and gather up all that theoretical knowledge and just put it away in 
      a box somewhere. Don&#39;t bring it up for discussion. The kind of knowledge 
      which arises during meditation is no of that order. It&#39;s a completely new 
      kind. When you experience some genuine insight, it&#39;s not the same as the 
      theory. For instance, when you write the word &#39;greed&#39; down on paper, it&#39;s 
      not the same as having the experience of greed in the mind. This applies 
      to anger in just the same way; the written word is one thing, but when you 
      actually experience it in the mind, you&#39;ve got no time to read anything – 
      you experience it right there in the mind. It is very important to 
      understand this.</P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="6">T</FONT>he written theory is correct, but the Dhamma 
      must really be <I>opanayiko</I> (leading inwards). You must internalise 
      it. If you don&#39;t internalise it, you won&#39;t really gain understanding or 
      insight. You won&#39;t experience the truth for yourself. I was the same in my 
      youth. I didn&#39;t study all the time, though I had taken the first three 
      levels of exams on the theory of Dhamma-Vinaya. I had the chance to go and 
      hear different teachers talking about their meditation practice, but at 
      first I was heedless and didn&#39;t know how to listen properly. I didn&#39;t 
      understand the way the meditation masters expressed themselves when they 
      talked about the practice. They spoke directly from their personal 
      experience, describing how they came to see the Dhamma from within their 
      own minds rather from the books. Later on, after I had done more of the 
      practice for myself, I began to see the truth in the same way as described 
      by those teachers. I was able to understand for myself, from within my own 
      mind, what they had been teaching. Eventually, after many years of 
      practice, I realised that all that knowledge which they had imparted in 
      their teaching came from what they had seen and directly experienced for 
      themselves – they didn&#39;t just speak from the books. If you follow the path 
      of practice which they described, you will experience the Dhamma to just 
      the same profundity. I concluded that this was the right way to practise. 
      There might well be other ways to practise, but just this much was enough 
      for me, and I stuck to it.</P>
      <P>You must keep putting effort into the practice. In the beginning the 
      important thing is to be doing it. Whether the mind is actually peaceful 
      or not, it doesn&#39;t matter – you just have to accept it the way it is. You 
      are concerned with creating wholesome causes. If you are diligent in the 
      practice, you don&#39;t need to worry about what the results will be like. You 
      shouldn&#39;t be afraid that you won&#39;t gain any results from your practice. 
      Worrying like that just prevents the mind from becoming peaceful. 
      Persevere with it. Of course, if you don&#39;t do the practice then who will 
      gain anything? Who will realise the Dhamma? Only the one who seeks will 
      realise the Dhamma. It is the one who eats who satisfies his hunger, not 
      the one who reads the menu. Each and every mood is lying to you; if you 
      are aware of it happening just ten times, that&#39;s better than nothing. The 
      same old person keeps lying about the same old things. If you are simply 
      aware of what goes on that&#39;s already good, because it takes so long before 
      you even become aware of the truth. The defilements are trying to delude 
      you all the time.</P>
      <P>Practice means to establish <I>sila</I>, <I>samadhi</I> and <I>panna</I> 
      in your mind. Recollect the qualities of the Triple Gem – the Buddha, 
      Dhamma, Sangha – and let go of everything else. As you practise right 
      here, you are already creating the causes and conditions for enlightenment 
      in this very lifetime. Be honest, sincere and keep doing it.</P>
      <P>The nature of the practice is such that even if you are sitting on a 
      chair, you can still fix attention on a meditation object. At first you 
      don&#39;t have to concentrate on many different things, it is enough just to 
      focus on one simple object, such as the breath, or the recitation of a 
      mantra like Buddho, Dhammo or Sangho used in conjunction with the breath. 
      When you fix attention on the breath, make a clear mental determination 
      that you are not going to force it in any way. If you get disturbed by the 
      breathing, it&#39;s a sign that you still aren&#39;t practising in the right way. 
      If you are not at ease with the breath then it will always seem either too 
      short or too long, too gentle or too forceful and it won&#39;t feel 
      comfortable. But once you do feel at ease with it and there is awareness 
      of each in-breath and out-breath, you&#39;ve got it right. This indicates you 
      are practising in the correct way. If it&#39;s not yet right, you are still 
      deluded. If you are still deluded then stop the meditation and 
      re-establish mindfulness on the breathing. In the course of the 
      meditation, if the desire arises to experience different things, or you 
      actually do start to experience different psychic phenomena, such as 
      bright lights or visions of celestial palaces or other similar things, 
      don&#39;t be afraid. Be mindful of such experiences and keep doing the 
      meditation. Sometimes you might be meditating and the sensation of the 
      breath totally disappears. It might truly seem to have vanished making you 
      afraid. Actually, there&#39;s no need to be afraid, it&#39;s only your thoughts 
      that have vanished, the breath is still there, but is simply operating on 
      a much more refined level than normal. Once an appropriate period of time 
      has elapsed, the sensation of the breathing will return by itself.</P>
      <P>In the beginning you have to practise making the mind calm in this way. 
      Whenever you sit down to meditate – whether on a seat somewhere, or in a 
      car or a boat – you should be able to calm the mind right away by focusing 
      attention on your meditation object. You have to practise to the point 
      where, if you get on a train to travel somewhere, you should be able to 
      sit down and enter a state of calm, almost immediately. If you have 
      trained yourself this thoroughly, you will be able to meditate anywhere. I 
      t means you already have some insight into the path of practice and can 
      use this as a basis for contemplating mind-objects: sights, sounds, 
      smells, tastes, tactile sensations and ideas. Be aware of all the liking 
      and disliking which you experience and don&#39;t make anything out of such 
      mental-states. If you experience a pleasant object, know it as pleasant; 
      if you experience an unpleasant one, know it as unpleasant. These are part 
      of conditioned reality. Whether they&#39;re good, bad or whatever, they&#39;re all 
      having the same characteristics, they&#39;re all <I>aniccam</I>, <I>dukkham</I> 
      and <I>anatta</I>. Things that are uncertain, so don&#39;t attach or cling to 
      them. This is a teaching or mantra that you should keep repeating to 
      yourself. If you keep seeing these three characteristics, <I>panna</I> 
      will arise by itself. The heart of <I>vipassana</I> meditation is to throw 
      each mind-object which you experience into these three &#39;pits&#39; of <I>
      aniccam</I>, <I>dukkham</I> and <I>anatta</I>.</P>
      <P>Whatever it is, whether good, bad or worse, throw it into these three 
      pits and very soon you will start to gain knowledge and insight. <I>Panna</I> 
      will begin to arise in small amounts, which is what meditation is all 
      about. Keep putting a consistent effort into it. You&#39;ve been keeping the 
      five precepts for many years now, so it&#39;s time to really put some effort 
      into the meditation. You have to gain insight into the truth of things so 
      that you can let go, give things up and be peaceful.</P>
      <P>I&#39;m not very good at having lengthy discussions about the Dhamma. It&#39;s 
      difficult to put it all into words. If anyone wants to know how I 
      practise, they should come and live here. If they stay here long enough, 
      they will get to know. In the past I&#39;ve gone around on foot to study and 
      practice with different teachers. I didn&#39;t go to make other people listen 
      to me. I went to listen to the various Masters teach the Dhamma; I didn&#39;t 
      try to teach them. Whatever they taught I listened; even if they were 
      young or didn&#39;t have much of a reputation I listened. I didn&#39;t go in for 
      discussion – I didn&#39;t see that there was any need for a lot of discussion. 
      That which was important and worth taking an interest in, involved 
      renunciation and letting go. The whole purpose of the practice is for 
      giving up and letting things go. Ultimately, it&#39;s fruitless doing a great 
      amount of formal study. Day by day you are getting older and older and if 
      all you do is study the words, it&#39;s like chasing a mirage – you never 
      really get hold of the real thing. There are many styles and methods of 
      practice and I&#39;m not critical of them, as long as you understand what the 
      true meaning and purpose of the practice is. If for instance, 
      practitioners are not keeping the Vinaya strictly, although they might not 
      necessarily be going that wrong, I would say that they would find it 
      impossible to attain ultimate success in the practice. It&#39;s like trying to 
      bypass <I>magga</I> or skipping over <I>sila</I>, <I>samadhi</I> and <I>
      panna</I>. Some people tell you not to get attached to <I>samatha,</I> 
      that you shouldn&#39;t bother with it and just go straight on to <I>vipassana</I>, 
      but from my experience if you try to skip over <I>samatha</I> and just do
      <I>vipassana</I>, it won&#39;t lead to success.</P>
      <P>Don&#39;t disregard the way of practice and the foundation which has been 
      left for us by Tan Ajahn Sow, Tan Ajahn Mun, Tan Ajahn Tongrut and Tan 
      Chao Khun Upali. If you train yourself following in the footsteps of these 
      Masters, it&#39;s the most direct way to enlightenment, because they actually 
      realised the Dhamma for themselves. They didn&#39;t bypass the <I>sila</I>; 
      they tried to be scrupulous and impeccable with it. Their disciples had 
      the utmost respect both for the teacher and the monastery regulations and 
      ways of practice. If the teacher told you to do something, you did it. If 
      he said you were doing something wrong and you should stop, you stopped. 
      These teachers taught to practise with determination and sincerity until 
      you actually saw and experienced results in your own mind. As a result, 
      the disciples of the great forest Masters had the deepest respect for and 
      were somewhat in awe of the teacher, because it was through following in 
      his footsteps that they came to see and understand the Dhamma.</P>
      <P>So, try it out in the way I have suggested. If you do the practice, you 
      will see and experience the results for yourself. If you really practise 
      and investigate the truth there is no reason why you shouldn&#39;t experience 
      them in just the way I&#39;ve described. I say that if you are practising in 
      the right way – which means giving up, speaking little, letting go of 
      views and conceit – the <I>kilesa</I> will be unable to gain a foothold in 
      the mind. You are able to listen peacefully to those who speak what is not 
      true, just as you are able listen to those who speak the truth, because 
      you know how to contemplate the truth for yourself. I say this is 
      possible, if you really put effort into the practice. But it&#39;s not often 
      that the scholars actually come and do the practice, there are still too 
      few of them that do. I feel a sense of regret that many of my fellow 
      Buddhists are like this and I consistently try to encourage them to get 
      down to the practice and start contemplating.</P>
      <P>That those of you who have previously trained as scholars have managed 
      to come here and practise is admirable; you have your own good qualities 
      which you can offer to the community. In most of the village monasteries 
      around here, it is the study of the scriptures and the theory which is 
      emphasised, but ultimately, they are studying that which just goes on and 
      on in an endless, unbroken flow. They never manage actually to cut through 
      the flow and finish. They only study that which is <I>santati</I> and <I>
      sandhi</I>, or that which gives rise to continued birth. If you can halt 
      the mental momentum, you can really use your theoretical knowledge as a 
      basis for research and investigation into the cause of suffering. Because 
      the true nature of the mind doesn&#39;t deviate from what you have learnt in 
      the books, it goes in accordance with what you have studied. But if you 
      study without ever practising, you will never really know. Once you have 
      practised, you can gain a deep and profound knowledge, actually seeing and 
      understanding clearly in the mind those things which you have studied in 
      the books. The important thing is to start practising.</P>
      <P>So go and live in a small hut in the forest, make the effort to train 
      yourself and experiment with the teaching. It&#39;s better than just studying 
      the theory. Practise discussing the Dhamma inwardly with yourself, living 
      in seclusion and observing your heart and mind. When the mind is still, 
      it&#39;s in a state of normality. When it moves out from that state of 
      normality, when different thoughts and imagination arise, that is <I>
      sankhara.</I> These <I>sankharas</I> will continue to condition the mind, 
      so be careful and maintain awareness of them. Once the mind moves out from 
      the state of normality, it will no longer be <I>samma patipada.</I> It 
      will either go in the direction of <I>kamasukhallikanuyogo</I> or <I>
      attakilamathanuyogo.</I> These two tendencies are <I>citta sankhara</I> 
      conditioning the mind. If the conditioning is wholesome, the mind takes on 
      wholesome characteristics; if the conditioning is unwholesome, it takes on 
      unwholesome ones. The process takes place in the mind. If you are 
      practising awareness, closely observing the mind, it&#39;s actually very 
      interesting. I would be happy to talk about this one topic the whole day 
      through.</P>
      <P>Once you are aware of the movements of the mind, you can see the 
      conditioning process. The mind has been raised and trained by the 
      defilements. I see it as being like a central place. These things which we 
      call <I>cetasika</I> (mental factors) are like visitors which come to stay 
      at this place. Sometimes this &#39;person&#39; comes to visit; sometimes that 
      &#39;person&#39; comes to visit and sometimes someone else. They all come to stay 
      at this one spot. All these &#39;visitors&#39;, which arise out of the mind, we 
      call mental factors.</P>
      <P>The way to practise is to awaken the mind and make it &#39;that which 
      knows&#39;, waiting and watching over itself. Whenever a visitor approaches, 
      you must wave your hand to forbid them from coming in. Where could they 
      sit, when the whole day long you occupy the only seat available, your 
      awareness being right in the centre, receiving all the visitors who come? 
      This is what &#39;Buddho&#39; means: a firm and unshakeable awareness. If you can 
      sustain this awareness, it will guard the mind. You simply sit down and 
      establish awareness on this one spot, because this is where all the 
      visitors have come to, right from the time you were just a baby throughout 
      your entire life up until the present. So you must get to know them all 
      and this is how. You simply sustain &#39;Buddho&#39;. All these visitors will tend 
      to want to fashion and concoct the mind in various ways, conditioning your 
      experience accordingly. These conditioned states, which are produced by 
      the actions of the visitors, are called mental factors. Whatever their 
      nature might be or wherever they might lead the mind is not the important 
      thing. Your job is to get to know these visitors who drop in. Whenever 
      visitors arrive they will find that there is only one chair available and 
      as long as you occupy it, they will have nowhere to sit down. They come 
      with the intention of speaking with you, but there is nowhere for them to 
      settle down.</P>
      <P>However many times these visitors come, they keep meeting the same 
      person sitting in the same seat receiving guests, and that person never 
      seems to go. How many times will they keep coming back? All you have to do 
      is sit there receiving them and you will come to know them all. Everything 
      that you have ever experienced since you first had knowledge of the world, 
      will come to visit right at that place. You only have to know this much.</P>
      <P>If you watch and contemplate the Dhamma just at this one place, you 
      will be able to develop insight which is capable of penetrating 
      everything. This is where you watch, investigate and contemplate for 
      yourself.</P>
      <P>This is just talking about Dhamma practice, I can&#39;t talk about much 
      else. This is the way I talk about the Dhamma, but in the end it&#39;s still 
      just talking about the practice. What&#39;s appropriate now is actually to do 
      the practice. When you start doing it, you will meet with various 
      experiences in the course of the practice. There are, of course, given 
      directions to follow telling you where to go and what to do ... if this 
      happens, do that and so on, but often when you proceed and it doesn&#39;t work 
      out well, you have to reflect and adjust your approach. You may have to 
      travel a long way to come across a signpost, before you realise which is 
      the right way to go. It comes down to the fact that you learn through 
      making mistakes and through working with your experience until you become 
      established in the right way of practice and you are beyond doubt. If you 
      still haven&#39;t found the correct way to practise, you&#39;re bound to meet with 
      some doubt or obstruction, so then you must keep prodding and poking right 
      at that spot. Once you investigate, consider it from various angles, talk 
      it through with yourself, this will really make an impression on the mind 
      and you&#39;ll know what to do. If you really get stuck, you can consult the 
      teacher, who has plenty of experience in confronting obstacles whilst 
      training the mind and he&#39;ll be able to advise on the way to practise with 
      them and get beyond them. Having access to a teacher can be immensely 
      valuable – someone who&#39;s been there, who knows the terrain. Someone you 
      can take your confusion to, someone you can discuss your practice with.</P>
      <P>Consider practising with mind-objects such as sound. There is hearing 
      and there is sound – you can be aware of the sound without making anything 
      out of it. Make use of natural phenomena like this to contemplate the 
      truth, until the mind is able to separate the mind from the object. This 
      distinction comes to he discernible because the mind doesn&#39;t go out and 
      get involved with things. When the ear hears a sound, watch to see whether 
      the mind gets tangled up or carried away with it. Is it disturbed? If you 
      can know and see just this much, you&#39;ll be able to hear sounds without 
      being disturbed by them. This is the cultivation and establishment of 
      mindfulness right here, close at hand. It&#39;s not something you have to go 
      elsewhere to do. Even if you want to avoid sound, you can&#39;t really get 
      away from it. It&#39;s only really possible to &#39;get away&#39; from sounds by 
      practising. That means training the mind until it is firm enough in the 
      practice of mindfulness to be able to let go when there is sense contact. 
      There is still hearing, but at the same time you let the object go. In 
      this case when there is mindfulness, this letting go is natural. You let 
      it be as it is. You don&#39;t have to struggle to separate the mind from the 
      object, the separation is quite obvious to you because you are practising 
      abandoning, letting go. Even if you felt inclined to follow the sound, the 
      mind wouldn&#39;t go after it.</P>
      <P>Once you are fully mindful of forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tangible 
      objects and thoughts, you will see them clearly as they truly are in 
      reality, with the internal eye of wisdom. They are dominated by the three 
      universal characteristics of <I>aniccam</I>, <I>dukkham</I> and <I>anatta</I>. 
      Whenever you hear a sound, for instance, there will be immediate insight 
      into the three characteristics in the process of having that experience. 
      It&#39;s like you no longer hear it, you don&#39;t hear it in the usual way, 
      because you see that the mind is one thing, the object is another. But 
      that doesn&#39;t mean the mind is no longer functioning. Mindfulness is 
      monitoring and watching over the mind at all times. If you&#39;re able to 
      develop your practice to this level, it will mean wherever you are or 
      whatever you are doing, you will be engaged in investigating the Dhamma. 
      This is <I>dhamma-vicaya</I> or one of the essential factors of 
      enlightenment [15]. If this factor is present in the mind, it means that 
      there will be intensive and sustained consideration and reflection on the 
      Dhamma going on at all times, and this will gradually loosen and undo your 
      attachment to body, feelings, perceptions, thoughts and consciousness. 
      Nothing will be able to disturb or intrude upon the mind when it is 
      absorbed in its work of reflection.</P>
      <P>For one who is experienced and has developed concentration, this 
      process of reflection and investigation takes place automatically in the 
      mind – it&#39;s not something you have to think about or create. The mind will 
      immediately be adept in contemplation in whatever direction you point it. 
      If you are practising in this way, one additional thing that occurs is 
      that once you have established mindfulness before you go to sleep, you no 
      longer habitually snore, talk in your sleep, gnash your teeth or writhe 
      about. If meditation is established in the mind, all of that disappears. 
      Even if you sleep deeply, when you awaken you will feel like you haven&#39;t 
      been asleep, and you won&#39;t feel tired or sleepy. In the past you might 
      have slept snoring heedlessly, but if you really develop wakefulness, that 
      can&#39;t happen. How could you snore when you don&#39;t really sleep? It is just 
      the body which stops and rests. With this level of mindfulness the mind is 
      awake at all times of the day and night. It is &#39;Buddho&#39;: knowing, awake, 
      clear and bright with its own inner happiness. At this level the mind has 
      it&#39;s own self-sustaining energy and is free of drowsiness, even though it 
      doesn&#39;t sleep in the normal sense. If you have developed your meditation 
      to this point, you might be able to keep going for two or three days 
      without sleep. Even then, if you start to feel sleepy because the body has 
      become exhausted, you can focus on your meditation object and enter a 
      state of deep <I>samadhi</I> immediately, and because of your skill, you 
      might only need to stay in it for five or ten minutes to feel as refreshed 
      as if you had slept all day and all night.</P>
      <P>As far as going without sleep is concerned, if you are beyond worrying 
      about the body then there is no problem, but you should know what amount 
      is right. You should reflect on the state of the body and what it&#39;s been 
      through and then adjust your sleep according to its needs. When you have 
      reached this stage in practice, you don&#39;t have to consciously tell the 
      body what to do, it tells itself. There is a part of the mind that is 
      constantly prodding and urging you on. Even if you feel lazy, you won&#39;t he 
      able to indulge in moods because there will always be this voice 
      encouraging and arousing you to make diligent effort. You will reach a 
      point where you can no longer stagnate, where the practice takes care of 
      itself. Try it out. You have done enough study and received enough 
      teaching already, now it&#39;s time to use what you&#39;ve learned to train 
      yourself.</P>
      <P>In the beginning, <I>kaya-viveka</I> (physical seclusion) is very 
      important. It&#39;s good to reflect on the Venerable Sariputta&#39;s teaching that
      <I>kaya-viveka</I> is the cause for the arising of <I>citta-viveka</I> 
      (mental seclusion) and <I>citta-viveka</I> is the cause for the arising of
      <I>upadhi-viveka</I> (seclusion from the defilements or <I>Nibbana)</I>. 
      Some people say that it&#39;s not important and that if you are peaceful, you 
      can live anywhere. That&#39;s true, but in the early stages of your practice, 
      you should see <I>kaya-viveka</I> as really necessary. One day you should 
      try going to stay in a lonely cremation ground, miles away from anyone, or 
      go up and meditate on some really desolate and scary place. Make the 
      practice challenging the whole night through, so you know what it truly 
      feels like.</P>
      <P>In my early years, I also used to think <I>kaya-viveka</I> was not so 
      important. It was just an opinion I held, which didn&#39;t actually come from 
      experience. Once I started to practice, I actually began to apply the 
      Buddha&#39;s teaching to my meditation and realised how at first <I>
      kaya-viveka</I> gives rise to <I>citta-viveka</I>. When you are still a 
      householder, what kind of <I>kaya-viveka</I> do you get? As soon as you 
      step inside the front door there&#39;s confusion and complications, because 
      there&#39;s no physical seclusion. If you leave the house and go to a secluded 
      place, then the atmosphere for practice is totally different.</P>
      <P>You must understand for yourself the importance of <I>kaya-viveka</I> 
      when you begin practice. Once you gain <I>kaya-viveka</I>, you start to 
      practise and gain knowledge of the Dhamma. Once you start to practise, you 
      need a teacher to give teaching and advice in areas where you still 
      misunderstand, because in actual fact it&#39;s where you misunderstand that 
      you think you understand correctly. If you have a skilful teacher, they 
      can advise you until you see where you have gone wrong. It&#39;s usually in 
      the very place where you thought you were correct, because your 
      misunderstanding covers over all your thinking.</P>
      <P>Some of the scholar monks have studied a great deal and investigated 
      the texts thoroughly, but I recommend people to give themselves to the 
      practice. When it&#39;s time to study, it&#39;s all right to open the books and 
      learn the conventional theory and form, but when it&#39;s time to fight with 
      the defilements, you have to go beyond the theory and conventions. If you 
      try fighting following the textbook model too closely, you won&#39;t be able 
      to defeat your opponents. If you truly want to get to grips with the 
      defilements, you have to go beyond the books. This is the way the practice 
      has to be in reality. The textbooks were only compiled with the intention 
      of providing teachings in the form of examples. If you attach too firmly 
      to the books they could even cause you to lose your mindfulness, because 
      they were written on the basis of the <I>sañña</I> and <I>sankhara</I> of 
      the writers, who didn&#39;t necessarily understand that all <I>sankhara</I> do 
      is condition the mind. Before you know it, they&#39;re off down into the 
      distant depths of the earth meeting with magical serpents <I>(nagas)</I>, 
      and when they come back up again they start speaking serpent language and 
      nobody knows what they are talking about. It&#39;s just crazy.</P>
      <P>The forest Masters didn&#39;t teach to practise like that. You might 
      imagine the things in the books to be exciting and interesting, but it 
      isn&#39;t like that. Our teachers showed us the way to give up defilements and 
      root out our views, conceit and sense of self. It&#39;s a practice which 
      involves dealing with the flesh and blood of the defilements. However 
      difficult it seems, you shouldn&#39;t he too quick to throw out what you have 
      inherited from these teachers of the forest tradition. It can be possible 
      to get quite deeply deluded about the mind and the practice of <I>samadhi</I>, 
      because in the course of practice, things which would normally seem 
      unlikely to happen might actually come up, so you can&#39;t always trust 
      yourself. What would you do in such a situation? I&#39;m always careful about 
      this.</P>
      <P>In my first two or three years of practice I still couldn&#39;t really 
      trust myself, but after I became more experienced in meditation and began 
      to have some insight into the dynamics of the mind, there were no 
      problems. Whatever manifests in the course of the practice, let it happen. 
      Don&#39;t try to resist it. If you understand how to practise, all these 
      things will cease harmlessly by themselves. They turn into objects for 
      contemplation and so you can use them as material for your meditation and 
      continue in a relaxed way. Perhaps you still have not tried this out. You 
      have done some meditation before haven&#39;t you? Sometimes in the course of 
      meditation, things that shouldn&#39;t normally go wrong can go wrong. For 
      instance, you might begin sitting with a determination: &#39; This time no 
      mucking about, I&#39;m really going to concentrate the mind.&#39; But that day you 
      don&#39;t get anywhere. However, we like to make determinations in that way. 
      Actually, I&#39;ve observed that usually the practice develops according to 
      it&#39;s own causes and conditions. Some nights you might begin sitting 
      meditation with the thought: &#39;Right, tonight I&#39;m not going to get up from 
      my mat until at least one in the morning.&#39; Thinking like that, you&#39;ve 
      already put yourself in an unskilful state of mind, because in no time at 
      all feelings of pain and discomfort will be invading your senses from 
      every direction, to the point where it becomes so unbearable you might 
      even think you are going to die. In fact, the mind sets a length of time 
      for sitting quite naturally by itself without you having to estimate or 
      establish fixed limits. There&#39;s no fixed point or particular time to reach 
      in the practice. Whether it&#39;s seven, eight or nine o&#39;clock, that&#39;s not the 
      most important thing; just keep meditating, maintaining your equanimity 
      and without forcing things. Don&#39;t be too compulsive or fixed in your views 
      about things, and don&#39;t try to coerce the heart with over-ambitious 
      declarations of how this time you are really going to do it for certain. 
      Of course it&#39;s at those times that things become all the more uncertain.</P>
      <P>You have to allow the mind to relax. Let the breath flow easily, 
      without making it too short or too long. Don&#39;t try to do anything to it. 
      Let the body be at ease and keep putting effort into the meditation. A 
      voice will come up and ask: &#39;How many hours will you practice tonight? 
      What time will you stop meditating?&#39; It will keep coming back to ask you, 
      so cut it off: &#39;Hey you, don&#39;t interfere!&#39; You have to keep subduing it, 
      because all such thoughts are just the defilements in one form or another, 
      coming to bother you. Don&#39;t pay any attention to them, just rebuke them: 
      &#39;Whether I wish to stop early or late is none of your damn business! If I 
      were to sit meditation the whole night through, it&#39;s not going to harm 
      anybody, so just leave me alone!&#39; Keep cutting them off like this and then 
      keep practising at your own pace. By letting the mind be at ease it will 
      become calm and you will gain a better understanding of the power of 
      attachment and how much you are affected by the tendency to create stories 
      and give undue importance to things. It might take what seems like forever 
      (maybe more than half the night) before you find that you can sit with 
      ease, but this is an indication that you have found the right way in the 
      meditation. Then you will have some insight into how your attachment and 
      clinging truly is defilement and that it exists because the mind gets 
      caught in wrong view.</P>
      <P>There are some people who will light a stick of incense in front of 
      them before they sit down to meditate and then make a dramatic 
      determination that they won&#39;t get up until the incense has completely 
      burned down. Then they start meditating, but after only five minutes they 
      feel as if a whole hour has passed and when they open their eyes to look 
      at the incense stick get a surprise when they find that it&#39;s still really 
      long. They close their eyes and restart the meditation and in no time at 
      all are checking the incense again. So, of course, their meditation 
      doesn&#39;t get anywhere. Don&#39;t be like that, it&#39;s like being a monkey. You 
      end up not doing any work at all. You spend the whole period of the 
      meditation thinking about that stick of incense, wondering whether it&#39;s 
      finished or not. Training the mind can easily get to be like this, so 
      don&#39;t attach too much importance to the time.</P>
      <P>In meditation, don&#39;t let <I>tanha</I> and <I>kilesa</I> know the rules 
      of the game or what your goal is in the practice. The voice of the 
      defilements will come and ask you, &#39;How will you practice? How much will 
      you do? How much effort will you put into it? How late will you go?&#39; It 
      will keep bugging you until you make some kind of agreement. If you say 
      that you plan to sit until two in the morning, the defilements will 
      immediately start pestering you. You won&#39;t even have been sitting for an 
      hour and already you&#39;ll feel restless and impatient to finish the 
      meditation. Then the hindrances will come up and say, &#39; Is it so bad that 
      you&#39;re going to die? I thought you were going to really concentrate the 
      mind and yet look how shaky it still is. You made a vow and couldn&#39;t keep 
      to it.&#39; Thinking like this, you just create suffering for yourself. You 
      become self-critical and end up hating yourself. You suffer all the more 
      because there&#39;s no one else to use as a scapegoat and blame for the mess 
      you&#39;ve got yourself into. If you make idealistic vows or determinations, 
      you feel honour-bound to hold to them until you are either successful or 
      die in the process. To do it right according to this style, you have to 
      practise intensely, without letting up. Another way is to practise more 
      gently, without making any fixed vows, though keeping up a steady and 
      persistent effort to train yourself. You will find that sometimes the mind 
      will become calm and the pain in the body will subside. All that stiffness 
      and pain in the legs will disappear by itself.</P>
      <P>So there is this balanced way of practice which means you contemplate 
      everything that you experience. Whatever you do, contemplate it thoroughly 
      and don&#39;t give up the work of meditation. Some people think that when the 
      formal meditation ends, it all stops and they can take a rest, so they let 
      go of their meditation object and stop contemplating. Don&#39;t be like that! 
      Keep reflecting on all that you experience. Whether you encounter good or 
      bad people, rich or poor, important or unimportant, young or old, keep 
      contemplating everything. See that it is all part of meditation.</P>
      <P>Contemplating and investigating the Dhamma means that you must observe 
      and reflect upon the various causes and conditions which influence the 
      mind. Contemplate the various mind-objects: large or small, good or bad, 
      black or white. If there is thinking, then note that the mind is 
      &#39;thinking&#39; and notice how it is only just that much, in actuality. In the 
      end, all mental impressions can be lumped together as <I>aniccam, dukkham, 
      anatta</I>, not to be grasped at or clung to. This is the &#39;graveyard&#39; of 
      all mind-objects. Throw them into these three &#39;pits&#39; and you will see them 
      in the true light of the way things are.</P>
      <P>Seeing <I>&#39;aniccam&#39;</I> for example, is something which doesn&#39;t lead to 
      suffering, but it has to come from contemplation. For instance, if you 
      acquire something attractive and you are pleased with it, keep 
      contemplating that sense of happiness. It&#39;s possible that you might use it 
      for a while and then start to get fed up with it and then want to give it 
      away or sell it; if you can&#39;t find anyone to take it off your hands you 
      might even want to throw it away. Why does this happen? It&#39;s because of <I>
      aniccam</I>. If you can&#39;t sell or get rid of it, you start to suffer. This 
      is the way it is. After you&#39;ve really seen this clearly in one dimension, 
      no matter how many times it crops up you&#39;ll always be able to use that 
      experience to help you to see beyond appearances. It&#39;s the same old story 
      repeating itself. Once you&#39;ve seen it once, you can see it everywhere.</P>
      <P>Sometimes you experience sights and sounds which are unpleasant to the 
      eye and ear, and that brings up aversion. Note that feeling of 
      dissatisfaction and contemplate it. Maybe at some point in the future the 
      feelings will change and you might start taking pleasure in what you 
      previously felt to be unpleasant. The things you like now might have been 
      the cause for aversion to arise in the past. It&#39;s like that sometimes. 
      Once you realise and know clearly for yourself that all pleasant and 
      unpleasant objects and experiences are <I>aniccam</I>, <I>dukkham</I> and
      <I>anatta</I>, then you will not attach to them. You will naturally come 
      to see all phenomena as equal, as having the same intrinsic nature, and 
      view everything simply as Dhamma arising into consciousness.</P>
      <P>Well I have just been talking about my experience in the practice here 
      as it&#39;s been for me, without wishing to make it anything special. When you 
      come to talk about the Dhamma with me, it&#39;s my job to tell you what I 
      know. But really it&#39;s not something you should spend all your time talking 
      about; the best thing is to get down to the practice. Like when you call a 
      friend inviting them to go somewhere with you. You ask them, &#39;Are you 
      going?&#39; and they say yes, so you both go off straight away, simply and 
      without any fuss. That&#39;s the way to practice.</P>
      <P>If you experience different kinds of <I>nimitta</I> [16] during 
      meditation, such as visions of heavenly beings, before anything else it&#39;s 
      important to observe the state of mind very closely. Don&#39;t forget this 
      basic principle. The mind has to be calm for you to experience these 
      things. Be careful not to practise with desire either to experience <I>
      nimitta</I> or not to experience them. If they arise, contemplate them and 
      don&#39;t let them delude you. Reflect that they are not you and they don&#39;t 
      belong to you. They are <I>aniccam, dukkham, anatta</I>, just like all 
      other mind-objects. If you do experience them, don&#39;t let your mind become 
      too interested or dwell on them. If they don&#39;t disappear by themselves, 
      re-establish mindfulness. Put all your attention on the breath, taking a 
      few extra deep breaths. If you take at least three extra-long breaths you 
      should be able to cut out the <I>nimitta</I>. You must keep 
      re-establishing awareness in this way as you continue to practise.</P>
      <P>Don&#39;t view these things as you or belonging to you. They are merely <I>
      nimitta</I> which can deceive the mind into attraction, aversion or fear.
      <I>Nimitta</I> are deluding and uncertain. If you do experience them, 
      don&#39;t give them undue importance or rush after them, because they are not 
      really you. As soon as you experience any kind of <I>nimitta</I>, you 
      should immediately turn your attention back to examine the mind itself. 
      Don&#39;t give up this basic principle of practice. If you do forget this 
      principle, you will tend to get caught up in <I>nimitta</I> and can become 
      deluded or even crazy. You might be so completely far gone that you can no 
      longer converse on the same wavelength as other people. Whatever you 
      experience, the thing which you can trust and be most certain about is 
      your own wisdom. If you experience <I>nimitta</I>, watch the mind. It has 
      to be calm, for you to experience them.</P>
      <P>The important point is to see <I>nimitta</I> as not-self. They can be 
      useful to someone with wisdom, but harmful to someone without. Keep 
      practising until you are no longer exited by <I>nimitta</I>. If they arise 
      they arise, if they don&#39;t they don&#39;t. Don&#39;t be afraid of them. If your 
      wisdom has developed to the point where you can trust your own judgement, 
      you won&#39;t have any problems. At first you become excited by <I>nimitta</I> 
      because they are new and interesting and there is a desire to experience 
      them. You become satisfied with them and this is a form of delusion. You 
      might not even want to become attracted to them, but it happens and you 
      don&#39;t know what to do or the right way to practice, so they actually 
      become a source of suffering. If the mind goes into a good mood because of 
      them, never mind. Establish awareness of the good mood and know it as 
      defilement and as something which is itself uncertain. This is the wise 
      way to let go of your attachment. Don&#39;t try to do it by telling yourself, 
      &#39;I don&#39;t want to be in a good mood, why is there this good mood?&#39; That&#39;s 
      the wrong way to do it. It&#39;s meditating with wrong view. It&#39;s going wrong 
      right here, close at hand, not far away. There&#39;s no need to fear <I>
      nimitta</I> or any other aspect of the meditation. I&#39;m just describing to 
      you some of the things that can happen, because I have some previous 
      experience, however, you must take this away and contemplate for 
      yourselves whether what I&#39;ve said is right or wrong. That&#39;s enough for 
      now.</P>
