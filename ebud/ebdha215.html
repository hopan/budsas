        <p><strong><font size="4" color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">1.
        Introduction</font></strong></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">The following discourse
        is based on a collection of lectures on the <b><i>Anatta</i></b>
        doctrine given by Sayadaw U Silananda. <b><i>Anatta</i></b> is a Pali
        word consisting of a negative prefix, '<b><i>an</i></b>' meaning not,
        plus <b><i>atta</i></b>, soul, and is most literally translated as
        no-soul. The word <b><i>atta</i></b>, however has a wide range of
        meanings, and some of those meanings cross over into the fields of
        psychology philosophy and everyday terminology as, for example, when
        atta can mean self, being, ego, and personality.</font></p>
        <font color="#000000">
        <p></font><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">Therefore, in
        this preface, we will examine and elucidate the wide range of meanings
        which <b><i>atta</i></b> can signify in order to determine exactly what
        the Buddha denied when He proclaimed that He teaches anatta, that is,
        when He denied the existence of atta. We will examine both Buddhist and
        non-Buddhist definitions of the term soul, and we will also examine
        modern definitions of terms such as ego and self.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">Most writers in the
        field of religion, when writing about soul or anatta specifically use
        the terms self, ego, being and soul interchangeably, while psychologists
        define those terms as totally different entities. If we define atta as
        including the terms self ego, personality, and being, we may make the
        mistake of claiming that Buddha denied the phenomena of individual
        differences, individual personalities, individual kamma and other
        features of individuality in people.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">But if we say that
        Buddha denied only the theological entity of a soul, while leaving
        intact a psychological entity such as an ego or self, then we are also
        mistaken. The resolution of this dilemma lies in the fact that we must
        deal with two levels of reality simultaneously, the ultimate level and
        the conventional level.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">In the absolute sense,
        the anatta doctrine denies any and all psychological entities or agents
        inside the person. In the absolute sense, all phenomena, including what
        is called a person, are composed of elements, forces, and a stream of
        successive states.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">The Buddha organised
        these phenomena into conceptual groups, known as khandhas (aggregates),
        and they are: (1) material processes, also known as bodily form,
        corporeality or matter; (2) feeling; (3) perception; (4) mental
        formations; and (S) consciousness. Most important ý when all mental and
        physical phenomena are analysed into those elements, no residual entity,
        such as a soul, self, or ego, can be found. In short, there are actions
        executed by these groups, but no actor The workings of these groups of
        forces and elements appear to us as an ego or personality but in reality
        the ego or self or agent of the actions has only an illusory existence.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">However on the
        conventional level, the workings of these forces, elements, and states
        are organised by causal laws, and, although they in no way constitute
        any extra-phenomenal self or soul, they do produce a human individual, a
        person - if we want to call a certain combination of material and mental
        processes a person.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">This complex combination
        of material and mental processes is dependent entirely on previous
        processes, especially the continuity of kamma which is the process of
        ethical volitions and the results of those volitions. Thus individual
        differences are accounted for even though the self or ego or personality
        is, in the ultimate sense, denied.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">An individual may be an
        angry, hot-tempered person, for example, because in the past he or she
        has performed actions which leave conditions for traits, which are kamma
        results, to arise in the present. But this happens because kamma leaves
        a potential for those traits of anger and ill will to arise, not because
        any kind of self of the person is continuing. Actually the human
        individual does not remain the same for two conseclusive moments;
        everything is a succession of forces and elements, and there is nothing
        substantial.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">Therefore, on the
        conventional level, we may say that individual differences have an
        illusory existence. Common everyday conceptions, such as ego, self, and
        personality seem to be very real, obvious, and well-defined by
        psychologists and laymen alike, but they are, on the absolute level and
        in the eyes of those who have achieved enlightenment, illusory.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">Another way to approach
        Buddhist psychology is to examine the very complex and technical
        psychological system known as Abhidhamma. The Abhidhamma is, in the
        words of Narada Maha Thera, &quot;a psychology without a psyche&quot;.
        Abhidhamma teaches that ultimate reality consists of four elementary
        constituents.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">One, Nibbana (in
        Sanskrit, Nirvana) is unconditioned, and the other three, citta,
        cetasika, and rupa - consciousness, mental factors, and matter
        respectively - are conditioned. These elementary constituents, called
        dhammas, alone possess ultimate reality. The familiar world of objects
        and persons, and the interior world of ego and self are only conceptual
        constructs created by the mind out of the elemental dhammas.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">Abhidhamma thus
        restricts itself to terms that are valid from the standpoint of ultimate
        realities: it describes reality in terms of ultimate truth. Thus it
        describes dhammas, their characteristics, their functions, and their
        relations.&nbsp; All conceptual entities such as self or being or
        person, are resolved into their ultimates, into bare mental and material
        phenomena, which are impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, and
        empty of any abiding self or substance.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">Consciousness, for
        example, which seems like one continual flow, is described as a
        succession of discrete evanescent mental events, the cittas, and a
        complex set of mental factors, the cetasikas, which perform more
        specialised tasks in the act of consciousness. There is no self, soul,
        or any kind of agent inside a person involved in this process.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">Now let us examine some
        of the terms related to atta that we find in various sources. The
        definition of Soul, Spirit given in the Abingdon Dictionary of Living
        Religions is as follows: &quot;That which gives life to any animate
        thing; or the inner essential, or noncorporeal part or dimension of any
        animate thing; or a noncorporeal but animate substance or entity; or a
        noncorporeal but individuated personal being.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">Another definition of
        soul comes from Richard Kennedy in The lnternational Dictionary of
        Religion: &quot;Many religions teach that man is composed of a physical
        body, which does not survive death, and an eternal, invisible core which
        is the true self or soul.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">Donald Watson, in A
        Dictionary of Mind and Spirit, writes, in the entry Sou/: &quot;It goes
        by many names: jiva (Jain), Atman (Hindu), Monad, Ego, Self, Higher
        Self, Overself, elusive self, psyche, or even Mind.&quot; In these
        non-Buddhist definitions of soul, we see many terms inter-changed, such
        as core, ego, and essence. Sayadaw U Silananda will elaborate on these
        meanings in his lectures.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">Two Buddhist definitions
        of atta are here given. The first is from Nyanatiloka's Buddhist
        Dictionary. &quot;... anything that in the ultimate sense could be
        regarded as a self existing, real ego-entity soul or any other abiding
        substance. &quot; In The Truth of Anatta, Dc G.P Malalasekera states
        that atta is &quot;self, as a subtle metaphysical entity soul.&quot;'
        These definitions also cover a wide range of meanings of the term atta
        and of the usual translations of atra as soul and self.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">The above definitions of
        atta, soul, sometimes cross over into the realm of psychology when the
        authors define soul as self, ego, psyche or mind. Did the Buddha deny
        that such conceptions as ego and self are real when He proclaimed the
        anatta doctrine? Once again, the answer depends on whether we are
        speaking of absolute or conventional reality. But first we will examine
        some definitions from psychology to see what was actually denied both
        implicitly and explicitly by the anatta doctrine.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">According to the
        Dictionary of Psychology self is: &quot;(1) the individual as a
        conscious being. (2) the ego or I. (3) the personality or organisation
        of traits.&quot; The definition of ego is &quot;the self, particularly
        the individual's conception of himself.&quot; Personality is defined as
        &quot;the dynamic organisation within the individual of those psycho
        physical systems that determine his characteristic behaviour and
        thought.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">Another definition of
        personality is &quot;that which permits a prediction of what a person
        will do in a given situation.&quot;&quot; These psychological terms
        correspond to some of the terms used in Buddhism to deal with the
        conventional life of sentient beings. They have a useful purpose as
        labels, but in the ultimate sense, these labels are, as we shall see,
        mere designations which have only an illusory reality,</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">In Pali, we have the
        terms satta, puggala, jiva and atta to describe the conventional
        psychology of beings. Satta, according to Nyanatiloka, means &quot;living
        being.&quot; Puggala means &quot;individual, person, as well as the
        synonyms: personality individuality being (satta), self (atta). Tiva is
        &quot;life, vital princi-ple, individual soul.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">Some uses of atta also
        fall within the realm of psychology Atta can mean, according to Dr.
        Malalasekera, &quot;one's self or one's own, e.g. attahitaya patipanno
        no parahitaya (acting in one's own interest, not in the interest of
        others) or attana va akatam sadhu (what is done by one's own self is
        good).&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">Atta can also mean
        &quot;one's own person, the personality including body and mind, e.g. in
        atrabhava (life), attapatilabha (birth in some form of life).&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">Pali has some terms
        which correspond to the psychological notions of traits. For example,
        the concept of nature or character is called carita. Using this term, we
        can speak of different types of persons. For example. we may describe a
        person as raga-carita (greedy-natured), dosa-carica (hateful-natured),
        moha-carita (dull-natured), saddha-carita (faithful-natured),
        buddhi-carita (intelligent-natured), and vitakka-carita
        (ruminating-natured) - six types altogether Different people are at
        different stages of development, according to their kamma. Buddhism does
        not deny that such conceptions of individuality have validity but they
        have validity only in the conventional sense.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">Dr Malalasekera writes:
        &quot;Buddhism has no objection to the use of the words atta, or satta,
        or puggala to indicate the individual as a whole, or to distinguish one
        person from another where such distinction is necessary, especially as
        regards such things as memory and kamma which are private and personal
        and where it is necessary to recognise the existence of separate lines
        of continuity (santana).</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">But, even so, these
        terms should be treated only as labels, binding-conceptions and
        conventions in language, assisting economy in thought and word and
        nothing more. Even the Buddha uses them sometimes: 'These are worldly
        usages worldly terms of communication, worldly descriptions, by which a
        Tathagata communicates without misapprehending them&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">Nyanatiloka adds to this
        idea when writing about the term satta: &quot;This term, just like atta,
        puggala, jiva and all other terms denoting 'ego-entity,' is to be
        considered as a merely conventional term (vohara-vacana), not possessing
        any reality value.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">All of the various
        conceptions of psychology and religion regarding a self or soul of any
        kind were indeed denied existence in the ultimate sense by the Buddha.
        But we may use terms such as self and ego to describe a particular
        arrangement of the five khandhas (aggregates) which give the illusory
        appearance of an individual. As Sister Vajira, an Arahant at the time of
        the Buddha, said:</font></p>
        <p align="center"><strong><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000066">When
        all constituent parts are there,</font><br>
        <font color="#000066">The designation 'cart' is used;</font><br>
        <font color="#000066">Just so, where the five groups exist,</font><br>
        <font color="#000066">Of 'living being' do we speak.</font></font></strong></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">In conclusion, the
        Sayadaw U Silananda has given us lectures on the anatta doctrine in
        which he uses terms such as soul and self interchangeably. This is
        because the doctrine of anatta was taught by the Buddha from the point
        of view of the Fully Enlightened One, a view which saw that all things
        are anatta. It is with this wisdom that the lectures are given.</font></p>
        <hr>
        <b>
        <p><font size="4" color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">2.
        Impermanence, Suffering and No-Soul</font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The doctrine of anatta is very important
        to Buddhists. No realisation of Truth can occur without the knowledge of
        the anatta (no-soul) nature of things. To realise Truth, one must
        practice meditation, and during meditation, the knowledge of anatta must
        arise. One needs the knowledge of anicca, dukkha, and anatta, that is,
        the knowledge of impermanence, of suffering, and of the no-soul nature
        of things. Until one experiences these characteristics in meditation,
        not just intellectually, but directly, one cannot make progress.
        Vipassana (Insight) meditation deals directly with these
        characteristics.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">These characteristics run through all
        stages of vipassana. I will discuss Vipassana later, but first we must
        explain what conceals the three characteristics from perception during
        meditation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Impermanence is concealed by continuity
        If one looks at a candle flame, one may think that it is the same flame
        from moment to moment. Actually, the flame is constantly disappearing
        and arising again every second. We have the illusion of one flame
        because of the idea and appearance of continuity.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The nature of suffering is concealed by
        changing into different postures. When we are sitting and feel some
        pain, we change posture and the pain goes away. Actually we are changing
        postures constantly at every moment of our lives, but this is not
        apparent to us. The moment a tiny unpleasant sensation is felt, we
        change postures. The characteristic of no-soul is concealed by the
        perception that things are compact and solid. We look at things and at
        ourselves as solid, compact things. Until we can break through the false
        perception that we are compact, we will not see the no-soul nature of
        things.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">That is why there are meditational
        practices in which the four elements, earth, water, fire, and air are
        contemplated. Actually the primary Qualities of those elements are
        contemplated: earth is characterised by hardness or softness, water by
        fluidity or cohesion, fire by heat, and air by extending or supporting.
        If we can have the insight into phenomena as being composed of elements
        and their characteristics, then the idea of compactness will be
        weakened.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We think that we are substantial, but if
        we have insight into our real nature, the nature of being composed of
        nama and rupa, or more precisely of elements and forces mutually
        dependent and interacting with each other then the idea of a coherent,
        abiding, substantial self is weakened, and nothing we can call a self is
        found.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The anatta doctrine is of primary
        importance to a Buddhist. In fact, anatta can only be understood when
        there is a Buddha or a Buddha's teaching in the world. No one but a
        Buddha can penetrate into the anatta nature of things because only
        through Vipassana meditation, discovered by Buddha, can insight into
        anatta be realised. Even though great and profound thinkers are around,
        they still cannot penetrate into anatta, and other kinds of meditation,
        such as Samatha (Tranquillity), may give you psychic powers or higher
        states of consciousness, but they cannot lead you to the insight into
        anatta.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As I mentioned earlier, the belief in a
        soul was described by the Buddha as a major cause of suffering. The
        belief in atta of any kind, whether belief in a personal ego or in a
        spiritual self, is the cause of all dukkhas in this rounds of rebirth;
        the belief in atta is the root of greed, hatred, and delusion. Atheists
        may not believe in a spiritual soul, but they serve the desires of their
        personal ego and thus may commit deeds of greed, hatred, and delusion.
        The idea of atta is very hard to conquer but still we must try because
        realisation of anatta is the way to deliverance, while the persistence
        of the idea of atta is a major cause of misery.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One cannot over-emphasise the importance
        of anatta, as Nyanatiloka explains:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Whosoever has not penetrated this
        impersonality of all existence, and does not comprehend that in reality
        there exists only this continually self consuming process of arising and
        passing bodily and mental phenomena, and that there is no separate
        ego-entity within or without this process, he will not be able to
        understand Buddhism, i.e., the teaching of the Four Noble Truths... in
        the right light.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">He will think that it is his ego, his
        personality, that experiences suffering, his personality that performs
        good and evil actions and will be reborn according to these actions, his
        personality that will enter Nibbana, his personality that walks on the
        Eightfold Path.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The words of Nyanatiloka bring up a very
        important point often asked about Nibbana: In the absence of a soul, who
        or what is it that enters Nibbana? This is a diffcult subject. From what
        has been said so far in this lecture, we can certainly say that there is
        no atta or self which realises Nibbana What realizes Nibbana is
        insight-wisdom, Vipassana-panna. It is not the property of a personal or
        universal self, but is rather a power developed ' through meditative
        penetration of phenomena.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yet another even more difficult Question
        is: What happens to a Tathãgata (here in the sense of one who has
        realised Nibbãna) after deathl Once again, Buddha gave his answer
        without recourse to any kind of spiritual entity such as atta. Buddha
        essentially replied that no words could possibly describe what happens
        to a Tathagata after death: &quot;A Tathãgata released from what is
        called body etc., is profound, immeasurable, hard to fathom, like the
        great ocean.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It does not fit the case to say that he
        is reborn or not reborn, or reborn and not reborn, or neither reborn nor
        not reborn.&quot; Then He goes on to say, after being Questioned
        further: &quot;Profound is this doctrine, hard to see, hard to
        comprehend, calm, excellent, beyond the sphere of reasoning, subtle,
        intelligible only to the wise.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus Nibbana, the Absolute Noble Truth,
        the extinction of all continuity and becoming, the &quot;Unborn,
        Unoriginated, Uncreated, Unformed&quot;. Reality is affirmed without
        reference to atta. Likewise, the Arahant who realises Nibbana does so by
        means of a flash of insight which destroys forever all illusions of the
        existence of atta. I will conclude with some well-written words from
        Nyanatiloka:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One cannot too often and too
        emphatically stress the fact that not only for the actual realisation of
        the goal of Nibbana, but also for a theoretical understanding of it, it
        is an indispensable preliminary condition to grasp fully the truth of
        anatta, the egolessness and insubstantiality of all forms of existence.
        Without such an understanding, one will necessarily misconceive Nibbana
        - according to one's either materialistic or metaphysical leanings -
        either as annihilation of an ego, or an eternal state of existence into
        which an ego or self enters or with which it merges. Hence it is said:</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><br>

        <font color="#000066"><b>Nibbana is, but not the man who enters it;</b></font><br>

        Experience of Anatta</font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The anatta doctrine is extremely
        difficult to comprehend. One can speculate or ponder about it - that is
        one kind of knowledge, acquired by listening to a lecture or by reading.
        One may also ponder over it more deeply in contemplation. But one can
        only really penetrate into it during vipassana meditation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When yogis practice, they keep
        themselves aware of everything. When they see something, there are two
        things: the mind which sees and the object seen, apart from these, there
        is nothing. More specifically, seeing is a process which depends on four
        things: the eye, the visible object, light, and attention to the object.
        If one of these conditions is lacking, no seeing occurs. If one does not
        have eyes, no atta can make one see. Only when all conditions are met
        does seeing consciousness arise. No agent like atta is a part of this.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Likewise, when yogis note themselves
        thinking during meditation, they note &quot;thinking, thinking,
        thinking,&quot; and they find only thinking and the mind which notes it
        - they do not find a self or ego or atta. They do not find that &quot;I
        am thinking,&quot; unless they add this idea as an afterthought. They
        really only find that thinking is occurring. In this process, yogis can
        see the impermanence of mind and thought: one thought comes, then goes;
        another thought comes and goes, and this goes on and on.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">A new thought comes every moment,
        arising and disappearing. They directly see the impermanence of thought.
        They can also notice the impermanence of material things, such as
        physical pain, by noting the arising and disappearing of the pain in the
        body. They can see that all things are oppressed by rise and fall, by
        arising and disappearing. This oppression of phenomena by arising and
        disappearing is the characteristic of dukkha (suffering).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Unwisely, we desire for things to be
        permanent, yet we realise that we have no power to make impermanent
        things permanent; we realise that we have no control or authority over
        things. No inner core, no atta, can be found in any observed phenomena.
        Yogis can discover this anatta nature of things in Vipassana meditation,
        because gradually they bring awareness and concentration to a high
        degree and then they have penetrative knowledge into the true nature of
        mind and body. <!-- text below generated by server. PLEASE REMOVE -->

        <b>Analysis of the Discourse on the Characteristic of No-Soul </b></font></strong><!-- text below generated by server. PLEASE REMOVE -->
        </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let us now study in more detail the
        Sutra which teaches the doctrine of anatta, known as the Anattalakkhana
        Sutta, &quot;The Discourse on the Characteristic of No-Soul.&quot; This
        was the second sermon of the Buddha.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the end of the first sermon, the
        Venerable Kondanna became a Sotapanna (a person at the first stage of
        enlightenment) and then, according to the Commentaries, for example, the
        Commentary on Vinaya, the other four disciples became Sotapannas, one on
        each of the four following days.&nbsp; On the first day after the
        full-moon day in July, the monk Vappa became a Sotapanna; on the second
        day, Bhaddiya; on the third day, Mahanama; and on the fourth day,
        Assaji. After they became Sotapannas, they all asked Buddha for
        ordination. Buddha ordained each of them by calling to them, &quot;Come
        monks.&quot; On the fifth day after the full-moon day, the Buddha
        assembled them and preached to them this discourse on no-soul.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse' is even shorter than the
        first sermon on the Four Noble Truths. It was delivered at the Deer Park
        at Benares. Buddha called the disciples by saying, &quot;Monks,&quot;
        and they replied, &quot;Venerable Sir&quot; and then the Buddha started.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We can divide the Sutta into five parts.
        In the first part, Buddha says that the five ag,regates are not atta,
        not self or soul. In the second section, Buddha asks the monks if the
        five aggregates are permanent or impermanent, pleasurable or painful,
        and then He arrives at the conclusion that the nature of the five
        aggregates is anatta. In the third section, Buddha teaches that the five
        aggregates should not be taken as a soul or self or as belonging to
        one-self. In the fourth section, Buddha explains briefly the progress of
        Vipassana meditation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The last section records that all five
        monks had attained the stage of Arahant. By the end of the Sutta, all
        five monks became Arahants which is the highest stage of enlightenment.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddha says, &quot;Bhikkhus, form is
        anatta, (form is not soul or self. Were form soul, then this form would
        not lead to affliction, and one could have it of form: 'Let my form be
        thus; let my form be not thus.' And since form is not soul, so it leads
        to affliction, and none can have it of form: 'Let my form be thus; let
        my form be not thus.&quot;' Here the Pali word rupa is translated as
        form.&nbsp;&nbsp; The word forms here used in the sense of material
        properties or just matter.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The reader may recall that the first of
        the five aggregates is form or corporeality But form cannot be atta
        because it is subject to affliction. Atta (self or soul) must have the
        meaning which we discussed earlier: that of vasavattana, something which
        has the power and autonomy to change the nature of things. No one likes
        pain and affliction in the body, but it cannot be changed. If form were
        atta, people could abolish pain, disease, and ugliness by merely
        wishing. But there is no core or director or soul inside or outside of
        people which has the power to accomplish such actions.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddha considered the second aggregate
        and says: &quot;Feeling is not soul.&nbsp; Were feeling soul, then this
        feeling would not lead to affliction, and one could have it of feeling:
        'Let my feeling be thus; let my feeling be not thus.&quot;' Then Buddha
        takes the third, fourth, and fifth aggregates:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Perception is not soul... Mental
        formations are not soul.... Consciousness is not soul. Were
        consciousness soul, then this consciousness would not lead to
        affliction, and one could have it of consciousness: 'Let my
        consciousness be thus; let my consciousness be not thus.&quot;'
        Consciousness cannot be atta because it is not under our control.
        Consciousness is unavoidably subject to afflictions - to sorrow,
        depression, and frustration. We cannot avoid being conscious of ugly
        sights, sounds, and sensations in the world, although we would like to
        arrange coming into contact with pleasant sensual objects only.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Likewise, in meditation, we would like
        to be conscious only of the meditation object, and we would like to
        achieve stillness of mind and concentration, but this is not easy, and
        we cannot will it. If consciousness were atta, we could will our
        consciousness to be still and concentrated, and then we could proceed to
        the higher states of mind - perhaps it would only take one day to
        advance to the higher stages of meditation!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">But in all cases, consciousness arises
        completely determined by circumstances and conditions, conditions which
        are not under our control. Therefore, consciousness cannot be atta. In
        the second section of the Sutta, Buddha asks the monks some Questions,
        which they answer. Buddha says: &quot;Bhikkhus, how do you conceive it:
        Is form permanent or impermanent!&quot; Since they were already
        sotapannas, they had already seen that the five aggregates are
        impermanent, suffering, and no-soul, so they answered, &quot;Impermanent,
        Venerable Sir.&quot; Now Buddha asks, &quot;Is what is impermanent,
        painful, and subject to change fit to be regarded thus:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">'This is mine. This is I. This is my
        soul?&quot;' They answered, &quot;No, Venerable Sir&quot; Form is
        impermanent because it disappears. It comes into being and then
        vanishes. It has a beginning and an end. The monks had already realised
        by means of Vipassana knowledge that form is impermanent. They had
        already seen the three marks of impermanence, which are the three phases
        of existence: arising, continuation, and dissolution.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another way to state this process is to
        call it non-existence after having been in existence, in Pali - hutva
        abhavato. Buddha then proceeds to explain that whatever is impermanent
        is also painful. The mark of pain (dukkha) is constant oppression by
        rise and fall, by arising and dissolution. This can be seen during
        meditation, when yogis take thoughts as objects and look at them
        closely. They see that the moment a thought is observed as an object, it
        disappears, and another thought takes its place.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As meditators observe very closely with
        concentration, they see all objects in the mind arising and disappearing
        constantly, and this is seen as a kind of oppression by arising and
        disappearing. Phenomena are called oppressed by rise and fall because
        nothing is ever at peace; everything is menaced by an endless flux. In
        this sense, whatever is impermanent is dukkha.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dukkha means more than just
        painful.&nbsp; Dukkha also comes from our desire for permanence. Dukkha
        means diffìcult to bear mentally and physically, and thus we call the
        impermanence of all phe-nomena dukkha (suffering).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the third part of Buddha's
        Questioning, He asks, &quot;Is that which is impermanent and painful fit
        to be called 'mine, I, my self or soul?&quot;&quot; Buddha is here
        leading the monks to the discovery of anatta. Is something that is
        disappearing fit to be called atta? No. From anicca (impermanence) to
        dukkha (suffering, and finally to anatta (no-soul) the monks are led.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let us review again the processes which
        hide impermanence, suffering, and no-soul. We, as unenlightened people,
        fail to see impermanence because we do not see the arising and
        disappearing of things. We are tricked by continuity, which hides the
        nature of impermanence. We look at things or at consciousness and see
        them as continuous.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In order to see impermanence, we must
        observe closely the arising and disappearing of phenomena. We must
        penetrate, by means of concentration and insight developed in
        meditation, through the impression of continuity which acts as a cover
        of impermanence.&nbsp; Let us think of a ring of fire. Someone has a
        torch and twirls it to create an impression of a circle of fire. But we
        know that there is really no ring of fire; it is just the impressions of
        individual positions of the fire at different places and at different
        times. But our mind takes the impressions as something continuous;
        rather, our mind connects the impressions and we deceive ourselves.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we could take a moving picture of the
        process and watch it at a slow speed, we would see the individual parts
        of the sequence of the apparent ring of fire. We would only see light at
        different places and not a circle. If we cannot pinpoint the components
        of things in order to see them arising and disappearing, we will
        continue to see things as whole entities.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let us note here that impermanence in
        this context means momentary impermanence. If we drop a cup which
        breaks, we say that it is impermanent. Or if a person dies, we say that
        the person is impermanent. These examples of impermanence are easy to
        see.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">But when we use that term in the context
        of Vipassana meditation, we mean the constant arising and disappearing
        of phenomena, and this can only be observed during Vipassana meditation.
        Similarly by dukkha, we do not mean ordinary pain or illness. We mean
        the constant oppression by arising and disappearing, and this can also
        be seen only in Vipassana meditation, even in phenomena we call
        pleasurable.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Please recall that dukkha is concealed
        by postures; more specifically, there is always dukkha in the body but
        we conceal that pain by changing postures.&nbsp; That is why we instruct
        meditators to sit very still while they are meditating. If yogis avoid
        changing postures often, they will achieve mindfulness and
        concentration, and they will observe the nature of dukkha
        directly.&nbsp; Anatta, the no-soul nature of all things, is concealed
        by compactness. We usually see things as solid and compact. We have to
        train our minds through Vipassana meditation to look at and analyse that
        compactness more closely.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Just as a scientist uses a microscope to
        look at things in a laboratory so yogis must use concentration in
        Vipassana meditation to penetrate into the unsubstantial, anatta nature
        of things. We must try to see through the apparently solid mass of
        mental and physical phenomena.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Regarding material things, we try to
        anaýze and observe them as earth, water fire, air and other material
        properties. Regarding mental phenomena, we try to see that, for example,
        one phenomena is contact, another feeling, and another perception,
        although these may have been experienced very rapidý as oný one mental
        event. Both mental and physical phenomena are composed of oný elements
        and forces, and thus have the nature of being anatta (unsubstantial).
        That is why we must try to observe everything very slowly in meditation
        in order to see that phenomena are not held together with a core, an
        atta.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">For example, all mental states and
        material properties have their own functions. Contact has one function,
        feeling another, and perception still another. If we see these mental
        phenomena as one connected whole, we fail to see them as parts with
        specific functions, and we fail to see them as void of a central core,
        atta.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">These mental states actually have
        different ways of taking objects and responding to them. Lobha
        (attachment) has one kind of response; dosa (hatred) another. We must
        see the individual differences of these mental states. We need to
        analyse and observe deeply to see that mind and matter have individual
        functions and responses. On superficial observation and analysis,
        everything seems to be compact, whole, and substantial. All of us think
        that a book is very solid, but if we could look at this book under a
        microscope, it would appear full of holes, with empty spaces, like a
        sieve.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Vipassana is like using a microscope to
        see that all things are only elements and forces which are not unified
        by any kind of core, by any kind of atta.&nbsp; In the third section of
        the Sutta, Buddha states that: 'Any kind of form, whether past, future,
        or presently arisen; whether in oneself or external; whether inferior or
        superior; whether far or near; must with right understanding be regarded
        thus:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">'This is not mine; this is not I; this
        is not my self or soul.&quot;' There can be different kinds of form,
        different kinds of matter, but none of them can be regarded as atta or
        as having atta. The same is true for feelings, perceptions, mental
        formations, and consciousness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Next, Buddha explains to the monks the
        progress made by a meditator:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When a noble follower who has
        heard the truth sees thus, he finds estrangement in form, finds
        estrangement in feeling, finds estrangement in perceptions...&nbsp; in
        mental formations... in consciousness.&quot; This means that the
        meditator becomes weary of form, dispassionate about matter. The
        meditator realises that the aggregates are impermanent, suffering, and
        no-soul.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When he finds estrangement,
        passion fades out.&quot; Buddha is here describing stages of Vipassana
        meditation in a very brief form with many stages left, out. The disciple
        wants to be free from the five aggregates, so this person makes more
        effort. The meditator then arrives at equanimity about formations. When
        Buddha uses the phrase &quot;finds estrangement,&quot; He is referring
        to all of the stages of Vipassana up to the very highest stage. After
        finding estrangement, passion fades out in one moment, the moment of
        enlightenment. That is the moment known as Path consciousness when some
        defilement of the mind are eradicated.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddha continues, &quot;With the fading
        of passion, he is liberated.&quot; This means that the meditator has
        reached the two or three moments after Path consciousness known as
        Fruition consciousness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When liberated. there is knowledge
        that he is liberated.&quot; Here the meditator reflects on the Path, on
        Fruition, on Nibbãna, on defilements destroyed, and on defilements that
        are remaining.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">He understands: 'Birth is exhausted. The
        holy life has been lived out. What need to be done is done. Of this
        there is no more beyond.&quot;' Like Buddha when He became enlightened,
        the meditator says similar words.&nbsp; The discourse ends: &quot;This
        is what the Blessed One said. The Bhikkhus were glad, and they approved
        His words. Now during this utterance, the hearts of the Bhikkhus of the
        group of five were liberated from taints, through clinging no more.&quot;
        This means that they had become Arahants. By under-standing the doctrine
        of anatta, they were now free of all fetters, defilements, and
        impurities. They had reached the highest state of enlightenment. They
        had realised Nibbana and were free from all rebirth.</font></p>

        Understanding Anatta</font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The anatta doctrine is one of the most
        important teachings of Buddhism. It is the most distinctive feature of
        Buddhism, for as many scholars have recognised, it makes Buddhism
        different from all other religions. Scholars write that all other
        religions accept the existence of some kind of spiritual, metaphysical,
        or psychological entity or agent or being inside and, in some cases,
        simultaneously outside of sentient beings. That is, most religions
        accept the existence of a soul or self.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Donald Watson writes: &quot;Of the world's
        major religions, only Buddhism denies or is agnostic about the existence
        of a soul.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another scholar Richard Kennedy writes:
        &quot;According to Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, each soul will be
        judged at the end of the world.... It is the soul which will determine
        whether the individual is punished by hell or rewarded by eternal life
        in heaven.... Buddhism teaches that there is no such thing as a soul or
        true, permanent self.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Encyclopedia Americana writes:
        &quot;In Buddhism there is no perduring or surviving self such as the
        atman. Meditation leads to the awareness that the idea of self, or
        atman, is mere illusion.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In A Dictionary of Comparative Religion,
        the teaching of the existence of the soul is traced through every major
        religion throughout history: primitive animistic, Egyptian,
        Mesopotamian, Hebrew, Greek religion in Homeric, Orphic, Pythagorean,
        and Platonic versions; Hindu, Zoroastrian, Chinese, Muslim, Japanese,
        and Christian. But, as the writers state, &quot;Buddhism, in its classic
        form, rejected the Hindu concept of atman as the essential, immortal
        self....&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As we can see, Buddhism is the only
        major religion that denies the existence of a metaphysical entity which
        is usually called a self or soul.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism is divided into two major
        schools, Theravada and Mahayana, which have, in some cases, major
        differences. But both schools adhere to the anatta doctrine. H. von
        Glasenapp writes: &quot;The negation of an imperishable Atman is the
        common characteristic of all dogmatic systems of the Lesser as well as
        the Great Vehicle (meaning here Theravada and Mahayana, respectively],
        and, there is, therefore, no reason to assume that Buddhist tradition
        which is in complete agreement on this point has deviated from the
        Buddha's original teaching.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although the anatta doctrine is so
        important, so distinctive, and supposedly so universally accepted by
        Buddhists, it is still the most misunderstood, the most misinterpreted,
        and the most distorted of all the teachings of the Buddha.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some scholars who have written on
        Buddhism had a great respect for the Buddha, liked His teachings,
        revered Him, and honoured Him, but they could not imagine that such a
        profound thinker had actually denied the existence of a
        soul.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently they have tried to find apparent
        loopholes in the teachings through which they have tried to insert the
        affirmation of atta by the Buddha.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">For example, two modern scholars, Ananda
        K. Coomaraswamy and I B. Horner in their book, The Living Thoughts of
        Gotama the Buddha, have devoted much of the book to the idea that Buddha
        taught a doctrine of two selves, the great Self, spelled with an upper
        case 'S' to signify the spiritual self or soul, and a small self, the
        personal ego, spelled with a lower case 's'.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">They claim that Buddha denied only this
        personal self or ego when He spoke of anatta. These scholars base their
        ideas on mistranslation of Pali terms, and later in these lectures I
        will devote considerable time to analysing the Pali passages which they
        have mistranslated.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another scholar John Blofeld, also
        claims that Buddha was really teaching a doctrine of two selves, one
        true Self or Soul, and one false personal self or ego. Notice in the
        following quote how he must clarify that the Zen doctrine of Self or One
        Mind is not in the reality the Atman of the Hindu Brahmins:-</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The doctrine of Atman has always been
        the centre of Buddhist controversy. There is no doubt that Gautama
        Buddha made it one of the central points of his teaching, but the
        interpretations of it are various. The Theravadins interpret it not only
        as &quot;no self,&quot; but also as &quot;no Self,&quot; thereby denying
        man both an ego and all participation in something of the nature of
        Universal Spirit or the One Mind. The Mahayanists accept the
        interpretation of &quot;egolessness,&quot; holding that the real &quot;Self&quot;
        is none other than that indescribable &quot;non-entity,&quot; the One
        Mind; something far less of an &quot;entity&quot; than the Ãtman of the
        Brahmins.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The &quot;Universal Spirit,&quot; &quot;One
        Mind,&quot; and &quot;Self&quot; which Blofeld finds within the anatta
        doctrine are really an Atman, an atta, of a finer substance, &quot;less
        of an entity &quot; as he says, but nevertheless an Atman. These ideas
        of atta are therefore in conflict with the anatta doctrine of the
        Buddha. As mentioned before, most Mahayanists accept the doctrine of
        anatta, but later schools of Mahayana, such as the Chinese Zen of which
        Blofeld writes, may have drifted into a soul-like theory.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The controversy over the anatta doctrine
        seems to be based on a deep fear of the denial of the existence of a
        soul. People are often very attached to their lives, so they like to
        believe that there exists something everlasting, eternal, and permanent
        inside them. When someone comes along and tells them that there is
        nothing permanent in them, nothing by which they will continue eternally
        such as a soul, they may become frightened. They wonder what will become
        of them in the future - they have the fear of extinction.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddha understood this, as we can see in
        the story of Vacchagotta, who, like many other people, was frightened
        and confused by the anatta doctrine. Vacchagotta was an ascetic who once
        went to the Buddha to discuss some important matters. He asked the
        Buddha, &quot;Is there atta?&quot; Buddha remained&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        silent. Vacchagotta then asked, &quot;Is there no atta&quot; But Buddha
        again remained silent.&nbsp; After Vacchagotta went away Buddha
        explained to Ananda why he had remained silent.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddha explained that He knew that
        Vacchagotta was very confused in his thinking about atta, and that if He
        were to respond that there does exist atta, then He would be expounding
        the eternalist view the eternal soul theory with which He did not agree.
        But if He were to say that atta did not exist, then Vacchagotta might
        think that He was expounding the annihilationist view, the view that a
        person is nothing but a psychophysical organism which will be completely
        annihilated at death.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since this latter view denies kamma,
        rebirth, and dependent origination, Buddha did not agree with this.
        Buddha teaches, in fact, that people are reborn with patisandhi, &quot;relinking
        consciousness,&quot; a rebirth consciousness which does not transmigrate
        from the previous existence, but which comes into existence by means of
        conditions included in the previous existences, conditions such as
        kamma.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus a reborn person is not the same as
        the one who has died, nor is the reborn person entirely different from
        the one who has died. Most importantly no metaphysical entity no soul,
        and no kind of spiritual self continues from one existence to another in
        Buddha's teaching.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">But this teaching was too difficult for
        Vacchagotta, and Buddha wanted to wait for a time when Vacchagotta would
        mature in intellect. Buddha was not a computer who gave automatic
        answers to every Question. He taught according to the circumstances and
        temperaments of the people, for their benefit.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As it happened, Vacchagotta advanced
        spiritually through Vipassana meditation, which allowed him to realize
        the suffering, impermanent, and no-soul nature of all things, and he
        later became an Arahant. Unfortunately, this story is used by some
        scholars to try to prove that Buddha did not really deny the existence
        of atta.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let us now examine the ideas contained
        in the term <b><i>atta</i></b>, Before Buddha appeared in this world,
        Brahmanism, which was later to be called Hinduism, prevailed in India.
        Brãhmanism teaches the doctrine of the existence of <b><i>atta</i></b>
        (in Sanskrit, <b><i>atman</i></b>), which is usually translated as soul
        or self. When Buddha appeared, He claimed that there is no <b><i>atman</i></b>.
        This doctrine was so important that Buddha proclaimed it only five days
        after His first sermon, the sermon on the Four Noble Truths.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The five disciples who heard that first
        sermon became &quot;streamwinners&quot; (Sotapannas) persons who have
        attained the first stage of enlightenment. Five days later, Buddha
        assembled the five disciples and taught them the anatta doctrine. By the
        end of that Sutta, all five became Arahants, persons who have attained
        the highest stage of enlightenment.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">What is this atta which the Buddha
        negated? The word anatta is a combination of two words: <b><i>an</i></b>&nbsp;
        and <b><i>atta</i></b>. <b><i>An</i></b> means not or no, and <b><i>atta</i></b>
        is usually translated as soul or self (sometimes with upper case 'S' to
        signify a spiritual entity). But atta has a wide range of meanings,
        which we will now examine. These terms are discussed in two famous books
        of Hindu scripture, the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita. Many views of
        atta are found in the Buddhist Brahmajala Sutta, which I will discuss
        later.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Atta is the inner core of anything. The
        inner core of a tree is the hardest part and thus the core of something
        can imply permanency The core may also imply the best part of something,
        the part which is the essence, the part which is pure, real, beautiful,
        and enduring. The idea of atta as the core of things is found in the
        Chandogya and Brihadaranyaka Upanishads.'</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another implication of atta is that of
        authority Authority is the ability to make others follow orders. If
        anything is to be called atta, it must have the power to exercise
        authority over the nature of things, as stated in the Kena Upanishad. In
        addition, atta is not subject to any other authority: it is the highest
        authority (sayamvasi) one who is his own master. It is like a lord or
        owner (sami). Atta is the lord of ourselves. It is distinct from
        ourselves and abides in ourselves.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is the dweller (nivasi) which is not
        part of the five aggregates. Atta is also the agent of action, a doer
        (karaka) and it is atta which actually does everything, good or bad.
        Atta is that by which we act, that by which we enjoy or suffer In
        ignorance we identify ourselves with the body and ego, forgetting that
        we are really atta.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we do something, it is really at
        the command of atta, but we ignorantly believe that we as individuals
        actually control our lives.&nbsp; Atta is thus a director and an
        experiencer.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another meaning of atta is that of soul,
        a spiritual entity inside of all people. The soul, called atman in Hindu
        scriptures, is the individual self, and it is identical with the
        Universal Self, the Supreme Being, called Brahman.&nbsp;&nbsp; Atman
        resides in everyone and in every living being. Like Brahman, atman is
        eternal. When the body dies, atman moves to another body and makes that
        body its new home.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this way it moves from one body to
        another discarding the worn-out body and taking a new one. Liberation
        is, according to Hinduism, the realisation that atman is identical with
        the Universal Atman or Brahman, or that the individual atman is part of
        Brahman'.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Atman is eternal - no one can kill or
        wound atman. In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna, one incarnation of the god
        Vishnu, has this in mind when he instructs the great warrior Arjuna, to
        go into battle. Arjuna was at first reluctant to go into battle in order
        to fight against his own cousins, but Krishna tells him that no weapon
        can cut atman, no fire can burn atman. Even if you kill someone, you
        kill only the body:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If any man thinks he slays, and if
        another thinks he is slain, neither knows the way of truth, The Eternal
        in man cannot kill; the Eternal in man cannot die. He is never born, and
        he never dies. He is in Eternity: he is forever more.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Krishna then urges Arjuna to do his
        honourable duty as a member of the warrior caste and go into battle,
        which Arjuna does.&nbsp; Buddha denied the atman theory According to
        Buddha, there is nothing we can call an inner core which is eternal and
        blissful. There is also nothing we can call upon to exercise authority
        over the nature of things. In Buddhism, there is no doer apart from
        doing, and no experiencer apart from the experiencing. There is nothing
        or no one which is omnipotent because everything is at the mercy of the
        constant creation and dissolution of conditioned things.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddha taught that there are only five
        aggregates (khandhas):</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">1) Corporeality (material process, or
          form)<br>
          2) Feelings;<br>
          3) Perceptions;<br>
          4) Metal formations; and<br>
          5) Consciousness.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Less specifically we may say that there
        are only two groups of phenomena in this existence: mind and matter,
        nama and rupa. Apart from mind and matter there exists nothing
        whatsoever that we can call atta. The only thing that exists outside of
        the realm of nama and rupa is the unconditioned (asankhata) Nibbana,
        Absolute Truth, but. as I will discuss later in these lectures, even
        Nibbana is anatta.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddha taught that, for us, there are
        only the five aggregates. We are a compound of five aggregates, and
        after we analyse and observe them one by one with the deep insight of
        meditation, we will realise that there remains nothing: no soul, no
        self, apart from the aggregates. The combination of the five aggregates
        is what we call a person, a being, a man, or a woman.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is nothing apart from the five
        aggregates - corporeality feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and
        consciousness - which are interacting and dependent upon each other. No
        director, no doer no experiencer, and no essence can be found. Atta is
        merely an idea which has no corresponding reality whatsoever.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the sutras, we find a story of a very
        famous ascetic-scholar named Saccaka. One day he heard that Buddha
        taught the anatta doctrine. Since he was a very sharp debater he decided
        that he would go to the Buddha and convince Him that the anatta doctrine
        was wrong. He was very confident; he claimed that if he were to debate
        with a stone pillar, that pillar would sweat from fear. He claimed that,
        just as a strong man takes a goat and flings it around his shoulders, so
        he would take hold of Gotama and fling Him around in debate.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Saccaka and his followers went to the
        Buddha and there exchanged greetings. He asked Buddha to explain the
        doctrines He taught. Buddha replied that He taught anatta.&nbsp; Saccaka
        countered, &quot;No. There is atta. The five aggregates are atta.&quot;
        Buddha replied, &quot;Do you really think that rupa (corporeality) is
        atta?&quot; As it happened, Saccaka was very ugly, and if he said that
        corporeality was atta, then Buddha could counter, &quot;Then why don't
        you make yourself more handsome!&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus Saccaka was forced to say that rupa
        is not atta. Here we can see Buddha striking down several
        characteristics that are attributed to the atta. If Saccaka had an atta,
        he could call upon it to exercise authority and power in order to change
        his appearance. After all, atta is identical to Brahman, the supreme
        ruler the infinite, omnipotent creator and source of all things, as
        explained in the Bhagavad Gita.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">But, according to Buddha, there exist
        only the five aggregates, the five khandhas, and these are not atta
        because they are subject to the laws of impermanence, suffering, and
        no-soul. Rupa (material form) is not atta; it is not master and ruler of
        itself, and it is subject to affliction. The other khandhas - feeling,
        perception, mental formations, and consciousness - are also subject to
        the same laws. Sacccaka was therefore defeated.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although it may be easy to understand
        that rúpa (material form) is not atta, some people may find it
        difficult to understand why the other khandhas - feeling, perception,
        mental formations, and consciousness - which we may summarise as simply
        nama (mind) do not constitute an entity which can be called atta. After
        all, many people believe that mind and soul are identical or
        interrelated, and they define mind and/or soul as that part of a person
        which gives life and consciousness to the physical body and they further
        believe that, as such, it is the spiritual and psychological centre of
        the person.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">But, according to the Buddha, nama is
        not atta for the same reasons that rupa is not atta: nama is equally
        subject to the laws of impermanence, suffering, and no-soul, as we shall
        study further when we analyse the Anatta-lakkhana Sutta in depth. Buddha
        treats nama and rupa equally, and they are mutually dependent upon each
        other:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Just as a wooden puppet, though
        unsubstantial, lifeless, and inactive, may by means of pulling strings
        be made to move about, stand up, and appear full of life and activity;
        just so are mind and body, as such, something empty, lifeless and
        inactive; but by means of their mutual working together, this mental and
        bodily combination may move about, stand up, and appear full of life and
        activity.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Furthermore, we must remember that
        nama-rupa or khandhas are merely abstract classifications made by the
        Buddha, and, as such, they have no real existence as groups. That is,
        there is never the functioning of an entire entity or group known as
        corporeality or feeling or perception or mental formations or
        consciousness, but only the functioning of individual representatives of
        these groups.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">For example, with one unit of
        consciousness, only one single kind of feeling can be associated. Two
        different units of perception cannot arise at the same moment, and only
        one kind of consciousness, for example seeing consciousness, can arise
        at one time. A smaller or larger number of mental formations can arise
        with every state of consciousness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The groups never arise as a totality;
        only constituents or bits from a certain group can arise depending on
        conditions. There are no integrally functioning groups that can be
        called a self or a mind. Moreover the single constituents of these
        apparent groups are all equally subject to the laws of impermanence,
        suffering, and no-soul.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another way to study the Question of why
        nama is not atta is simply to go back to the definition of khandhas
        given by the Buddha in Samyutta Nikaya XX, 56. Here we will see that the
        four khandhas, which can be classified simply as nama (mind) are in no
        way to be understood as an abiding mind substance or as anything that
        can be called atta. Rather, the khandhas are completely interdependent,
        and the constituents of each group condition the arising of the others.
        There is no self existing, abiding entity in any part of the following
        definition, but only constituents which mutually condition each other
        and arise only when they interact:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;What, 0 monks, is the
        corporeality-group?<br>
        The four primary elements and corporeality depending thereon....</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">What, 0 monks, is the feeling-group?<br>
        There are six classes of feeling: due to visual impression, to sound
        impression, to odour impression, to taste impression, to bodily
        impression, and to mind impression....</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">What, 0 monks, is the perception-group?<br>
        There are six classes of perception: perception of visual objects, of
        sounds, of odours. of tastes, of bodily impressions, and of mental
        impressions....</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">What, 0 monks, is the group of mental
        formations?<br>
        There are six classes of volitional states: with regard to visual
        objects, to sounds, to odours, to tastes, to bodily impressions, and to
        mind objects....</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">What, 0 monks, is the
        consciousness-group?<br>
        There are six classes of consciousness: eye-consciousness,
        ear-consciousness. nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness.
        body-consciousness, and mind-consciousness.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Based on the above definitions, it is
        easy to see that nothing which can be called atta can be found in the
        workings of rupa or nama. Still another way in which the nature of nama
        and rupa is analysed is to be found in the Abhidhamma, which is highly
        recommended for anyone who wants to understand Buddhism thoroughly.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the most comprehensive and
        analytical study of all phenomena given by the Buddha. Here Buddha
        analyses nama and rupa into three groups of absolute realities, which
        are 89 types of consciousness (cittas), 52 mental factors (cetasikas),
        and 28 material properties (rupa). Here too, there is no abiding mind
        substance or atta, but only the interdependent workings of the
        constituents of these groups. <!-- text below generated by server. PLEASE REMOVE -->

        <p><strong><font size="4" color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">6.
        Misunderstanding Anatta</font></strong></b></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We will now discuss some of the attempts
        to place a doctrine of atta into Buddhism. Some scholars have tried to,
        in the words of Dr. Walpola Rahula, &quot;smuggle&quot; the idea of atta
        into the teachings of the Buddha.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let us now see how two scholars, Ananda
        K. Coomaraswamy and I. B.&nbsp; Horner, already discussed briefly have
        mistranslated certain Pali terms to demonstrate that Buddha affirmed the
        existence of atta. They argue that Buddha did indeed claim that the five
        aggregates are not atta, but that He never directly denied the existence
        of atta. The five aggregates are not atta, but there is something apart
        from the five aggregates that we can call atta, self or soul, these
        scholars claim.&quot;' Whenever Coomaraswamy and Horner see the word
        atta, they try to imagine that it means eternal self or soul.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the passages they point to is
        found in Dhammapada (verse I60): &quot;Atta hi attano natho.&quot; They
        translate is as &quot;Self is the lord of self.&quot; They say that it
        means that the big Self is the lord of the little self. Actually, it
        means, &quot;One is one's own lord or refuge,&quot; or, &quot;One is one's
        own support.&quot; The second line of the verse reads, &quot;Ko hi natho
        paro siya,?&quot; or &quot;Who else can be the lord or refuge?&quot; In
        Pali, the word atta can mean self, soul, or eternal self, in the Hindu
        sense, or it can simply be a part of a reflexive pronoun like himself,
        yourself, or myself. Thus when Buddha says &quot;Atta hi attano natho,
        ko hi natho paro siya?&quot; mean &quot;One is one's own lord or refuge;
        who else can be the lord or refuge&quot;, it is clear that atta means
        oneself, not soul.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddha urges people to rely on
        themselves, on their own effort, and not to rely on others in their
        spiritual practice. Another passage which is misinterpreted in the book
        by Coomaraswamy and Horner is from the Mahaparinibbana Sutta':&nbsp;
        &quot;Attadipa viharatha anannasarana.&quot; The meaning is, &quot;Dwell
        having yourself as an island, having yourself as a refuge and not anyone
        else as a refuge.&quot; Here also they interpret atta to mean soul or
        eternal self.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">They claim that Buddha was instructing
        us to make the soul our island or refuge. But in the next line, Buddha
        says, &quot;Dhammadipa viharatha dhammasarana anannasarana,&quot; which
        means, &quot;Dwell having the Dhamma (Buddha's teachings) as an island,
        having the Dhamma as a refuge, nothing else as a refuge.&quot; Buddha is
        instructing his followers to rely on their own effort and on the
        teachings, especially as He was soon to be gone from this earth.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The idea of atta as soul is completely
        foreign to this passage. Moreover Buddha went on to say, &quot;How is
        the monk to dwell making himself an island?&quot; He then went on to
        describe the practice of the four foundations of mindfulness. The Buddha
        really meant that one should make Satipatthana meditation (contemplation
        of the body, feelings, mind, and dhamma objects) one's refuge.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is no mention of soul whatsoever
        Another passage Coomaraswamy and Horner point to is the story in which
        Buddha spoke to some princes. There were thirty princes who were cousins
        of King Pasenadi of Kosala. Twenty-nine of them had wives, but one did
        not.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day, they went to a park to amuse
        themselves, and they hired a woman for the unwed prince. When they were
        drunk and having fun, the hired woman took all of the valuables and ran
        away with them. They looked for her and met the Buddha. They asked
        Buddha if He had seen her and He said,</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;What do you think, young men!
        Which is better for you? To search after the woman or to search after
        yourselves (attanam gaveseyyatha)?&quot; They replied that it would be
        better to search after themselves, and so Buddha told them to sit down
        and listen to a Dhamma talk.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Coomaraswamy and Horner interpret the
        word atta in that passage to mean higher self or soul, and they want it
        to mean that Buddha told the princes to search after atta. But Buddha is
        telling the princes to turn away from chasing after worldly pleasures
        and to practice the self-discipline of the Noble Path. In that Dhamma
        talk, Buddha spoke about giving (dana), moral conduct (sila), the
        celestial world (sagga), the peril, vanity and depravity of 'sense
        pleasures (kamanam adinavam, etc.), and the advantages of renunciation
        (nekkhamme anisamsam). There is no mention whatsoever of searching :.,'
        for a soul, for atta.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another passage mistranslated by
        Coomaraswamy and Horner is one found : in Visuddhimagga: &quot;buddhatta
        ... Buddho.&quot; They translate it as, &quot;Buddha is awakened Self.&quot;
        But the correct translation of the Pali is, &quot;He is the Buddha
        because he knows or he has known.&quot; The word buddhatta is not a
        compound so of buddha and atta, but one word, buddha, with the suffix -
        tta combined with the ablative case termination, a, which means `because
        of'. The word buddhatta therefore means 'because of the state ofbeing
        one who knows'.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It would be better to say that one does
        not believe in the anatra doctrine and that Buddha was wrong about it
        than to try to say that Buddha taught a religion with atta in it. It is
        not accurate to say that Buddha did not deny atta.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact,
        there are many places in the Pali canon where atta is denied by Buddha.
        For example, Buddha once said, &quot;I do not see a soul theory which,
        if accepted, does not lead to the arising of grief, lamentation,
        suffering, distress, and tribulations.&quot; Buddha also said, &quot;Since
        neither self nor anything pertaining to self can truly be found, is not
        the speculative view that the universe is atta wholly and completely
        foolish?&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddha teaches that belief in atta is a
        wrong view (ditthi or miccha-ditthi) which will lead to misery. Wrong
        views must be rejected because they are a source of wrong and evil
        aspirations and conduct.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Majjhima Nikaya, Buddha describes the
        belief in atta as an idea which leads to selfishness and pride: &quot;The
        Perfect One is free from any theory (ditthigata), for the Perfect One
        has seen what corporeality is, and how it arises and passes away. He has
        seen what feeling... perception... mental formations. consciousness
        are, and how they arise and pass away. Therefore I say that the Perfect
        One has won complete deliverance through the extinction, fading away
        disappearance, rejection and casting out of all imaginings and
        conjectures, of all inclinations to the vainglory of 'I' and 'mine'.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the famous Brahmajala Sutta which is
        recommended for those who want to study an explanation of wrong views,
        Buddha describes and classifies all conceivable wrong views and
        speculations about reality. One of those wrong views is the belief that
        there exists an eternal self. Buddha says of this view:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Therein, bhikkhus, when those
        recluses and brahmins who are eternalists proclaim on four grounds the
        self and the world to be eternal - that is only the agitation and
        vacillaation of those who do not know and do not see; that is only the
        agitation and vacillation of those who are immersed in craving.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Coomaraswamy and Horner argue that
        Buddha's denial of atta refers only to the phenomenal self, and that His
        denial is really an affirmation of what they call the Great Self (mah'atta)
        . They argue that Buddha stated that the five aggregates are not atta,
        but that He never categorically stated that there is no atta, or Self.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">They claim that Buddha was only
        directing us not to see the real Self in the personal ego - a view
        identical to the Hindu view. They reason that Buddha's denial of certain
        things being atta indicates that He affirmed a true atta of a different
        nature. When Buddha said, &quot;This is not atta,&quot; these scholars
        insert the following argument: &quot;But a moment's consideration of the
        logic of the words will show that they assume the reality of a Self that
        is not any one or all of the 'things' that are denied of it.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">But let us say, for the sake of
        argument, that I have five animal horns here. If I say &quot;None of
        these horns is the horn of a rabbit,&quot; does it mean that there
        exists somewhere else or in another form such a thing as a horn of a
        rabbit?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">No. A horn of a rabbit is just a
        designation, an abstraction, without any corresponding reality.
        Similarly Buddha often said, &quot;This is not atta. That is not atta.
        Nothing here is atta.&quot; Does that indicate that Buddha means that
        there exists somewhere something that can be called atta? No.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I will conclude this section by
        explaining a very important statement found in Patisambhidamagga and in
        Majjhima Nikaya:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Sabbe sankhara anicca; sabbe
        sankhara dukkha (not in M.N.); sabbe dhamma anatta.&quot; The first
        sentence means, &quot;AII conditioned things are impermanent.&quot; The
        second means, 'All conditioned things are suffering.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third sentence, however is
        different. Here, Buddha does not use the word sarckhara, but He uses
        dhamma instead. Dhamma here means all things without exception. So the
        third sentence means, 'AII things, conditioned or unconditioned, are
        anatta, are void of self and soul.&quot; This means that even Nibbana,
        which is asankhara, unconditioned, is not atta or is void of atta. This
        statement unequivocally denies atta of any kind, even in ultimate Truth
        and Enlightenment, even in Nibbana.</font></p>

        Questions and Answers</font></b><font size="4"><br>
        </font></font></p>
        <p><b><font color="#000099" face="Times New Roman">Q: When you feel
        pain, you think that it is more permanent than thought. It is not
        permanent, but it does seem to be continuous.</font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">- Yes, it seems to be continuous and to
        last for a long time, but actually the pain arises and disappears at
        every moment. Because we cannot see it arising every moment, we think
        that it is one solid thing. But when you practice meditation and keep
        noticing the pain, you will get concentration, and then you will come to
        see that there are gaps in that pain.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The same applies to sound, for example.
        If you note sound in your mind as it occurs, you will get concentration,
        and you will come to experience gaps in that sound: there is not really
        one continuous sound.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">A person once told me about this level
        of concentration, which he achieved while he was meditating. Music was
        playing very loudly the whole night, so he could do nothing except
        concentrate on the sound by noting &quot;hearing, hearing, hearing.&quot;
        He then achieved concentration and experienced the music in small bits;
        in other words, he was able to detect gaps in what seemed to be one
        continuous sound. The elements of the music actually arise and disappear
        every moment; nothing is ever the same for even two tiny milliseconds.</font></p>
        <p><b><font color="#000099" face="Times New Roman">Q: When I look at my
        own mental pain, I see a whole pattern of pain which; I interpret
        according to psychology, which I have studied. I think I have a pretty
        good knowledge of what it is, but is than an obstacle to seeing the
        nature of pain?</font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">- All that is needed to see the nature
        of pain is to dwell with awareness on it, to make mental notes of it,
        and when you get enough concentration, you will penetrate into the
        nature of pain and see that it is impermanent.</font></p>
        <p><b><font color="#000099" face="Times New Roman">Q: Even if I were to
        lose a lot of weight, cut my hair, and develop all new interests, others
        and myself would still know me as myself. Why is that, if there is no
        continuity?</font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">- That continuity is created only in our
        minds. Actually, there is no continuity, but there is the relationship
        of cause and effect. Many people ask: 'If there is no atman to go to
        different worlds, how do Buddhists say that we have past and future
        lives?' The answer is that mental and physical phenomena arise and
        disappear at every moment. They arise, and then disappear, and in their
        place, other new phenomena arise. But the new phenomena that arise are
        not totally different or new because they have arisen due to some cause</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kamma causes the next life, and that
        next life is not totally new and different; neither is it the same or
        identical. The cause causes the effect to arise, and that effect is not
        the result of just any cause, but of a specific cause: a strong
        relationship exists between the cause and the effect.&nbsp; The cause
        can impart some of its similar Qualities to the effect, impart in the
        sense of causing certain qualities to arise.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this way we have the notion of
        continuity but actually everything is newly arisen at every
        moment.&nbsp; There is a Buddhist formula describing rebirth: neither
        that person nor another. This means a person is reborn in a future life,
        but that person is not the identical person who died here; neither is
        that person reborn as a totally new person.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The commentaries, such as Visuddhimagga,
        XVII, give some similies as examples. Suppose someone shouts into a
        cave. When the sound comes back, it is not the original sound, but
        without the original sound, there can be no echo. Or suppose one lights
        a candle from another candle. It cannot be said that the flame has
        transferred itself to another candle. The flame in the second candle is
        not the same as that in the first one, but it came into being with the
        help of the first candle. Similarly, a seal leaves an impression on
        paper. The impression is not the same as the original seal, but neither
        is it unrelated to it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We Buddhists do not accept permanence,
        but we accept a connection as cause and effect. Cause and effect go on
        and on, even in this lifetime, from moment to moment. This gives a
        person the impression of continuity, the impression of being the same
        person continually. Cause and effect go on and on throughout the life
        span until old age and death.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">But death is just a conventional term
        for the disappearance of a certain psychophysical life process. But
        actually we are dying and being reborn at every moment. Thoughts
        likewise die and come into being at every moment, as do physical
        properties. Thus, even when we are living as we do now, we are dying,
        but we do not call it dying. We call it dying only when we come to the
        end of one life. Immediately after the end of this life, there is the
        next life. Immediately after death, there is rebirth; there is no
        interim between death and rebirth.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Think of the midnight hour of the
        previous day only one second after that, we call it a new day the next
        day. Actually time is just going on and on. One moment we call Sunday,
        and the next moment we call Monday.&nbsp; Similarly life and death and
        rebirth go on continually.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><b><font color="#000099" face="Times New Roman">Q: How does rebirth
        cease?</font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It ceases only when a person cuts off
        the root of this process. The roots are lobha (attachment), dosa (anger)
        and moha (ignorance). The Arahants have cut off this process altogether
        so for them, no future rebirth occurs. They have no desire for the
        life-death process to continue. It is like a lamp: when the oil is used
        up, the flame just disappears.&nbsp; Desire is like the oil; when desire
        is cut off there is no new becoming.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000099" face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: But why does not
        an Arahant disappear at the moment of enlightenment?&quot;</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">That is because the present life, by
        which I mean the present body and mind, is the result of past kamma.
        Past kamma gives rise to this present life, and it must run its course.
        The Arahant does not acquire new kamma, but past kamma must have its
        effect.</font></p>

        feeling, monks, were soul, then this feeling would not lead to
        affliction, and one would be able to say, 'Let my feeling be thus. Let
        my feeling not be thus.' But since feeling is not soul, so it leads to
        affliction, and no one can say 'Let my feeling be thus. Let my feeling
        not be thus.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Perception (sanna) is not soul. If
        perception, monks, were soul, then this perception would not lead to
        affliction, and one would be able to say, 'Let my perception be thus.
        Let my perception not be thus.' But since perception is not soul, so it
        leads to affliction, and no one can say, 'Let my perception be thus. Let
        my perception not be thus.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Mental formations (sankharas) are
        not soul. If mental formations, monks, were soul, then these mental
        formations would not lead to affliction, and one would be able to say, 'Let
        my mental formations be thus. Let my mental formations not be thus.' But
        since mental formations are not soul, so they lead to affliction, and no
        one can say, 'Let my mental formations be thus. Let my mental formations
        not be thus.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Consciousness (vinnana) is not
        soul. If consciousness, monks, were soul, then this consciousness would
        not lead to affliction, and one would be able to say 'Let my
        consciousness be thus. Let my consciousness not be thus.' But since
        consciousness is not soul, so it leads to affliction, and no one can say
        'Let my consciousness be thus. Let my consciousness not be thus.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Monks, what do you think? Is form
        permanent or impermanent?&quot;<br>
        &quot;Impermanent, Venerable Sir.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Now what is impermanent, is it

        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So, monks, whatever perception,
        whether past, future, or present: whether gross or subtle; whether in
        oneself or in others; whether inferior or superior; whether far or near;
        must with right understanding of things as they really are, be regarded
        thus:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">'This is not mine. This is not I. This
        is not my soul.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So, monks, whatever mental
        formations, whether past, future, or present; whether gross or subtle;
        whether in oneself or in others; whether inferior or superior; whether
        far or near; must, with right understanding of things as they really
        are. be regarded thus: 'This is not mine. This is not I.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Seeing thus, monks, the learned
        disciple of the Noble Ones becomes weary of form, weary also of
        feelings, weary also of perception, weary also of mental formations, and
        weary also of consciousness. Being weary, he becomes detached; being
        detached, he becomes free; being free, the knowledge arises, 'I am free.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And he knows, 'Rebirth is no more;
        I have finished practising the life of purity; done is what should be
        done; of this there is no more beyond.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is what the Exalted One said.
        Delighted, the group of five monks rejoiced at the Exalted One's words.</font></p>
