        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Keynote address delivered by 
        Agganyani, Secretary General, Deutsche Buddhistische Union at the public 
        meeting held on September 21, 2002 at Savsiripaye, Colombo to 
        commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the founding of the German

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I feel greatly honoured to be here, to be 
      with you on this meaningful day, on the 50th anniversary of the German 
      Dharmaduta Society. Your kind invitation made it possible for me to come 
      to your country to attend this jubilee and to stand in front of you now. 
      So, let me first express my sincere and deep thanks to you for your 
      generous invitation.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What a magnificent jubilee! For me there 
      are several points to remember and appreciate on this very special 
      anniversary.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Great vision</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Exactly 50 years ago, on 21st September 
      1952, an outstanding personality succeeded in realising a great deed. It 
      was Asoka Weeraratna, a merchant by profession, but in his heart and mind 
      a deep, sincere dhammaduta worker. He dedicated his life to the Dhamma and 
      for the spread of the Dhamma in Europe. And lastly he himself renounced 
      the lay life to lead the noble life of a Bhikkhu as Venerable 
      Dhammanisanthi. Sadhu, sadhu, sadhu!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Under the great vision of Asoka 
      Weeraratna, the Lanka Dhammaduta Society later renamed the German 
      Dharmaduta Society - was founded on this 21st September, 50 years ago, as 
      a useful vehicle to spread and transmit the Dhamma to the West, to bring 
      the Buddha's noble message of peace, happiness, liberation, and the way to 
      attain them to Europe.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I am extremely thankful that Asoka 
      Weeraratna chose Germany as the main base of his Dhammaduta work in 
      Europe. Perhaps we Germans had this good fortune because of the deep 
      regard the Buddhists in Sri Lanka had for our famous German Maha Thera 
      Nyanatiloka, who became the first patron of the Society, and the sincere 
      interest of some respected persons and leaders of the initial Buddhist 
      Associations and Societies in Germany, who paved the way for Asoka 
      Weeraratna to send the first Buddhist Mission to Germany.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">History of Buddhism in Germany</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I want to go a little bit further back 
      into the History of Buddhism in Germany. It is about one hundred years ago 
      that Buddhism came to Germany successfully. A fruitful ground was prepared 
      by the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer who had great influence on the 
      first German Buddhists.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Early examples of deeply inspired people 
      were Anton Gueth, the later Ven. Nyanatiloka, Karl Eugen Neumann, the 
      famous Indologist and translator from Austria, Dr. Paul Dahlke, a 
      physician from Berlin, and Georg Grimm. Their influence is still very much 
      alive in present-day Germany. The accurate translations, summaries, 
      Pali-grammer and the Buddhist dictionary of Ven. Nyanatiloka Maha Thera 
      are in use even now - not only in Germany they have become something like 
      an international standard.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Neumann's poetic, artistic and sensitive 
      translations into German are still appreciated and read by many, although 
      his ancient German is sometimes hard to understand for young people. Georg 
      Grimm's school, the &quot;Ancient Buddhist Community&quot; flourished in Bavaria, 
      and his books are still available.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Das Buddhistisches Haus in Berlin - 
      Frohnau</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Paul Dahlke, the medical doctor, 
      influenced mostly rational thinking people like scientists. With his 
      exemplary Buddhist life and his publications and interpretations of the 
      Pali texts he inspired many German people. His greatest achievement 
      undoubtedly is the Buddhist House in Berlin-Frohnau. Founded in 1924 it 
      developed into a sacred place of living Dhamma. It was built in an 
      interesting architectural style, a mixture of an upper-middle-class German 
      Villa of the Twenties and an East-Asian Buddhist temple with meaningful 
      symbols found even in the huge forest-like garden.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Whenever I visited the Buddhist House in 
      Berlin, I was again and again amazed to enter this peaceful place on the 
      wooded hill, in the lively and hectic city of Berlin, through the 
      beautiful carved stone-gate, reminiscent of Sanchi stupa's gateways, to 
      climb up the steep staircase leading from the Samsaric world to something 
      higher, nobler, peaceful, Nibbanic.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">After Dahlke's death in 1928, the house 
      fell into a long sleep under the non-Buddhist heirs of Dahlke. Only in 
      1957, when the German Dharmaduta Society purchased the premises, the 
      living Dhamma re-entered the house, which then was converted into a 
      Vihara. Since that time, without interruption these 45 years now, it has 
      remained a true home for the Sangha. The monks, mainly from your country, 
      living there, have inspired many German people who visited this place.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Students using the big library, school 
      children listening to the introduction of Buddhism, meditators following 
      carefully and silently the instructions. All seekers of an alternative way 
      of life, in search of the truth, of real happiness and inner peace. The 
      Buddhist House has become the central place to visit for 
      Theravada-Buddhism in Germany and Central Europe. Thanks to Sri Lanka, 
      thanks to the German Dharmaduta Society, thanks to all of you!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In July 2001, nine years after my first 
      visit, I came to the Buddhist House again. In the meantime Tissa 
      Weeraratna had taken over the management of the Vihara. He had invited the 
      Executive Board of the German Buddhist Union to the Buddhist House for its 
      meeting. Having met him several times before and having heard about his 
      enthusiastic and energetic work for the Vihara, we could assure ourselves 
      of the successful and ongoing renovation works and his selfless engagement 
      in favour of the Dhamma.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Buddhism as the natural law of the 
      mind, the law of cause and effect</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I often talked to Tissa Weeraratna about 
      the understanding and presentation of the Dhamma. I share his strict 
      opinion that Buddhism must be based on total purity and morality and 
      should be preferably introduced to Western new-comers as the natural law 
      of the mind, the law of cause and effect, scientific and practical, both, 
      but purely Buddhist - that means not mixed with cultural elements, not 
      with too many rituals, not mixed with other religions and beliefs, not 
      with modern Western psychology, esoteric, new-age, or feminism as we can 
      observe everywhere today.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha's Dhamma is the Dhamma - the 
      truth - and cannot be adapted or possessed neither by a modernist kind of 
      spirituality nor by Sri Lanka nor Germany nor any other country in the 
      world. The truth is true for everybody - everywhere - any time. What has 
      to be adapted are the outer forms resulting from our daily life and 
      experience in the present-day world.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Examples should be given for understanding 
      the Dhamma, which itself is already complete and perfect. The main 
      problems of mankind and the obstacles for peace and happiness are the same 
      as they were 2500 years ago in ancient India. There has been no 
      fundamental change. And our minds are working in the same way since the 
      beginning of time.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The need for a full Order of the Sangha 
      in the West</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There is something I have to confess 
      today: For a long time, like most Westerners, I did not realise that for 
      the successful promotion of Theravada Buddhism we need the full Order of 
      the Sangha. Also in Germany we need: Bhikkhus and Bhikkhunis, Upasakas and 
      Upasikas. Monks and nuns represent the life of the Buddha in an authentic 
      way, the noble ideal of renunciation, a life fully and uncompromisingly 
      dedicated to the noble search for the end of suffering, for final 
      liberation and the highest spiritual value: Nibbana.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Striving hard for this aim, they need the 
      support of devoted lay-people. This idea is not very common in Western 
      countries. People still have to learn why and how to support these strict 
      followers of the Buddha. Because there is almost no understanding, respect 
      and support for Buddhist monks and nuns in the West, and in Germany, 
      almost no monks and nuns exist in this part of the world. It is a vicious 
      circle and a great pity! How can we learn about the high value of the 
      monk's or nun's ideal than from our Asian Buddhist friends?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I myself have received my main inspiration 
      in Myanmar (Burma) where hundreds of thousands of monks and nuns live and 
      are well supported. The few Westerners, who ordain and try to lead a 
      proper monk's or nun's life, mostly fail when they return to the West. 
      Why? Because, as I said, there is almost no understanding and support 
      there to maintain the Sangha, as done in traditional Buddhist countries.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Celibacy and renunciation</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Celibacy and renunciation are considered 
      as weakness in the West, because here it seems as if the person has failed 
      in the worldly life. It is the opposite in the East, where spirituality 
      and renunciation have a long tradition. So my sincere thought is, we 
      indeed need the active help of the traditional Theravada Buddhist 
      countries like Sri Lanka and of associations like the German Dharmaduta 
      Society. The only Theravada monasteries in Central-Europe which are 
      running well, are a few Thai monasteries, mainly because of the immense 
      support of the Thai people. Fortunately, they do not support only their 
      own Thai monks but also Western monks.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the Buddhist Vihara in Berlin it is 
      somewhat similar, but also very special. The House and the resident 
      community in the Vihara are dependent to a high degree on Sri Lankan 
      support and your aid. Now, along with Venerable Punnaratana, the abbot and 
      a living example of loving kindness, and other Sri Lankan or Asian monks, 
      there is the German Samanera Santuttho and from time to time other Western 
      monks like Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi, Ven. Dhammadipa, Ven. Ashin Ottama and Ven. 
      Analayo who come and stay there for a while. And you and your countrymen 
      welcome them all. Through this welcome, I feel your great generosity, 
      sincerity and credibility. And I think this an extremely important step 
      and deed.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Honest mutual cooperation required</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If the Asian monks only stay among 
      themselves in the Diaspora, things will never ever change in these western 
      countries. In spite of all the difficulties that exist in the West because 
      of different temperaments, education, cultural backgrounds and habits, I 
      am sure Buddhism can only be transmitted successfully and flourish by 
      honest mutual cooperation. Germans can learn so much from Sri Lankan 
      people, and I am also sure, that the Germans have some different character 
      strengths, which are also worthy of use in the service of the Dhamma.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As a practical example I would like to 
      again mention Ven. Santuttho. As I know him, he is deeply rooted in the 
      Dhamma, which he learned in Sri Lanka and he is deeply thankful for this 
      highest gift of your people. Day after day he works selflessly in the 
      Buddhist House, humble and mainly in the background of the office in order 
      to write, translate, edit Buddhist texts and books, to create and maintain 
      websites, etc. You support him, give him a place to live in, teach him the 
      Dhamma and Vinaya, and he in return serves to transmit the Dhamma to the 
      people in Germany. But mentioning only his name as an example, I am not in 
      any way overlooking or underestimating the contributions of all the 
      others, without whose mental, spiritual, material or physical support, the 
      Buddhist Vihara cannot flourish and may not even survive.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">My deep gratitude and thankfulness to all 
      of them on behalf of the pious Theravada Buddhists of Germany.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">German Buddhist Union</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I am speaking here today not only in my 
      individual capacity but also as the Secretary - General of the Deutsche 
      Buddhistische Union (German Buddhist Union) (DBU).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This year we commemorate the 47th 
      anniversary of the founding of the German Buddhist Union. This by itself 
      is nothing special. But our organisation is something special within 
      Europe. Without arrogance or pride I can say that our Head -Association 
      has set a good example and serves as a model for other European countries. 
      The German Buddhist Union is an umbrella-organisation under which many 
      Buddhist Associations and Societies are affiliated. All Buddhist 
      traditions are unified and work together. As you may imagine, this 
      cooperation is not always easy. Different traditions, schools, canons and 
      fundamental texts, different interpretations, means and methods of various 
      ways which all are said to lead to the same final goal of Nibbana 
      (Nirvana). But this goal and the great vision of the establishment of 
      Buddhism, though through a variety of traditions, in Germany allow us to 
      work together and overcome all difficulties.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But, I have to come to a special, 
      interesting and problematic point. This German Buddhist Union was founded 
      as a cooperation or network of three Theravada Buddhist associations in 
      1955. At that time Theravada Buddhism was the dominant school of Buddhism 
      in Germany. The various Mahayana schools were rather unknown and had not 
      yet been introduced. What a change compared to the present!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the 1960's and 1970's especially the 
      Zen groups boomed, in the 1980s and 1990s Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhism began 
      to boom. And more and more of these new Buddhist groups became interested 
      and began to join our German Buddhist Union.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Theravada Buddhism in Germany</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So today out of 52 Buddhist associations 
      under our umbrella, there remain only seven pure Theravada associations 
      and five open societies or seminar houses with a great leaning towards 
      Theravada. Two more Theravada associations, including the Buddhist House 
      in Berlin, have applied for membership and hopefully will join soon. 
      Counting the number of individual Buddhists - we guess there is altogether 
      a number of about 100.000 German Buddhists. But one sadly sees that 
      Theravada has become still more rare with less than 10% of followers among 
      the total number of Buddhists. For me that is a warning signal. In order 
      to preserve the original teachings of the Buddha and to make them 
      attractive to the Germans we have to do something actively. Now.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Within the German Buddhist Union, in order 
      to work more effectively, we have organised some working-groups or -teams: 
      Three teams have been formed on the lines of the main Buddhist traditions: 
      a group of Japanese traditions, a Tibetan Buddhist group, and a Theravada 
      group. And in the light of some important duties and aims of our Union 
      other working-groups have been formed, such as Engaged Buddhism, Buddhism 
      in Schools, Inter-religious dialogue, and future of the German Buddhist 
      Union.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">And there are teams for preparation of our 
      annual Buddhist Congress. This year our congress will be held in Leipzig 
      at the end of October, the first time in Eastern Germany, where Buddhism 
      is not very well-known, but our strong aim is to present and promote 
      Buddhism there as well.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Buddhism in German Schools</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I wish to stress on the theme &quot;Buddhism in 
      Schools&quot; and would like to convey to you the happy news, that from next 
      year - 2003 - onwards, Buddhism will be introduced as a subject in Berlin 
      primary schools. As Buddhism is not recognised as an official religion in 
      Germany, this development i.e.making available Buddhism as a subject in 
      school curricula, is very significant.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We think that it is very important to have 
      the chance to teach and transmit basic Buddhist values, Buddhist ethics, 
      loving kindness, compassion, patience, unselfishness and a responsible way 
      of life, to the young generation. Especially in this very difficult time 
      of materialism, consumerism, environmental crime, pollution and natural 
      disasters, terrorism and war, Buddhism receives an especially important 
      position among the religions.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Loss of confidence in Christianity</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Many Western people have lost their 
      confidence in Christianity and are searching for an alternative and 
      rational ways of leading a spiritual life. They are also looking for 
      guidance to lead a meaningful, happy life. More and more Western people 
      have become interested in Buddhism, especially in meditation as a way to 
      mental peace and calmness, and they convert to Buddhism after a critical 
      trial period. Well known Buddhists such as the Dalai Lama or Thich Nhat 
      Hanh are sources of inspiration and have become very popular in the West. 
      They are living examples of mindfulness, compassion, tolerance and peace. 
      Even non Buddhists in the West give them high respect. This is a good 
      development in my eyes as it also prepares a fruitful soil for Theravada 
      Buddhism, which in my opinion enshrines these qualities in greatest purity 
      and perfect clarity.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Theravada Working - Group</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I have to come back to the German Buddhist 
      Union and its working-groups. In our Theravada working-group we try to 
      build a network of Theravada groups and individuals and we often discuss 
      how to promote Theravada Buddhism. We are on the way to establishing an 
      informative Theravada Website on the Internet, that will also present the 
      main Theravada events and highlights. A Theravada newsletter is being 
      distributed by e-mail to all interested people.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We are printing German Dhamma-books for 
      free distribution, and costs of printing are met through donations. The 
      next two books have been printed with the kind help of the Buddhist 
      Publication Society (BPS) in Sri Lanka and copies of these new books are 
      expected to be sent to Germany in a few days. These two books are: the 
      new, expanded edition of the Pali-grammer by Ven. Nyanatiloka, and &quot;The 
      Seven Contemplations of Insight&quot; by the late Ven. Matara Nyanarama Maha 
      Nayake Thera (the former Meditation Master at the Mitirigala Forest 
      Hermitage).</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Dhamma study tour of Myanmar</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Within the Theravada-working-group I have 
      organised a Dhamma-study-tour of Myanmar (Burma) where a free study-course 
      of Satipatthana Sutta, fundamental Abhidhamma and Vipassana meditation is 
      offered at &quot;Sotag International Buddhist Academy&quot; in Sagaing. We are 
      continuously seeking close contact and cooperation with the traditional 
      Buddhist countries and masters. We are convinced that only a close 
      relationship and willingness to learn more from them, will uplift 
      Theravada Buddhism in Germany to say nothing about any personal success in 
      attaining one of the Noble Aryan stages on the way to Arahatship.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We have appointed four internationally 
      famous monks active in Germany namely the Venerables Sayadaw U Nyanissara, 
      Bhikkhu Bodhi, Ashin Ottama, and Dhammadipa as members of the advisory 
      board of our working-group.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Networking</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Networking has already begun, especially 
      within and between Germany, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Myanmar and Sri 
      Lanka to some extent. We hope that this cooperation will include other 
      European and Asian countries soon, will intensify and bring out noble 
      results in future, the fruit of the Dhamma: Nibbana, the highest bliss - 
      available and attainable for everyone, who is yearning and striving for 
      it.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The German Buddhist Union and especially 
      our Theravada-working-group is keenly following the celebration of today's 
      anniversary of your German Dharmaduta Society.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We German Buddhists will never forget what 
      you have done for us. We all appreciate your contribution to the spread of 
      Buddhism in Germany, and to the Berlin Buddhist Vihara, and we thank you 
      out of the deepest gratitude of our hearts.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><I>May all of you attain Nibbana soon as a 
      reward for your generosity and promotion of Theravada Buddhism in Germany.<BR>
      Let Sri Lankans and Germans follow the path of the Buddha together,
