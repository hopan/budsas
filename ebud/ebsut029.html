    <hr width="30%">
    <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Once the Bhagava (
    Lord Buddha) was staying at the Jetavana monastery in the
    pleasance of Anathapindika at Savatthi. A group of monks
    received permission from the Lord to meditate in a distant
    forest during the period of Buddhist Lent. Each of the monks
    took shelter under a big tree as a temporary residence and an
    engaged themselves intensively in the practice of meditation.
    </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">On account of the
    spiritual power of their meditation, the tree deities could
    not stay in their trees-abodes above the monks, so they had
    to come down to the ground. Realizing that the monks would
    spend the whole rainy season there, the deities were much
    annoyed. So they tried to scare the monks away during the
    night by harassing them in various ways.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">After living under
    such impossible conditions for sometime, the monks could not
    bear it any longer and rushed back to the Buddha and informed
    him about their difficulties. So the Buddha advised them to
    recite the text of loving kindness (Metta Sutta) and to
    radiate the spirit of love to all beings. On the full-moon
    day of Wagaung, the Buddha taught the monks the Metta Sutta.
    From that day till now, the full-moon day of Wagaung has been
    called as the 'Great or Grand Occasion of Metta.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Encouraged by this
    discourse, the monks returned to their respective places.
    They practised in accordance with the instructions given them
    to permeate the entire atmosphere with radiant thoughts of
    love, The tree-deities were much pleased to be affected by
    the power of love, and so let the monks (meditators) stay
    without any further disturbances.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Metta</strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Metta is the highest
    need of the world today, indeed it is more needed than ever
    before. Because in this new world, there are sufficient
    materials, money and brilliant wise men and scientists. In
    spite of these, there is no peace and happiness. It shows
    that something is lacking, That is Metta.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">What is the Buddhist
    idea of Metta? The Pali word &quot;Metta&quot; means
    &quot;loving kindness&quot;, not the ordinary, sensual,
    emotional, sentimental kind of love. Metta has been
    translated by modem translators into English as generous,
    mindness loving, loving kindness, sending out thoughts of
    love towards others&quot; but according to the words of
    Buddha, Metta has a far wider significance, and a much more
    extensive implication than this. It means a great deal more
    than loving kindness harmlessness, sympathy. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">What is love? Love is
    also defined in the Oxford Dictionary. According to it, love
    means warm affection, attachment, affectionate devotion, etc.
    These are synonymous terms for love and they all refer to
    sentimental worldly love. So, Metta has no full English
    equivalent. For this Metta is much more than ordinary
    affection or warm feelings. The Pali word Metta literally
    means &quot;friendliness&quot;, but also means love without a
    desire to possess but with desire to help, to sacrifice
    self-interest for the welfare and well being of humanity.
    Metta is with out any selection or exclusion. If you select a
    few good friends and exclude a bad person, then you have not
    got a perfect grasp of Metta. Indeed Metta is not only
    benevolent thought, but also performing charitable deeds, an
    active ministry for the good of one and all.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In the &quot;Metta
    Sutta&quot; the Buddha has chosen the love of a mother for
    her child as an example. Imagine a mother's love when her
    child is hungry; she watches carefully to feed her child even
    be fore it asks her for food. When the child is in danger,
    she will risk her own life. So the Buddha taught us to love
    all beings as a mother loves her only child. If we can do
    this even to a small extent, the world will become happier
    and more peaceful place. In the Dighanikaya, it is said by
    the Buddha that almost every virtue such as unselfishness,
    loving sympathy and loving kindness is included in this
    &quot;Metta&quot;.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Though we talked much
    about Metta and repeat the formula &quot;Sabbe satta avera
    hontu, abyapajjha hontu etc;. &quot;( May all sentient beings
    be free from danger; may they be free from oppression etc.),
    without Metta how can it be effective? This passage is not to
    be merely recited. The Buddha does not ask us to learn any of
    his teachings for recitation only. So the recitation of the
    &quot;Metta Sutta&quot; is good, but the Buddha did not mean
    it to be merely recited. He exhorted us to follow and
    practise the instructions in it so that we might realize
    Metta as the best state of heart in the world.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore do not be
    satisfied with the mere recitation of the &quot;Metta
    Sutta&quot; but strive to know its meaning with a view to
    practising it and to make it suffuse your being. That is the
    most essential fact. Meditation does not mean merely to think
    about it, but to practise it in your daily life.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Discourse
    of loving kindness</strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse of
    loving kindness serves as a mark of protection and as a
    subject of meditation. In the first part of the discourse are
    found virtues that should be practised by anyone who desires
    his own welfare, and in the latter part the method of
    practising Metta or good will is explained in de tail. The
    Buddha taught us to follow and practise the following
    principles:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>He who is
        skilled in doing welfare, who wishes to attain the state
        of calm, (Perfect tranquility) must work to be efficient,
        upright, perfectly upright, easy to speak to, gentle and
        humble.</em></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Contended,
        easily supportable, having few duties, simple in
        livelihood, controlled in sense prudent, modest and not
        greedily attached to families, he must not commit even
        the slightest sin for which other wise men might censure
        him. </em></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>He must
        contemplate so: May all beings be happy, may all beings
        be secure, may all beings be happy. He must radiate the
        measureless thoughts of loving kindness to whatever
        living beings there may be; feeble or strong, tall,
        medium or short, small, medium or large, thin, medium or
        stout, seen or unseen, those dwelling far or near, those
        who are born and those who are to be born- may all
        beings, without exception, be happy.</em></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Let none be
        angry with another, let him not despise anyone in any
        place. By means of physical and verbal provocation or by
        frustrated enmity, in anger or ill-will let him not wish
        another's suffering. </em></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Just as a
        mother would protect at the risk of her own life the life
        of her only son, even so let him spread boundless loving
        kindness to every corner of the world; above, below and
        across, unhindered without any obstruction, without any
        hatred, without any enmity.</em></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>While
        standing, walking, sitting or lying down, as long as he
        awake, without sloth (laziness) he should devote himself
        to this mindfulness of love. This, they say, is the
        &quot;Highest Conduct&quot; and this is called the
        &quot;Noble living&quot; (Holy life).</em></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>If the
        meditator, not falling into wrong-view (egoism), be
        virtuous and endowed with perfect insight, and expel his
        passion for sensual pleasure, then, of a truth, he will
        never be conceived in any womb again.</em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In the Dhammapada the
    Buddha said, &quot;A beautiful word or thought which is not
    accompanied by corresponding acts is like a bright flower
    which bears no fruit. It would not produce any effect.&quot;
    So, it is action, not speculation, it is practice, not theory
    that matters. According to the Dhammapada, &quot;will&quot;
    if it is not followed by corresponding action does not count.
    Therefore, practice of the &quot;Noble Principles of the
    Metta Sutta&quot; is the essence of Buddhism.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In this connexion this
    &quot;Metta&quot; or Universal Love (Loving kindness) is
    generally taken to exist in connexion with other people, but
    in reality love for self comes first. It is not a selfish
    love, but love for self, pure love that comes first. By
    having pure love or &quot;Metta&quot; as we defined it for
    self; selfish tendencies, hatred, anger, will be diminished.
    Therefore, unless we ourselves possess &quot;Metta&quot;
    within, we can not share, radiate, send &quot;Metta&quot; to
    others. So meditation on love &quot;Metta&quot; is to be
    started within ourselves. According to Buddhism self-love
    comes first. By helping ourselves, we can help others
    effectively. The Buddha pointed out, &quot;If a person cannot
    help himself well, he cannot help others well&quot;.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In the Dhammapada it
    says, &quot;One should first establish oneself in what is
    proper then only he should advise another; such a wise-man
    will not be reproached!&quot;. If one cannot find happiness
    in himself, he cannot find happiness anywhere else. It is
    also said that people who cannot control themselves cannot
    find happiness. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">According to the
    Buddhist method, training oneself comes first. Individual
    perfection must be first, so that the organic whole may be
    perfect. The state of the outer world is a reflection of our
    innerselves. The world is like a great mirror, and if you
    look at the mirror with a smiling face, you will see your own
    beautiful smiling face. If you look at it with a shrinking
    face, you will see your own ugly face. It means that
    &quot;Every action must have equal and opposite
    reaction.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">So if you treat the
    world properly, kindly, the world will treat you kindly. We
    should not expect other persons to treat us kindly first, we
    should start by ourselves treating them kindly,</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">This is the essence of
    Buddhist &quot;Metta&quot; Loving Kindness.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>&quot;May
    all beings be happy, may all beings be secure, may all beings
    be happy minded and may their hearts be wholesome.&quot; </strong></em></font></p>
