  Death</b></font></a></p>
  <p><a name="The First Council"><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><b>The First
  Council</b></font></a></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">With respect to the Buddha&#146;s instruction
  to the bhikkhus (Buddhist monks) before his passing away informing them that his doctrine,
  that is to say - the Norm and the Law, shall be their teacher when he is gone, it is well
  to have at least a bird&#146;s eye view of the history of the Dhamma or his Doctrine from
  the time of the Dhamma (the Buddha&#146;s teaching) or his Doctrine from the time of his
  Parinibbana (death) up to the present time. This may give a better understanding and a
  firm foundation for reasonable belief of those intellectuals who wish to know something of
  the historical facts in addition to the Message itself.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">It is general believed that during the
  Master&#146;s life-time there was no systematic classification of the Doctrine as is known
  in the present. Like a variety of scattered flowers blooming here and there in the garden,
  the teaching of the Master must have been maintained orally and individually, that is to
  say, according to the tendency of individual disciples. These instructions and admonitions
  given by the Master were systematically arranged, like the arranging of flowers in the
  vase, by wise and holy disciples after the Master&#146;s passing away.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">We learn from historical facts that shortly
  after the Buddha&#146;s death here was what could be called a bad omen for those
  well-wishers of Buddhism. The tears of his mourners had not yet dried away when among one
  of his devoted Elder Kassapa&#146;s followers there was an old bhikkhu called Subaddha who
  suddenly surprised, or rather shocked, his mourners by the bold declaration that since the
  Master had passed away it was better that there would be from then on forbid them to d
  this and to do that any more.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">This, to the Venerable Kassapa, foreshadowed
  the deterioration of the Buddha&#146;s doctrine if left unchecked. So he expressed his
  concern to the other devoted Elders who were Arahats or Saints. The latter were unanimous
  in their support of his plan that there should be held a Council of Elders or Arahats for
  the sake of reciting the Massage of the Master so that it could be memorised and handed
  down in its pristine purity to the younger generations.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">With such an agreement, the place and the
  persons who were to participate in this great undertaking had been proposed and carefully
  selected. The cave of Sattapanna of Vebhara mountain in the town of Rajagaha was at last
  chosen and the participants, according to the general agreement, were to be the
  Buddha&#146;s contemporary Arahats or Saints. This was the first &#147;SANGAYANA&#148; or
  Buddhist Council, which lasted seven months during which the patricide King Ajatasattu had
  been the prime supporter and host and had given the financial help for carrying out this
  great task.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">This &#147;SANGAYANA&#148; or Council
  attended by 500 Arahats contemporaries of the Buddha was undertaken for the purpose of
  settling the contents of the Buddhist Canon by revising, classifying and standardizing the
  various teachings of the Buddha during the 45 years of his preaching. Obviously it is a
  great enterprise as well as huge undertaking. It is not an over-estimate, therefore, to
  say that much, or rather most of the success was derived from the Venerable Ananda who was
  the Master&#146;s personal attendant bhikkhu (Buddhist monk) and who had heard and
  committed to memory almost all Sutta and Abhidhamma, second and third of three Baskets
  (TIPITAKA) of the Buddhist Canon. The first, however, was accomplished through the memory
  of the Venerable UPALI who had always been the distinguished bhikkhu for his VINAYA -- the
  first of the three Baskets (TIPITAKA) concerning the monastic Law. After the process of
  questioning and answering in details, all other attending Arahats or Saints including the
  Venerable Kassapa who presided over the Council, recited those passages again and again
  until they were word-perfect. How great and difficult this task was may be seen from the
  fact that the Council lasted seven months before the whole of the teachings was
  satisfactorily revised.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Now that the meeting was closed the
  participating Arahats then went forth on their missionary work, preaching to their own
  followers the Dhamma or Message that had been studied from the Council. Thus it is a fact
  that we cannot portray the depth of our gratitude for the pioneer Venerable Kassapa and
  Ananda and Upali, without whom we can never imagine how lost in ignorance we should be who
  are born long after the Master&#146;s Parinibbana (Absolute Extinction).</font></p>

  <p><a name="The Second Council"><b><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman">The Second
  Council</font></b></a></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">One hundred years after the first Council
  presided over by the Venerable Kassapa there arose a sad incident in the town of Vesali. A
  large group of bhikkhus called Vajjiputta was formed up and caused a great sensation all
  over the Buddhist circles by their heretical beliefs. These were numbered ten and included
  the drinking of the juice extracted from palmyra date or cocoa palm and the receiving or
  hoarding of money. These and many others being prohibited in the Vinaya (Monastic Law)
  were then proclaimed by the group of VAJIPUTTA bhikkhus to have been allowed. This caused
  a great discordance as well as a great sensation among the Buddhists, laity as well
  bhikkhus. The situation threatened to become worse and worse as time went on and the chief
  bhikkhu of the orthodox members, YASA KAKANDAKAPUTTA by name, was, according to history,
  even bribed by the heretics. But being no less holy than wise, he drove away the
  heretics&#146; messenger and with his clever instruction and explanation was later on
  successful in gathering a large number of followers, both bhikkhus and the laities,
  against the Vaiputta bhikkhus, who had then been successful in winning over King Kalasoka
  of Magadha country to their side. Under their instigation the befooled king set out
  oppressing the bhikkhus under the leadership of Venerable YASA by various means. But no
  sooner had the sovereign order been carried out than the King&#146;s sister who was a
  bhikkhuni (Buddhist female monk), Nanda by name, intervened and finally convinced her
  brother of his mistake. Seeing now what was right and what was wrong in the Buddha&#146;s
  doctrine, the king then revoked his former orders, begged forgiveness of his holy sister,
  and gave his support to the Venerable Yasa&#146;s group of bhikkhus and laities. Now it
  was time for the Venerable Yasa to hold a general meeting of all the devoted bhikkhus and
  to have in the presence of the meeting a formal discussion as to how it was wrong in the
  Vajjiputta bhikkhu&#146;s ten heretical beliefs. After the process of thorough
  questioning, answering, reasoning and debating, the meeting come to its final resolution
  that the heretical claims were all wrong. In addition to this all the three Baskets of the
  Buddhist Canon were also brought under a copious discussion and careful consideration in
  such a manner as had been done in the assembly of the first Council one hundred years ago.
  How great the task was can be seen in that it lasted eight months, that is to say, one
  month longer than the first Council.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The place of this second Council was in the
  town of Vesali. The Arahats or Saints participating were about seven hundred in number.</font></p>
  <p align="right"><a href="#top"><strong><font face="Times New Roman">[^]</font></strong></a></p>
  <b><p><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><a name="The Third Council">The Third
  Council</a></font></b></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">So far as the second Council is concerned the
  Venerable Yasa and King Kalasoka may be successful in maintaining the Message of the
  Buddha in its pristine purity, but the heretic Vajjiputta bhikkhus were in no way
  defeated. Nor were they discouraged in propagating those heretical beliefs to their
  followers as a counter-attack for the Venerable Yasa. Their competition proved to be no
  less successful for there grew more and more discordance among the Buddhists both bhikkhus
  and laities. Since there are always those who prefer what is convenient to them and others
  who respect what is good and right more than what is what is only convenient, the quarrels
  between the two groups became more and more bitter. So much so that the bhikkhus of one
  group refused to perform religious rites and ceremonies with those of the other group.
  This was equivalent to saying that the bhikkhus of other group were no more bhikkhus in
  the ecclesiastical sense and were consequently as good as a layman. Thus Buddhism was at
  this time i.e. 218 years after the Buddha&#146;s death rent by discord in two hostile
  schools viz. the Theravada and the Acariyavada. The former represents those who still
  respect the words of the Thera or Elders such as the Venerable Yasa of the second Council,
  whereas the latter represents those who still cling to the teachings of the Vajjiputta
  bhikkhus. We also learn more of this unhappy incident from some historians who say that
  each of the two schools were even subdivided into several different and antagonistic
  sects, numbering altogether eighteen. This shows that the situation of Buddhism was at
  that time almost hopeless for any well-wisher to make better. The need was strongly felt
  for a &#147;strong&#148; man in this critical moment of Buddhism.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In a Buddhist text called
  &#147;Mahavangsa&#148;, however, it was told that the heretics being deprived of the usual
  offerings and honour by the King&#146;s devotion to Buddhism, had masqueraded themselves
  as Buddhist bhikkhus and then taken that opportunity to preach and practise their former
  doctrines. Of course there was no surer way of destroying a doctrine than by doing so, and
  in course of time when this infidel movement was known to the righteous group of bhikkhus
  it invariably gave birth to a bitter contempt on the part of the pious Buddhists who were
  not so befooled. This being known to King Asoka, a general meeting of bhikkhus was
  formally held in which there was a close scrutiny of the behaviour and ideal of an
  individual bhikkhu. This Council held under the auspices of the great and pious King Asoka
  was presided over by the Holy Thera Tissa Moggalliputta who was well versed in the
  Master&#146;s doctrine. Any bhikkhu who was found out as holding heretical beliefs and
  practising infidel methods were disrobed until it was reasonably believed that there was
  left no more of such defilement of the doctrine.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">After this monastic purgation the holy Tissa
  was then invited to call a meeting once again of the righteous and well versed bhikkhus
  for the sake of reviewing and re-standardizing as in the previous Councils the
  Master&#146;s doctrine so that it could be correctly handed down in all its simplicity and
  nobility. For this purpose the Arama (or monastery) of Asoka in the town of Pataliputta
  was presented to the holy ones as the choice place. About one thousand bhikkhus were
  called in to participate in this Council which lasted nine months, during which King
  Asoka, like the previous kings of the first and second Councils, had all the time given
  his best help. This even took place in the two hundred and eighteenth year after the
  Buddha&#146;s death.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">It has been rightly said that those who
  undertook to carry on the third council must have been more or less encouraged by the work
  of the previous Councils and its success was therefore undoubtedly inspired by the
  previous achievement of their devoted predecessors. But a unique aspect of success of the
  third Council which seems to surpass the previous two is that its missionary work was
  carried on in a far wider scale. King Asoka being an ardent missionary himself, it would
  not extol him to say that through his initiative character, groups of self-sacrificing
  bhikkhus were after the Council sent forth to various lands carrying the torch of
  India&#146;s greatest son to illumine the four corners of the earth. Of these groups one
  sent to Ceylon was conducted by the great king&#146;s son and daughter who had been
  ordained as a bhikkhu and a bhikkhuni (Buddhist female monk) respectively. Others were
  sent abroad and overseas to various remote countries. The one that reached Thailand was
  known to be conducted by the Venerable Sona and Uttara.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">From the historians&#146; view-point these
  three Councils convened in India were accepted as perfectly and rightly carried out. From
  now on there had been several Councils held in various lands at different times but all
  these are local and sectarian Councils and not universally accepted as the perfect ones.</font></p>
  <p align="right"><a href="#top"><strong><font face="Times New Roman">[^]</font></strong></a></p>
  <b><p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800080">2) <a
  name="Buddhism in Indo-China Peninsula">Buddhism in Indo-China Peninsula</a></font></b></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">As has been already pointed out, a group of
  missionary bhikkhus was sent by King Asoka to remote countries of the Indo-China
  peninsula. This was conducted by Venerable Sona and Uttara. In the course of their journey
  by land from India they must have passed Burma first before going on to other
  south-eastern countries. In Thailand the antiquities at the town of Nakhon Pathom, 50
  kilometres west of Bangkok, seems to give practical evidence as to where Buddhism was
  first settled down. These include stone inscriptions, Buddha Images, the Buddha&#146;s
  Foot-prints and the great Pagoda itself which, stripped of its later-constructed top,
  would be of the same design as the &#147;Stupas&#148; of that Great King Asoka at the town
  of Sanchi in India.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">It was at first doubtful how the missionary
  bhikkhus managed to make themselves understood by the people of the place where they
  landed or reached. But in the case of the two holy ones who arrived Thailand at that time,
  it was rather fortunate for them that there had been Indian traders and refugees living
  all along the Malay and Indo-China Peninsulas. Some of these Indian tribes were known to
  have fled from Asoka&#146;s invasion before he was converted to Buddhism by the horrors of
  war. Thus it was not without reason to say that the first preaching of the Message would
  be at first among the Indian themselves and then through these Indians interpreters to the
  people of the country who were supposed to be at that time a racial stock of people known
  as the Mons or Lawas.</font></p>
  <p align="right"><a href="#top"><strong><font face="Times New Roman">[^]</font></strong></a></p>
  <b><p><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><a name="Fu-Nan Period">Fu-Nan Period</a></font></b></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">We have learnt how Buddhism prospered in the
  Indo-China Peninsula which to some extent may be rightly called &#147;Suvannaphumi&#148;
  (lit. the Golden Land). The inhabitants of this region at that time, however, were
  supposed to be the Mons or Cambodia or &#147;Lawa&#148;, whose superiors or rulers were
  either the Indians themselves or of Indian blood or lineage by marriage. From this fact it
  was certain that Indian culture and civilization were prevailing all over the land. Thus
  to the exclusion of the north-east which is now the northern part of Vietnam, Theravada
  Buddhism had spread all over the Indo-China Peninsula and when in course of time the
  Burmese and the Thais evacuated from Tibet and Yunnan, they were also impressed and later
  on adopted it as their religion.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">With the rise of Mahayana school in India in
  the sixth Buddhist century, missionaries were sent abroad both by sea and by land.
  Travelling by land they made their journey through Bengal and Burma, while in their voyage
  they first landed at the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra where they made the second part of
  their voyage to Cambodia. Also during this time there arose a &#147;Fu-Nan&#148; or Phanom
  Kingdom covering the land of Cambodia, and also the north-eastern and the central part of
  the Thailand. The people of this Fu-Nan Kingdom were known to profess the two schools of
  Buddhism were known to profess the two schools of Buddhism viz. the Theravada and
  Mahayana. So much so that in the tenth Buddhist century some Fu-Nan bhikkhus were recorded
  to have gone forth to China for the purpose of studying and translating the Buddhist texts
  there. Of these courageous bhikkhus, the well-known were Sanghapala and Mandarasena.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">But the Fu-Nan Kingdom was, in the eleventh
  Buddhist century, on the decline and then overrun and defeated by one of here own
  colonies, the Jen-la kingdom. This also brought about a stop, if not a deterioration, in
  the progress of Buddhism of this land.</font></p>

  <b><p><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><a name="Tvaravadi Period">Tvaravadi
  Period</a></font></b></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">During the eleventh Buddhist century when
  Buddhism was more or less affected by the decline of the Fu-Nan kingdom, the Mons who
  lived in the territory of Chao Phraya River took it an opportunity to declare themselves
  independent and build up the &#147;Tvaravadi&#148; kingdom. Due to its being once a seat
  of culture and civilization, the new kingdom made a rapid progress in its arts and
  religion. It was also unique in maintaining and strictly observing the doctrine of
  Theravada Buddhism from one of Asoka&#146;s missionary group. Since it had a close contact
  with the Indians of the Ganges, Buddhist art of this period was very much like that of
  Kupta dynasty of India. The capital, or centre of the &#147;Tvaravadi&#148; kingdom must
  have been in the present town of &#147;Nakhon Pathom&#148;. But in the following the
  twelfth Buddhist century the kingdom extended upwards firstly to the town of Lopburi and
  then to the northern provinces of Thailand. One evidence of this fact was that Queen
  Camadevee, who was a Mon of Tvaravadi period, became the ruler of the town of Hariphunjai
  or the present town of Lamphun (some 700 kilometres north of Bangkok) and had invited 500
  bhikkhus, all well versed in the Canon, to preach their doctrine for her people. This was
  one reason that Theravada Buddhism of Tvaravadi had gained ground in the northern
  Provinces of Thailand at present (It was also at that time in the possession of the Thais
  evacuating from Yunnan). The Mons domination over the northern region lasted many
  centuries and inscriptions in ancient Mons character can be found from the town of Nakhon
  Pathom up to Lopburi and Lamphun.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In the fourteenth Buddhist century the Jen-La
  kingdom was replaced by the ancient Khmer (Cambodian) kingdom, which also pushed forward
  its territory to some parts of Tvaravadi kingdom, to the exclusion of the latter&#146;s
  north and north-eastern provinces.</font></p>

  Period</a></font></b></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">During the time Tvaravadi kingdom was still
  flourishing there were in the south of Thailand several states, some of which, as
  mentioned in the Chinese record, were Siah-Tho (Red Earth) and Phan Phan. The former was
  situated somewhere near the state of Saiburi in the Federated Malay States (also some
  archaeologists confirm that this state was somewhere near the town of Madrid in Burma).
  Its people professed Buddhism. The latter was what is at present the town of Surat Thani
  in Thailand (some 650 kilometres South of Bangkok). Its people were said to accept
  Theravada Buddhism as their faith. These states used to have close communications with the
  Tvaravadi. In the twelfth Buddhist century there arose in Sumatra a Srivijjai kingdom,
  whose dominating power and territory extending to the Malay Peninsula was bordered by that
  of the Tvaravadi kingdom. In these states during this time, however, the Savakayana
  Buddhism, according to the Chinese missionary E-Ching&#146;s record, was still
  flourishing, since their rulers and people firmly adhered to the rules and the practices
  of the doctrine. But when the Pala dynasty of Magadha-Bengal began to rise to power,
  Mahayana Buddhism, especially the Mantrayana sect, was energetically patronized, and since
  the country also came into contact with the equally mighty kingdom of Srivijai, now lord
  of the Southern Seas and the Malay Peninsula, the Mahayana sect had been accepted by the
  Srivijai kingdom as their faith for the following five Buddhist centuries. Evidences of
  these may be found in that in the town of Nakhon Si Thammarat, which was then known by the
  name of Tam-Pnon-Link, there is a rock inscription in Sanskrit characters, dated as far
  back as B.E. 1318 (775 AD), mentioning the suzerainty of a Srivijai King. Also in the
  fifteenth Buddhist century, there was mentioned a great religious teacher of Tibet, called
  Dipankara Atisa who had had his resident for 120 years at the Dhamma-Kirti in Sumatra.
  Next to these will be seen in the Vihara of Borobudur in Java, of which there is now no
  further question as to the greatness of its constructor. Especially in Thailand several
  places of worship such as the pagoda or Chedi enshrining the Buddha relics at that town of
  Chaiya and the innermost Chedi within the Ceylonese style Chedi at the town of Nakhon Si
  Thammarat are, among many others, undeniable evidences of Srivijai influence accompanies
  with Mahayana Buddhism of those days. These evidences along with several others, tell us
  that there were tow periods when the Srivijai influence was spread overseas to the land of
  Kam-Bhoo-Ja (Cambodia) and to her colonies in the thirteenth Buddhist century, whereas the
  second one was in the middle of the fifteenth century. King Suriya Varaman the first of
  Cambodia was also of Srivijai lineage and such was the reason why Mahayana culture was
  once flourishing in the countries of Thailand and Cambodia from the thirteenth Buddhist
  century.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The fifteenth to the eighteenth Buddhist
  century, when the Cambodian influence was predominant in Thailand, was called Lop Buri
  period. Some of these Cambodian kings, however, were Buddhist while others were
  Brahmanists. As for Buddhism then prevailing, they were mentioned both Theravada and
  Mahayana: the former not so ardently supported as the latter, since most kings were
  inspired by the Mahayana Buddhism, which had struck firm roots in this soil since the
  Fu-Nan period. Though it was for some time, during the Tvaravadi period, on the decline,
  it was subsequent to the decline of the Tvaravadi kingdom that the Mantrayana sect of
  Mahayana School was adopted from Srivijai and quickly became the dominating power in
  Cambodia and in some parts of Thailand such in the central plains and the north-eastern
  tableland. The well-known rock temple at that town of Phimai (on the north-eastern
  tableland) bears evidence of the dominating power of this Mahayana sect. This was supposed
  to be built in the sixteenth Buddhist century while the triple &#147;Prang&#148; (a kind
  of pagoda) at Lopburi was also known to be dedicated to Mahayana Buddhism. Besides, a
  countless number of Buddha amulets will be found in several towns of Thailand such as in
  the town of Nakhon Sithammarat (some 800 kilometres south of Bangkok), Lopburi, Suphanburi
  and Sawankalok (some 500 kilometres north of Bangkok). These were all made according to
  the belief of the Mantrayana Buddhism which was later on the breeding ground of a sort of
  &#147;black&#148; magic that was added to the &#147;corpus&#148; of Buddhism in the
  neighbouring countries as well as in Thailand.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism as a movement in Thailand had always
  undergone various developments and obstacles side by side with the situation of the
  country that patronized it. Generally speaking, when the country is peaceful and safe from
  outward enemies, the Buddha light is aglow and the study and practice of Buddhism is
  always encouraged by the public as well as by the king or rulers. But when the country is
  on the decline, although the spirit of Buddhism - the Buddha light within - may still be
  singing in the hearts of the people, Buddhism as a movement is inevitably more or less
  affected. The teaching of history of Buddhism in Thailand is therefore not possible
  without referring to the periods when each dynasty ruled over the country and when the
  capital was moved generally southward for the sake of safety and convenience.</font></p>

  Buddhist century and in the following century Buddhism was believed to reach China.
  Meanwhile one of the Thai Kings of the &#147;Ai-Lao&#148;, called Khun Luang Mao, (there
  were at that time several independent tribes of the Thais) was known to have formally
  declared himself as a Buddhist. This was the first Thai ruler who made himself known as
  upholder of Buddhism, which was presumably a Sankayana rather than a Mahayana. But whether
  it was really the Theravada school or not is still an unsettled question (the Sankayana
  was, from its history in Pali and Sanskrit texts, sub-divided into 18 smaller groups).</font></p>

  century the Thais, in constant conflict with the Chinese, chose to migrate southwards to
  the Indo-China Peninsula. Then there arose a Thai King whose name was Pi-lok, who founded
  the Nan-Chao Kingdom which lasted five centuries with its capital at the town of
  Ta-Li-Foo. It was during this time when Mahayana Buddhism, upheld by the &#147;Tang&#148;
  dynasty of China, was believed to flourish also in Thailand. One of the tributes paid to a
  king of the &#147;Sung&#148; dynasty was known to be a text of
  &#147;Prajna-Paramita-Sutta&#148;, which of course was especially one of Mahayana Suttas.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">But in the following century (the eighteenth
  Buddhist century) Nan-Chao Kingdom was overrun by Kublai Khan&#146;s army. This was the

  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Chiang-San or Yo-nok, the sixteenth
  &#150; twenty-first Buddhist century, was founded in the sixteenth Buddhist century by the
  Thais migrating from their &#147;Ai-Lao&#148; Kingdom. They seemed, however, to have at
  this time a more cosmopolitan outlook in their religious beliefs, for while some were
  known to be still ardent supporters of Buddhism of their former Kingdom (Ai-Lao), others
  adhered strongly to the Theravada of the Mons, others Mahayana of Cambodia and still
  others Mahayana of the Nan-Chao Kingdom. But in course of time, some parts of the Kingdom
  were under the suzerainty of the Burmese, who had been used to adopting and re-adopting
  various faiths that reached their land. They, as well as the Thais, first professed
  Theravada Buddhism of the Mons and then changed to the Mantrayana sect of Mahayana school
  which reached Burma from Bengal in India. Then in the sixteenth Buddhist century, when
  King Anoradha of Burma re-adopted the former Theravada as his faith, seat of Buddhism was
  then at the town of Phu-Kam (or Pagan) where Theravada Buddhism had had her golden days.
  This led to a misunderstanding by some historians who concluded that the Buddhism belonged
  to another system of thought and practice and thus incorrectly named it &#147;Theravada in
  the Pagan Style&#148;. In fact it was no other than the former School of the Mons which
  had once been on the decline and was afterwards revived during the great king
  Anoradha&#146;s reign.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Due to his mighty forces the north-western
  part of Thailand and some of the town on the Chao Phaya River were also under his power.
  The town of Nakhon Pathom was also overrun during his reign. Thus Theravada Buddhism also
  gained ground in these parts of the land. But owing to their being accustomed to their
  former practices, Mahayana Buddhism was still firmly adhered to by those who had once been
  under Cambodian influence.</font></p>

  (Ceylon) Period</a></font></b></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In the Buddhist seventeenth century there
  reigned in Ceylon a great king whose name was Prak-Kamabahu. Being himself a devoted
  follower of the Buddha, he had dedicated much of his personal property and of his own
  happiness for the promotion of Buddhism in his land. His unique achievement was that he
  had managed to unite the bhikkhus of various sects who had some minor doctrinal
  differences and also had them convene a Council of well versed Theras (or Elders) for the
  sake of settling the contents of the three Baskets of Buddhism Canon as had been
  previously done in Ceylon and India. Due to the success of this Council, the Pali language
  was once again revised and proclaimed as the formal language for the research and study of
  Buddhism. His fame having spread for and wide to foreign lands, several Buddhist countries
  such as Burma and Thailand then sent out groups of bhikkhus to further their study of
  Buddhism in Ceylon. Seeing with their own eyes how the Ceylonese bhikkhus were
  well-behaved and well-grounded in their doctrinal beliefs, most of these bhikkhus were
  strongly impressed and took that opportunity to remain in Ceylon and have a thorough study
  of the Master&#146;s teachings. For this purpose, these foreign bhikkhus were to be
  ordained once again in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Ceylonese
  bhikkhus. On their return, they brought to their homeland the refined manners,
  well-grounded belief and Ceylonese culture which again made no less impression upon their
  people than they themselves had been so impressed. More young men left their homes for the
  homeless life of a bhikkhu and the Ceylonese religious culture had from that time taken
  root in various countries such as Burma, Lao, Cambodia and Thailand.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In Thailand it was about the Sukhothai
  Period, B.E. 1800, that the Ceylonese culture was adopted. It was believed that there were
  also some Ceylonese bhikkhus accompanying Thai bhikkhus on their homeward bound. They must
  have first of all landed at the town of Nakhon Sithammarat (some 800 kilometers south of
  Bangkok) and heralded the new culture there. When, as before, their fame was known far and
  near, it had later on reached the town of Sukhothai (some 500 kilometers north of
  Bangkok), then the capital of Thailand. The great king Ramkamhaeng, being himself as
  devout Buddhist, was delighted at the news and sent messengers to invite the group of
  &#147;Lankavansa&#148; bhikkhus to preach their doctrine at Sukhothai, promising them
  every help and convenience. We learn from the inscriptions that, through these Ceylonese
  bhikkhus from Nakkon Sithammarat, he was also well versed in the Buddhist Canon and
  whatever lessons in moral he taught his people, they were always backed by his own
  example.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Thus with the rise of Ceylonese Buddhist
  culture under the devoted king&#146;s patronage, came the decline of the once flourished
  school of Mahayana. This undoubtedly was due to the doctrinal as well as the disciplinary
  differences in several major practices and ideals. The former Theravada school not
  differing widely in the spirit and modes of practice, held their ground for the time being
  but had finally to give way and assimilate itself with the more influential party of
  Lankavangsa.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Obviously this movement bears a paramount and
  lasting influence upon the Buddhist disciplinary practice from then to the present time.
  One practical evidence to be seen even today is that around the Uposatha or the main
  shrine of several Aramas or temples both in the Sukhothai and the Chakri (the present
  dynasty) period there can be found sets of two, or even three, boundary stones set up
  within an arched stone canopy. This was possible because of the aversion on the part of
  Ceylonese bhikkhus, who were unwilling to perform religious rites within the former
  boundary stone, which, to the, might not have been correctly built or formally put up in
  strict accordance with the disciplinary rules. Thus they had one, or even two more to be
  built and formally put up according to their standard of belief. That most of the royal
  Aramas or temples in Bangkok today can be seen with two or three blocks of boundary stone
  is an evident proof how deep-rooted was the establishment of Lankavangsa ideals in
  Thailand.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><b><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><a name="Sukhothai Period">Sukhothai
  Period</a></font></b></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The eighteenth Buddhist century saw the
  decline of the Cambodian power which paved the way for the independence of the Thais and
  then to the establishment of the Sukhothai kingdom by the free Thais under the leadership
  of Poh-Khun (Lord or Chief) Intrathit and Ban Muang. These people of Sukhothai professed
  Buddhism both Mahayana and Theravada, while those of the north-east and of Nakkon
  Sithammarat in the South, being independent of Sukhothai, adhered firmly to Theravada. In
  the reign of the great king Ram Kam Haeng, third king of the Sukhothai lineage, his
  kingdom was greatly extended as far north as the town of Luang Phra Bang and as far south
  as the Malay Peninsula. In the East it was bordered by the river Mae Khong and in the west
  it annexed the whole of the Mons kingdom. The flood of Srivijai power was now ebbing away
  due to the downward press of the Thais together with the upward press of Java. And, just
  as before, with the ebbing away of military power came the decline of its accepted faith.
  Thus it was now the turn of Theravada to gain the spiritual power over the people, whereas
  Mahayana of Cambodia and Srivijai, having once risen to power together, were once again
  having an equal share in their declining days.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Now that the Lankavangsa Buddhism was well
  patronized by King Ramkamhaeng of the Sukhothai dynasty, it finally dominated over the
  existing beliefs of the Theravada and Mahayana. Sanskrit, the language held sacred by the
  Mahayanist, was accordingly replaced by Pali, the sacred language of the Theravadins and
  the Lankavangsa. The study of Pali was certainly at that time greatly enhanced. So much so
  that one of the later kings of Sukhothai dynasty called Phaya Lithai was among the
  well-known Pali Scholars far famed for his experience and devotion in the Buddhist study
  and way of life. He had also crystallized his research into the form of a book called in
  Thai &#147;Triphoom Phra-Ruang&#148; which is considered the earliest manuscript of
  Thailand. Its index and bibliography tells us how extensive his research was and how
  well-known he was among Buddhist scholars of that time. From a book by a lady called
  &#147;Nopphamas&#148;, presumably one of the lesser queens of the Sukhothai kings, there
  were ample evidences how Buddhist was at that time flourishing both in the study and the
  practice.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">One of the stone inscriptions (B.E. 1835 or
  1292 AD) in the reign of the great King Ram Kamhaeng tells us further that the Buddhist
  hierarchy of Ceylon was also adopted in Thailand. In another inscription (B.E. 1904 or
  1361 AD) in the reign of the later king Lithai of Sukhothai there was mentioned a
  Patriarch &#147;Maha Swami&#148; of Ceylon being invited to be the Patriarch &#147;Maha
  Sangha Raja&#148; of Thailand. Also in this reign there was recorded that the bhikkhus
  were divided into two groups viz. the &#147;Gamavasi - those living together within the
  town (or village) and the Aranyavasi - those living alone in the forest. This must have
  been originated from the two aspects of the study of Buddhism in the Scriptures viz.
  Ganthadhura - the business of learning (or book-studying) and Vipassanadhura - the
  business of practising or meditating for the development of Insight. This two categories
  of bhikkhus though not formally divided may be actually seen even in the present time.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">All though the time of Sukhothai period
  Buddhism had played a very important role as the foundation of culture, architecture and
  Buddha image construction, some evidences of which may be seen in the exquisite
  workmanship displayed in the images of the Buddha called JINARAJ, in the grand temple of
  Phitsanulok, 400 kilometers north of Bangkok, and JINASRI in the temple of PAVARANIVESA in
  Bangkok. The stars of Sukhothai, however, had risen for one hundred and twenty years and
  from that time it began to fall gradually until the kingdom was finally annexed to
  Ayutthaya.</font></p>

  Phraya River was founding Sukhothai kingdom, another tribe in the north-western tableland,
  called Lanna, was also successful in driving out the Mons influence from the River Ping.
  In the nineteenth Buddhist century King Meng-Rai of the ancient Chiang-San dynasty was
  known to have defeated King Ye-Ma, the Mon king of the town of Lamphun, and later built
  his capital at Chiang Mai.During this time Theravada Buddhism of Ceylon had been brought
  from their flourishing states in the Mons country and in Sukhothai to the north-western
  tableland, but was not able to take its firm roots there. In the twentieth Buddhist
  century through the royal order of King-Kue-Na, several &#147;Lankavangsa&#148; bhikkhus
  both from Moulmein (Mau-Ta-Ma) and from Sukhothai were invited to Chiang-Mai (750 km north
  of Bangkok) to preach their doctrine. Of these bhikkhus along with their followers, one
  named Ananda was from the town of Mua-Ta-Ma in the Mons country and the other called
  Sumana was from Sukhothai.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In the following century (B.E. 2020 or 1477
  A.D.) under the auspices of King Tilokara, the thirteenth of Chieng Mai dynasty and under
  the leadership of Khammadinna Thera, a general Council of bhikkhus which lasted one year
  was convened at the Maha Bodhivong Vihara. Practically this was the first Council held in
  Thailand and reflected the intensive study of Buddhism during the time. A collection of
  Pali texts, compiled by the Thera (Elders) of that glorious age, are now a pride of the
  those who wished to further their research of Buddhism in the Pali language. Some such
  texts were Abhidhammayojana, Mulakaccayanayojana. Vinayayojana, Vessantaradipani and
  Mangalathadipani. In the following (twenty-second) century the town was taken by the
  Burmese and from time Chiang-Mai became a unhappy town alternately torn by two superior
  powers i.e. Burma on her north and the kingdom of Ayutthaya on her south.</font></p>

  once under Sukhothai domination, proclaimed his state as independent of Sukhothai power
  and built up his capital at a town called Sri Ayutthaya, south of Sukhothai. This kingdom,
  which lasted 417 years, are ruled over by 33 kings.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Through more than four centuries which marked
  the age of Ayutthaya kingdom, Theravada Buddhism in Thailand seemed to reach its zenith of
  popularity. Within and without the city of Ayutthaya there scattered innumerable temples
  and pagodas which served as places, thereby exerting a great influence on the spiritual
  life of the people. Buddhist art, both in the field of architecture and Buddha-image
  construction, were on the same line of flourishing. An illustrative example of this fact
  may be seen today in the temple of the Foot-Prints at Saraburi. There was also a tradition
  which is still in practice today for every Thai young man to be ordained at least once as
  a bhikkhu. Several kings such as Phra Borom Trai Lokanatha, the 18th king, in following
  the example set by King Li-Thai of Sukhothai period, had temporarily renounced his throne
  to be ordained as a bhikkhu.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">During the reign of Phra Borom-Kote, the
  thirty-first of Ayutthaya kingdom, there reigned in Ceylon (now, Sri Lanka) a king named
  Kitti-Siri-Raj-Singha, who being discouraged by the decline of Buddhism in his island
  country and learning that Buddhism was purer in Thailand than any other country, sent
  forth his religious mission to the Thai King, asking a favour of some Thai bhikkhus to
  revive the spirit of Theravada Buddhism which had almost died out in his land. This was a
  good occasion when Thailand was able to repay her debt to Ceylon and the Venerable Upali,
  together with his followers, were sent to Ceylon. Thus the community of Ceylonese bhikkhus
  ordained by the Thai bhikkhus at that time has ever since been called Upali-Vangsa or
  Siam-Vangsa. It is the well known and most revered sect in Ceylon.</font></p>

  Buddhism, not to say the compiling of new texts and other measures for the propagation of

  settled, religious texts collected and the study and practice of Buddhism revised to some
  degree. With regard to the texts such as the Tipitaka, Commentaries and Sub-commentaries
  destroyed by fire, he had them borrowed or copied from those Cambodia. It is safe,

  wars with outward enemy, he often managed to find time to encourage the study and practice
  of Buddhism. Numerous temples, both inside and outside the capital, were repaired. Of
  these temples, the Jetuvana Vihara (or Wat Pho, in the vernacular), which ranks among one
  of the most important, had undergone seven years of repair and the well-known Wat-Phra-Keo
  (Temple of the Emmeral Buddha), which is regarded as the most important one in Thailand,

  in sending a religious good-will mission group to Ceylon and organizing the research and
  study of Buddhism. Thus it was during this time that the course for studying Buddhism in
  Pali language was divided into mine grades as such had once been done in Ayutthaya period.
  Other activities included the repairing of the existing temples and the building of new

  dynasty, succeeded his father in B.E. 2367. Having a natural bent for architecture besides
  being a pious king himself, he had more temples built both inside and outside Bangkok. The
  temple of Jetuvana in the reign of King Rama I became a treasure of religious knowledge
  for Buddhist scholars and the symbolic &#147;Prang&#148; of Bangkok was perfectly
  completed in his reign. Also two groups of good-will missionary bhikkhus, one after the
  other, were sent to Ceylon. His piety in Buddhism may be seen in his pioneer undertaking
  to translate the Pali Tipitaka and some other Pali texts into Thai. Nevertheless, his
  reign came to an end before they were all completed.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In B.E. 2372 there was a religious movement
  which marked a cornerstone for the study and practice of Buddhism in Thailand -- the birth
  of the Dhammayutta group of bhikkhus. This was due to Prince Mongkut, the King&#146;s
  younger brother who had been ordained as a bhikkhu for 27 years. Through this long period
  of secluded life he was endowed with a thorough knowledge of the Buddhist Scriptures,
  including the Tipitaka, its Commentaries, Sub-commentaries and other Pali texts as well.
  With such a wealth of knowledge gained and digested as a result of long and profound
  thinking, he was able to distinguish more clearly between what is right and what is wrong
  in the Master&#146;s doctrine. He then set out putting to practice what is mentioned and
  regarded as righteous in the Tipitaka. By doing so, he unwittingly made a great impression
  on those who, inspired by his conduct, took it upon themselves to follow his way of life.
  This group of people, in course of time, grew bigger and more popular and became a
  separate gathering of bhikkhus called the Dhammayutta group as distinct from the former
  group of bhikkhus in Thailand. Besides being proficient in religious knowledge, Prince
  Mongkut also had a good command of Sanskrit and English , and in his establishing the
  Dhammayutta group of bhikkhus, his movement might be compared with that of the Venerable
  Rahula Thera who through his examplary mode of practice had founded the Lankavangsa group
  of bhikkhus at the town of Nakhorn Si Thammarat (some 800 km. south of Bangkok).</font></p>

  their study and practice of Buddhism, so that they were well-behaved as well as

  the fact. The greatest and highest &#147;Chedi&#148; or pagoda of Nakhon Pathom, called
  the &#147;Pathom Chedi&#148; second to none in its design and decorations, also bears
  witness of his constructive genius and serves to remind the Thai people of its historical
  importance.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">As a result of earnest study in Buddhism
  there were more books expounding the tenets of the Buddha&#146;s doctrine in Thai
  language. This movement opened up a new trend of modern thought in disseminating the
  Dhamma to the people on a broader scale, instead of the former which seemed like
  monopolizing it for the realization of the few intelligentsia. Of the Pali literature, a
  volume by the Supreme Patriarch Prince Pavares Variyalongkorn, named
  &#147;Sugatavidatthividhana&#148; is the most important of the time.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><em><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><b>King Rama V</b></font></em></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The reign of King Rama V, formerly called
  Phra Chula Chom Klao, began in the year B.E. 2411 and lasted 42 years. He was also one of
  the few monarchs who temporarily renounced his throne after his coronation in order to be
  ordained as a bhikkhu. This was because most of the Thai kings since Ayudhya period were
  usually ordained before the coronation day.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Being no less devout to Buddhism than his
  predecessors, he managed to found two Buddhist Universities for the sake of increasing the
  progress and stability of the education of Buddhism.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">These two were Mahamakuta Raja Vidyalaya and
  Mahachulalongkorn Raja Vidyalaya, both of which have played a very in the field of
  Buddhist study. He also enacted a law concerning the administrative system of the
  community of bhikkhus, declaring that the Buddhist Church should be self-governing holy
  community, while the state would be the patron under the direction and for the welfare of
  the Church. Of other major construction work one is Wat Benjamabophit, which is well known
  among foreigners for its impressive Buddha image in the Uposatha.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In B.E. 2431 a Council of Bhikkhus under the
  chairmanship of the Supreme Patriarch Prince Pavares Variyalongkorn was held for the
  purpose of transliterating the existing Tipitaka from the palm-leaf books in Cambodian
  characters to printed books using Thai characters. This required 39 printed volumes for
  each set of the entire Tipitaka. Besides the Message itself, some Commentaries from
  Cambodian to Thai characters and then printed in the form of paper books.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">One of the king&#146;s elements of religious
  success, however, undoubtedly comes from the zealous efforts of one of his great helpers.
  This was no other than his own half-brother, the Supreme Patriarch Prince
  Vajirananavarorasa, who had a profound knowledge in English as well as Pali and Sanskrit.
  Thus, by virtue of his ability plus his high position (as the king&#146;s brother and as
  chief of the whole community of bhikkhus), the theoretical and practical sides of Buddhism
  under the far-sighted and able Patriarch were greatly encouraged. Most of his noble works
  are still now studies by the public as well as by the students, and it is never an
  over-estimate to say that he has blazed a trial for modern thought in the study and
  practice of Buddhism.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In B.E. 2437 the Mahamakuta Raja Vidyalaya,
  one of the two Buddhist Universities published a religious periodical, called &#147;Dhama
  Cakshu&#148;, which now reaches its sixty-third anniversary and is therefore the oldest
  and most long-lived religious periodical in Thailand.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><strong><em><b>King Rama VI</b></em></strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">King Rama VI, the poet and philosopher,
  formally known as Phra Mongkut Klao, ascended the throne in B. E. 2453. In order to imbue
  the spirit of Buddhism into the minds of his citizens, without distinction of position,
  profession or sex, he organized a new branch of studying Buddhism in Thai language. This
  was successfully done because there has been several texts on Buddhism compiled in the
  reign of his royal father together with many writers during his reign [mostly by the
  Supreme Patriarch Prince Vajirananavarorasa]. He himself never neglected to do so, and
  thus there were written many religious books which were both instructive and
  understandable by all. His wealth of religious literature consisted of such books as
  &#147; Addresses to Scouts&#148; and &#147;What did the Buddha realize?&#148; So it can be
  said that the study of Buddhism was now accessible to all, whether they know Pali or not,
  whether they want to study it for a long time of within a limited period of time and
  whether they be a male or a female. In case they have a limited time for studying, it is
  then advisable that they should Buddhism from the texts written in Thai, and if they are
  ordained as a Bhikkhu or Samanera [Novice], they are called &#147;Nak Dhamma [Dhammiko-the
  Dhamma student]. The [almost] same course for laymen or woman called &#147;Dhamma
  Suksa&#148;. [Dhamma-Sikkha-Dhamma student]. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">As regards the transliteration work done in
  the reign of King Rama V, more Commentaries, Sub-commentaries, Tika, and other Paki works
  were transliterated during his reign.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><strong><em><b>King Rama VII</b></em></strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Phra Pok Klao, of King Rama VII, came to the
  throne in B.E. 2468. Besides preserving all the movements for the promotion of Buddhism as
  King Rama VI had done, he also had a Council of Bhikkhus convened under the chairmanship
  of the Supreme Patriarch Prince Jinavara Sirivatthana for the sake of revising and
  checking the contents for the 39 Tipitaka volumes printed in the reign of King Rama V with
  the Tipitakas from Ceylon, Burma, Europe and Cambodia. Then a re-print was done. This time
  the contents were divided into 45 volumes, of which 8 were the Vinaya, 25 Suttanta and 12
  Abhidhamma. All these were printed in B.E. 2470. This new set of Tipitaka was called
  &#147;the Siam-Rath edition&#148;.</font></p>
  <b><p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><strong><em>King Rama VIII</em></strong></font></b></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">King Rama VIII or King Ananda Mahidol,
  succeeded King Rama VII in the year B.E. 2477. The administrative system for the community
  of Bhikkhus was during this time altered in compliance with that for the State, so that
  there were Ecclesiastical ministers and prime minister. More of this alteration will be
  dealt with under the heading &#147;Administrative system for the community of Thai
  Bhikkhus&#148; in the following pages.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Or the events worth mentioning, one was the
  construction of Wat Phar Sri Mahadhat by the Government and another was the study of
  Buddhism which became more popular in neighbouring lands such as in the Federated Malay
  States and Singapore.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><strong><em><b>King Rama IX</b></em></strong></font></p>
  <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">The reign of King Rama IX, formally called King
  Phumiphon, began in B.E. 2489.</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">A special hospital for Bhikkhus was built and
  two Buddhist Universities, in the real sense of a university, were established. These two
  are Mahamakuta University, situated at the temple of Bovoranives, opined in B.E. 2489. and
  Mahachulalongkorn University, situated at the temple of Mahadhat, opened in B.E. 2490.
  There two Buddhist Universities were really managed by Bhikkhus, with a subsidy from the
  Government and contributions from the public. Also studying in these two universities are
  Bhikkhus from neighbouring countries such as Laos and Cambodia. Up till now there have
  been several groups of graduated students. This is in a way a good omen foe Buddhism in
  this age of trouble and turmoil.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In B.E. 2499. King Bhumiphol temporarily
  renounced the throne for the purpose of ordination. During the period as a Bhikkhu he gad
  attentively studied Buddhism both in its theoretical and practical side. This moved the
  people to a general appreciation and rejoicing and in this occasion there was also
  rejoicing and in this occasion there was also an amnesty of many prisoners. The Supreme
  Patriarch was the Preceptor [Upajja] in this royal ceremony of ordination.</font></p>

  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><strong>MAHAYANA BUDDHISM
  IN RATANAKOSIN PERIOD</strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Mahayana Buddhism might have theoretically or
  nominally been lost from Thailand in the eighteenth Buddhist century, but all through this
  time some of its ideals have been practically and with some degree of sincerity adhered to
  by the general public. The general belief that everybody is or can be a Buddha and that
  the king is a Boddhisatva [or future Buddha] including the efficacy of charms and amulets
  that make a believer invulnerable to weapons and dangers and misfortunes are evidences
  that the spirit of Mahayana is still clinging stubbornly to the hearts of the people.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The first time Mahayana Buddhism came into
  Thailand was the Mantrayana Sect. Then for the second time Mahayana was introduced in the
  reign of King Thonburi and Rattanakosin Period by the refugees from Viet-Nam or An-Nam at
  that time. Owing to a state of revolution in their country, there were many noblemen and
  people who were immigrants from An-Nam. They later on built up a temple of their own. With
  a second wave of immigrants two more Annam Temples were built in Bangkok. In the reign of
  King Rama III, there more temples of the An-Nam Buddhism, one in Bangkok and two in the
  country, were built by the third group of immigrants.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In the reign of King Rama V there came from
  China a Chinese Bhikkhu, who later became very popular among the Chinese in Thailand, He
  afterwards built two Chinese temples - one in the country and the other in Bangkok, called
  in Chinese &#147;Leng Noi Yee&#148; or Wat Mang Kon Kamalavas which is the biggest
  Mahayana temple in Thailand. When an ecclesiastic title was given to the Chinese and the
  An-Nam Bhikkhus, he was one of those who were offered the honorable title. It should be
  noted, however, that Mahayana Buddhism in Thailand introduced by the Chinese and the
  An-Nam Bhikkhus belonged to the Sukhavati sect (Pure Land sect).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Another progressive step of the Chinese
  Buddhists during this reign was the building of another temple of their own-the first
  temple in Thailand that, due to the presence of Sima (formal boundary mark as prescribed
  in the Vinaya or Book of Discipline), can be used as a place wherein to perform the
  religious rite of ordination. This eliminated one of the previous troubles that required a
  Chinese bhikkhu to be ordained from China. In addition to this, there were also many
  Buddhist Associations founded by the Chinese Buddhists for the purpose of propagating
  their Mahayana doctrine. Nevertheless, their propagation was practically restricted &nbsp;
  among their fellow countrymen. This is possibly because the Mahayana Bhikkhus are
  generally more relaxed in their behaviour and less educated in their study.</font></p>
  <p align="right"><a href="#top"><strong><font face="Times New Roman">[^]</font></strong></a></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><strong>SOME PROPAGATION
  ACTIVITIES</strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">It has been traditional for every Wat or
  temple in Thailand to arrange for every Wat or temple in Thailand to arrange for a
  delivering of the sermon four times a month. This is done on the Buddhist Sabbath day,
  called in Thai &#147;Wan Phra&#148;, which, calculated from the lunar calendar, falls on
  the full-moon day, the half-moon days (of the waxing moon and the waning moon) and the day
  before the new moon day. In addition to this, there was later arranged a sermon on Sunday
  which, like those on the four Sabbath days, has been broadcast from various radio radio
  stations. The days of the Buddhist events such as Visakha Day, Magha or All Saints&#146;
  day and the day of Lent are proclaimed official official holidays. On the Buddhist Sabbath
  days there is to be no killing whatever in all slaughter-houses. There is also a
  department of religious affairs which is responsible for the welfare of Bhikkhus and the
  upholding of Buddhism (and other religions), for which purpose an annual subsidy from the
  Government is given. Bhikkhus who are well be offered a noble title by the king according
  to their ability and will also be given some financial help by the government.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Every turn of life practically cannot do
  without Buddhist ceremony or observance in some way or other. The birth, marriage, death
  and many other occasions of an individual as well as state ceremonies often require some
  Bhikkhus to take part in them by chanting or by delivering a sermon or by some other
  methods. Before beginning the morning lessons in every school, the pupils are to say their
  prayer to the Triple Gem (i. e. the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha ), and the life of
  Buddha and his doctrine are among compulsory subjects in the school curriculum. Also there
  has for a long time a tradition that every Thai youth must be once ordained as a Bhikkhu
  for a &#147;Vassa&#148; (a rainy season i. e. three months). It is all the better for him
  if he can stay as a Bhikkhu longer than that or for the rest of rest of his life.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">At present there are several Buddhist as
  associations under the management of devoted lay adherents. Some of these are the Buddhist
  Association and the Yong Buddhist Association of Thailand, both with affiliated societies
  in almost every town in the country. By the efforts of these associations programs for a
  lecture or talk or discussion on the Dhamma are at regular intervals arranged for the
  public, in addition to a periodical each of their own.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Thus it is an undeniable fact to say that the
  every day life of a Thai from the cradle to the grave, so to speak, together with his arts
  and craft and literature and culture and arts and other elements of his life, are all
  based upon and moulded by the one common factor-the spirit of Buddhism.</font></p>

  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><strong>ADMINISTRATION OF
  THE BUDDHIST CHURCH </strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In Thailand the head of the Buddhist Church
  is the Supreme Patriarch. The executive power is vested in the Council of Ecclesiastical
  Ministers, which to a great extent corresponds to the Cabinet Council of the State. For
  this Council there are Ecclesiastical Ministers, including the Sangha Nayaka
  (Ecclesiastical Premier), Ecclesiastical Ministers for Administration, for Propagation,
  for Education and for Public Welfare, and Eccl. deputy ministers. The rest are Eccl.
  ministers without portfolio. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The State, so far as the administration of
  the Church is concerned, is divided into main sections, each with its own Eccl. High
  Commissioner and his assistant, something like the State High Commissioner or
  Governor-general. Each section is further sub-divided into town, each with its own leading
  Bhikkhu or Eccl. Commissioner or Governor with his assistant. Then (for each town) there
  is a board of town committee, along with the board of town judges. Each town is divided
  into several &#147;Amphur&#148; (or districts), which in turn is sub-divided into several
  &#147;Tam-boon&#148; (Sub-districts). For each &#147;Amphur&#148; and &#147;Tamboon&#148;
  there is again a chief together with his assistant and board of &#147;Amphur&#148; or
  &#147;Tam-boon&#148; committee, These administrative agents are all Bhikkhus.</font></p>
  <b><p align="left"><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman">The Twenty-Fifth Buddhist
  Century</font></b></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In the auspicious occasion of the
  twenty-fifth Buddhist century, Thailand has organized a nation-wide celebration from
  12th-18th May in commemoration of one of greatest events for all Buddhists. Thus for the
  glory of the longevity of Buddhism in spite of undermining influences, and for the sake of
  showing the world how Thailand had firmly upheld Buddhism and how the Thai people are
  impressed by the Master&#146;s teaching, there is allocated as a sanctuary a piece of land
  to be called Buddha-Monthon (Buddha&#146;s domain), wherein is erected a standing Buddha
  image 2500 in. in height. In addition to this, the whole Tipitaka or the Three Baskets of
  the Buddhist Canon has been translated into Thai; temples and places of worship all over
  the land are being repaired; 2500 persons are to be ordained as Bhikkhus, and an Amnesty
  Act is passed; Buddhist activities, both on the part of Bhikkhus and laities such as of
  the various Buddhist societies, are also exhibited to the public; Buddhist literature and
  pieces of art will be displayed, and, within the temporary pavilion in the midst of the
  Phra Meru Ground, sermons are to be delivered, Parittas (instructive passages from the
  Sacred Books) chanted and food presented to 2500 Bhikkhus each day throughout the seven
  day celebration. These are to be presided over by their Majesties the King and the Queen.</font></p>
