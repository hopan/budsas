        told that if we listen well, we gain discernment. If we don't listen
        well, we won't gain any discernment. In terms of the Buddha's teachings,
        <i>listening well means that the mind has to be centered and firmly
        intent. </i>Success depends on our mind's being firmly intent. If we're
        not intent, there won't be any success -- we won't succeed in attaining
        the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana in the way they did in the
        past. In the past they listened for just an instant and succeeded in
        attaining nibbana. Why was that? Because they listened well. They gained
        discernment. They understood. In other words, they took it to heart.
        Nowadays we study all kinds of things -- going abroad to study; studying
        many, many fields of knowledge -- but it doesn't lead to release from
        suffering. It just leads back into the world of conventional truths and
        wandering on. We already know a lot, but if we want to listen well, in
        the way that leads to discernment, the mind has to be still.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">How do we make it still? Offerings we've
        already given. The precepts we've already taken: against killing,
        against stealing, against illicit sex, against lying, against
        intoxicants. And now it's up to us as to whether we'll keep them or not.
        The rewards of keeping the precepts, you know, go all the way to
        nibbana. The attainment of the human state, the attainment of the
        heavenly state, the attainment of nibbana are all results of keeping the
        precepts. That's what we're told.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Next comes meditation, making the mind
        centered, firmly intent. This is the duty of each and every one of us.
        You have to make a mental effort to look after the mind. It's a subtle
        thing, not blatant at all. It's subtle -- but it lies within us. Lots of
        teachers have come through here, teaching you to think <i>buddho,</i> or
        <i>buddho, dhammo, sangho.</i> You have to keep recollecting these
        things until the mind gets firmly centered. The reason the mind isn't
        yet firmly centered in concentration is because you go centering it
        outside. It's centered inside just a bit and then goes stretching
        outside. It won't stay centered inside. And when this is the case, you
        find it hard to listen well. So you have to try to listen well. Make the
        mind firmly centered. <i>You listen with your mind, not just with your
        ears. </i>You listen with your mind. When the mind is firmly centered,
        you gain discernment. Understanding. Total comprehension. In the past,
        they listened for just a little bit and they understood. They became
        stream-winners, once-returners, non-returners, and arahants.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So focus your minds on meditating. Make
        the mind still. Let it calm down from its outside preoccupations.
        Outside preoccupations are all around us. Let your eyes and ears be
        still. Our ears keep on hearing, so how can they be quiet? <i>We're</i>
        the ones who aren't quiet. We keep giving rise to things that go flowing
        out the ears and eyes. We keep making contact. So we're told to make the
        mind quiet. Make it centered. We have to be mindful, keeping the breath
        in mind.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So. Sit and meditate right now. Focus on
        your breath. Close your eyes and focus on your breath. Close your eyes
        and think <i>bud- </i>with the in-breath, <i>dho </i>with the out. <i>Bud-</i>
        in, <i>dho</i> out. Train the mind. And listen. If you simply listen
        without doing the training, nothing will develop. When you've listened,
        that's not the end of it. You have to listen and do it as well. What
        this means is that when you've listened, you have to do it right then
        and there so that you can gain some benefits from listening. Only then
        will you gain the skillfulness that you hope for, that you want. When
        the mind is centered and you understand, it leads to merit and skill.
        When the mind is still, you see what they mean by &quot;merit,&quot; you
        reach what they mean by &quot;merit.&quot; It's not the least bit hard.
        If the mind isn't centered, it's pretty hard. So fix the mind firmly on
        nothing but the in-and-out breath. Observe the breath. Is there an
        in-breath? An out-breath? It's something we all have within each and
        every one of us. This treasure is already there. The in-breath is there.
        The out-breath is there. So we have to bring our powers of observation
        inside the body. Keep this breath in mind. Don't go wandering off far,
        okay? Look at what's already there inside you.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">You have a valuable treasure within you
        -- the treasure of being a human being. So you have to look after this
        treasure until it grows more complete, until it becomes the treasure of
        the heavenly realms, the treasure of nibbana. Look after this treasure.
        It's hard to look after if you don't know how to use it, if you don't
        know how to take care of it. If you're not discerning, this treasure can
        turn into a liability -- there's no need to doubt it. So what can we do
        when we're not yet discerning? There are all kinds of dangers that can
        make us fall away from this treasure. This is why we have to develop the
        skills needed to take care of it -- in other words, observing the five
        precepts and keeping the mind firmly centered on the in-and-out breath.
        Keep the mind firmly centered. Keep watch over the breath continually.
        Keep after it continually, making sure that the in-breath is
        comfortable, the out-breath is comfortable. When we do this, we're
        looking after our treasure. When we look after it mindfully, nothing
        will threaten it. If anything comes our way, we'll know in advance.
        We'll be able to look after our treasure for the rest of our lives. Or
        we'll be able to increase it, add to it, so that it becomes the treasure
        of the heavenly realms, the treasure of nibbana. It all comes from this
        one spot right here. It comes from the breath. If we can take care of it
        and keep it firm, it'll take us to the treasure of the human state, the
        treasure of the heavenly realms, all the way to the treasure of nibbana.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, it's only natural that doing this
        will require persistence. Effort. Patience and endurance. Only then will
        we arrive at our goal. If we're diligent and persistent, we're sure to
        succeed, just like the great ajaans, just like the Buddha. They reached
        the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana through endurance, diligence,
        and persistence. That's how the Buddha became the Buddha we worship and
        bow down to every day. Why do we bow down to him? Because he exerted the
        kind of effort and persistence that enabled him to gain omniscience, to
        become the mainstay for all beings, human and divine.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The same principle holds true for us.
        Once we've set our minds on developing our treasures -- our noble
        wealth, our inner wealth as well as our outer wealth -- we have take
        good care of this spot: the breath. We have to train the heart so that
        it's firmly centered and established, staying with the breath at all
        times every day.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Actually, the breath is already always
        there. If it weren't there, we'd be finished. The breath has been with
        us ever since the day of our birth, but the mind hasn't looked after it,
        hasn't taken care of it. In other words, it hasn't looked after its
        guardian, hasn't even been acquainted with its guardian from birth. This
        guardian has looked after us all along, you know, from the time we came
        out of our mother's womb up until now. If this guardian hadn't been
        attentive in caring for us, we'd be dead. Finished. So we shouldn't
        forget the good that she's done us. Look to see what kind of person she
        is: What does she look like? What are her features? Is she warm or cold?
        Short or long? Focus on seeing what kind of person she is, to see why
        she's been so good-hearted. She's been looking after us all the way up
        until now, even though we aren't acquainted with her, haven't paid her
        any attention at all, to see how she's getting along, what her needs
        are. We've never looked after her at all. So let's give her some
        thought. Look to see what she's like when she comes in, what she's like
        when she goes out. Keep track of her. Pay her some attention. Be
        observant. Reflect on what you see. That way you'll see that the
        in-breath is there, the out-breath is there. Then it's up to you: sit
        here and keep this awareness going. Keep the breath going comfortably.
        Notice: is the in-breath comfortable? Is the out-breath comfortable? If
        the in-breath and out-breath are comfortable, keep them going that way.
        If they're not comfortable, we can change them. You might try in long
        and out short, depending on what you notice feels good. If long
        breathing isn't comfortable, you can change to short. Or if short
        breathing isn't comfortable, you can change to long. In other words,
        gain a sense of how to adjust things so that they're comfortable. If
        you're well acquainted with the breath, you can adjust it. If you're not
        acquainted with the breath, how will you be able to adjust it?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So first we have to get acquainted with
        it, to see the features of the breath already coming in and going out of
        the body. What's it like when it comes in? What's it like when it goes
        out? When we can clearly observe it, when it's comfortable, then we keep
        after it, keep it going, continually. We'll find that our guardian grows
        more good-hearted and kind. When our guardian is good-hearted, our heart
        will grow good as well. Why is that? It's the same as when we live with
        good-hearted people, our heart feels good, too. When our guardian is
        good-hearted, our heart will keep on being good.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha taught, <i>asevana ca
        balanam, panditanañca sevana:</i> when you associate with fools....
        When our heart sours, it's as if we associate with fools -- fools inside
        us. When the heart is good, it's because we have good friends -- <i>panditanañca</i>
        -- within. When the mind has a good friend as its guardian within, it
        will grow bright, open, and refreshed. It will gain in mindfulness and
        discernment. Whatever we think of doing won't be for the purpose of
        harming ourselves or others. So keep your mind firmly established in
        this way, because you've got a good friend, a guardian who will keep
        giving you good advice. The mind will experience brightness and clarity
        throughout the day, the month, the year, all the way until there's no
        more in-and-out breathing. So keep looking after your guardian until you
        breathe your last. If the mind is in really good shape, you'll go all
        the way to nibbana.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If that's what you want, you have to
        make an effort to study and train a lot, keep after it, for it's a skill
        that arises only from within you. It's your own direct refuge. In
        gaining this skill, you have to depend on yourself. The Buddha taught us
        to train ourselves, that we have to be strict with ourselves. Our
        parents, brothers and sisters, our teachers: these are simply people
        with whom we associate for a short while. But if we're really earnest,
        really intent, we have to depend on ourselves. That's what the Buddha
        taught. When he had taught living beings to take themselves as their own
        refuge, he was able to teach them to reach the paths and fruitions
        leading to nibbana. When he taught them, they took his teachings inward
        -- <i>opanayiko</i> -- to contemplate and then to put into practice so
        that they saw in line with the Dhamma.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So we should train ourselves to be
        better and better every day, every night, for this is our very own
        affair. You can say that the practice of the Dhamma is hard, and it is.
        You can say that it's easy, and it is, for the breath is right here
        within us. It's our very own affair. It all depends on whether you want
        to do it or not. If you don't train yourself, aren't strict with
        yourself, then you won't make progress. If you train yourself, are
        strict with yourself, then you will -- every day, every night. You start
        out with your parents and teachers. They teach you how to talk, how to
        eat, how to sit up, how to walk, all kinds of things. Ever since you
        came out crying: how long has it been? They trained you for months and
        then years, kept on training you. You depended on your parents to train
        you. You couldn't sit up, you couldn't walk, and so they taught you how.
        You couldn't talk, so they kept teaching you how. You gradually became
        more and more skilled, more and more intelligent. You've depended on
        your parents as your first teachers to teach you and advise you to the
        point where you're grown. Now it's your own duty. You're adults. It's
        your own duty to train yourself, to be strict with yourself. It's all up
        to you. <i>Whether you're to be good or bad, to rise or fall, it's all
        up to you.</i> If you don't train yourself, and just let things follow
        their course, who's going to suffer? You will.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The things we have to practice are all
        already within us. So we have to be selective in looking at the heart to
        make it firmly centered within. We have to realize that we've already
        got wealth. We're human beings. <i>Aggathanam manussesu:</i> the supreme
        status is in the human state. Being supreme in this way isn't something
        easily gained, you know. To be born as a human being and to meet with
        the Buddha's teachings is hard. There are a lot of beings out there who
        don't make it here. So we already have a treasure, we already have
        wealth. It's now up to us to develop that treasure into the treasure of
        the heavenly realms, the treasure of nibbana. It's not all that hard.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">For those who don't have this treasure
        -- spirits, angry demons, hungry ghosts -- it's hard. They want to do
        good, but they can't. Why not? Because they don't have any bodies. They
        don't have any wealth. They want to do good along with everyone else,
        but they can't. So they have to wander around, begging from people here
        and there, trying to get a message through by possessing this person and
        that, telling them to do good. They themselves want to do good but they
        can't. Back when they were human beings they didn't want to do good.
        Having gained the human state, they were lazy, eating and sleeping,
        sleeping and eating, letting the days pass by, pass by.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So we have to take time out every day to
        give some value to our lives. If human beings had a sense of how to give
        value to their lives -- even just for an hour a day, every day .... The
        important thing is that you not be complacent. Be intent on accelerating
        your efforts. Whatever goodness you should develop, should realize,
        should master, should perfect: make an effort to give rise to it. Give
        the heart something to hold to. When the heart has something firm to
        hold to, it's not put to any difficulties. So be as intent as you can on
        not being complacent. The Buddha told us to accelerate our efforts.
        Whatever goodness you haven't yet developed in your actions, go ahead
        and develop it. Whatever goodness you haven't yet developed in your
        words, go ahead and develop it. Whatever goodness you haven't yet
        developed in the area of the mind, you should accelerate your efforts
        and build it up within yourself as the treasure of the human state. That
        way, when you die and leave this human realm, you won't have to beg for
        anything from anyone else, because you've already provided for yourself.
        What you have is perfectly complete, with nothing lacking in any way at
        all.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is why those who know accelerate
        their efforts. When we're born into the human realm, we're born into a
        realm that's abundant in every way. So when those who know are born
        here, they waste no time and make every effort to build up their
        perfections even further. Like the Buddha -- think about it: for four
        incalcuable periods and one hundred thousand aeons he kept returning to
        this human realm to build up his perfections, taking birth again and
        again, growing old, growing sick, and dying again and again. Four.
        Incalculables. <!--stet ~~ jtb 011002-->
        Do you have any idea how long that is? Twenty-eight beings have
        completed their perfections to the point of becoming Buddhas. Each
        perfection of each Buddha has to be totally complete in every way. If
        you were to take all the treasures of the human realm, they'd still be
        no match for the perfections of the Buddha. <i>He was born for the sake
        of perfection,</i> to build his perfections. That was his aim. Whatever
        he was born as, it was always for the sake of his perfections, for the
        sake of the knowledge of Awakening. That was why he kept swimming around
        in samsara, dying and taking birth, dying and taking birth, dying and
        taking birth, over and over again. He kept on building up his
        perfections until he succeeded in gaining Awakening in line with his
        aims. The same with his disciples: they all were born for the sake of
        building up their perfections.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So how about us? What are the
        perfections we've been born for? Why haven't we accelerated our efforts
        to give rise to something? Why haven't we aimed our sights higher? Ask
        yourself: what do you aim for? What are your aspirations? When you have
        an aspiration, work to fulfil it. Bring it into being in line with your
        aims. Even if you don't succeed in this lifetime, you're forming the
        habits, the requisite conditions, for the next life, so that they're
        tempered and strong, so that they'll keep on growing higher and higher
        with every lifetime -- because you keep adding to them with every
        lifetime. In that way you'll be able to succeed.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we come into this world, we have to
        know within ourselves what we've come for. What were we born for? What
        were we born for? We're born to build up our goodness, so we should
        hurry up and develop our goodness and make it a reality. Just like the
        Buddha and his disciples: They weren't complacent. No matter where they
        were born, they were born for perfection. They didn't get infatuated
        with the affairs of worldly treasures. No matter how much worldly
        pleasure they experienced, they weren't satisfied. As soon as they had
        the opportunity, they left home to practice the holy life in order to
        continue building up their perfections in line with their aims.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As for us, as soon as we experience a
        little bit of pleasure we get stuck on it, addicted to it. And so we
        aren't willing to go anywhere. Even with just little pleasures, we get
        satisfied with the way things are. These pleasures are really tricky,
        you know -- these human pleasures. They're called sensual pleasure.
        Sensual pleasure is like a drug: One taste and you get addicted. They
        say that with heroin it's hard to break the habit, but this is even
        worse. It goes deep, right into the bone. It's what made us get born in
        the first place, and has kept us circling through birth and death for
        aeons and aeons. There's no medicine you can take to break the habit, to
        wash it out of your system, aside from the medicine of the Buddha's
        teachings. Only when you use the Buddha's teachings will your addiction
        to these pleasures gradually loosen, gradually lighten, gradually fade
        away. Only then will you be done with the poison of this intoxicant.
        That's what it is: sensual intoxication. We live with sensual
        intoxication. It's really fierce. It's what keeps us swimming around in
        death and rebirth. Think about it. Think about it. Human beings, common
        animals, they're all in the same boat. No matter where you're born in
        the sensual realm: even those who are born in the heavenly realm are
        still addicted. Even in the heavenly realms, they're not done with it.
        As soon as you escape from the human realm you get stuck in the heavenly
        realms. So as long as we don't use the medicine of the Buddha's
        teachings to cut through this addiction, to drive it out, we'll have to
        keep on swimming through death and rebirth, going and coming back the
        way we are right now, with never a chance to put an end to it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is why those who know have ears,
        have eyes, have discernment. They listen well and gain discernment.
        That's why they see through everything. They contemplate all fabricated
        things and see right through them. That's why they're able to destroy
        becoming and birth, so that they no longer have to keep swimming through
        death and rebirth. They let go of all stress and suffering, all
        difficulties and hardships, and enter nibbana. They abandon all
        fabrications without leaving a trace and go straight to nibbana. The
        Buddha and his disciples have all succeeded in this way, washing away
        all states of becoming and birth, so that they don't have to come back
        and suffer in this human world ever again.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So we should all set our hearts on
        making the mind into a firm foundation that we can hold to, as much as
        possible. If you can't yet hold to it, then do what you need to, so that
        you can.</font></p>
