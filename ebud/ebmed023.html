<I> Ajahn Pannavaddho was one of the first bhikkhus
to live and practise in the Hampstead Vihara with Kapilavaddho
Bhikkhu in the 1960's. He has since taken up residence in Wat
Pa Barntard, the forest monastery of Ajahn Maha Boowa of whom
he is a close and respected disciple. In the following piece he
illuminates the importance of samadhi as a basis for the deepening
of wisdom. <BR></I>

<P>
Atomic bombs don't let themselves off, they require
people to do so; bullets are not fired from guns without people
behind them; and what is behind each person is his own klesas
all the time. 
<P>
 In the training of the mind there is the need to
develop wisdom. Unfortunately, this cannot be done directly, just
by wanting wisdom. There may be some people with innate wisdom,
but they will not be able to bring it out and use it properly,
unless there is enough mindfulness to support and control it.
Wisdom does not simply mean intellectual thought, it is of quite
a different order and can only arise from an internal state of
calm. Therefore, the first necessity of mental training is to
attain a state of calm.
<P>
 Samadhi, the state of calm attained by meditation
practice, has many levels depending on the degree of absorption
of the citta with the object of meditation. The word, citta, means
the mind, heart or consciousness; it is the basis in a person
which is `central', whereas everything else, including the five
khandas is peripheral. Practically everyone has to develop the
practice of samadhi, if they want to attain wisdom and a state
of happiness beyond what is normally possible in this world. Having
attained samadhi, the way is then clear for the development of
wisdom. 
<P>
 Developing samadhi can be put like this. Normally,
the heart is hungry, it wants something, and it is searching around
all the time. The only way it knows how to search is through the
senses and in the world, because this is what it has learnt. It
wants this, searches for that, looks for this, wants to hear that
- and so on, all the time. It goes out continually, but what it
gets from the world and what it gets by doing this never satisfies
the hunger. In fact it tends to increase it if anything. The heart
is still hungry after all the searching one has done. 
<P>
 Now the way to satisfy the heart is not by going
out, but by going in the opposite direction. One must withdraw
one's attention away from sense stimuli, memory and thoughts -
both discursive and playful _ and one must give the mind as little
as possible to hold onto. One allows one's attention to remain
only with the subject of meditation, such as the repetition of
&quot;Buddho&quot;, or watching one's breathing. The mind is given
only this one thing to hold onto, one anchor. 
<P>
 At first it is very difficult for the mind still
wanders and jumps about but, as one goes on, it becomes more used
to it and interest starts to arise. When interest arises there
is less tendency to run around. You have probably noticed this
with work; how, when you had something which at first you did
not want to do, when you got deeply into it the work started to
become interesting. After that, it was no longer such a hard task.
It was much easier and could be done without much hardship. 
<P>
 It's like that with meditation practice. At first
it's hard work, but once you get into it then interest arises
and, once that happens, the mind becomes more and more absorbed
in the practice. When it becomes absorbed, the external things
all start dropping away automatically. The mind goes right inward,
and when it goes inward and stays there, it gets complete rest
and the heart is fulfilled internally and feels quite satisfied.
When it comes out of that state, it no longer wants to search
around looking for things, because it is satisfied. It is prepared
to remain just there - still.
<P>
 Withdrawing from this state of absorption the mind
is replete, satisfied, as though it has had a good meal. It is
also wieldy and pliable; this state can be turned to good advantage
by developing wisdom, because the main obstacles to its development
are quelled for a time. Instead of being restless, fluctuating
and wandering, the mind is in a suitable state which can be used
for investigation, and it can go very, very deep. This is true
wisdom and this wisdom brings results. 
<P>
 In the normal way of life, it is possible for one
to have insight and gain a lot of understanding by using reason
and discursive thought. Sometimes one may feel that such insights
are deep and important, for they may reveal things about life
and people which one had never realised before. Yet when one reviews
that understanding, it does not really have much effect on oneself
internally; it is, so to speak, on the surface. It may be quite
true, but it does not alter one's outlook or nature. 
<P>
 To give an illustration: the type of understanding
that does alter one's nature is like that of a young child who
sees something hot, like a red hot coal, and he goes to pick it
up. Once he touches it, he never does it again. He learns quickly
and deeply - it penetrates, it is effective. That sort of wisdom
is not easily lost. However, the wisdom which we must work for
is of a much more subtle nature, and can only be attained when
we have a basis of Samadhi. In Samadhi, the heart is still, it's
open, and whatever is penetrated by wisdom will go straight into
it. 
<P>
 Normally, the heart is covered over with all sorts
of garbage as though it's wrapped up and nothing can get through,
but when samadhi is developed the heart can be reached quite easily.
It is quite open, and whatever wisdom is developed goes right
in. That wisdom is then effective in giving results. It can be
effective in quite extraordinary ways - it can even reverse long-standing
habits of people quite easily. 
<P>
 Those obstructive qualities, which are like &quot;sand
in the gears&quot;, are called kilesas or defilements. They wrap
around the heart and prevent the calm from penetrating. They are
the things which we have to try and get rid of, and they are the
things which we must come to know. Mainly, they consist of greed,
hatred and delusion, but there are a whole heap of other things
which spring from these three. They have endless ramifications
and endless tricks too, they trick us in all sorts of ways. 
<P>
 Let me give an example: when doing meditation practice
and a thought arises - something not very good - one might catch
it, and then think, &quot;I've caught that one, the kilesas didn't
get me there.&quot; So then one congratulates oneself, but while
congratulating oneself one does not realise that this is also
kilesa, and one has been caught in another direction! 
<P>
 These are the sort of tricks that they play all the
time. One must learn their tricks and be up to them all the time
with understanding. One must not think that these kilesas are
little things, which are just tacked onto oneself somehow. They
are extremely important and are very deep in the heart. It is
just these kilesas that cause all the trouble in the world - nothing
else. Atomic bombs don't let themselves off, they require people
to do so; bullets are not fired from guns without people behind
them; and what is behind each person is his own kilesas all the
time. 
<P>
So the whole trouble in 
the world springs from these <I>kilesas</I>, which are quite subtle,
extremely resourceful and ever-present. They are resourceful because
they dwell there in each person's own heart (or citta), which
they usurp. They use its inherent cleverness to further their
own ends.  
<P>
The <I>kilesas</I> are 
there in the heart, and <I>Dhamma</I> is there also, all mixed
up; it depends on circumstances which one dominates at any one
time. These <I>kilesas</I> are there in the heart all the time,
and so they are continually flowing out and displaying themselves
in action, speech and thought. In fact, we could say that the
average person is almost entirely the <I>kilesas</I>. It is not
that sometimes they are there and sometimes they are not - they
are there all the time, colouring our outlook, causing our understanding
to be deluded. Our basic perceptions of the world, other people,
ourselves, religion and endless other things are all distorted,
because they all come under the baneful influence of <I>kilesas</I>.
<P>
 For this reason, everything that we do in ordinary
life is to some extent, false or wrong. There is nothing that
we can do perfectly, until we get rid of the kilesas. However,
we must not be too worried about this because, although everything
we do is false, there are two ways in which we can go; there is
one way that is wrong, and another that is right. What we must
learn is how always to choose the right direction, even though
it may be far from perfect and coloured by these kilesas. 
<P>
 If we go in the right direction, the kilesas steadily
get thinner, and the understanding that undermines them gets stronger.
However, if we go in the wrong direction, we become more deluded
and more caught up until there is no hope in anything. You only
need to look and see people who do bad things and see what they
become. They become coarse and gross, and they don't understand
anything subtle at all. This is because their kilesas are growing
fast, because they are going in the wrong direction all the time.
Those people who go in the right direction gain happiness, as
if there was an aura of happiness around them all the time. They
are not concerned about things, and they don't worry like other
people do. The world to them is not an unpleasant place; all the
problems in it do not really touch them, because they are good
inside. This is because the troubles in the world are always troubles
in oneself, while external troubles are mere occurrences which
just take place. It is within one's own internal state that all
troubles exist and, if one can only learn to cure oneself, all
troubles and problems will recede into the background. 
<P>
 As to the details of what you should do, you know
already what is meant by meditation practice, and you should try
to maintain whichever technique you find works best. As far as
wisdom is concerned, it is good to use wisdom in the sense of
thinking about things, seeing how things work in the world and
in one's life. Steadily this does have an effect, although it
is slow and takes a long time to penetrate deeply. In other words,
thinking about the right kind of things in the ordinary way of
thinking can develop wisdom but only very slowly, for it takes
a long time to penetrate internally in depth. Generally speaking,
there is little alternative to the development of Samadhi.
