      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="6">T</FONT>he Buddha declares that he teaches the Dhamma for the sole purpose of 
      leading beings to freedom from suffering. If, moved by that teaching, we 
      resolve to make an end of suffering, it is of prime importance that we 
      understand the problem of suffering clearly in its true width and depth. 
      If our grasp of the problem is too glaringly incomplete, our endeavours to 
      eliminate it will also be incomplete, incapable of garnering the strength 
      needed to yield fully satisfactory results.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When asked &quot;Why end suffering?&quot; the obvious answer is that one wishes 
      to end suffering because it is the natural innermost urge of one's being 
      to be free from affliction. However, in aspiring to the extinction of 
      suffering, we should think not only of our own affliction, but also of the 
      pain and sorrow we inflict upon others as long as we have not reached the 
      perfect harmlessness of a passion-free heart and the clear vision of a 
      liberated mind. If we regularly recollect the fact that, on our way 
      through samsaric existence, we inevitably add to the suffering of others 
      too, we shall feel an increased urgency in our resolve to enter earnestly 
      the path leading to our own liberation.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The suffering we may inflict upon our fellow-beings includes first 
      those cases where other beings become passive objects of our harmful 
      actions. Our greed robs, impoverishes, deprives and detracts, soils and 
      violates. Our hate kills and destroys, hurts and rouses fear. The turbid 
      waters of our interfering ignorance flood and devastate the neighbour's 
      peaceful shores; our misjudgements lead him astray and leave him in 
      calamity.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Then there is a second and even more detrimental way our defilements 
      may cause harm to others. Our evil or impure actions often provide in 
      others a harmful response that entangles them still more in the meshes of 
      their defilements. Our own greed increases the competitive greed of 
      others; our own lust rouses in others lustful desires which might have 
      slumbered had we not awakened them. Our own hate and anger provoke 
      hostility in return, starting thus the endless round of mutual revenge. 
      Our prejudices become infectious. By our own illusions we deceive others 
      who, by believing them, lend them increased weight and influence. Our 
      wrong judgements, false values and erroneous views, sometimes only 
      casually expressed, are taken up and expanded by others into extensive 
      systems of deceptive and perverted notions working untold harm on people's 
      minds. In all these cases a good part of the responsibility will be ours. 
      How careful we must be in what we speak and write!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A third way we may cause suffering to others is due to the limited and 
      varying lifetime of our emotions. Our own love towards a certain person 
      may die a natural death, while the person whom we loved still loves us, 
      and thus suffers under our neglect. Or, in reverse, while the other's love 
      for us has died, our own still lives and constantly urges him, encroaches 
      upon his need for freedom, disturbs his peace and tears at his heart, 
      causing him sorrow because he cannot help us. These are quite common 
      situations in human relationships, and their consequences are often 
      tragic. We feel their poignancy particularly strongly because no moral 
      guilt seems to be involved, only the stern impassive law of impermanence 
      impressing its painful stamp upon this scene of life. Yet here too a moral 
      principle applies, though it is a matter of definition whether we use the 
      word &quot;guilt.&quot; Understood rightly, the situation presents a case of lust, 
      attachment or craving causing pain through lack of fulfilment. Looking at 
      this case in this light, how clear will become the second noble truth: 
      &quot;Craving is the origin of suffering.&quot; And so too that seeming paradox: 
      &quot;From what is dear to us, suffering arises.&quot; When deeply contemplating 
      that little specimen of life's suffering as presented here, we shall feel 
      indeed: &quot;Truly, this alone is enough to turn away from all forms of 
      existence, to become disenchanted with them, to become detached from 
      them!&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We still have not exhausted all the ways our wn imperfections may draw 
      others into the whirlpool of suffering. But it may suffice here to add a 
      fourth and last point. Our own passions and ignorance, whether they 
      involve another directly or only as an observer, may contribute to his 
      harm by destroying his trust in man, his belief in high ideals, and his 
      will to contribute to the fund of goodness in the world. Our own 
      imperfections may thus induce him to become egocentric out of 
      disappointment, a cynic or a misanthrope out of personal or impersonal 
      resentment. Owing to our own imperfections, the forces of Good will again 
      have been weakened not only in us, but in others too.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There are many who will reply to the Buddhist doctrine of suffering by 
      saying: &quot;We are well aware that happiness and beauty, joy and pleasure, 
      have to be paid for by a certain amount of suffering. But we are willing 
      to pay the price without grumbling, even the last price, death; and we 
      think it is worth the price, and that it adds zest to our enjoyment.&quot; 
      Before those who speak thus, we may place the facts indicated above, and 
      ask them: &quot;Are you aware that the price you are speaking of is paid not 
      only by your own suffering, but also by the suffering of others? Do you 
      think that it is right and fair for you to make //others// pay for your 
      happiness? Will you still find 'added zest' if you look at your happiness 
      from that angle?&quot; And our partner - provided he is honest and noble-minded 
      (and only then would it be worthwhile to speak to him) - will pensively 
      say: &quot;I did not think of that. It is true, I must not make others pay for 
      my shortcomings. If I consider it unfair and ignoble to do so in my 
      everyday dealings, should it not likewise be so in relation to these 
      higher problems of life?&quot; We may then be sure that we have planted the 
      seed in his mind and conscience which will sprout in due time.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We return now to our initial line of thought. We have seen how our 
      actions may affect others through many channels, how our shortcomings may 
      drag others into suffering, entanglement and guilt. Thus our constantly 
      accumulating responsibility for much of the suffering and unhappiness in 
      the world should be an additional and powerful incentive for us to become 
      holy and whole for the sake of others, too.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Certainly our own wholeness and health will not cure others, at least 
      not directly and not in all cases. Our own harmlessness will only rarely 
      keep others from doing harm. But by winning to spiritual health, we shall 
      diminish at least by one the sources of infection in the world and our own 
      harmlessness will lessen the fuel nourishing the fires of hate which 
      ravage this earth.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">By remaining conscious of the suffering we cause and the suffering we 
      might prevent, we add two powerful motives to those already urging us to 
      enter the liberating path: the challenging sense of manly responsibility, 
      and the fullness of motherly love and compassion. These complementary 
      ideals of duty and love, which we may call the male and the female 
      principles, will help to keep us unswervingly on the path. Love and 
      compassion towards those who might become the victims of our own 
      imperfections will urge us to fulfil our duty towards them in the only way 
      possible: by fulfilling our duty towards ourselves.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The above lines of thought are tersely expressed by a saying of the 
      Buddha that is much too little known:</FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;By protecting oneself, one protects others;<BR>
      by protecting others, one protects oneself.&quot; -- SN 47:19</FONT></I></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the light of the observations made above, these simple yet profound 
      words of the Master will become still more translucent, charged with a 
      magical power stirring the very depth of our being. By contemplating how 
      our own defiled actions can have detrimental effects upon others, we shall 
      still better understand that both statements in this passage are 
      complementary: by guarding ourselves we are doing our best to protect 
      others; wishing to protect others against the suffering we ourselves can 
      cause, we shall do our utmost to guard ourselves.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Therefore, for our own sake and for the sake of our fellow-beings, we 
      have to be watchful of every step we take. Only by a high degree of 
      mindfulness shall we succeed. Thus it is said in the same discourse that 
      the method of practising that twofold protection is the firm establishing 
      of mindfulness (//satipatthana//), which here too proves to be &quot;the sole 
      way&quot; (//ekayano maggo//):</FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;I shall protect myself,&quot; thus the establishing of mindfulness has to 
      be cultivated. <BR>
      &quot;I shall protect others,&quot; thus the establishing of mindfulness has to 
      be cultivated.</FONT></I></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The same idea and method is expressed in a passage of the Buddha's 
      &quot;Advice to Rahula&quot; (MN 61):</FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;After reflecting again and again, actions by deed, word and thought 
      should be done... Before doing such actions by deed, word and thought, 
      while doing them and after doing them, one should reflect thus: &quot;Does this 
      action lead to the harm of myself, to the harm of others, to the harm of 
      both?&quot; After reflecting again and again, one should purify one's actions 
      by deed, word and thought. Thus, O Rahula, should you train yourself.&quot;</FONT></I></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Again, it is said:</FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Thus, O monks, should you train yourselves:<BR>
      Considering one's own welfare, this is sufficient to strive untiringly.
      <BR>
      Considering the welfare of others, this is sufficient to strive 
      untiringly. <BR>
      Considering the welfare of both, this is sufficient to strive 
      untiringly.&quot;<BR>
      SN 12:22</FONT></I></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">These three sayings of the Master will illuminate each other. By 
      reminding us of the right motives of our quest, and supplying us with the 
      right methods for accomplishing our task, they will be infallible guides 
      in treading the path.</FONT></P>
