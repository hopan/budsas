      <td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ajahn Sumedho (Robert 
        Jackman) was born in Seattle, Washington in 1934. On graduating from university, 
        he joined the U.S. Navy as a medical officer and served in the Korean 
        War. Returning to academic life, he took an M.A. in South Asian Studies 
        from the University of California (Berkeley) in 1963. After a short spell 
        working for the Red Cross, he went out to the Far East and spent two years 
        teaching English with the Peace Corps in Borneo.<br>
        His growing interest in Buddhism took him (in 1966) to Thailand, where 
        he sought to enter monastic life. He became a novice in Nong Khai and 
        a bhikkhu one year later in 1967, with Chao Khun Rajapreechayamuni as 
        preceptor. Soon after his ordination, he was taken to meet Ajahn Chah, 
        with whom he stayed and trained for ten years. Following a -- tudong -- 
        pilgrimage in India in 1974, he helped establish Wat Pah Nanachat and 
        became its abbot.<br>
        In 1977 Ajahn Chah was invited by the English Sangha Trust to visit Britain. 
        He brought Ajahn Sumedho with him, and seeing the interest there, left 
        him in London (at the Hampstead Vihara) in charge of a small group of 
        bhikkhus. In 1979 the monks were able to move to Sussex, which marked 
        the beginning of Chithurst Buddhist Monastery. Interest flourished, and 
        under Ajahn Sumedho's guidance Amaravati Buddhist Centre near London was 
        established in 1984, in addition to branch monasteries in the north and 
        south-west of England, and also in Switzerland and New Zealand.<br>
        In 1981 Ajahn Sumedho was appointed an -- Upajjhaya -- (preceptor). He was 
        also president (1983--87) of the London-based Buddhist Society.</font></td>

        <p align="left"> TODAY IS THE FULL MOON OF JANUARY and the beginning of 
          our winter retreat. We can have an all-night meditation sitting tonight 
          to commemorate the auspiciousness of the occasion. It's very fortunate 
          to have an opportunity such as this to devote ourselves for two months 
          to one-pointed reflection on Dhamma.</p>
        <p align="left">The teaching of the Buddha is the understanding of The 
          Way Things Are -- being able to look, to be awake. It means developing 
          attentiveness, brightness, and wisdom -- developing the Eightfold Path, 
          which we call bhavana.</p>
        <p align="left">Now when we're reflecting on things as they are, we're 
          'seeing', rather than interpreting through a veil of self-view. The 
          big obstacle all of us have to face is this insidious belief in the 
          'I am' -- attachment to self-view. It's so ingrained in us that we're 
          like fish in the water: water is so much a part of the fish's life that 
          it doesn't notice it. The sensory world we've been swimming in since 
          our birth is like that for us. If we don't take time to observe it for 
          what it really is then we'll die without getting any the wiser.</p>
        <p align="left">But this opportunity as a human being has the great advantage 
          for us of our being able to reflect -- we can reflect on the water we're 
          swimming in. We can observe the sensory realm for what it is. We're 
          not trying to get rid of it. We're not complicating it by trying to 
          add to it -- we're just being aware of it as it is. We're no longer deluding 
          ourselves by appearances, by fears, desires and all the things we create 
          in our mind about it.</p>
        <p align="left">This is what we mean when we use such terms like: 'It 
          is as it is.' If you ask someone who is swimming in water, 'What is 
          water like?', then they simply bring attention to it and say, 'Well, 
          it feels like this. It's this way.' Then you ask, 'How is it exactly? 
          Is it wet or cold or warm or hot...?' All of these words can describe 
          it. Water can be cold, warm, hot, pleasant, unpleasant... But it's just 
          like this. The sensory realm we're swimming in for a lifetime is this 
          way! It feels like this! You feel it! Sometimes it's pleasant. Sometimes 
          it's unpleasant. Most of the time it's neither pleasant nor unpleasant. 
          But always it's just this way. Things come and go and change, and there's 
          nothing that you can depend on as being totally stable. The sensory 
          realm is all energy and change and movement; all flux and flow. Sensory 
          consciousness is this way.</p>
        <p align="left">Now we're not judging it; we're not saying it's good or 
          it's bad, or you should like it, or you shouldn't; we're just bringing 
          attention to it -- like the water. The sensory realm is a realm of feeling. 
          We are born into it and we feel it. From the time the umbilical cord 
          is severed we're physically independent beings; we're no longer physically 
          tied to anybody else. We feel hunger; we feel pleasure; we feel pain, 
          heat, and cold. As we grow, we feel all kinds of things. We feel with 
          the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, the body; and with the mind 
          itself. There is the ability to think and remember, to perceive and 
          conceive. All this is feeling. It can be lots of fun and wonderful, 
          but it can also be depressing, mean and miserable; or it can be neutral 
          -- neither pleasant nor painful. So all sensory impingement is The Way 
          It Is. Pleasure is this way; pain is this way. The feeling of neither 
          pleasure nor pain is this way.</p>
        <p align="left">To be able to truly reflect on these things, you have 
          to be alert and attentive. Some people think that it is up to me to 
          tell them how it is: 'Ajahn Sumedho, how should I be feeling right now?' 
          But we're not telling anybody how it is; we're being open and receptive 
          to how it is. There's no need to tell someone how it is when they can 
          find out for themselves. So this two months of finding out how it is, 
          is a valuable opportunity. Many human beings it seems, are not even 
          aware that such a development of wisdom is possible.</p>
        <p align="left">What do we mean when we use this word wisdom? From birth 
          to death, this is the way it is. There's always going to be a certain 
          amount of pain, and discomfort, unpleasantness and ugliness. And if 
          we're not aware of it as it really is -- see it as Dhamma -- then we tend 
          to create a problem out of it. The span between birth and death becomes 
          all very personal; it becomes fraught with all kinds of fears and desires 
          and complications.</p>
        <p align="left">We suffer a lot in our society from loneliness. So much 
          of our life is an attempt to not be lonely: 'Let's talk to each other; 
          let's do things together so we won't be lonely.' And yet inevitably, 
          we are really alone in these human forms. We can pretend; we can entertain 
          each other; but that's about the best we can do. When it comes to the 
          actual experience of life, we're very much alone; and to expect anyone 
          else to take away our loneliness is asking too much.</p>
        <p align="left">When there's physical birth, notice how it makes us seem 
          separate. We're not physically joined to each other, are we? With attachment 
          to this body we feel separate and vulnerable; we dread being left alone 
          and we create a world of our own that we can live in. We have all kinds 
          of interesting companions: imaginary friends, physical friends, enemies, 
          but the whole lot of it comes and goes, begins and ends. Everything 
          is born and dies in our own minds. So we reflect that birth conditions 
          death. Birth and death; beginning and ending.</p>
        <p align="left">During this retreat, this kind of reflection is highly 
          encouraged: contemplate what birth is. Right now we can say: 'This is 
          the result of being born; this body. It's like this: it's conscious 
          and it feels, there's intelligence, there's memory, there's emotion.' 
          All these can be contemplated because they are mind objects; they are 
          dhammas. If we attach to the body as a subject, or to opinions and views 
          and feelings as 'me' and 'mine', then we feel loneliness and despair; 
          there's always going to be the threat of separation and ending. Attachment 
          to mortality brings fear and desire into our lives. We can feel anxious 
          and worried even when life is quite all right. So long as there's ignorance 
          -- avijja -- regarding the true nature of things, fear is always going 
          to dominate consciousness.</p>
        <p align="left">But anxiety is not ultimately true. It's something we 
          create. Worry is just that much. Love and joy and all the best in life, 
          if we are attached to them, are going to bring the opposite along also. 
          That's why in meditation we practise accepting the feeling of these 
          things. When we accept things for what they are, we're no longer attached 
          to them. They just are what they are; they arise and cease, they're 
          not a self.</p>
        <p align="left">Now from the perspective of our cultural background, how 
          does it appear? Our society tends to reinforce the view that everything 
          is 'me' and 'mine'. 'This body is me; I look like this; I am a man; 
          I am an American; I am 54 years old; I am an abbot.' But these are just 
          conventions, aren't they? We're not saying I'm not these things; rather 
          we're observing how we tend to complicate them by believing in the 'I 
          am'. If we attach to them, life becomes so much more than it actually 
          is; it becomes like a sticky web. It gets so complicated; whatever we 
          touch sticks to us. And the longer we live the more complicated we make 
          it. So much fear and desire comes from that commitment to 'I am' -- to 
          being somebody. Eventually they take us to anxiety and despair; life 
          seems much more difficult and painful than it really is.</p>
        <p align="left">But when we just observe life for what it is, then it's 
          all right: the delights, the beauty, the pleasures, are just that. The 
          pain, the discomfort, the sickness, are what they are. We can always 
          cope with the way life moves and changes. The mind of an enlightened 
          human being is flexible and adaptable. The mind of the ignorant person 
          is conditioned and fixed.</p>
        <p align="left">Whatever we fix on is going to be miserable. Being a man, 
          or being a woman, as a permanent belief, is always going to make life 
          difficult. Any class we identify with -- middle class, working class, 
          American, British, Buddhist, Theravadin Buddhist -- grasping to any of 
          these will produce some kind of complication, frustration and despair.</p>
        <p align="left">Yet conventionally, one can be all these things -- a man, 
          an American, a Buddhist, a Theravadin; these are merely perceptions 
          of mind. They are adequate for communication; but they're nothing more 
          than that. They're what is called sammuttidhamma -- 'conventional reality'. 
          When I say, 'I'm Ajahn Sumedho,' that's not a self, not a person; it's 
          a convention. Being a Buddhist monk is not a person -- it's a convention; 
          being a man is not a person, it's a convention. Conventions are as they 
          are. When we attach to them out of ignorance, we become bound and limited. 
          That's the sticky web! We're blinded; being deluded by the convention.</p>
        <p align="left">When we let go of the conventions, we don't throw them 
          away. I don't have to kill myself or disrobe; the conventions are all 
          right. There's no suffering involved in any of these if there is the 
          awakened mind seeing them for what they are; they just are as they are. 
          They're merely a convenience; expedient to time and place.</p>
        <p align="left">With the realisation of 'ultimate reality' (paramatthadhamma), 
          there is the freedom of Nibbana. We are free from the delusions of desire 
          and fear; this freedom from conventions is the Deathless. But to realise 
          this we have to really look at what attachment is. What is it all about? 
          What is suffering, and attachment to the 'I am' process? What is it? 
          We're not asking anybody to deny themselves; attachment to the view 
          of being nobody is still somebody. It's not a matter of affirmation 
          or negation but of realisation; of seeing. To do this we use mindfulness.</p>
        <p align="left">With mindfulness we can open to the totality. In the beginning 
          of this retreat, we open to the whole two months. On the first day, 
          we've already accepted in full awareness all possibilities: sickness 
          and health, success and failure, happiness and suffering, enlightenment 
          or total despair. We're not thinking, 'I'm only going to get..., I only 
          want to have..., I want to have only the nice things happen to me. And 
          I've got to protect myself so that I'll have an idyllic retreat; be 
          perfectly safe and tranquillised for two months.' That in itself is 
          a miserable state, isn't it? Instead, we take all the possibilities, 
          from the best to the worst. And we're doing this consciously. That means: 
          everything that happens during these two months is part of the retreat 
          -- it's a part of our practice. The Way Things Are is Dhamma for us: 
          happiness and suffering, enlightenment or total despair -- everything!</p>
        <p align="left">If we practise this way, then despair and anguish take 
          us to calm and peace. When I was in Thailand I had a lot of these negative 
          states -- loneliness, boredom, anxiety, doubt, worry and despair. But 
          accepted as they are, they cease. And what's left when there's no more 
          despair?</p>
        <p align="left">The Dhamma that we're looking at now, is subtle. Not subtle 
          in the sense that it's high up -- it's so ordinary, so very much here 
          and now that we don't notice it. Just like the water for the fish. Water 
          is so much a part of its life the fish doesn't notice it; even though 
          it's swimming in it. Sensory consciousness is here, now. It's this way. 
          It's not distant. It's not really difficult. It's just a matter of paying 
          attention to it. The way out of suffering is the way of mindfulness: 
          mindful-awareness or wisdom.</p>
        <p align="left">So we keep bringing our attention to the way things are. 
          If you have nasty thoughts, or feel resentful, bitter or irritated, 
          then notice what it feels like in your heart. If we're frustrated and 
          angry during this time, it's all right because we've already allowed 
          for that to happen. It's a part of the practice; it's the way things 
          are. Remember, we're not trying to become angels and saints -- we're 
          not trying to get rid of all our impurities and coarseness and just 
          be happy. The human realm is like this! It can be very coarse and it 
          can be pure. Pure and impure are a pair. To know purity and impurity 
          is mindfulness-wisdom. To know that impurity is impermanent and not-self 
          is wisdom. But the minute we make it personal -- 'Oh, I shouldn't have 
          impure thoughts!' -- we're stuck again in the realm of despair. The more 
          we try to have only pure thoughts, the more the impure thoughts keep 
          coming. That way we make sure we're going to be miserable for the whole 
          two months; guarantee it. Out of ignorance we create a realm for ourselves 
          that can only be miserable.</p>
        <p align="left">So in mindfulness, or full mindedness, all misery and 
          all happiness are of equal value: no preferences. Happiness is this 
          way. Misery is this way. They arise and they cease. Happiness is still 
          happiness; it's not misery. And misery is still misery; it's not happiness. 
          But it is what it is. And it's nobody's and it's only that much. And 
          we don't suffer from it. We accept it, we know it and we understand 
          it. All that arises ceases. All dhamma is not self.</p>
        <p align="left">So I offer this for your reflection.</p>
