        <p>Venerable Bodhipalo (Michael Markham) was born in Nottingham, England, 
          in 1948. When he was young, his family moved around quite a lot, and 
          he spent 18 months in Canada when he was eight years old. After leaving 
          school he did various jobs, but was unable to find anything that really 
          interested him; eventually, he decided to go travelling. He went overland 
          through Europe to the Middle East, and on to India and Nepal. In Kathmandu, 
          he read a book about meditation, which sparked off his interest; later, 
          while staying in Benares, he heard about a meditation course being held 
          in Bodh Gaya, and travelled there to attend.<br>
          He returned to the U.K. in 1972 and worked on a farm, but, still feeling 
          unable to settle, he went back to India in 1974. At Bodh Gaya he became 
          a samanera, travelling later that year to Wat Pah Pong, where he received 
          bhikkhu ordination. However, uncertain about making a long-term commitment 
          to the Holy Life, he disrobed and returned to the U.K. in 1976. After 
          a short time back in lay life he realised that it still did not suit 
          him, and with fresh resolve he went back to Thailand and received upasampada 
          again, this time with Ajahn Chah as preceptor.<br>
          He visited the U.K. in 1986 for health reasons, spending a few months 
          at Chithurst Monastery, before setting out on a pilgrimage to the Buddhist 
          holy places in India.<br>
          He is currently living in Thailand.</p>

          Venerable Bodhipalo returned to England from Thailand in 1986, to spend 
          time with his family and at Chithurst Buddhist Monastery. On the journey 
          back to Thailand he decided to undertake a lone pilgrimage in India 
          to the Buddhist holy places. After a few months a letter was received 
          by the community at Chithurst. Here are some extracts.<br>

          told me all the terrible things<br>

          and decided to walk to Lumbini.&quot;<br>
          <img src="line-bot.gif" width="522" height="3"> </font></b></font></p>
        <p align="left"> I LEFT SAVATTHI ON 4TH DECEMBER and was glad I had the 
          chance to see it. I wanted to walk to Lumbini but met with a lot of 
          negativity from people. They told me all the terrible things that might 
          happen -- I might starve, or get lost, or be robbed or killed, and it 
          was too cold to sleep out at nights. Although it's easy to travel from 
          place to place by bus with the pilgrims, and they're quite willing to 
          take you, I wouldn't have enjoyed that at all. Originally, I was not 
          going to use roads at all and go cross-country from village to village, 
          but this proved impracticable. Fifteen years ago when I was here, the 
          paddy fields were empty all winter, but now they're full of crops: winter 
          wheat, rape, tapioca, sugar cane, vegetables. And here in Nepal they're 
          still harvesting the rice in some places.</p>
        <p align="left">Anyway, in spite of other people's negativity, I thought 
          I should at least give walking a try. So I thought of all the good things 
          that might happen, the kind, helpful people I might meet, etc., and 
          decided to walk to Lumbini.</p>
        <p align="left">On my first attempt at pindapata (almsround) in Bulrampur, 
          I did quite well -- not a square meal, but enough to keep me going. One 
          problem was trying to explain to people that I didn't accept money or 
          raw rice. Also I think perhaps some people thought I was broke -- a hard-up 
          hippie. So then I got a monk to write a note (in Hindi) saying something 
          like, 'I am a Buddhist monk on pilgrimage to the holy places. I do not 
          accept money. I depend on alms food and eat only between dawn and midday. 
          I am grateful for your help.' With this note things have been easier. 
          I stand in front of a shop or house for a while -- maybe half a minute 
          -- and if they don't say anything, I move on to the next. If they ask 
          what I want, then I give them the note to read. In most cases the response 
          has been very good. Sometimes someone will walk along with me and chivvy 
          their friends into giving me something. I usually look like the pied 
          piper with a great gaggle of ragged children on my tail. One day I had 
          quite a good meal of chapatis and sabjees and sweets. Other times I 
          had small bits and pieces.</p>
        <p align="left">I've slept in a variety of places; by the road in a small 
          copse of trees with a stream running through it (plenty of streams in 
          this area, so no problem bathing); one night in a straw stack. The villagers 
          wanted me to sleep in a house in the village, but there were too many 
          women and children around, so I slept outside the village in the threshing 
          area on a heap of straw, under a large mango tree. That was one of the 
          warmest nights. Sleeping out is very cold and it is usually impossible 
          to sleep lying down. But I remembered my experiences in Kanchanaburi 
          (in Thailand), and found that I could make more economical use of my 
          robes, and keep warmer by sitting up. One night I found an abandoned 
          grass hut near the road. Daytime is pleasantly warm, but it gets a bit 
          hot in the sun around midday, if you're walking or exerting yourself.</p>
        <p align="left">I regret I can't speak the language. I think it would 
          be even more fruitful if I could. I've decided to carry on the rest 
          of the pilgrimage in this way, going next to Kushinara, then Varanasi 
          and Bodh Gaya. Of course, some of the dangers that people have pointed 
          out might happen, but I'm sure they were just as likely in the Buddha's 
          day, and I could probably more easily be killed by a taxi in London 
          than by robbers in India.</p>
        <p align="left">I'm sure that my greatest protection is keeping the Vinaya-discipline. 
          The parami (virtue) of keeping good Vinaya is very powerful; especially 
          important are rules about food and money. If I kept food or money, I 
          could not go pindapata with a clear conscience. Many people have done 
          their best to persuade me to accept money or carry food with me, but 
          I know if I did that then pindapata wouldn't work, I would not get any 
          of the help or respect that usually go to a samana (renunciant).</p>
        <p align="left">I'm now in Lumbini. I stopped at Kapilavastu for one day, 
          but there's not much to see. It doesn't appear to have been a very big 
          place -- nothing like Savatthi -- but it's hard to say, as so little has 
          been excavated. You can see the Himalayas from here. At Savatthi you 
          couldn't see them. On the second day's walk I looked up in the late 
          afternoon, and there they were; quite took my breath away. Green fields 
          and trees stretching into the distance and beyond, the purple brown 
          foothills, beyond this the snowcapped peaks against a vivid blue sky. 
          The best time to see them is early morning, before eight; especially 
          at sunrise, when the snow is bright pink....</p>
        <p align="left">I had a lot of doubts about doing this while I was still 
          in England. When I first arrived in India I had doubts too. Sometimes 
          I thought I was completely crazy, or that it was just a waste of time, 
          a distraction, or just ego. But now I'm very glad I'm able to do this 
          trip. I consider myself very lucky to have the opportunity. I hope more 
          monks will do the same....</p>
        <p align="left">I hope all goes well with everyone at Chithurst. Excuse 
          my terrible writing, but I'm not used to writing so small.</p>
