        <p>This book is about a community of people endeavouring to do justice 
          to the gift they have received. More precisely, it is a collection of 
          transcribed talks, letters and essays offered by disciples of Luang 
          Por Chah, who are now living at various monasteries around the world. 
          These teachings have been gathered specifically for this publication. 
          It seemed appropriate that a book published in the West to honour the 
          Venerable Ajahn Chah's life should reflect the results of his years 
          of teaching. These are some of the fruits of what he spent his life 
          nurturing. Although some editing was required so that the oral teachings 
          might be accessible in the written form, it is hoped that the spirit 
          of the original presentation has been preserved: that is, the spirit 
          of the living Truth.</p>
        <p>The Buddha said that nobody else can walk the Way for us -- but they 
          can point out the way we should go. The directions given will be different 
          for each of us, depending on how far we must go and from where we are 
          starting. There were occasions when people questioned Ajahn Chah about 
          apparent contradictions in his advice. He replied that if he was standing 
          at the end of a road and saw someone coming towards him veering off 
          to the left, he would tell them to go right. If they were veering to 
          the right he would tell them to move left. The instructions were different, 
          but the ultimate direction was the same.</p>
        <p>Style and emphasis also vary when the Teaching is presented by different 
          individuals. This will become obvious as the reader progresses through 
          this book. The reader may also come across inconsistencies and contradictions. 
          If this is so, it should be remembered that such discrepancies are in 
          appearance only. These words are not presented as the Truth itself but 
          as reflections offered for consideration.</p>
        <p>Many people have benefitted from Ajahn Chah's ability to point out 
          the Way; and many of these same people have participated in offering 
          this book in commemoration of their teacher. One of the deepest forms 
          of gratitude is that which springs forth from a true appreciation for 
          the beauty of the Way; it is with such gratitude that this offering 
          is made. It is the wish of all who have contributed, that the readers 
          may see, understand, and follow the Way about which all these words 
          have been written.</p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#800000">A 
          note on hierarchy and the order of presentation:</font><br>
          The Buddha instructed that repect should always be shown to those monks 
          who have been in the Order the longest. This holds true regardless of 
          other qualities any individual may possess. Hence, the sequence of this 
          presentation is determined solely with respect for seniority in the 
          bhikkhu-sangha. These talks are not offered as a progressive teaching. 
          Accordingly, it is recommended that readers feel free to select and 
          read, re-read or omit as they wish.</p>
