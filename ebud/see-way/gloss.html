      <td colspan="3"> 
        <p align="left">The following words are mostly in Pali, the language of 
          the Theravada Buddhist scriptures and chants (if not Pali, the language 
          of the word is noted). They are brief translations for quick reference 
          these are not exhaustive or refined definitions. Not all of the foreign 
          words found in the talks are listed below, as many are defined at the 
          point of use. Note most Pali diacritics have been omitted here and within 
          the book, as few people are familiar with the specialised pronunciation 
          conventions</p>
        <p align="left">ajahn: (Thai) 'teacher'. Often used as the title of the 
          senior monk or monks at a monastery.</p>
        <p align="left">anagarika: 'homeless one'. An anagarika, still technically 
          a lay person, lives in a monastery and follows the Eight Precepts.</p>
        <p align="left">anatta: 'not-self', i.e. impersonal, without individual 
          essence.</p>
        <p align="left">anicca: impermanent, transient (and by implication, ephemeral), 
          having the nature to arise and pass away.</p>
        <p align="left">arahant: an enlightened being, free from all delusion.</p>
        <p align="left">bhavana: practice, cultivation. Used in a specific way 
          (e.g., metta bhavana), or more generally (as in the bhavana which the 
          spiritual life itself entails).</p>
        <p align="left">bhikkhu: alms mendicant. In Buddhism, it is the term for 
          a monk, who lives on alms and abides by training precepts which define 
          a life of renunciation and simplicity.</p>
        <p align="left">bodhisatta: As used in the Theravada school, this refers 
          to a being destined for enlightenment, and sometimes specifically to 
          Gotama Buddha before his enlightenment.</p>
        <p align="left">bodhisattva: (Sanskrit) A term from Mahayana Buddhism, 
          referring to one who 'delays complete enlightenment' for the sake of

        <p align="left">Buddha: The Understanding One, the One who is awake, who 
          knows things as they are; a potential in every human being. The historical

        <p align="left">Chao Khun: (Thai) title of honour for a monk, which confers 
          responsibility for the Sangha of a district.</p>
        <p align="left">dana: generosity. Hence, often used to refer to an offering, 
          especially of food, to a monastic community.</p>
        <p align="left">dhamma: This word is used in several ways. It can refer 
          to the Buddha's Teaching, as contained in the scriptures; to the Ultimate 
          Truth, towards which the teaching points; and to a discrete 'moment' 
          of life, seen as it really is. (Sanskrit 'dharma'.)</p>
        <p align="left">dhutanga (Thai tudong): special strict monastic observances. 
          Dhutanga bhikkhus are noted for their diligence and impeccability. In 
          Thailand, such monks often undertake the mendicant's wandering practice 
          of the Buddha's time -- hence the phrase, 'to wander (or 'go') tudong'.</p>
        <p align="left">dukkha: 'hard to bear'; dis-ease, restlessness of mind, 
          discontent or suffering, anguish, conflict, unsatisfactoriness.</p>
        <p align="left">jhana: meditative absorption or trance.</p>
        <p align="left">kamma: action or cause (and by extension, the result or

          natural energies. (Sanskrit 'karma'.)</p>
        <p align="left">karuna: compassion.</p>
        <p align="left">khandha: 'heap'; the term the Buddha used to refer to 
          each of the five components of human psycho-physical existence.</p>
        <p align="left">koan: (Japanese) meditation riddle, often used in the 
          Zen form of Buddhism.</p>
        <p align="left">kuti: (Thai) hut; typical abode of a forest monastery 
          bhikkhu.</p>
        <p align="left">Luang Por: (Thai) difficult to translate; literally, 'Venerable 
          Father', but very much conveying a sense of affection as well as respect.</p>
        <p align="left">Mara: a being of Buddhist mythology who is the adversary 
          of the Buddha; hence, the one who tempts, deludes or destroys. Mara 
          is also the Pali word for 'death'.</p>
        <p align="left">metta: goodwill, 'loving-kindness'.</p>
        <p align="left">mudita: 'sympathetic' joy (the opposite of jealousy).</p>

          enlightenment.</p>
        <p align="left">Phra Khru: (Thai) title of honour for a monk, recognizing 
          his service as a teacher.</p>
        <p align="left">Precepts (Five/Eight/Ten): The basic codes of conduct 
          recommended by the Buddha for his followers. The Five Precepts pertain 
          to the ordinary 'household' life, and the Eight or Ten Precepts form 
          the foundation for the renunciant life (which is then further elaborated 
          in the vinaya). A list of the Precepts is given at the end of this glossary.</p>
        <p align="left">samadhi: concentration or one-pointedness of mind.</p>
        <p align="left">samana: one who has entered the Holy Life; a religious.</p>
        <p align="left">samanera (Thai samanen): The novice stage for a bhikkhu.

          of life.</p>
        <p align="left">sila: moral virtue.</p>
        <p align="left">sangha: the community of those who practise the Buddha's

        <p align="left">sati: mindfulness, recollection.</p>
        <p align="left">sukha: happiness.</p>

          into the monastic order.</p>
        <p align="left">upasampada: ceremony of entering the bhikkhu-sangha; bhikkhu 
          'ordination'.</p>
        <p align="left">upekkha: equanimity, serenity.</p>
        <p align="left">uposatha: the Buddhist 'Sabbath', a day which lay people 
          often spend at a monastery, observing the Eight Precepts. The uposatha 
          days occur according to the lunar phases.</p>
        <p align="left">vassa: the 'Rains' retreat period. As established by the 
          Buddha, it occurs during the Asian monsoon season.</p>
        <p align="left">vihara: a residence; often used as the name for a small 
          monastery.</p>
        <p align="left">vinaya: the monastic discipline, or the scriptural collection 
          of its rules and commentaries.</p>
        <p align="left">vipassana: the penetrative insight of meditation, as distinguished 
          from simple mental tranquillity.</p>
        <p align="left">wat pah: (Thai) forest monastery (typically, a place of 
          dhutanga observance).</p>
        <p align="left"></p>
        <p align="left">THE PRECEPTS</p>
        <p align="left">The Five, Eight or Ten Precepts are guidelines which encourage 
          mindfulness and selfless action. They are best understood as the proper 
          standards of behaviour for a human being, to be respected and cultivated. 
          Shortcomings with regard to the precepts do not necessarily constitute 
          sin or evil, but rather they point out where greater effort and awareness 
          are needed. The practice of the precepts is beneficial both to the one 
          who uses them and to those who encounter such a person.</p>
        <p align="left">The first five are recommended for all people:<br>
          1: Not intentionally taking the life of any living creature.<br>
          2: Not taking anything which is not given.<br>
          3: Refraining from irresponsible sexual conduct. (As part of the Eight 
          or Ten Precepts, this is observed as complete chastity, i.e. refraining 
          from any sexual behaviour.)<br>
          4: Not speaking falsely, abusively or maliciously.<br>
          5: Not taking any intoxicating drink or drug.</p>
        <p align="left">The next three are the traditional renunciations helpful 
          to those engaged in serious spiritual practice:<br>
          6: Not taking solid food after mid-day.<br>
          7: Not singing, playing music, dancing, or attending games and shows; 
          not beautifying or adorning one's body.<br>
          8: Not using a high or luxurious sleeping place.</p>
        <p align="left">To arrive at ten precepts (which form the basis of mendicancy), 
          one divides the seventh into two precepts, and then adds the following:<br>
          10: Not handling or controlling money.</p>
