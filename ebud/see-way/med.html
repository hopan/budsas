          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#800000"><b>GUIDED 
          METTA MEDITATION</b></font></p>
        <p align="left">This meditation could be used in a group, with one person 
          reading the instructions slowly and quietly. A series of dots at the 
          end of a paragraph (. . . .) indicate a brief period of silence before 
          continuing with the next instruction. It is suggested that the meditation 
          take approximately half an hour.</p>
        <p align="left">This will be a meditation on loving-kindness. It will 
          incorporate a simple visualisation using a faculty of mind that we use 
          quite routinely. For instance, if I suggest bringing to mind the image 
          of a flower, we can do that. It doesn't matter if it's a rose or a lily, 
          or what colour it is, or even how clear that mental image is something 
          fleeting is adequate.</p>
        <p align="left">Now sitting upright, notice if there's any tension in 
          the face. Relaxing around the eyes, around the jaw and mouth. Let the 
          attention come down to the heart area an area in the middle of the chest, 
          around the sternum, the breastbone. We breathe in, experiencing the 
          breath energy. It's almost as if it's possible to breathe in and out 
          from that area in the middle of the chest. Now as we breathe in, saying 
          to ourselves: MAY I BE WELL wishing ourselves well, let there be a sense 
          of well-being, a subtle gesture of mercy directed towards ourselves. 
          Let the past be; letting it go: and for this moment in time, just keep 
          letting the mind come to the breath, and the heart, and the thought, 
          in an harmonious whole. Breathing in: MAY I BE WELL. . . . . .</p>
        <p align="left">and then breathing out, directing that same merciful energy 
          outwards, saying: MAY OTHERS BE WELL.</p>
        <p align="left">Continue letting a simple rhythm develop Breathe in: MAY 
          I BE WELL, breathe out: MAY OTHERS BE WELL. . . . . .</p>
        <p align="left">If the mind has wandered off, gently, with great patience, 
          bring the attention back. It's a soft movement, coming back to the heart, 
          to the breath, to the thought breathing in: MAY I BE WELL, breathing 
          out through the heart: MAY OTHERS BE WELL. . . . . .</p>
        <p align="left">What we are doing is beginning to attune ourselves to 
          that which is loving and compassionate in the universe. Opening up to 
          that caring energy and allowing it to energise us, nourish us, using 
          the breath and the thought as a channel, as a vehicle for that energy. 
          Breathing in: MAY I BE WELL. And then channel that energy out to others: 
          MAY OTHERS BE WELL. . . . . .</p>
        <p align="left">Keeping the breath soft and steady, letting the breath 
          energy nourish us; breathing in to the heart, breathing out through 
          the heart. . . . . .</p>
        <p align="left">Opening up to that which is compassionate in the universe. 
          Breathing in, letting the heart become more sensitive and receptive 
          to that energy. Breathing out, the heart becoming more open and expansive, 
          giving out: MAY OTHERS BE WELL. . . . . .</p>
        <p align="left">And when we are ready. . . . . .</p>
        <p align="left">take a slow, deep breath into the heart, letting the thought 
          and breath energy fill us. Holding it for a while keeping it comfortable. 
          Allowing the thought to deepen that sense of well-being. Letting it 
          saturate us, permeate the body. Breathing out, slowly, quietly, back 
          out through the heart: MAY OTHERS BE WELL. Doing that a few times deep 
          breath in, hold it, and out. . . . . .</p>
        <p align="left">Now we begin to use the visualisation, working more with 
          the out-breath. On the in-breath continue as before, breathing into 
          the heart with the thought: MAY I BE WELL. And on the out-breath, we 
          first bring to mind the image of our parents it doesn't matter where 
          they are, near or far, alive or dead. Bringing them up one at a time, 
          or together whichever is easier. Seeing them a few feet in front of 
          us, and each time we breathe out bringing up that image and directing 
          our thoughts of kindness and acceptance towards them. So breathing in 
          with the thought: MAY I BE WELL. . . . . .</p>
        <p align="left">and breathing out, with the mental image of our parents. 
          As we breathe out: MAY THEY BE WELL. . . . . .</p>
        <p align="left">Next: bringing to mind our spiritual teachers, those who 
          have helped us, guided us, encouraged us, instructed us throughout our 
          life. With the out-breath, a gesture of gratitude, using the thought: 
          MAY THEY BE WELL. . . . . .</p>
        <p align="left">Bringing to mind now our family; partner, children, brothers 
          and sisters one at a time, or in a group. With the out-breath, a gesture 
          of affection: MAY THEY BE WELL. Breathing into the heart: MAY I BE WELL, 
          breathing out through the heart: MAY THEY BE WELL. . . . . .</p>
        <p align="left">Now bringing to mind a special friend or friends those 
          whom we feel would benefit from thoughts of kindness. With the out-breath, 
          bringing them into the mind and wishing them well; a subtle embrace, 
          a gesture of caring. . . . . .</p>
        <p align="left">Breathing into the heart: MAY I BE WELL. Breathing out 
          through the heart: MAY THEY BE WELL. . . . . .</p>
        <p align="left">Bringing to mind now those whom we practise with, those 
          in our immediate environment; directing our thoughts out, including 
          all of them: MAY THEY ALL BE WELL AND AT PEACE. . . . . .</p>
        <p align="left">Now bringing to mind an image of the Earth as if seen 
          from outer space. Towards that beautiful blue, white, green, brown image, 
          directing our thoughts: MAY ALL BEINGS BE WELL. Breathing out: MAY ALL 
          BEINGS BE WELL. . . . . .</p>
        <p align="left">And now bringing to mind an image of spaciousness, emptiness. 
          Into that vastness directing our thoughts: MAY ALL BEINGS BE WELL. Letting 
          the mind open up, open out; letting the heart open up, open out. The 
          body drops away no boundaries vastness spaciousness. . . . . .</p>
        <p align="left">Now carefully, in a slightly more focused way, bringing 
          our attention back to the heart, a point in the middle of the chest, 
          and breathing in slowly and deeply with the thought: MAY I BE WELL. 
          Holding it for a while.... Letting that thought spread as a sense of 
          well-being throughout the body, energising and nourishing us. With the 
          out-breath, slowly and quietly, back out through the heart. Doing that 
          once or twice deep breath in, hold it, and out. . . . . .</p>
        <p align="left">Now bringing to mind an image of someone you hurt, intentionally 
          or not, alive or dead... and using their name, saying: PLEASE FORGIVE 
          ME. . . . . </p>
        <p align="left">Calling to mind someone you hurt. . . . . .</p>
        <p align="left">using their name saying: PLEASE FORGIVE ME.</p>
        <p align="left">Paying very close attention to the heart. Keeping it open. 
          . . . . .</p>
        <p align="left">and now bringing to mind an image of someone who hurt 
          you. Using their name saying: I FORGIVE YOU. . . . . .</p>
        <p align="left">Bringing to mind someone who hurt you. Using their name 
          saying: I FORGIVE YOU.</p>
        <p align="left">Now using our own name, we say: I FORGIVE YOU. . . . . 
          .</p>
        <p align="left">Using our own name, we say: I FORGIVE YOU. . . . . .</p>
        <p align="left">and. . . . . .</p>
        <p align="left">YOU ARE FORGIVEN. . . . . .</p>
        <p align="left">YOU ARE FORGIVEN.</p>
        <p align="left">Being with those feelings of caring. Bringing them into 
          the heart; holding them gently. . . . . .</p>
        <p align="left">Now carefully coming back to the breath the breath energy 
          coming into the heart with the thought: MAY I BE WELL. Being nourished, 
          filled. And back out, out through the heart for others: MAY OTHERS BE 
          WELL.</p>
        <p align="left">So simple breathing in, being energised. Breathing out, 
          wishing others well. Breathing out for others. . . . . .</p>
