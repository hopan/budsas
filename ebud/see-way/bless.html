        <p align="left">Venerable Thanavaro (Giuseppe Proscia) was born in the 
          north-east of Italy in 1955. Having shown a keen interest in the arts 
          from an early age, he studied music, dance and drama. Conscripted into 
          the Italian army, he met a disciple of a Tibetan lama, who introduced 
          him to Buddhism. After serving his year's national service, he spent 
          a while in London studying music, and worked in a fast-food restaurant. 
          Some time later, back in Italy, he read (in a Christmas Humphreys book) 
          about Buddhist centres in England, and in a casual conversation in a 
          cafe heard about Ajahn Sumedho. Returning to England, he went to meet 
          Ajahn Sumedho at the Oakenholt Buddhist Centre near Oxford, where the 
          monks were temporarily residing.<br>
          In October 1977, he became an anagarika at the Hampstead Vihara, and 
          a samanera one year later. He received upasampada in 1979 on a boat 
          on the River Thames, his preceptor being Venerable Dr. Saddhatissa. 
          Thus he was the first Western monk training in Ajahn Chah's monasteries 
          to be ordained in England.<br>
          Venerable Thanavaro spent six years at Chithurst Monastery and Harnham 
          Vihara, before accompanying Venerable Viradhammo to New Zealand in 1985, 
          to help establish a vihara in Wellington.</p>

          The following teaching by Venerable Thanavaro has been taken from a 
          response to a question asked at a public talk in Palmerston North, New 
          Zealand, 1988. The classic Buddhist text being commented upon is known 
          as the Mahamangala Sutta -- 'The Discourse on Great Blessings' -- from 
          the Sutta Nipata.<br>

        <p align="left"> MEDITATION IS THAT WHICH ENABLES US TO BE AWARE of the 
          process of change. And this process of change is the process of life. 
          If we're not able to acknowledge this process then we resist it. We 
          act in habitual ways and lose our spontaneity. We pile up all kinds 
          of problems in our minds.</p>
        <p align="left">It would be nice if in the morning when we 
          wash our face we could give a good scrub to our mind also -- you know, 
          somehow everything that was worrying us was left behind -- we could come 
          out feeling really fresh and new! But it doesn't work like that, does 
          it?</p>
        <p align="left">However, there is a way that does cleanse the mind. It is the way 
          of bringing blessings into our life. Now do you know how to bring blessings 
          into your life? I'm sure most of us have tried to do this. Some people 
          try to bring blessings into their lives by bringing more money into 
          their pockets, but money is not necessarily always a blessing. The blessings 
          that I am talking about are blessings that come through understanding; 
          they are brought about by right motivation. Whenever we have right motivation 
          we bring blessings into our life -- we bring happiness into our life.</p>
        <p align="left">So 
          first of all -- 'to associate with good friends and not be caught up 
          with foolish people' -- that is a way of bringing blessings into our 
          life. The company of the wise is a source of blessings. Also, the way 
          we relate to those good and wise friends brings blessings. Whenever 
          our heart is humble, and we are able to give homage, that very attitude 
          is a source of blessing.</p>
        <p align="left">'To live in a good place' -- that means a place 
          which is conducive to peacefulness and calm -- is a source of blessings. 
          For example, living in the centre of New York City doesn't exactly facilitate 
          a cascade of blessings into your life.</p>
        <p align="left">'Taking care of our parents, 
          our children, our partner, and friends' is a source of blessings. 'To 
          have a skill' and 'to work with others without conflict' is a source 
          of blessings.</p>
        <p align="left">'To listen continuously' and therefore be attentive is 
          a source of blessings. Through listening and being attentive we recognise 
          the truth of what is being said -- the truth is awakened 'within' us. 
          Because the truth is 'inside' and not just 'outside', it is a source 
          of blessings. And 'discussion on the truth' -- sharing of one's experiences 
          -- is a source of blessings. This is not the sharing of gossip about 
          each other, that's not a source of blessings -- but this is a sharing 
          in the light of giving.</p>
        <p align="left">[To the audience] Do you know of any other 
          source of blessings -- anything else that brings happiness into your 
          life?</p>
        <p align="left"><i>Meditation ... contentment ... gratitude ... giving 
          ... giving of oneself....</i></p>
        <p align="left">So, yes! Meditation and the ability to clear the mind: 
          are you all familiar with this skill? If the mind is not clear then 
          it is obstructed, isn't it? And whenever the mind is obstructed we experience 
          problems. One after another they pile up. Since the mind in its true 
          nature is like empty space, we can stack all the problems in until there's 
          a nervous breakdown. That means you've had enough! A nervous breakdown 
          is a way of releasing the accumulated dirt of the mind -- all the daily 
          irritations and frustrations.</p>
        <p align="left">My teacher, Ajahn Sumedho, describes 
          meditation as a kind of 'controlled nervous breakdown'. That means that 
          you are in control, you are the master, observing this process of gradual 
          release. And all sorts of stuff will come up, you know. I won't tell 
          you some of the things that have come up in my mind.</p>
        <p align="left">In Buddhism we 
          say that before the mind is restored to its pristine awareness it is 
          obstructed by three poisons. The three poisons that continually contaminate 
          the stream of consciousness are greed or lust, aversion -- which culminates 
          in hatred -- and stupidity. And they say you can have eighty-four thousand 
          variations on this theme of greed, hatred and stupidity. So you can 
          really be creative!</p>
        <p align="left">Now you know some people are striving to transcend 
          these tendencies. Transcending these tendencies is the process of meditation 
          -- the process that liberates us. Any questions about this?</p>
