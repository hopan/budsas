        <p>Venerable Pasanno (Reed Perry) was born in La Pas, Manitoba in Canada. 
          He studied History at the University of Winnipeg. After graduating he 
          spent some time travelling in India, and from there went to Thailand.<br>
          In 1974, primarily as a means to extend his stay in Thailand, he became 
          a bhikkhu at Wat Pleng Vipassana with Phra Khru Nanasirivatana as preceptor. 
          However, he started to develop a genuine interest in monastic life, 
          and during his first year as a monk was taken by his teacher to meet 
          Ajahn Chah, with whom he asked to be allowed to stay and train.<br>
          One of the early residents of Wat Pah Nanachat, Venerable Pasanno became 
          its abbot in his seventh year. During his incumbency Wat Pah Nanachat 
          has developed considerably, both in physical size and in reputation, 
          and Venerable Pasanno has become a very well known and highly respected 
          Dhamma teacher in Thailand.</p>

          by Venerable Pasanno at Buddhamonton (Buddhamandala) near Bangkok in 
          September, 1987. It was offered during a week of formal meditation instruction 
          and practice dedicated to His Majesty King Bhumibol on the occasion

        <p align="left"> THE BUDDHA OFFERED HIS TEACHING TO THE WORLD with the 
          intention of showing a way to know Truth -- Dhamma. His life-long gesture 
          of renunciation was made so we could personally know this Truth. The 
          fact that these Teachings are still with us shows that they have been 
          put to good use by both lay and ordained people alike. It is important, 
          however, that we understand the need for personal contemplation of these 
          Teachings for their true value to arise. With such personal contemplation, 
          if it is right, we can come to sense the completeness, coolness and 
          calm that they offer.</p>
        <p align="left">As a foreigner living here in Thailand, I find life as 
          a Buddhist monk extremely beneficial. Sometimes people visiting our 
          monastery, Wat Nanachat, ask me how long I've been a monk. 'Over ten 
          years,' I tell them. 'Is it good?' they like to ask. 'If it wasn't any 
          good,' I reply, 'why would I have spent over ten years living this way? 
          I could be doing all sorts of other things.' It is because I personally 
          see the value of this Way that I live it.</p>
        <p align="left">Without clear understanding of the processes of our hearts, 
          we create all kinds of problems. We become hot and bothered and are 
          dragged about by emotional states. For there to be personal and global 
          peace, these states need to be understood: the ways of the heart need 
          to be seen clearly. This is the function and value of Dhamma.</p>
        <p align="left">In contemplating the Buddhist Way, it is important to 
          see that there is absolutely no obligation or intimidation involved. 
          Whether we take it up or not is our choice, we have complete freedom 
          in this regard -- the Buddha only offered us an introduction to the Path. 
          There is no external judge checking up on us. He pointed out that which 
          leads to true success, to liberation, peace and wisdom; and also that 
          which leads to failure and confusion. No external authority is making 
          absolute statements about what is good and bad, right and wrong, and 
          nobody is going to punish us if our preference is not to follow. However, 
          observe that there is always that within our own hearts that knows what 
          we are doing.</p>
        <p align="left">So it is important that we consider together how to actually 
          use the Buddha's Teachings and realise for ourselves their true value. 
          We have all heard many times about the Four Noble Truths and The Eightfold 
          Path. Maybe we have heard about them to the point where we take them 
          for granted; we don't think they are so important any more. But these 
          Teachings are actually referred to as 'The Heart of the Buddha's Way'. 
          Throughout the forty-five years of his teaching the Buddha never changed 
          or abandoned them.</p>
        <p align="left">Last week in our monastery I was unable to do walking 
          meditation because I had sprained my ankle. I would join the community 
          for the sitting period and then when it came time for walking I would 
          go back to my hut. I made use of the time to go over some of the chanting 
          that we do. Many times I went over the Buddha's first Discourse -- the 
          Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta -- which contains The Four Noble Truths and 
          the Eightfold Path. As a result I discovered many valuable points.</p>
        <p align="left">Let us first consider the context in which these Teachings 
          were offered. The Buddha had spent six long years striving to see for 
          himself the Truth. He had undergone an incredible amount of hardship 
          -- not like meditators these days, who make a lot of fuss if conditions 
          are not exactly how they want them. When the Perfect Enlightenment eventually 
          took place he carefully considered exactly how to go about sharing his 
          realisation. He was thirty-five years of age at the time, not old and 
          senile -- and, as he had been brought up a prince he had had the best 
          education available. He was in the prime of his life and fully capable 
          of articulating his understanding. So he wasn't going to hand out the 
          Teachings to just anybody.</p>
        <p align="left">He decided that his five companions during the time of 
          his asceticism were most suited. They were totally sincere in their 
          efforts, well experienced and intelligent. He then spent several weeks 
          walking to where they were staying. When eventually he reached them, 
          he gave the Teachings of the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. 
          So these Teachings are not common and insignificant.</p>
        <p align="left">The fact that we have heard and talked about them many 
          times means we run the risk of their becoming mere theory for us. However, 
          if we were to talk in a worldly sense about achieving something, we 
          would understand that it would of course require effort; likewise in 
          the case of the Eightfold Path. If we make the right effort then realisation 
          can take place.</p>
        <p align="left">Now let us consider what we mean by 'right effort'. The 
          Buddha gave an example of throwing a stick into a river. If that stick 
          didn't run aground on either the right bank or the left, and if it didn't 
          sink, then it would definitely reach the sea. In terms of our practice, 
          the left and right banks are the extremes of clinging to pleasure -- 
          kamasukhallikanuyogo -- and clinging to pain -- attakilamathanuyogo. Not 
          sinking means not relinquishing effort. If it wasn't for becoming caught 
          in sensuality, indulging in negativity and giving up making effort, 
          we would reach Nibbana -- Peace. This is one of the laws of nature. A 
          true appreciation and honest accordance with the Way shows us that it 
          must be like that.</p>
        <p align="left">The Eightfold Path is called the Middle Way, which means 
          our effort must be in the right amount. If our actions of body and speech 
          are not in harmony with this Way; if we are getting caught up in seeking 
          sense pleasure and really indulging in states of anger and irritability, 
          then definitely it is impossible to see things as they actually are.</p>
        <p align="left">We must constantly endeavour to make the right kind of 
          effort or we will end up like the stick, and sink. When we are feeling 
          enthusiastic we can easily give ourselves to the practice. But it can 
          also happen that at times we are totally disillusioned, even to the 
          extent that we forget completely the original confidence and faith we 
          had. But that is natural. It is like swimming a long way; we become 
          tired. We don't need to panic; simply be still for a while. Then when 
          we have regained strength, continue. Just don't sink ! Understand that 
          much: in accordance with nature, that state will change. Despair, if 
          that is what has arisen, will pass. Just keep practising. Observing 
          our minds and seeing how our attitudes are continually changing shows 
          us that impermanence is natural.</p>
        <p align="left">Understand how necessary this kind of contemplation of 
          Dhamma is in our lives. It is like nourishment to the heart. If we don't 
          have clear understanding, then it is as if something is missing. Often 
          people who visited Ajahn Chah would say they didn't have time to practise. 
          They'd say they had too many commitments. He would ask them: 'Do you 
          have enough time to breathe?' They always replied, 'Oh yes! It's natural 
          to breathe.'</p>
        <p align="left">Isn't cultivating Dhamma as important as breathing? If 
          we stop breathing then we die. If we are not established in a right 
          understanding of the Truth of the Way Things Are, then also we die; 
          we die from that which is truly good, from true ease and true meaning. 
          If we are lacking the richness of truth in our hearts, then when we 
          die and they cremate us, our lives will be worth no more than the handful 
          of ashes we produce -- and that's not much! We must investigate how to 
          live in a way that truly accords with what the Buddha taught. Surely 
          then we could live in harmony without conflicts, difficulties and problems 
          to resolve.</p>
        <p align="left">Sila (morality) is that which shows us this Middle Way. 
          It points to the avoidance of the extremes of pleasure and pain -- it 
          means knowing the right amount. When we live in the Middle Way regarding 
          action of body and speech then we don't cause offence to others; we 
          do what is appropriate for human beings. The practice of formal meditation 
          is to train our minds and hearts to stay in the Middle Way.</p>
        <p align="left">These days, many people who meditate try to force their 
          minds to be as they want them to be. They sit there arguing with their 
          thoughts; if their attention wanders they forcibly bring it back to 
          the breath. Too much forcing is not the Middle Way. The Middle Way is 
          the ease that arises naturally in the mind when there is the right effort, 
          right intention and right awareness. When practice is 'right' and there 
          is ease of mind, we can simply watch the different states that arise 
          and consider their nature. We don't need to argue with anything. Arguing 
          only causes restlessness. Whatever emotion arises is within the domain 
          of our awareness, and we simply watch. Whether it's joyful or the absolute 
          opposite, all experiences are within the boundaries of our awareness. 
          We just sit, watch, contemplate and recognise them; they will naturally 
          cease. Why do they cease? Because that is their nature. It is this realisation 
          of the true nature of change that strengthens and stills the mind. With 
          such insight (pañña) there is tranquillity (samadhi) and peace.</p>
        <p align="left">The Buddha's wisdom is knowing the right amount. It doesn't 
          mean knowing everything about everything, but knowing impermanence, 
          knowing suffering, knowing selflessness. The reason we get caught in 
          seeing things as other than they really are is our lack of wisdom. With 
          wisdom we know how to let go; to let go of craving, let go of clinging, 
          let go of beliefs. We let go of the tendency to always see things in 
          relation to a self.</p>
        <p align="left">What we call 'Me' is merely a convention; we were born 
          without names. Then somebody gave us a name and after being called it 
          for a while, we start to think that a thing called 'me and mine' actually 
          exists. Then we feel we have to spend our lives looking after it. The 
          wisdom of the Buddha knows how to let go of this 'self' and all that 
          pertains to it: possessions, attitudes, views and opinions. It means 
          letting go of the opportunity for suffering (dukkha) to arise. It means 
          giving occasion for seeing the true nature of things.</p>
        <p align="left">So cultivating the Eightfold Path develops what is 'right' 
          for human beings. Through the practice of discipline, tranquillity and 
          wisdom (sila, samadhi, pañña) we can live in harmony. Continually being 
          caught up in extreme states is the result of selfishness; of not knowing 
          the right amount; of not knowing the Middle Way. This Eightfold Path 
          is a job that we need to do. If done carefully and correctly the right 
          result will appear.</p>
        <p align="left">On reciting the Buddha's First Discourse last week I was 
          reminded of how the Eightfold Path actually takes effect. It says in 
          the sutta: Cakkhukarani, ñanakarani, upasamaya, abhiññaya, sambodhaya, 
          nibbanaya samvattati. Which means that this Path functions by opening 
          the 'Eye of Dhamma' -- cakkhukarani; 'giving rise to insight' -- ñanakarani; 
          'giving rise to peace' -- upasamaya; 'giving rise to knowing accurately' 
          -- abhiññaya; 'to knowing fully' -- sambodhaya; and to 'realising perfect 
          freedom' -- nibbanaya samvattati. This is the complete Path that the 
          Buddha teaches. It is a Path that, when cultivated, opens the eye that 
          sees the Dhamma, knows the Dhamma, and becomes the Dhamma. This is the 
          eye that sees that any condition that arises also ceases.</p>
        <p align="left">In the scriptures we read, that when the 'Eye of Dhamma' 
          is opened, when we see clearly the way things are, then we 'Enter the 
          Stream of Dhamma'. It is only this knowledge that arises from the practice 
          of the Eightfold path which causes defilements to diminish, brings peace 
          to the heart, and eventually frees us from all suffering. Therefore 
          it is of supreme importance to all of us. The Eightfold Path has this 
          function -- it is something that really works.</p>
        <p align="left">How we practise the Buddha's Teachings depends on how 
          we view them. It depends on what we consider as having value. Please 
          do try to investigate and see that your lives accord with the Buddha 
          Way.</p>
