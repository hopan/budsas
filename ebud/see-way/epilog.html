        <p align="left">DEAR FRIENDS ON THE PATH,</p>
        <p align="left">Greetings. Though I've seen many of you this summer here 
          at the Vihara or away at one of the public talks I've given, I've not 
          had the opportunity for quite a while to write a letter to you all. 
          I think it's important that occasionally we reflect upon ourselves as 
          a part of a larger community of beings all united in our inclination 
          to Nibbana, peace. The transforming effect of a virtuous community is 
          the power of Sangha. Though literally the word can mean any sort of 
          group or gathering, its usage in Buddhist practice is quite specific.</p>
        <p align="left">Sangha is one of the precious Triple Gems, one of the 
          Three Refuges to which Buddhists continually go in their skilful effort 
          to return and re-establish themselves on the Way, moment to moment. 
          I go to Buddha, I go to Dhamma, I go to Sangha.</p>
        <p align="left">What is this 'going to Sangha', Sangham saranam gacchami, 
          and what does it have to do with Nibbana? In its strictest sense, Sangha 
          refers to those beings who have had true insight and are firmly established 
          in Right View. This Ariya Sangha, or group of Noble Ones, can be made 
          up of men and women, ordained people and laity, young and old beings 
          alike. Ariya Sangha don't even have to be 'Buddhists'! Members of this 
          virtuous order are dedicated to practice: practising goodness, practising 
          straightly -- avoiding the extremes of sensory indulgence or repressive 
          self-mortification -- practising direct insight into the way things are, 
          and endeavouring to master these great efforts so that thoughts, speech, 
          and actions are conditioned by wisdom rather than ignorance.</p>
        <p align="left">The members of the Ariya Sangha have had insight into 
          the Four Noble Truths. They know the cessation of suffering, the experience 
          of true peace. Though they may still be fooled by beguiling conditions 
          of mind and body (except in the case of arahants, who are never fooled), 
          they can return to the Path, re-establishing Right View from the perspective 
          of knowing this moment as it is. They can begin again. Members of this 
          Noble Sangha can 'let go'. This is wisdom.</p>
        <p align="left">Basically, the Ariya Sangha is that group of wise beings. 
          Why then is the third refuge 'I go to the Sangha'? Because wise beings 
          are alive, flesh and blood, here and now, living examples of the Way. 
          Their earthiness and tangibility often touches our heart when Buddha-Dhamma 
          seems remote and abstract. Sangha brings the Teachings to life.</p>
        <p align="left">We need not, though, be obsessed with designating 'who 
          knows' and 'who doesn't', 'who's truly wise' and 'who isn't'. 'Will 
          the REAL Sangha members please stand up!' Even if we do hear or think 
          that he or she is attained, we still need to be able to deal with the 
          doubt arising in our own mind. 'Does he really know?'</p>
        <p align="left">More importantly, however, we need to develop that inner 
          sense of what is wholesome and what isn't, what rings true and what 
          doesn't. This discernment will tell us whether to trust someone or not. 
          We don't need to rely on some official stamp of ecclesiastic authority 
          -- 'He's a stream enterer,' 'She's fully realised,' 'He's a non-returner,' 
          etc. In fact, if we are moved by such claims, then we tend to blindly 
          follow others' opinions, and never get beyond doubt.</p>
        <p align="left">Though it's impractical to designate 'Who's Who', the 
          principal importance of a wise being remains. If we know individuals 
          who inspire us with their presence, their practice, their insight, their 
          goodness, then we should make an effort to respect them, learn from 
          them, support them. The Buddha praised the great blessing of seeking 
          out the wise rather than the foolish as companions. This is not to say 
          blindly follow them. But just beginning to sense what is wise and what 
          is not is the birth of the reflective mind. Then, to raise up that goodness 
          in our hearts through various actions, we begin to bring those Sangha 
          qualities into consciousness. After all, from a wise being we hear the 
          true teaching. From the ignorant beings in our lives (and in our own 
          minds) we hear about ME and YOU, TIME, I MUST HAVE, I MUST GET RID OF, 
          and all the other 84,000 assorted delusions of greed, hatred and self-conceit.</p>
        <p align="left">'I go for refuge to the Sangha' means I will seek out 
          a wise friend. The Buddha teaches that the wise ones are 'worthy of 
          gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of respect. 
          They give occasion for incomparable goodness to arise in the world.' 
          Sangha is a true refuge. Let's remember that.</p>
        <p align="left">Traditionally, Sangha refers to those ordained bhikkhus 
          and bhikkhunis, who are giving their lives to the practice of the Way. 
          But strictly speaking, the Noble Sangha is open to all beings who have 
          had true insight. Having a robe and a shaven head is no guarantee whatsoever 
          of wisdom and virtue. When the monastic life is lived sincerely and 
          earnestly it is conducive to developing virtue, insight and true accomplishment. 
          In fact, in any lifestyle how we practise determines whether Sangha 
          is present -- not our robe, sex, occupation, or religious title.</p>
        <p align="left">In a broader and quite practical sense, Sangha can and 
          should include all beings inclining towards peace, virtue, wisdom and 
          compassion. As opposed to the worldly stream carrying groups of beings 
          into whirlpools of passion, dogmatic views and despair, the power of 
          Sangha is that counter-current and flow of beings towards the oceanic 
          calm of kindness, compassion, joy and serenity -- metta, karuna, mudita, 
          upekkha. Good friends are so important for reminding us when we go astray, 
          for inspiring and encouraging us, empowering us to begin again.</p>
        <p align="left">These definitions of Sangha all focus on outer beings, 
          wise teachers, virtuous friends. When there is doubt, wavering, confusion 
          within, the outer manifestations of wisdom illumine the way. Friends 
          and wise beings in our lives, however, are part of this mind, our mind. 
          Our worldly habits say HE and SHE OUT THERE, but really those beings 
          are arising in our own minds, just as do our thoughts -- and the thoughts 
          of reading this letter as well. The qualities of wisdom and virtue that 
          we recognise in others are also part of this mind that we call our own. 
          Eventually we must realise that Sangha is essentially the boundless 
          virtue within.</p>
        <p align="left">Our refuge in Sangha, our contact with wise beings, keeps 
          directing our hearts to seeing the Buddha within, that in us which knows, 
          which is aware now, which is not deluded by our experience. Our contact 
          with Sangha reminds us, encourages us, in effect offers us occasions 
          conducive to using this Buddha Nature within so the Dhamma is revealed, 
          so that Truth -- How Things Are -- becomes clear in our minds. Our contact 
          with Sangha outside, as manifested in our wise friends and virtuous 
          companions, reminds us to cultivate these very same qualities unshakeably 
          within our hearts. True Sangha does not point to itself -- 'We are the 
          special ones' -- but rather it points to the virtuous heart, to that 
          skilful effort which brings us back again and again to practise the 
          Dhamma.</p>
        <p align="left">This summer I've had the good fortune to experience the 
          power of Sangha in many ways: leading retreats; participating in discussion 
          groups; attending an ordination ceremony with fellow monks and nuns, 
          and our teacher Venerable Sumedho; and learning from other spiritually-oriented 
          groups. In the most ordinary and immediate sense, I live with monks 
          and anagarikas who are dedicated to developing the Way. We are supported 
          by our many generous friends. This humbles us, for we know that as alms 
          mendicants we cannot live alone, and yet it inspires and warms our hearts 
          to receive. Those conditions then generate a new round of Sangha virtue 
          as we naturally feel motivated to make ourselves worthy of offerings, 
          to practise well, to offer what we can.</p>
        <p align="left">Sangha generates Sangha generates Sangha: swelling spheres 
          of goodness that meet and merge, leaving only joy and gratitude, the 
          sense of inner and outer melted into one mind. These moments disappear 
          when the overlapping spheres shrink down, the contracting power of identifying 
          with ME and MINE collapsing space into independent alienated bubbles 
          of being this or that. Trapped in our own private worlds, space is further 
          splintered and fragmented into a maze of jagged beings, caught in a 
          current of time, competing with one another for happiness. Life becomes 
          very complicated and anxious, as we feel compelled to protect our fragile 
          niche, or improve it, or take over someone else's. I think we have all 
          felt like that.</p>
        <p align="left">Now remember how you felt when you encountered Sangha, 
          a wise being, one who is at ease. When we hear the Truth or see it, 
          or feel its peaceful manifestation, we can relax. Faith and trust are 
          born. Suddenly, miraculously, the myriad divided beings begin to awaken 
          to the truth of this moment; and where there was separation, a unifying 
          universality begins to pervade our heart as we come together in attentiveness, 
          wise reflection, virtuous effort. The differences are still apparent, 
          but they do not divide us, for we stand together inspired by the Way 
          itself. Many times I've seen this miracle happen and then dissolve. 
          Coming together often with our dhamma friends helps to generate and 
          sustain this 'right seeing' and dissolve that habitual tendency to contract 
          our spacious heart into rigid self views.</p>
        <p align="left">Obviously, in our normal lives we will encounter many 
          not-so-wise beings within and without. Learning to cope in this world 
          with its many faces is painful and difficult, but with our refuge in 
          Sangha we learn to find joy in Right Effort, no matter who's around. 
          Then Sangha is established in our hearts, and all beings are our family, 
          giving us precious teachings. Sangham saranam gacchami takes us home 
          to the wise and virtuous one within. The virtuous ones 'without' remind 
          us of the Way, and in gratitude we honour them and remember our true 
          home: One Heart, One Knowing.</p>
        <p align="left">May all beings find a good friend.</p>
