        <p>Venerable Pabhakaro (Gordon Kappel) was born in Seattle, Washington 
          in 1948. he joined the U.S. Army in 1967 and was sent to Vietnam in 
          1969, where as a captain in the 1st Cavalry Division (Air Mobile) he 
          piloted helicopters. He came into contact with Buddhism while on rest-and-relaxation 
          (R&R) in Bangkok, where he visited several monasteries and met some 
          of the Western monks living there.<br>
          In 1970 he was sent back to the U.S., to Alabama, where he began seriously 
          studying Buddhism, lived by the eight precepts and began experimenting 
          with teaching himself meditation. Having decided he wanted to become 
          a bhikkhu, he applied for and was granted an honourable discharge from 
          the service on conscientious grounds. On returning to Thailand he became 
          a novice a Wat Bovornives, and in due course received bhikkhu ordination 
          at Wat Pah Pong in 1972.<br>
          When Ajahn Sumedho left for England in 1977, Venerable Pabhakaro took 
          over as senior monk at Wat Pah Nanachat until he himself went with Ajahn 
          Chah to Europe and the U.S. on a visit in 1979. On returning to Thailand 
          he spent an 18-month period walking on tudong and living in solitude, 
          before going back to live with Ajahn Chah, whose health was deteriorating. 
          As one of Ajahn Chah's principle nursing attendants, he took responsibility 
          for setting up a purpose-built clinic at Wat Pah Pong.<br>
          Venerable Pabhakaro went to England in 1984 and assisted with the establishment 
          of Amaravati Buddhist Centre. He is currently the senior incumbent at 
          Harnham Vihara, and was featured recently in the TVS television programme 
          'Almsbowls to Newcastle'.</p>

          what we are bowing to is the highest<br>
          human potentials -- peace, love and understanding.&quot;<br>
          <img src="line-bot.gif" width="419" height="3"> </font></b></font></p>
        <p align="left"> WHEN WE STOP TO INVESTIGATE THE TEACHINGS, we can see 
          the importance of personal responsibility: of taking responsibility 
          for what we do, what we say, and eventually for what we think. We see 
          the possibility of developing something -- of cultivating our body, speech 
          and mind. I personally felt very attracted to this way particularly 
          because there was room to doubt and question. I was very inspired by 
          the thought of not having to take anything on board just because it 
          was written down; one was being encouraged to explore through meditation 
          and self-enquiry.</p>
        <p align="left">Now I'm in the position where I have the opportunity to 
          share my experience; to teach. The way I was taught and trained was 
          to open in the present moment, to the best of one's ability, and speak 
          from the heart -- to speak from one's own experience. My intention is 
          to make an offering. Sometimes this feels comfortable and one is very 
          confident. At other times I have to question and reconsider: maybe that's 
          not what people need or what they can relate to. In such questioning 
          I always try to come back to this intention and to look with an attitude 
          of openness and honesty, asking myself: 'Where am I coming from?'</p>
        <p align="left">Honesty to me seems to be one of the most beneficial things 
          that we as human beings can develop. It is one of the Buddhist Perfections 
          -- sacca parami -- truthfulness or honesty. Whether we consider ourselves 
          spiritual or religious or not, if we aren't honest with ourselves then 
          there is a deception that we pass on to others. It may be very subtle, 
          but if we deceive ourselves, how can we not deceive others?</p>
        <p align="left">When I try to be honest I feel humble. There is a feeling 
          of meekness and sinking down with humility. Now, reflecting on these 
          words, in popular culture we sometimes say that humiliation is one of 
          the most degrading experiences we can have -- 'That was one of the most 
          humiliating experiences of my life' -- which is very negative. In one 
          sense it is the lowest of the low to be put down physically or verbally; 
          especially verbally, as something someone says can make us feel degraded 
          and belittled. Usually the feeling that comes up when this happens is 
          revenge: 'I've been made a fool of, I'll get them!' What is really happening 
          in that situation is that ego is being threatened. All our defence mechanisms 
          are triggered into a kind of red alert to defend ourselves.</p>
        <p align="left">In the religious life, however, we talk about 'developing' 
          a quality of humility, because, by taking a positive attitude towards 
          it, we can turn situations around and grow from them. Maybe you question 
          this, thinking: 'Wouldn't this make us weak and servile?' But it's not 
          to say that we have to let everybody walk all over us: that we lie prone 
          on the street and let people trample on us so we can be humiliated and 
          therefore become humble. Rather we see how we can refrain from reacting 
          or over-reacting in situations by learning to lay down our pride and 
          opinions.</p>
        <p align="left">Consider what happens if we don't react when someone verbally 
          attacks us. What they're usually looking for is some sort of reaction 
          that they can feed on. It's like practising tennis and hitting a ball 
          against a wall; you can do it because there's a reaction. If someone 
          throws verbal abuse at us and we don't react with aversion, aggression, 
          or anything, but just absorb it, then it deflates and fizzles out. When 
          this happens in our daily-life situations, try to see how we can move 
          towards not-reacting by just being able to absorb.</p>
        <p align="left">I try to practise this when I travel, although it's not 
          usually verbal abuse that I receive -- even though people can sometimes 
          yell something once you've passed by. It's a more subtle physical reaction 
          that one feels, an aggressive energy that you sense when people walk 
          by. When this happens, my instinctive reaction is to meet it with aggression, 
          but what I try to practise is simply absorbing that aggressiveness. 
          It's incredible what this different attitude does to one's physical 
          and mental state. It changes from a tightening of the abdomen with clenched 
          fists ready for defence, to a softening and absorbing reception. So 
          this is a way of learning to use these situations and energies skilfully. 
          It results in a feeling of humility.</p>
        <p align="left">Most of my life I've been amongst the biggest and the 
          strongest, having to live up to an image of being six foot three and 
          weighing 200 pounds, so there's never been the problem like the wee 
          lads had of always trying to prove themselves. Softening that image 
          felt very foreign, especially when everything inside me was saying: 
          "Puff out your chest, bulge out your arms and be a man." But whether 
          we're large, middling or small, practising like this is difficult.</p>
        <p align="left">This is why I find the religious form a very beautiful 
          thing to have. It gives one a skilful means to work with. We have devotional 
          practices like bowing and chanting. Of these, one of the most difficult 
          is bowing. No matter what we bow towards, it doesn't come naturally 
          for us; there's a great deal of resistance to doing it. A lot of it 
          comes from our conditioning about bowing to idols. But really, what 
          is it that doesn't want to bow?</p>
        <p align="left">In my own practice I recognised quite early on this resistance 
          to bowing. I was fortunate in meeting Venerable Ajahn Chah, a man whom 
          I considered to be a genuine Master. It was quite easy to humble myself 
          and bow at his feet. Not because he said: 'Bow at my feet,' but because 
          that was the form and I wanted to do it. It was so nice to take this 
          large frame and prostrate it on the ground instead of standing tall, 
          thinking: 'Hey! look at me; ain't I tough. Big Mean ME.' I felt a softening 
          take place, and putting it on the ground brought a great joy into my 
          heart.</p>
        <p align="left">Those not familiar with our way may find it difficult 
          to understand. In Western culture we tend to form strong opinions, often 
          judging immediately by the appearance of things. Visitors come to the 
          monastery and see those who have been around for a number of years bowing 
          and acting in a humble way, and may think that we systematically brain-wash 
          people and are out to boost our egos. It might look like we have whipped 
          and beaten them into doing these things and they appear to be servile. 
          To be honest, when people actually bow to me -- as is the Thai custom 
          -- it brings up a feeling of wanting to lower myself in a similar way, 
          so I bow in return with my heart. It's like the hand gesture of anjali 
          (bringing one's palms together) which comes from the Indian tradition 
          and means Namaste: 'I revere the Highest or Divinity within you.' Here 
          in the West, especially America, you hold out your hand and give the 
          other guy's paw a big squeeze: 'How are ya! Glad to meet ya!' Now I 
          find anjali a nicer gesture.</p>
        <p align="left">A number of years ago we had an English Tibetan nun staying 
          with us at Ajahn Chah's home monastery in Thailand. One evening Ajahn 
          Chah went over to the nuns' community to offer a teaching. He asked 
          me to come along in order to do the translating for her benefit. After 
          he had finished talking and I had translated, we stayed on for a while 
          answering questions.</p>
        <p align="left">Earlier in the day, Ajahn Chah had observed the nun as 
          she was circumambulating the main Uposatha Hall doing full-length Tibetan-style 
          prostrations. He now asked her if she would demonstrate it for us and 
          the other nuns. After agreeing, she stood up, requesting plenty of room, 
          and explained each action as she went along. She showed how the hand 
          gesture meant an offering of first one's body, then speech, and finally 
          one's mind. Continuing, she moved her arms out to the side and over 
          the head in a wide sweeping motion, symbolising the inclusion of all 
          sentient beings in the act. Once she was completely prone on the floor, 
          the arms and hands did a sweeping motion one more time, with the hands 
          finishing over the back of the head directed skywards in anjali. As 
          she lay prone for the second time and her hands came over the head in 
          the final gesture, Ajahn Chah pointed and exclaimed: 'That is surrender!' 
          I'll never forget that. He was emphasising the beauty in the physical 
          gesture of 'I give up. I surrender.' If seen with proper understanding, 
          it's the most humble bodily expression of human devotion. Even the most 
          proud and ego-centred person cannot deny that.</p>
        <p align="left">So in the monastery I can be a stickler for training the 
          new monks in proper bowing, and have been known on occasions to give 
          people a hard time for not doing it correctly. We train in it because 
          it's a way of stopping: taking time to collect and compose ourselves, 
          learning to put our hearts into it. Ultimately what we are bowing to 
          is not a golden image but that which it symbolises -- the highest human 
          potentials of peace, love and understanding.</p>
        <p align="left">Each night before I bed down I bow six times and again 
          first thing on arising. It doesn't matter where I am, I still do it. 
          When I stay in people's houses I still bow, which is always an interesting 
          reflection if the room they offer me has posters on the walls of celebrities 
          like Boy George. Whether there is an image of the Buddha or not makes 
          little difference if we are humbling ourselves to the Highest Quality 
          within. This is something that each of us can work on.</p>
        <p align="left">Whether we wish to use these forms and traditions or not 
          is our own choice. They are here for our benefit to be used skilfully. 
          When I notice people not bowing I don't get upset, I just feel a bit 
          of sadness. When I see you doing it this brings a good feeling to my 
          heart. I know how difficult it is, but because you are willing to work 
          with it, it's very uplifting. This is what makes the struggle of cultivating 
          humility worth our effort.</p>
