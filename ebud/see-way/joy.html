        <p>Venerable Tiradhammo (Ian Adams) was born in New Westminster, British 
          Columbia, in 1949. He spent some time at university, but left to undertake 
          a long overland trip in the Middle East, which culminated in a cycle 
          ride from Pakistan to Sri Lanka. He stayed for a fortnight at the Island 
          Hermitage in Sri Lanka, and spent a further month practising meditation 
          at Kanduboda Meditation Centre with Bhikkhu Sivoli.<br>
          Back in Canada, he completed his university studies, after which he 
          returned to India and later went on to Thailand, where he became a novice 
          in 1973. He took upasampada one year later at Wat Meung Man in Chiang 
          Mai with Venerable Tong.<br>
          In 1975 he moved, in order to be with Ajahn Chah, staying at Wat Pah 
          Pong and Wat Pah Nanachat. He went on several tudong journeys through 
          the north-east of Thailand and the mountains of Chiang Mai, visiting 
          many famous forest meditation masters.<br>
          Venerable Tiradhammo was invited to England in 1982 to help with developments 
          there. He spent two years at Chithurst Monastery, and three years in 
          charge of Harnham Vihara in Northumberland. He is presently the senior 
          incumbent of a newly opened vihara near Bern, Switzerland, and is engaged 
          in writing a book on Vinaya, the monastic code of conduct.</p>

          The following teaching has been adapted from a talk given by Venerable 
          Tiradhammo on the seventh day of a ten-day retreat in Switzerland, in 
          May 1988. The 'Seven Factors of Enlightenment' referred to in the talk 
          are mindfulness, investigation, energy, joy, relaxation, concentration 
          and equanimity.<br>

          </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#800000">&quot;When 
          there is joy,<br>
          we are ready to discover new things....<br>
          If we have already decided 'Life is suffering,'<br>
          then we won't look any 
          further.&quot;<br>
          <img src="line-bot.gif" width="419" height="3"> </font></b></font></p>
        <p align="left"> WE CAN SOMETIMES MAKE THE MISTAKE in practice of thinking 
          that the religious life means some sort of self-flagellation. Or, we 
          tend to believe that spiritual practice should result in some special 
          kind of purity. With this idea we look at ourselves and, of course, 
          all we see is impurity; having developed a concept of enlightenment, 
          we examine our own minds and see just the opposite -- confusion and conflict.</p>
        <p align="left">But the point is, these ideas we have about practice are 
          just ideas. Thinking: 'I'm here and Nibbana is over there; I'm just 
          a confused idiot and Nibbana is all purity and profundity,' is merely 
          projecting onto concepts. When it comes down to real practice, enlightenment 
          means actually being aware of confusion itself. Wisdom is that which 
          is aware of ignorance. It's not a matter of knowing our wisdom, but 
          of using wisdom to know ignorance!</p>
        <p align="left">The whole practice of mindfulness is about realising the 
          true nature of this being right here. We're not trying to plug into 
          some kind of 'Nibbanic Wisdom' that's floating around in space or waiting 
          for wisdom to fall into our laps. We are being aware of the nature of 
          the human condition as it is. Once we really understand life as it is, 
          then we can begin to transcend it. If we try to transcend it before 
          we actually know it, we're merely caught up in illusion.</p>
        <p align="left">Ajahn Chah used to say: 'First we have to pick things 
          up before we can realise how heavy they are.' When we see how heavy 
          they are, then that's seeing 'dukkha'. Having seen dukkha, we let go. 
          When we've let go of things then we realise how light it actually is. 
          'Ah! What a relief.' And this is where joy comes in -- or piti as it's 
          called in the 'Factors of Enlightenment'.</p>
        <p align="left">There are various translations of this term piti. As there 
          are various kinds of joy. We were talking yesterday about how, having 
          been motivated by dukkha to seek the 'Way', we arrive at trust -- and 
          this trust in turn conditions joy.</p>
        <p align="left">So we have these various kinds of joy arising in practice 
          from different causes, and, personally I've found reflecting upon them 
          very useful. The point of joy and its function often seems to be missed 
          when talking about spiritual training.</p>
        <p align="left">Now piti is not just the pleasure of having a good time. 
          But it's the kind of experience that leads to opening up to life -- to 
          awakening. When there is joy, we are ready to discover new things. On 
          the other hand, if we have already decided, 'life is suffering' and 
          judged it as 'miserable', then we won't look any further.</p>
        <p align="left">Consider children: notice how they observe and want to 
          find out -- the fascination they have about things. Sadly, as adults, 
          we've become too sophisticated to go around looking into flowers and 
          little things. We function on a much more conceptual level. When we 
          see a flower we think 'flower'. And then, 'Yes, I know all about flowers. 
          I've seen flowers all my life and this is just another flower.' Actually, 
          each flower is a unique flower: it is here, at this moment, this time, 
          this place, this flower.</p>
        <p align="left">If we can truly listen, for instance, to a bird singing; 
          there is just sound. And that's quite different from thinking, 'Oh, 
          another bird singing.' If we really listen, there is simply sound happening 
          right in this moment, in this place, in this situation; and there is 
          a knowing of that -- there's hearing. And that's a completely different 
          reality from thinking 'bird singing'.</p>
        <p align="left">If we are always falling back into concepts, then the 
          internal dialogue goes chattering on: 'Bird singing. Flower over there. 
          This person talking. I wish they'd be quiet. Candle burning...' and 
          so on. And we think we know all about life! We continually juggle these 
          concepts around in our heads and all they ever do is move from one side 
          of the brain to the other -- out of the memory to be verbalised, then 
          back again. If we live with only concepts of life, it can get pretty 
          boring -- it's the same old words -- 'flower, bird, tree'.</p>
        <p align="left">While it's natural that we learn and understand through 
          language, and express our understanding through language, many of us 
          have become prisoners of language. With meditation we have the opportunity 
          now to bring about a profound change in our Western civilisation. We 
          are trying to understand on a 'non-conceptual' level. In meditation 
          we are realising the nature of experience directly.</p>
        <p align="left">People who are completely identified with words may find 
          this threatening, but we're not talking about by-passing words altogether; 
          we still have to express ourselves; we still need to communicate. But 
          we should recognise that the words we use in communication are not the 
          same as the experience we are attempting to convey.</p>
        <p align="left">Such little space is given in our society to silence. 
          Words have become so loud and so powerful these days that sometimes 
          that is all we hear. But it is the very space of silence that gives 
          us access to, and nurtures, another way of relating. How wonderful to 
          be like a child again and not be limited by words!</p>
        <p align="left">In the beginning, children don't have a word for a flower. 
          'What is this?' they enquire. And we tell them: 'It's a flower.' So 
          okay, they have to learn to communicate, but maybe we should try saying, 
          'Well, it's called a flower, but that's not what it really is. It has 
          it's own perfect nature which is just-the-way-it-is.' To know this 'just-the-way-it-is' 
          is to know joy. And knowing joy means we can bring back to life many 
          of those beautiful qualities that have become drained out of us. We 
          have a secret key now that will help free us from our habits.</p>
        <p align="left">The quality of joy can also be developed further. Beyond 
          piti or spiritual joy there is a much more stable quality known as sukha. 
          Generally, this term sukha is translated merely as happiness -- the opposite 
          of dukkha -- but that's not enough. Momentary happiness in like a butterfly 
          that flitters around. It's certainly OK, but it's not the profound quality 
          of well-being that is meant by sukha. Through having lived so much in 
          concepts, our life has become boring, and fleeting excitement has come 
          to appear as important to us.</p>
        <p align="left">Sukha, on the other hand, means: 'Everything is just fine.' 
          It's a sense of calm and well-being which pervades our whole body and 
          mind. It makes the mind peaceful and collected, providing a firm foundation 
          for samadhi -- concentration.</p>
        <p align="left">But coming back to joy: joy is spontaneous. You can't 
          preconceive it. You can't make it. It just arises in the moment. When 
          there is true joy, you are in the moment. And joy in this way becomes 
          a valuable reference point for us: if there is true joy, then we know 
          we're in the moment, and if we are really in the moment, then there 
          is true joy.</p>
        <p align="left">So try to discover where joy comes from. See what supports 
          it and what causes it to pass away. When we are doing this, we are beginning 
          to cultivate joy as one of the 'Factors of Enlightenment'.</p>
        <p align="left">It becomes one of the qualities that leads us to awakening.</p>
