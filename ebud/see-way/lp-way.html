        <p align="left">Venerable Jayasaro (Shaun Chiverton) was born on the Isle 
          of Wight, England, in 1958. At school he excelled academically, but 
          a spell of three weeks in Morocco with the Venture Scouts when he was 
          14 had whetted his appetite for travel, and when he left school he decided 
          to go overland by bus to India.<br>
          For the next 18 months he travelled extensively throughout India, acquiring 
          an interest in Eastern religion and meditation practice along the way. 
          Hitch-hiking back in 1977, he spent three months in Iran teaching English. 
          Declining the offer of a place at Sussex University, he went to work 
          for his father who was an engineer.<br>
          During the following year he started visiting the Hampstead Vihara, 
          and in 1978 he became an anagarika, spending the vassa with Ajahn Sumedho 
          at Oakenholt, near Oxford. He then went to Thailand with the intention 
          of becoming a bhikkhu, and he received upasampada from Ajahn Chah in 
          1980. Currently he lives at Wat Pah Nanachat, where he assists with 
          the training of monks. In 1988, he accompanied Tan Chao Khun Paññananda 
          on a visit to England.</p>

          Khun Pannananda also to spend time with his family. The following reflections

        <p align="left"> MY OWN FIRST MEETING WITH AJAHN CHAH was on the full 
          moon of December 1978. I had spent the 'Rains' retreat of that year 
          as an eight-precept lay person with Ajahn Sumedho at Oakenholt here 
          in England. After the retreat I went out to Thailand. When I arrived 
          at Wat Pah Pong, Venerable Pamutto, an Australian monk resident there 
          at the time, took me to see Ajahn Chah. He was sitting under his kuti 
          having a drink. He looked at me and smiled very warmly. He held out 
          the drink he had in his hand so I crawled over and took it. As I returned 
          to my place I found there were tears welling up in my eyes. I was emotionally 
          overcome for quite a while. Since that day I don't think I have ever 
          wanted to leave the monastery or do anything except be a disciple of 
          Ajahn Chah.</p>
        <p align="left">People often presumed there would be a problem with language 
          for Westerners who wanted to stay at the monastery, but this was not 
          the case. Someone once asked Ajahn Chah: 'Luang Por, how do you teach 
          all your Western disciples? Do you speak English or French? Do you speak 
          Japanese or German?'</p>
        <p align="left">'No,' replied Ajahn Chah.<br>
          'Then how do they all manage?' he asked.<br>
          'Householder,' Ajahn Chah enquired, 'at your home do you have water-buffaloes?' 
          'Yes Luang Por,' was the reply.<br>
          'Do you have any cows, or dogs, or chickens?' 'Yes Luang Por.'<br>
          'Tell me,' Luang Por asked,' do you speak water-buffalo; do you speak 
          cow?' 'No,' the householder replied.<br>
          'Well, how do they all manage?'</p>
        <p align="left">Language was 
          not so important to Luang Por. He knew how to see through the exterior 
          trappings of language and culture. He could see how basically all minds 
          revolve around the same old centres of greed, hatred and delusion. His 
          method of training was one of pointing directly at the way our minds 
          work. He was always showing us how craving gives rise to suffering actually 
          allowing us to see directly the Four Noble Truths. And for him, the 
          way of exposing desires was to frustrate them. In his vocabulary, the 
          words 'to teach' and 'to torment' were more or less interchangeable.</p>
        <p align="left">Such 
          training as this can only take place if everyone in the monastery has 
          great confidence in the teacher. If there is the slightest suspicion 
          that he might be doing it out of aversion, or desire for power, then 
          there wouldn't be any benefit. In Ajahn Chah's case everyone could see 
          that he had the greatest courage and fortitude and so could trust that 
          he was doing it out of compassion.</p>
        <p align="left">Primarily he would teach about letting 
          go. But he also taught a lot about what to do when we can't let go. 
          'W e endure,' he would say. Usually people could appreciate intellectually 
          all about letting go, but when faced with obstacles they couldn't do 
          it. The teaching of patient endurance was a central aspect of the way 
          that he taught. He continually changed routines around in the monastery 
          so you wouldn't become stuck in ruts. As a result you kept finding yourself 
          not quite knowing where you stood. And he would always be there watching 
          so you couldn't be too heedless. This is one of the great values of 
          living with a teacher; one feels the need to be mindful.</p>
        <p align="left">In looking 
          into Ajahn Chah's early life it was inspiring for me to find just how 
          many problems he had. Biographies of some great masters leave you with 
          the impression that the monks were perfectly pure from the age of eight 
          or nine that they didn't have to work at their practice. But for Ajahn 
          Chah practice was very difficult; for one thing he had a lot of sensual 
          desire. He also had a great deal of desire for beautiful requisites 
          bowl and robes, etc. He made a resolution in working with these tendencies 
          that he would never ask for anything even if it was permitted to do 
          so by the Discipline. He related once how his robes had been falling 
          to bits; his under-robe was worn paper-thin so he had to walk very carefully, 
          lest it split. Then one day he heedlessly squatted down and it tore 
          completely. He didn't have any cloth to patch it but remembered the 
          foot-wiping cloths in the Meeting Hall. So he took them away, washed 
          them and patched his robe with them.</p>
        <p align="left">In later times when he had disciples, 
          he excelled in skilful means for helping them; he had had so many problems 
          himself. In another story, he related how he made a resolution to really 
          work with sensual desire. He resolved that for the three-month 'Rains' 
          retreat he would not look at a woman. Being very strong-willed, he was 
          able to keep to it. On the last day of the retreat many people came 
          to the monastery to make offerings. He thought: 'I've done it now for 
          three months, let's see what happens.' He looked up and at that moment 
          there was a young woman right in front of him. He said the impact was 
          like being hit by lightning. It was then that he realised mere sense 
          restraint, although essential, was not enough. No matter how restrained 
          one may be regarding the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind, if 
          there wasn't wisdom to understand the actual nature of desire, then 
          freedom from it was impossible.</p>
        <p align="left">He was always stressing the importance of wisdom: not 
          just restraint, but mindfulness and contemplation. Throwing oneself 
          into practice with great gusto and little reflective ability may result 
          in a strong concentration practice but eventually end up in despair. 
          Monks practising like this usually come to a point where they decide 
          that they don't have what it takes to 'break through' in this lifetime, 
          and disrobe. He emphasised that continuous effort was much more important 
          than making a great effort for a short while only to let it all slide. 
          Day in, day out; month in, month out; year, in year out: that is the 
          real skill of the practice.</p>
        <p align="left">What is needed in mindfulness practice, he taught, is 
          a constant awareness of what one is thinking, doing or saying. It is 
          not a matter of being on retreat or off retreat, or of being in a monastery 
          or out wandering on tudong ; it's a matter of constancy.' What am I 
          doing now; why am I doing it?' constantly looking to see what is happening 
          in the present moment. 'Is this mind-state coarse or refined?' In the 
          beginning of practice, he said, our mindfulness is intermittent like 
          water dripping from a tap. But as we continue, the intervals between 
          the drips lessen and eventually they become a stream. This stream of 
          mindfulness is what we are aiming for.</p>
        <p align="left">It was noticeable that he did not talk a lot about levels of enlightenment 
          or various states of concentration absorption (jhana). He was aware 
          of how people tend to attach to these terms and conceive of practice 
          as going from this stage to that. Once someone asked him if such and 
          such a person was an arahant was enlightened. He answered: 'If they 
          are then they are, if they're not then they're not; you are what you 
          are, and you're not like them. So just do your own practice.' He was 
          very short with such questions.</p>
        <p align="left">When people asked him about his own 
          attainments, he never spoke praising himself or making any claim whatsoever. 
          When talking about the foolishness of people, he wouldn't say:' You 
          think like this and you think like that,' or' You do this and you do 
          that.' Rather, he would always say:' W e do this and we do that.' The 
          skill of speaking in such a personal manner meant those listening regularly 
          came away feeling that he was talking directly to them. Also, it often 
          happened that people would come with personal problems they wanted to 
          discuss with him, and that very same evening he would give a talk covering 
          exactly that subject.</p>
        <p align="left">In setting up his monasteries, he took a lot 
          of his ideas from the great meditation teacher Venerable Ajahn Mun, 
          but also from other places he encountered during his years of wandering. 
          Always he laid great emphasis on a sense of community. In one section 
          of the Mahaparinibbana Sutta ('Dialogues of the Buddha,' sutta 16) the 
          Buddha speaks about the welfare of the Sangha being dependent on meeting 
          frequently in large numbers, in harmony, and on discussing things together. 
          Ajahn Chah stressed this a lot.</p>
        <p align="left">The Bhikkhu-Discipline Vinaya was to 
          Ajahn Chah a very important tool for training. He had found it so in 
          his own practice. Often he would give talks on it until one or two o'clock 
          in the morning; the bell would then ring at three for morning chanting. 
          Monks were sometimes afraid to go back to their kutis lest they couldn't 
          wake up, so they would just lean against a tree.</p>
        <p align="left">Especially in the 
          early days of his teaching things were very difficult. Even basic requisites 
          like lanterns and torches were rare. In those days the forest was dark 
          and thick with many wild and dangerous animals. Late at night you could 
          hear the monks going back to their huts making a loud noise, stomping 
          and chanting at the same time. On one occasion, twenty torches were 
          given to the monastery. But as soon as the batteries ran out, they all 
          came back into the stores as there weren't new batteries to replace 
          them.</p>
        <p align="left">Sometimes Ajahn Chah was very harsh on those who lived with him. 
          He admitted himself that he had an advantage over his disciples. He 
          said that when his mind entered samadhi (concentration) for only thirty 
          minutes it could be the same as having slept all night. Sometimes he 
          talked for literally hours. Going over and over the same things again 
          and again, telling the same story hundreds of times. For him, each time 
          was as if the first. He would be sitting there giggling and chuckling 
          away and everybody else would be looking at the clock and wondering 
          when he would let them go back.</p>
        <p align="left">It seemed that he had a special soft spot for those who 
          suffered a lot; this often meant the Western monks. There was one English 
          monk, Venerable Thitappo, whom he gave a lot of attention to; that means 
          he tormented him terribly. One day there was a large gathering of visitors 
          to the monastery and, as often happened, Ajahn Chah was praising the 
          Western monks to the Thais as a way of teaching them. He was saying 
          how clever the Westerners were, all the things they could do and what 
          good disciples they were. 'All,' he said 'except this one,' pointing 
          to Venerable Thitappo. 'He's really stupid.' Another day he asked Venerable 
          Thitappo: 'Do you get angry when I treat you like this?' Venerable Thitappo 
          replied: 'What use would it be? It would be like getting angry at a 
          mountain.'</p>
        <p align="left">Several times people suggested 
          to Ajahn Chah that he was like a Zen Master. 'No I'm not,' he would 
          say, 'I'm like Ajahn Chah.' There was a Korean monk visiting once who 
          liked to ask him koans. Ajahn Chah was completely baffled; he thought 
          they were jokes. You could see how it was necessary to know the rules 
          of the game before you could give the right answers. One day this monk 
          told Ajahn Chah the Zen story about the flag and the wind and asked: 
          'Is it the flag that blows or is it the wind?' Ajahn Chah answered: 
          'It's neither; it's the mind'. The Korean monk thought that was wonderful 
          and immediately bowed to Ajahn Chah. But then Ajahn Chah said he'd just 
          read the story in the Thai translation of Hui Neng.</p>
        <p align="left">Many of us tend to confuse profundity with complexity, 
          so Ajahn Chah liked to show how profundity was in fact simplicity. The 
          truth of impermanence is the most simple thing in the world, and yet 
          it is the most profound. He really emphasised that. He said the key 
          to living in the world with wisdom is a regular recollection of the 
          changing nature of things. 'Nothing is sure,' he would constantly remind 
          us. He was always using this word in Thai 'Mai-naa!' meaning 'uncertain'. 
          This teaching: 'It's not certain,' he said, sums up all the wisdom of 
          Buddhism. In meditation, he emphasised, 'We can't go beyond the hindrances 
          unless we really understand them.' This means knowing their impermanence.</p>
        <p align="left">Often he talked about 'killing 
          the defilements', and this also meant 'seeing their impermanence'. 'Killing 
          defilements' is an idiomatic expression in the meditative Forest Tradition 
          of North East Thailand. It means that by seeing with penetrative clarity 
          the actual nature of defilements, you go beyond them.</p>
        <p align="left">Whilst it was 
          considered the 'job' of a bhikkhu in this tradition to be dedicated 
          to formal practice, it didn't mean there wasn't work to do. When work 
          needed doing you did it. And you didn't make a fuss. Work is not any 
          different from formal practice if one knows the principles properly. 
          The same principles apply in both cases, as it's the same body and mind. 
          </p>
        <p align="left">And in Ajahn Chah's monasteries, when the monks worked, they really 
          worked. One time he wanted a road built up to W at Tum Saeng Pet mountain 
          monastery, and the Highways Department offered to help. But before long 
          they pulled out. So Ajahn Chah took the monks up there to do it. Everybody 
          worked from three o'clock in the afternoon until three o'clock the next 
          morning.</p>
        <p align="left">A rest was allowed until just after five when they would head 
          off down the hill to the village on alm sround. After the meal they 
          could rest again until three, before starting work once more. But nobody 
          saw Ajahn Chah take a rest; he was busy receiving people who came to 
          visit. And when it was time to work, he didn't just direct it. He joined 
          in the heavy lifting and carrying of rocks alongside everyone else. 
          That was always very inspiring for the monks to see: hauling water from 
          the well, sweeping and so on, he was always there right up until the 
          time his health began to fail.</p>
        <p align="left">Ajahn Chah wasn't always popular in 
          his province in North East Thailand, even though he did bring about 
          many major changes in the lives of the people. There was a great deal 
          of animism and superstition in their belief systems. Very few people 
          practised meditation, out of fear that it would drive them crazy. There 
          was more interest in magical powers and psychic phenomena than in Buddhism. 
          A lot of killing of animals was done in the pursuit of merit. Ajahn 
          Chah was often very outspoken on such issues, so at first he had many 
          enemies.</p>
        <p align="left">Nevertheless, there were always many who loved him. And it 
          was clear that he never played on that. In fact, if any of his disciples 
          were getting too close, he would send them away. Sometimes monks became 
          attached to him, and he promptly sent them off to some other monastery. 
          As charismatic as he was, he always stressed the importance of Sangha, 
          of community spirit.</p>
        <p align="left">One New Year's Eve I remember how, in accordance 
          with custom, a vast number of people had come to the monastery. After 
          the evening chanting Ajahn Chah gave a talk, and this was followed by 
          meditation. Just before midnight someone came in and announced that 
          a senior monk from the village monastery had arrived. I remember how 
          Ajahn Chah went out and received the monk himself: came in carrying 
          his bag and proceeded to lay out his sitting-cloth. He then made the 
          three most beautiful bows of respect that I have ever seen. In every 
          way he displayed heartfelt humility: as if he were a monk just newly 
          ordained. In the middle of many hundreds of his disciples it was as 
          though he were completely immune to all the unskilful feelings that 
          many of us may have felt.</p>
        <p align="left">I think it was because Ajahn Chah was 'nobody 
          in particular' that he could be anybody he chose. If he felt it was 
          necessary to be fierce, he could be that. If he felt that somebody would 
          benefit from warmth and kindness, then he would give that. You had the 
          feeling he would be whatever was helpful for the person he was with. 
          And he was very clear about the proper understanding of conventions. 
          Someone once asked him about the relative merits of arahants and bodhisattvas. 
          He answered: 'Don't be an arahant, don't be a bodhisattva, don't be 
          anything at all. If you are an arahant you will suffer, if you are bodhisattva 
          you will suffer, if you are anything at all you will suffer.' I had 
          the feeling that Ajahn Chah wasn't anything at all. The quality in him 
          that one was inspired by was the light of Dhamma he reflected; it wasn't 
          exactly him as a person.</p>
        <p align="left">So since first meeting Ajahn Chah, I have 
          had an unshakeable conviction that this way is truly possible it works 
          it is good enough. And I've found a willingness to acknowledge that, 
          if there are any problems, it's me who is creating them. It's not the 
          form and it's not the teachings. This appreciation has made things a 
          lot easier.</p>
        <p align="left">It's important that we are able to learn from all the ups 
          and downs we have in practice. It's important that we come to know how 
          to be 'a refuge unto ourselves' to see clearly for ourselves. When I 
          consider the morass of selfishness and foolishness my life could have 
          been.... And then reflecting on the teachings and benefits I've received, 
          I find I really want to dedicate my life to being a credit to my teacher. 
          Such reflection has been a great source of strength. This is one form 
          of sanghanusati 'Recollection on Sangha' recollection of the great debt 
          we owe our teachers.</p>
        <p align="left">So I trust that you may find this is of some help 
          in your practice.</p>
