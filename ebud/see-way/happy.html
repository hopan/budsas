        <p>Venerable Jagaro (John Cianciosi) was born in Southern Italy in 1948. 
          When he was 10 years old his family emigrated to Australia. He studied 
          chemistry at the Melbourne Institute of Technology, but later, while 
          working as a research chemist, he felt the need to broaden his horizons. 
          So, like many young Australians, he set off travelling -- through Bali, 
          Indonesia and Malaysia, and ending up in Thailand, where he encountered 
          Buddhism. He decided to become a monk and received bhikkhu ordination, 
          aged 24, under Venerable Phra Khru Nanasirivatana, at Wat Pleng Vipassana, 
          in 1972.<br>
          In 1973 he moved to Wat Pah Pong to train under Ajahn Chah. In due course, 
          he succeeded Venerable Pabhakaro as senior incumbent of Wat Pah Nanachat. 
          At the invitation of the Buddhist Society of Western Australia, he went 
          to Perth in 1982 with Venerable Puriso to start a monastery there. Initially, 
          the monks lived in a house in the suburbs of Perth while a more rural 
          setting was sought, and eventually a 97-acre site south of the city 
          was purchased.<br>
          Venerable Jagaro, assisted by Venerable Brahmavamso, has since guided 
          the development of the Bodhinyana Forest Monastery, the monks doing 
          much of the construction of the buildings themselves. The monastic community 
          has since grown to ten. A wide range of teaching activities are conducted 
          at the new monastery and at the thriving Dhammaloka Buddhist Centre 
          in Perth. Venerable Jagaro continues to visit Thailand frequently, where 
          he is well known and respected as a teacher of Dhamma.</p>

        <p align="left"> HAPPINESS IS SOMETHING CLOSE TO THE HEART of everybody. 
          We all want to be happy. Happiness in the normal sense means that you 
          always get what you want, when and how you want it. This is very difficult, 
          because so many things are beyond our control: the weather, one's appearance, 
          health, relationships, one's meditation so many things we cannot control. 
          One's striving for worldly happiness seems constantly hindered. Where 
          is this happiness? How can we possibly be happy when everything is in 
          this state of uncertainty and constant change? We may spend all our 
          lives seeking it and finding disappointment. If you are a fortunate 
          person with good conditioning and positive states of mind, you may be 
          happy most of the time. However , there is always the opposite when 
          things are not as you want them to be, when the mind doesn't do what 
          you want it to do, when people are not as you want them to be and naturally 
          the opposite emotions and feelings which we call unhappiness will arise. 
          Unhappiness has to be there so long as there is happiness.</p>
        <p align="left">It is like Nasrudin, the wise man who acted like a fool; 
          or maybe he was a fool who acted like a wise man. He was sitting with 
          this big bag of little red chillies very hot! Tears were streaming down 
          his face and he was panting and crying and eating chillies. An old friend 
          came by and asked, 'Nasrudin, what are you doing there eating all those 
          really hot chillies?' Nasrudin, between gasps for air and wiping away 
          his tears and blowing his nose, managed to say, 'I'm looking for the 
          sweet one.'</p>
        <p align="left">And so we continually look for the sweet one, continually 
          seek happiness in the conditioned, and we haven't found a sweet one 
          yet. Even when you are getting what you want maybe you can be 90% happy, 
          but still there is that at the back of the mind that is a little bit 
          concerned, a little bit afraid, a little bit possessive. Underneath 
          you know it can't last! That nagging fear leads us to a spiritual path, 
          to seek an alternative source of happiness.</p>
        <p align="left">In Buddhism we are striving for a different sort of happiness. 
          Do you think there can be happiness and joy in the mind which is self-contained, 
          independent of all conditions and perceptions, completely independent 
          of anything whatsoever? This is the happiness of the Buddha. This is 
          Nibbana, the happiness of Enlightenment and non-attachment, the happiness 
          of no limitations, the happiness of no self.</p>
        <p align="left">When you stop having an invested interest in conditions 
          and results, you are not burdened by anything. When you are not burdened 
          the mind is at peace. It is naturally joyful and happy. The Buddha was 
          a shining example of this happiness. From my own experiences of having 
          met many great meditation Masters, they share this quality of inner 
          tranquillity, despite the inability to control conditions and events.</p>
        <p align="left">When I went to live with Ajahn Chah, at first I was amazed, 
          and then I was quite upset, to see how he ran his monastery. I expected 
          him to have a really tight control over everything: keep the monks in 
          line, keep the lay people out of the way, have a regular timetable. 
          Ajahn Chah didn't do anything like that at all. Things would continually 
          change in the monastery: sometimes we would meditate in the morning; 
          sometimes we would chant; then for a month or so we would do a lot of 
          formal practice; then we would work continually flowing with the conditions. 
          I began to realise that Ajahn Chah didn't go out of his way to control 
          and regulate conditions. Everybody wanted him to have a timetable, but 
          he just never kept to it. He would just sit there, and if people came 
          he received them; he never turned them away . If they didn't come, then 
          he was perfectly happy to be alone. He didn't bother to control events, 
          yet if I have ever met a joyful happy person, it was Venerable Ajahn 
          Chah. It wasn't that he was always laughing although he did laugh a 
          lot but he just had this joy about him, whatever he was doing. He wasn't 
          seeking anything from anybody , wasn't trying to control things in order 
          to be happy . </p>
        <p align="left">In Buddhism we are interested in freedom the freedom of 
          non-attachment. W e carry around an immense burden of attachment to 
          everything we consider 'me' and 'mine' , like a big heavy stone on our 
          shoulders. When a wise person points out to us that we could throw off 
          this burden, we regard them with suspicion. 'Throw it off? Then I wouldn't 
          have anything left! I couldn't do that!' Thinking they will bring us 
          happiness, we continue to lug around our personal investments and self 
          interests this great big heavy burden! The Buddha taught that nothing 
          is worth attaching to. Do not attach to anything: that will bring true 
          peace and happiness. Reflect on the process of what we call suffering: 
          what it really is how it arises. Only then can one begin to appreciate 
          what attachment really is, what the result of attachment is, and begin 
          to glimpse the idea and the possible results of non-attachment.</p>
        <p align="left">Attachment is something we create in the mind. When we 
          let it go, we begin to experience the silent empty mind. This still, 
          peaceful mind can be found when sitting in meditation. Is it possible 
          to bring it also into our daily lives? Can we live as ordinary people 
          with this non-attachment? There is one vital factor needed if we wish 
          to live skilfully, and that factor is mindful awareness. This factor 
          of knowing, of being present, is essential if we wish to go beyond our 
          continual stream of thinking, projecting, analysing and reacting. It 
          is difficult, isn't it? Without awareness, we are locked into our stale 
          conditioning, like a monkey with its paw stuck in the biscuit jar . 
          All it has to do to become free is let go, but this is just what it 
          won't do. Actually , non-attachment is not something you have to do: 
          all you have to do is stop attaching. This is natural for the enlightened 
          mind, and it is awareness which makes this a real possibility in our 
          lives.</p>
        <p align="left">The Buddha taught a Path, gave us a method of skilful 
          means. Meditation is the tool to help us with the process of being present, 
          of seeing attachment and tensions arising, of knowing when to relax 
          and let go. The practice of meditation is very highly emphasised. The 
          more you become aware, the more you can begin to experience true peace 
          and happiness. There is no need to have anything else, no need to achieve 
          anything.</p>
        <p align="left">Through Enlightenment, you gain nothing at all: all you 
          do is get rid of the extras; you just put down your burden. Life is 
          still life, there are still relationships, and there is still action. 
          The big difference is that you are perfectly at peace, and there is 
          a real and lasting happiness.</p>
        <p align="left">So we should all make an effort with our practice. Without 
          meditation, life is very difficult, and progress on the spiritual path 
          is very hard. I once knew a German who even at that time had been a 
          monk for fifteen years, and I asked him, 'Do you still meditate?' and 
          he said, 'Yes, I meditate regularly . I don't think it is possible to 
          lead a spiritual life without meditation.' I have always remembered 
          that, and I have always reflected on how true it is. Without the ability 
          to calm the mind, without the ability to clear the mind, without the 
          ability to sustain awareness and reflect and observe the nature of the 
          mind and body , it is not possible to develop in the spiritual direction 
          the ultimate direction which enables us to let go, to stop seeking happiness 
          from anything or anybody.</p>
