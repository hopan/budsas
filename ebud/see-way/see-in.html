        <p>Venerable Puriso (Bruce Evans) was born in Melbourne, Australia in 
          1951. As a young man he became involved in the music business and made 
          a record. Through contact with a Zen teacher in Melbourne he was inspired 
          to go to Japan to study Zen.<br>
          En route, he stopped over in Bangkok and met some Western bhikkhus, 
          but was put off training in the Theravada tradition because of the restrictions 
          on music in the monks' discipline. Nonetheless, he decided to attend 
          a Vipassana meditation retreat in Nong Khai. While attending the retreat 
          his guitar was stolen. This made him decide to abandon his plans to 
          train in Japan, and he started to investigate more closely what opportunities 
          might be available in Thailand.<br>
          Having heard about Ajahn Chah, he visited Wat Pah Pong, and eventually 
          took upasampada there in 1975, with Ajahn Chah as his preceptor. In 
          1982 he went back to Australia with Venerable Jagaro to help found a 
          monastery in Perth. After some time he returned to Thailand. He is now 
          senior incumbent at Wat Wana Potiyahn (Wat Keurn), not far from Wat 
          Pah Pong, and close to the Lao/Cambodian border, where he is actively 
          engaged in working to preserve the dwindling forests in the area. This 
          work was featured in a very successful television documentary, which 
          was broadcast nationwide in Thailand.</p>

          In the meditation monasteries of North-East Thailand it is a tradition 
          for the village people to spend the new moon and full moon uposatha 
          days in the monastery. They keep the eight precepts and practise meditation 
          alongside the monks and nuns until dawn of the following day. On such 
          evenings a Dhamma talk is given especially to encourage laity. The following 
          talk, translated from the Thai by the speaker, was given by Venerable 
          Puriso during the Rainy-Season Retreat (Vassa) of 1987.<br>

        <p align="left"> FOR YOU WHO HAVE COME TO THE MONASTERY, leaving your 
          homes for the observance day, it is a good opportunity to stop and reflect 
          on your lives. Where are you going? Are you travelling the worldly path 
          or the path of Dhamma? If you are travelling the path of Dhamma, are 
          you making progress? In the practice of Dhamma, one should constantly 
          try to improve oneself; don't just go about things in a perfunctory 
          way -- move ahead. To make the Dhamma meaningful, you have to make it 
          relevant to your life, reflecting on your actions in the light of Dhamma.</p>
        <p align="left">For example, when developing sati, recollection. In any 
          one day, how much time do you spend with sati, being aware of yourself? 
          We develop sati in our meditation practice. At first, one may only be 
          able to keep one's attention on the breath for two or three seconds 
          before it wanders. Especially if you don't establish your mind when 
          sitting, you may not even follow the breath for even two or three seconds. 
          You may end up just sitting there, passing the time away.</p>
        <p align="left">When sitting in meditation, you should really, consciously, 
          sit in meditation. What is our task when sitting meditation? We must 
          bring the breath to mind, to recollect on, contemplate around, or notice 
          the in- and out-breaths. This is developing the ability to recollect 
          or be mindful -- sati. Using repetition, we can improve our ability in 
          this area.</p>
        <p align="left">With all the practices in the forest monastery here, there 
          is room for improvement and refinement. What are our practices here? 
          Firstly, for instance, there is eating one meal a day. This is one of 
          our basic practices. In forest monasteries this standard should be observed 
          firmly. Another one is the practice of not lying down in the evenings 
          of the observance days. For those who have the strength, this should 
          also be observed -- although if one's health is not good, one may not 
          be able to go all through the night. Even so, one can still make the 
          effort to be especially diligent on that night.</p>
        <p align="left">Listening to Dhamma is another one of our practices. Listening 
          to Dhamma is something one must train in. If one has never listened 
          to Dhamma, one won't really know how to do it. One's mind will wander 
          and one will get caught up in thoughts of criticism or praise, approval 
          or disapproval, and so on. As for those who have trained in listening 
          to Dhamma, when they hear the Dhamma they feel pleasure. Likewise, if 
          we can practise the Dhamma in our everyday lives, we should experience 
          lightness and ease as a result. We should experience the 'disbanding' 
          or 'dissolving' of suffering. The suffering of this world arises through 
          clinging and attachment. The world is the sphere of 'me' and 'mine'.</p>
        <p align="left">Now in this world there are many people, so it's necessary 
          to share things around. But in fact, there isn't much sharing, there's 
          more grabbing going on. People are struggling against each other to 
          make a living, raise a family, set themselves up securely, and so on. 
          In other words, they're suffering. Generally speaking, people manage 
          to get by, but there are times when things get rough, problems arise 
          in the form of disputes, quarrels, fighting, and so on. It's just as 
          if people were blinded by darkness.</p>
        <p align="left">So what should we do? We must listen to the Dhamma, contemplate 
          the Dhamma. We must learn to look at all these things in the light of 
          Dhamma, bringing light into our minds. When you bring light into a dark 
          place, the darkness disappears. No matter how long the darkness has 
          been there, it dissipates the instant we bring light into that place. 
          The 'light' here is the understanding of things in the light of Dhamma. 
          What is the light of Dhamma? When we know how to let go of 'me' and 
          'mine', and see things as they are -- this is seeing things in the light 
          of Dhamma.</p>
        <p align="left">For instance, in Buddhism we talk about the 'Eight Worldly 
          Dhammas': gain and loss, praise and criticism, fame and obscurity, happiness 
          and suffering. These are the things most people are running after or 
          from. People look for wealth and possessions. Praise is another thing 
          people look for. We like to hear people say we are good and clever. 
          Words like that please us. If we hear words of criticism or abuse, we 
          don't feel so good. Another kind of worldly Dhamma is status. Some people 
          aren't so interested in wealth as such, but they like rank and power. 
          Politicians may spend lots of money to get political power and position.</p>
        <p align="left">If we look into all these worldly Dhammas, we will notice 
          that they all tend to swell up one's self-image. However, the practice 
          of Dhamma tends to work towards cutting it down, towards giving up pride. 
          'Self building' is contrary to the way of things, because in the end 
          we lose all those things anyway.</p>
        <p align="left">I've noticed the monkeys here in the forest. Sometimes 
          I've seen them playing a game, something like 'King of the Castle'. 
          One of the monkeys will run to the top of a termite mound. He's the 
          King of the Castle. Then all the other monkeys down below will compete 
          with each other to pull him down and get up there themselves. All of 
          the monkeys want to get on top, they want to be big, they want to show 
          their stuff. But being on top doesn't necessarily guarantee happiness. 
          In fact, the monkey on top of the mound suffers more than all the others. 
          He's got to be constantly on guard against the other monkeys jumping 
          up and pulling him off the mound. The others are much better off, they've 
          got nothing to lose.</p>
        <p align="left">There's something we can learn from this, too. 'Make yourself 
          small.' To say 'Make yourself small' doesn't mean to make yourself stupid, 
          lazy or cowardly, but to know how to let go: to be humble, respectful, 
          easily contented and appreciative.</p>
        <p align="left">These four qualities are contrary to the normal way of 
          the world. In the world, people don't usually aim for these sorts of 
          things -- they normally seek to make themselves big. The Buddha said 
          this is contrary to nature.</p>
        <p align="left">So whatever practice is a vehicle to help us let go of 
          'me' and 'mine' is a correct practice, as well as being the way to happiness. 
          This is because letting go is happiness; clinging is suffering. Regarding 
          this point here, one who has never studied or thought about the Dhamma 
          won't like to hear it, because most people tend to cling. There are 
          many things people cling to as being their own. Seeing things as being 
          one's own in an absolute sense is called 'clinging'. If one isn't clinging, 
          one will see that 'our' things are ours only in a relative sense. As 
          long as supporting conditions are there, then those things will also 
          be there; but when supporting factors no longer exist, then those things 
          also cease. Thinking in this way is thinking in the light of Dhamma. 
          And thinking in the light of Dhamma will make us cool and peaceful; 
          we will experience the disbanding of clinging. When clinging is disbanded, 
          we will experience lightness.</p>
        <p align="left">That we come to practise in the monastery is not so that 
          we can simply run away from home, but so that we can step back a bit 
          from our everyday lives and look at things more clearly. If we were 
          to practise only at home, there would be difficulties. One might feel 
          embarrassed to sit or walk meditation. But all of you who come to the 
          monastery come with the single intention of studying and practising 
          the religion. So you can all relax. If somebody wants to practise walking 
          meditation, that person won't have to feel embarrassed or afraid that 
          people will look askance at him, because walking meditation is one of 
          our duties here. If you tried doing walking meditation in the market 
          place, they might think you were crazy, and lock you up! So we come 
          to practise in the monastery where we can relax, practise meditation, 
          read Dhamma books or simply spend the day quietly. Keeping the precepts 
          is already a meritorious action, because actually it's quite difficult 
          to do, especially the eight precepts. If one keeps the eight precepts, 
          one is living like a renunciant, especially here in this monastery where 
          it's very peaceful, and removed from the bustle of house hold life. 
          Living here for a day and a night is like ordaining for a day and a 
          night. If you were to try living like this at home, it wouldn't be easy 
          -- sounds of radio, television, people coming and going -- these things 
          don't help meditation practice.</p>
        <p align="left">However, having come to stay here, we should look into 
          suffering. There will be suffering arising within our bodies and minds. 
          Our duty is to understand the truth of suffering. What does suffering 
          arise from, how does it arise? We must study these things. The Buddha 
          taught, 'Suffering is something that should be recognised,' but most 
          people don't want to recognize it. If suffering arises, the only thing 
          they can think of doing is to try to run away from it. They don't want 
          to look into it. They are not real Dhamma practisers. A Dhamma practiser 
          must look into problems as they arise in order to understand their causes.</p>
        <p align="left">Sometimes, some incident may arise which we instantly 
          react to -- for instance, when people criticise us. But if we look into 
          what they say, we may find some truth there. Our getting angry was simply 
          a defence-reaction based on fear. If we accept what they say, that is, 
          we recognise their right to say what they wish, then no incident arises.</p>
        <p align="left">If we practise so as not to give rise to any 'incidents' 
          in our lives, we will have some peace. If any incidents do arise, we 
          dare to look into them in the light of Dhamma, with openness, clarity 
          and honesty. But seeing things in the light of Dhamma is not easy. We 
          have our habits. This is what makes seeing in the light of Dhamma so 
          difficult. We see things not as they are but coloured by our habitual 
          reactions and value judgements.</p>
        <p align="left">We must depend on Dhamma practice to further train ourselves. 
          We must develop moral discipline (sila) and mental discipline (samadhi) 
          in order to give rise to understanding (pañña). Sila and samadhi are 
          the tools with which we calm our actions, speech and thoughts. If our 
          actions, speech ;and thoughts are not restrained, everything is agitated, 
          we can't see things the way they are. In other words, we can't see in 
          the light of Dhamma. We must firmly take hold of the practices which 
          the Buddha has bequeathed us: moral precepts, the dhutanga practices, 
          making merit and giving offerings; these are all tools in our practice. 
          They give us the strength to overcome the hindrances and develop clarity.</p>
        <p align="left">How can we give up hindrances? Take the example of giving 
          offerings. Whether offering of material goods or offering of one's time 
          and energy, these are all aspects of dana, and they are one way of giving 
          up mental hindrances and cleansing our mind. Don't think that making 
          offerings is in order to go to heaven. That's not a sure thing. If one 
          makes offerings and yet does bad actions, one may end up going to hell. 
          Making merit through good deeds ;and making offerings are done in order 
          to cleanse one's mind. You can see the fruit of your action in the present 
          moment, you don't have to go looking off into a future life. Future 
          lives are an uncertainty, we should consider this life. If you give 
          offerings wholeheartedly, without a trace of doubt or regret, giving 
          fully with one's whole heart, one will experience happiness right there, 
          a sense of well-being and fulfilment. Right there is the fruit of giving, 
          you don't have to look for it in the future.</p>
        <p align="left">Keeping the precepts is the same. If one keeps the precepts 
          wholeheartedly, without doubts on one hand or self-pride on the other, 
          one will experience a feeling of strength in one's heart. The mind will 
          be firm and strong. If one takes such a mind and trains it further in 
          concentration practice, that firmness will increase until the mind becomes 
          unified. This is our path of practice.</p>
        <p align="left">This is how the forest monasteries teach the Dhamma. They 
          teach us to practise the Dhamma, to actually put it into practice, to 
          the best of our ability, and to see the fruits of the practice in the 
          present, right before your eyes. For instance, if you practise meditation 
          and calm the mind, the fruit of your efforts will be plainly there before 
          you. You don't have to think of practising meditation for some future 
          result, you can see the fruit right there. Goodness is its own reward. 
          This point is one that people don't seem to understand. They see people 
          going to the monastery for years and never getting rich, so they conclude 
          that they've done good deeds and received no result. This is a misunderstanding. 
          If one really does virtuous deeds, there must be virtue within one at 
          that time. The fruit of the action is right there within one. The same 
          applies to bad actions. Sometimes we may see others doing bad things 
          and seeming to get away with it, and so conclude that they've done bad 
          actions and received no bad result. This is still not seeing clearly.</p>
        <p align="left">In Buddhism we say, 'Good actions bring good results, 
          bad actions bring bad results.' This isn't a theory, an idea, an ideal, 
          or some form of wishful thinking -- it is the way things are, whether 
          one sees it or not. People who commit evil acts become evil people. 
          Their minds, their speech and their actions become evil. This is the 
          result of their evil actions, in keeping with the Buddha's instruction, 
          'We are the owners of our kamma.'</p>
        <p align="left">Moreover, good and bad actions reap future results as 
          well, such as when a thief steals something. At the time of stealing, 
          he may even feel pleasure of a sort -- even if it is a shoddy sort of 
          pleasure -- and it may last for many days. He may get a lot of money 
          and spend it lavishly, but when the police catch him, all that pleasure 
          he experienced is as nothing -- it disappears without a trace -- leaving 
          him alone with the consequences of his actions. This is the fruit of 
          bad kamma. If we really practise and contemplate, we should see that 
          this is so.</p>
        <p align="left">When I went to Australia with Ajahn Jagaro, the day we 
          arrived at Perth Airport we were approached by a man as we were going 
          through Customs. He was a little drunk, but he must have been something 
          of a philosopher as well. Seeing us monks aroused his curiosity, so 
          he came to ask about our religion. We told him we were Buddhists.</p>
        <p align="left">'Oh, Buddhists. You revere the Buddha, is that right?'<br>
          'Yes.'<br>
          'They tell me, the Buddha was such a pure being, living such an exemplary 
          life, giving up himself for the sake of others, revered by the world 
          as a great sage .... But eventually he died, didn't he?'<br>
          'Yes, that's right.'<br>
          'Now suppose we take the example of someone who committed untold evil 
          -- such as Hitler, for example. He was responsible for the deaths of 
          so many people, so much suffering, so many heinous deeds ... but in 
          the end, he also died, right?'<br>
          'Yes, that's right.'<br>
          'Well then, what's the difference? One man practises so virtuously, 
          one commits so much evil -- but in the end they both died just the same. 
          What's the use of virtue, if that's the case?'</p>
        <p align="left">I answered, 'They both died, it's true, but it wasn't 
          the same thing. The Buddha understood death. He lived his life fully 
          aware of the fact of death and was unshaken by it. When the time came 
          for him to die, he died peacefully, without doubts, without regrets, 
          having lived a 'true' life, one that was lived in accordance with the 
          truth.</p>
        <p align="left">'Hitler, on the other hand, didn't understand death. His 
          life was lived with fear and suspicion, his mind was wrought with untold 
          sufferings and a view that was ignorant of the truth, which is why he 
          could commit such evil actions anyway. His life was lived out of fear, 
          and he died in confusion and darkness. His life was full of ignorance 
          and falsehood. This is the important difference: one of them understood, 
          the other didn't.'</p>
        <p align="left">This is the important point. We Buddhists should have 
          this understanding in our hearts. What does 'Buddha' mean? Buddha means 
          'knowing', Buddho means 'the one who knows'. This Buddhist Religion 
          is the religion of knowing and understanding the way things really are.</p>
        <p align="left">Now, the knowledge of the Buddha and the enlightened disciples 
          is not the knowledge of so much -- it's basically to know oneself. If 
          you want to be a true Buddhist, you must cultivate that knowing in your 
          heart. This knowing is not like worldly knowledge, which is an amassing 
          of facts and ideas. It is simply to know ourselves.</p>
        <p align="left">If you know how to practise like this, then it's just 
          like planting a Bodhi-tree in your mind. All the bad, unwholesome qualities 
          will be like fertiliser to feed the Bodhi-tree, the tree of knowing. 
          You will be able to use the defilements of mind as objects of awareness, 
          as vehicles to see the true state of your mind, and seeing the true 
          state of greed, hatred and delusion.</p>
        <p align="left">For example, if you happen to get angry, then know that 
          anger has arisen. Don't fool yourself by saying, 'No, I'm not angry, 
          it's just that so-and-so is such a dirty rat....' Sometimes when we 
          are angry, we fail to recognise it because we put all our attention 
          onto the object of anger rather than on our own minds. We are always 
          watching others, rarely ourselves.</p>
        <p align="left">The Buddha said that, no matter what happens, accept it 
          and investigate it. Such as when anger arises: know that this is anger 
          and investigate it. How does it feel to be angry? Do you feel happy 
          when you're angry? If you do this, then you are looking at things in 
          the light of Dhamma. Eventually you will learn to let go of anger, because 
          you will know that it causes suffering. If it causes suffering, why 
          cling to it?</p>
        <p align="left">But this is easy to say ... hard to do. Even so, listening 
          to a discourse can remind us of our direction and encourage us to practise. 
          If we practise hard not to get deluded by the conditions of mind, then 
          we are behaving as real Buddhists.</p>
        <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</p>
        <p align="left">It hadn't rained for many days. Walking around, I saw 
          the forest parched, some trees seemed to be dying. Now that it's rained, 
          the frogs are all out revelling in the water. They find themselves a 
          puddle, and croak away so happily -- they probably think those puddles 
          are always going to be there. But when the rain stops in no long time 
          they will all dry up, and the frogs will be dying of the heat.</p>
        <p align="left">Our human lives are similar. When conditions are conducive, 
          we are able to live fairly comfortably. When conditions change, we may 
          not be able to continue. These days, people seem intent on destroying 
          nature. They don't seem to realize that human beings are parts of nature, 
          born of nature, just like those frogs. If human beings destroy nature, 
          it is just like destroying themselves -- because we don't exist separate 
          and above nature, we live dependent on it, as part of it. Destroy nature 
          and we destroy ourselves.</p>
        <p align="left">So, on that note, I'll finish off the Dhamma talk. I hope 
          that some things I've said may be of use. At least you may have some 
          good food for reflection, so that you take what you've heard and examine 
          it, using it to develop your own wisdom.</p>
