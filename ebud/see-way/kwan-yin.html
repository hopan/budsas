        <p>Venerable Sucitto was born in London in 1949, but moved to the small 
          town of Dunstable in his teens. His first encounter with Buddhism came 
          through an interest in Japanese literature while at grammar school, 
          but he found nothing to follow it up in his local town. The continuing 
          interest in literature carried him through a B.A. in English and American 
          Literature at Warwick University in 1971. After that, the search for 
          a meaningful direction in life eventually attracted him to take an overland 
          trip through the East, heading for Australia. Following a period in 
          India, he went to Thailand in 1975, where he happened across a class 
          in Buddhist meditation in Chiang Mai. After a few days' practice, he 
          decided to make a tentative commitment to the Holy Life.<br>
          He spent three years in Thailand, mostly at Wat Kiriwong in Nakhon Sawan. 
          During a short sojourn in Chiang Mai, however, he met Ajahn Sumedho, 
          before the latter left for England. When Venerable Sucitto himself returned 
          to England in 1978 to visit his family, he met Ajahn Sumedho again at 
          the Hampstead Vihara, and decided to stay and train with him. During 
          the past ten years he has lived for the most part with Ajahn Sumedho, 
          and has been responsible for editing and publishing his talks, as well 
          as other Sangha publications.<br>
          Venerable Sucitto was the first senior incumbent of the Harnham Vihara. 
          Since 1983 he has been involved with establishing a training for ten-precept 
          nuns, and in 1984 he moved to Amaravati Buddhist Centre where he still 
          resides.</p>

          In the winter of 1986-87, Venerable Sucitto was in Thailand; during 
          that time he went wandering (tudong) with Venerable Gavesako. Most of 
          the time was spent in the Isan -- the provinces of North East Thailand 
          -- but in the following piece, he reflects on another part of the trip, 
          in Siraja and Ko Sichang....<br>

        <p align="left"> SIRAJA IS NOT A PARTICULARLY BEAUTIFUL TOWN. It's part 
          of that urban overspill to the east of Bangkok that flows along the 
          coast through Samut Pakhan and down to Chonburi, oozing along in the 
          wake of the oil and shipping developments around the Gulf of Thailand. 
          Ajahn Gavesako and I had decided to go there as part of our tudong trip, 
          in order to get out to an island called Ko Sichang -- The Island of the 
          Noble Elephant. This would be around Christmas time, which like most 
          festive occasions in Thailand is very noisy, at least in the more Western-influenced 
          cities. Accordingly, we planned to stay a night or two at a small monastery 
          that Ajahn Gavesako knew, and then go out to the island for a few days 
          of living very simply, away from the hustle and bustle.</p>
        <p align="left">It seemed like a good idea: even before the festival began, 
          life in the city was noisy compared with the forests of the Isan. The 
          little monastery that we were staying in occupied a few acres squashed 
          up against a hillside on the outskirts of the city of Siraja; it wasn't 
          exactly in the heart of town, but it certainly wasn't outside of it. 
          There was a lot of noise from the streets and from Christmas music being 
          played very loudly; so after the initial pleasantries with the resident 
          monks, I for one was quite eager to get away. But of course one has 
          to wait until someone gets to know of one's wishes and offers to buy 
          a ticket -- which may take a few days.</p>
        <p align="left">So one evening we went down to the seafront and walked 
          out to a small island that was connected the mainland by a pier. On 
          this island there was one of those Chinese Buddhist temples, of which 
          there are very many in Thailand, which go in for the more ritualistic 
          side of Buddhism. In order to obtain good fortune one can make offerings 
          at shrines in such temples -- to the Buddha or to one of the bodhisattvas, 
          particularly to the Bodhisattva of Compassion, The One Who Listens to 
          The Sounds Of The World -- or Kwan Yin, as she is known in Chinese. I 
          must admit this supplication to divine agencies has never fitted in 
          with my ideas about Buddhism; my mind kept turning away from the painted 
          images and the decorative shrines to the sea, bathed in sunset gold. 
          The serene horizon hinted of sublime planes, and I found myself more 
          eager than ever to get out to a place where I could apply myself whole-heartedly 
          to meditation.</p>
        <p align="left">By the next afternoon, unseen wheels had turned and we 
          were able to get a ferry boat out to the island of Ko Sichang. We landed 
          at a little harbour and walked along the coast of the island until we 
          came to a more remote area. There we found a fantastic old ruined temple 
          that had been built in the reign of King Mongkut. It wasn't like the 
          Chinese temple. Its very decay gave it a certain air of sanctity: there 
          was a bodhi tree growing up through the roof, and the cracked walls 
          inside were bear except for a few photographs of tudong bhikkhus, like 
          Venerable Ajahn Mun. To be in the presence of such images of austerity 
          and dedication to Dhamma practice was very encouraging. This was the 
          right place, sure enough.</p>
        <p align="left">We walked on down to the rocky seashores, the beaches 
          and the sparkling water. We decided to make the best use of the situation 
          by separating and practising on our own most of each day. I had already 
          resolved to fast for the five days that we'd be out there, because whenever 
          I fast then I find that this gives a clarity to my mind, and a greater 
          refinement to my attention. The physical energies calm down and level 
          out and there is less need to sleep.</p>
        <p align="left">The weather was beautiful. December in Thailand is a lovely 
          time of year, hot but not stuffy and sticky; and then being on an island 
          there were pleasant breezes, so it was quite idyllic. At night it was 
          warm and balmy and I would sit underneath the measureless stars meditating 
          with the moon as my only companion. Time stretched itself out and went 
          to rest....</p>
        <p align="left">So after a few days of this I was getting pretty blissed 
          out. Then, I think it was on the third clear day, I came across a beautiful 
          old wooden palace structure that was half burnt down, set in grounds 
          with frangipani trees -- and that was quite amazing. It was near the 
          ruined temple, and exploring further I found a cave which opened into 
          the ground. You could walk down inside this great cleft in the ground, 
          which then opened out to reveal long galleries where you could do walking 
          meditation, and niches in the rock where you could sit and meditate. 
          Then you could go down even further until you couldn't see or hear anything; 
          so you could be completely enfolded in the earth's womb. A hermit's 
          dream!</p>
        <p align="left">I thought, 'This is amazing, this is really wonderful!' 
          And it was the day of the full moon. My mind immediately constructed 
          the evening confrontation with Mara: I was near the ruined temple, so 
          I could sit there with Ajahn Mun, or I could go down into the cave and 
          practise, or I could do walking meditation out under the frangipani 
          trees with the cool evening breezes blowing and the full moon beaming 
          down. 'This is it,' I thought, 'this is going to be the night when I 
          really get into some samadhi.'</p>
        <p align="left">I was feeling very light, almost skipping up the slope 
          with expectation, when I noticed some people coming along -- which was 
          kind of strange. They were all dressed in white; then I recognised that 
          it was one of the anagarikas from the monastery in Siraja we'd been 
          staying at, and he had some lay women with him who were also dressed 
          in white. I quickly realised that they must have come to see us; but 
          I didn't want to be bothered with polite conversation -- particularly 
          as I couldn't speak the language. However, they'd seen me: I couldn't 
          ignore that, so I decided to make the best of it, come over, be nice, 
          and hopefully it wouldn't last too long. We sat down by a big bodhi 
          tree outside the ruined temple and they had one of those refrigerated 
          boxes with some Coca Cola in it, so I accepted a bottle and drank some. 
          They started asking questions and talking and I couldn't get very much 
          of what they were saying. I just smiled and said I didn't understand 
          and thought that sooner or later Ajahn Gavesako would happen along. 
          Then he could talk to them, and I could go off and sit somewhere and 
          get into some samadhi.</p>
        <p align="left">But somewhere in the back of my mind was an anxious voice: 
          'Why have they come? I wonder what it is?'</p>
        <p align="left">Then Ajahn Gavesako came along. I sat with him for a while, 
          but he seemed quite at ease listening and talking to them, so I thought: 
          'Well I'll just move off.' I started to slip away; but as I was slipping 
          away he turned around and said: 'Oh, Tuhn Sucitto, pack your bag, will 
          you? We're going back.'</p>
        <p align="left">My mind stopped: 'Back, what?' He said, 'We're going back 
          to Siraja.' And I said, 'What for? What are we going back for?' Suddenly 
          my evening of samadhi dropped away. 'Oh, they've invited us.' I looked 
          at him questioningly, and he added, 'I don't know what for. It doesn't 
          matter. They've invited us so we'd better go. It wouldn't be polite 
          to refuse.'</p>
        <p align="left">At that point something in me stopped. I turned round 
          and walked off and went to where my bowl bag was and packed my alms 
          bowl with my mind going: 'What do they want? What are we doing? I suppose 
          we're going back to chant something or another, do some ritual. Why 
          can't we stay here? We came here for a few days. We were going to go 
          back in a couple of days anyway. We came here for a few days to practise 
          and now we've got to go back to the town. What for? What do they want?' 
          But I knew enough to recognise that resistance in the mind and not to 
          follow it. So I packed my bag. We walked back from that haven to a road 
          where they'd got a motorbike taxi to give us a ride out to the little 
          harbour village. We waited there. I stared glumly at the sea, and then 
          when the ferry came we all packed into it. The boat lingered for a few 
          minutes, then turned and carried us away from the Noble Elephant back 
          to the reeking harbour of Siraja.</p>
        <p align="left">We returned to the temple in the city not knowing what 
          for. I went to my kuti, unpacked my bag and sat there waiting for something 
          to happen. And I sat and waited; and nothing happened except the sounds 
          of the city swelled as the duskfall turned into night. Sounds of the 
          traffic, sounds of the world -- and I had to listen to it as night turned 
          into day. And it being Christmas Eve and Thai people, Christians as 
          well as Buddhists, enjoying loud music, there were lots of loud Christmas 
          songs -- in English. Perhaps it was because they were in English that 
          it didn't seem to matter what they were about, because they weren't 
          even Christmas carols that you could be inspired by. What came rolling 
          into my kuti was Christmas Muzak, like 'White Christmas' and 'Rudolph 
          the Red-Nosed Reindeer' -- again and again. I sat there in the night 
          and I sat there in the morning; listening, waiting and listening to 
          'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer', remembering the full moon, the ruined 
          temple, Ajahn Mun, and samadhi.</p>
        <p align="left">But I did listen; and something in me got the point. Something 
          in me stopped resisting and became at one with the way things are. 'Rudolph 
          the Red-Nosed Reindeer' is quite a reasonable song actually, when you 
          listen to it a few times; it's got a moral to it. And when something 
          in me let go and listened to the sounds of the world, it seemed there 
          was a vibrant silence behind it all. And the silence behind the sound 
          of the world seemed to encompass and listen to everything. Profound 
          or petty or inane, no sound could stain the silence of the listening 
          mind; and in that acceptance was timeless compassion.</p>
        <p align="left">Nobody came for us; nor did anyone come to take us anywhere. 
          They didn't want me to give a talk, do any chanting, bless anything, 
          go anywhere, say anything. Maybe they were worried that we were getting 
          lonely. Perhaps they thought we were not getting enough to eat; I expect 
          the whole event arose out of compassion. But in the end I was grateful. 
          Whatever the Law or compassionate Bodhisattva that arranges these events 
          -- I have a lot to thank them for. They've always managed to catch me 
          out; always turned me away from my attachments, and ideas of practice 
          to make me listen to the way things are. Their emissaries are everywhere. 
          They never let up.</p>
        <p align="left">And perhaps I learnt something about the Noble Elephant, 
          the symbol of Dhamma practice. The Buddha himself is likened to the 
          elephant: it's the symbol of the unstoppable aspiration to Nibbana that 
          keeps going through anything. It is with such an aspiration that a tudong 
          monk establishes his practice -- he inclines to be enduring, to be resilient, 
          and to be tested by wild and lonely places. In fact for me it's always 
          been a great pleasure to go to remote places, where I could be alone 
          and independent. Yet I've also noticed that when I interpret the aspiration 
          too literally, a mahout climbs on the back of the Noble Elephant. This 
          mahout is always saying things like: 'I'm going to get into jhana tonight. 
          This is the real place for practice, if I could stay in this place forever, 
          I'd really develop.' And he's always asking the practice to come up 
          with something fancy; like a mahout that wants his elephant to dance 
          and prance and perform tricks. He's always been a burden, this mahout; 
          and as long as he's driving the elephant I've never felt that satisfied, 
          even in blissful circumstances. Instead my attitudes get caught up in 
          trying to prove or attain or hold on to something -- a rather self-conscious 
          striving that finally does not lead to coolness, detachment or liberation.</p>
        <p align="left">Of course, when one lives as a bhikkhu there are chances 
          to undertake austerities and live alone sometimes, but the basic standard 
          always entails a relationship with the society. The life is one of dependence; 
          it's an interface. Yet if the Buddha established the bhikkhu life for 
          liberation then we should trust the opportunity for selflessness that 
          it presents. It's a bumpy ride at times, but I've learned to appreciate 
          the tests of Sangha life, and the enigmatic compassion of The Way It 
          Is: they always create predicaments where I have to let go.</p>
        <p align="left">When I came down from my kuti on Christmas Eve morning, 
          Ajahn Gavesako was reading a newspaper. 'It says here there are four 
          babies born in the world every second!' 'Better get used to group practice,' 
          I commented.</p>
        <p align="left">Sometimes we need austerities, sometimes we need isolation, 
          and sometimes it takes a Red-Nosed Reindeer to awaken us from ourselves.</p>
