        <p>Venerable Anando was born in Buffalo, New York in 1946, and grew up 
          near Niagara Falls. Upon leaving high school he joined the U.S. Marines 
          and served in Vietnam as a radio operator. Severely wounded in combat, 
          he was flown back to the U.S., where he eventually made a remarkable 
          recovery. Decorated and invalided out of the service, he enrolled at 
          Buffalo University to study Psychology and French, and spent one semester 
          at a Catholic seminary.<br>
          During this period he became disillusioned with U.S. involvement in 
          Vietnam, and took part in the growing anti-war demonstrations, eventually 
          deciding to go abroad again. While spending a year in France studying 
          in Nice, he came across a book on Zen by Alan Watts, which fuelled his 
          interest in travelling to the East. Journeying overland through Turkey 
          and Afghanistan, he spent six months in Nepal and India, where he first 
          encountered meditation.<br>
          In 1972, a requirement by the U.S. military that he undergo a medical 
          check-up fortuitously took him to Thailand. While at a monastery in 
          Pattaya, he was taken to meet Ajahn Sumedho, who was staying at Wat 
          Kow Chalok in Chonburi. He became a samanera there, and later went to 
          Wat Pah Pong where he took bhikkhu ordination.<br>
          After five years in Thailand, Venerable Anando went back to the U.S. 
          in 1977 to visit his family. Instead of returning to the East, he was 
          asked by Ajahn Chah to join Ajahn Sumedho at the Hampstead Vihara in 
          London. Since then, he has helped establish the monasteries at Chithurst 
          and Harnham. He is presently abbot of Chithurst Buddhist Monastery.</p>

        <p align="left"> THERE IS A STORY IN THE SCRIPTURES (suttas), regarding 
          a period in the Buddha's life about 20 years after his enlightenment. 
          By that time the monastic community had grown quite large. And it happened 
          that the monks living around the town of Kosambi became involved in 
          an argument over the rules. The dispute got so intense that a schism 
          in the community was about to form. This is something which the Buddha 
          considered very serious indeed. Hearing of the situation he immediately 
          went to where they were, in an attempt to re-establish peace. But each 
          time he tried to talk with the monks they dismissed him. They told him 
          to 'Abide in peace and inactivity here and now,' which is a euphemism 
          for 'Get lost!'</p>
        <p align="left">After a few attempts at re-establishing concord in the 
          Sangha and being dismissed or ignored, the Buddha left.</p>
        <p align="left">He made his way to a park where another three bhikkhu 
          disciples were living and practising: the Venerables Anarudha, Nandiya 
          and Kimbila. Now these three disciples were all fully enlightened beings 
          arahants. </p>
        <p align="left">When the Buddha arrived the monks greeted him in the traditional 
          manner. He asked if they were living in harmony and comfort; did they 
          have any problems with alms food? Venerable Anarudha said, 'We have 
          no problems Lord. Indeed we are well supported and live in harmony.' 
          The Buddha asked, 'How is this so?' Anarudha responded, saying how he 
          considered it a great blessing to have such companions and that he had 
          decided to give up personal preferences; he would do what was conducive 
          to harmony within the community. The Buddha praised Anarudha and asked 
          further, 'Do you live diligently?' Anarudha said, 'Yes Lord, we do.' 
          And the Buddha asked, 'What is it that you do Anarudha?'</p>
        <p align="left">Anarudha described briefly ways in which they took care 
          of each other. For example: the first one back from the alms-walk set 
          out the mats for sitting upon and would see that the bowls for drinking 
          and washing were in place. And after the meal, the last to finish would 
          put everything away and clean up. They helped each other fill the jars 
          with drinking water and also carry water for the toilets.</p>
        <p align="left">Once a week they sat up all night discussing the Dhamma 
          and practising meditation. But the most significant point, and it is 
          emphasised several times in this sutta, is where Anarudha says, 'I dwell 
          with a heart of loving-kindness for my companions, both in public and 
          in private. My mind is attuned to theirs, to the extent that there is 
          only one mind.' The other two bhikkhus when asked, responded in the 
          same way. The Buddha again praised and encouraged them to continue.</p>
        <p align="left">It's inspiring to see how perfectly enlightened beings 
          found that the practice of metta or loving-kindness was what brought 
          harmony and peace. It was manifest in the world by their being sensitive 
          to the needs of those they lived with. Even from the perspective of 
          an arahant, mundane and obvious gestures of help are very important. 
          These are the things which lead on to concord. I've found reflecting 
          on this quite helpful over the years.</p>
        <p align="left">Also in the suttas it mentions 'eleven benefits' from 
          practising metta bhavana. The first benefit is that one falls asleep 
          easily and contented. The second is that one wakes easily, contented 
          and happy. The third is that one is loved by other human beings, and 
          the fourth is that even non-human beings love one. And there is a list 
          of all the harmful and poisonous things from which one is protected. 
          Also it' s said that metta bhavana makes the mind easily concentrated, 
          and that the face of one who practises metta is serene and radiant. 
          The tenth benefit is that one dies unconfused. The eleventh benefit 
          states that if one has not penetrated with insight the nature of the 
          mind, then the power of metta bhavana will bring about birth in the 
          heavenly realms.</p>
        <p align="left">A very significant thing about this practice for me is 
          the tolerance for oneself that develops. Some of the questions asked 
          on this retreat indicate that people are still being trapped by the 
          same old syndrome, the struggle with not wanting what is. W e set up 
          what we like against what we dislike. Thoughts and fantasies become 
          the enemy that which we feel we have to get rid of and escape from.</p>
        <p align="left">How we react in each case depends on the nature of the 
          particular condition. If we perceive it as threatening, then we try 
          to run away from it. When fear arises, for example, we always react 
          with wanting to get away; we want to get some space between us and it. 
          And, of course, as soon as we do that, we empower that condition, we 
          give it life. And it stays with us and disturbs us until we stop reacting.</p>
        <p align="left">As a result of what happened to me in Vietnam I have suffered 
          from what they call 'post-trauma syndrome'. They've done tests on Vietnam 
          veterans and found that a lot of them have this particular anxiety reaction 
          as a result of past trauma. Now it' s very nice having a label for it, 
          but that doesn't make it go away. I know from years of experience that 
          as long as there is resistance to fear then it has power over us. Metta 
          bhavana is wonderful when dealing with such conditions. W e become less 
          adamant about trying to get rid of them. There is a willingness to befriend 
          them and to see that they are just feelings we are experiencing even 
          the ugly, gruesome, terrifying aspects of the mind.</p>
        <p align="left">So, for several days now we have been practising with 
          'May I be well, may others be well,' and perhaps you have noticed that 
          a feeling of goodwill, of metta, begins to arise. When that feeling 
          happens, we can let go of the thought 'May I be well...' and pay closer 
          attention to those actual feelings. Then we can take it a step further 
          and direct those feelings outwards; radiate feelings of goodwill. That 
          word 'outwards' is used quite carefully. One can experience feelings 
          of loving-kindness pervading all directions, filling our world with 
          friendliness, with care, with loving concern. That which was previously 
          troublesome, suddenly in those moments is not. And over a period of 
          time, our attitudes towards ourselves slowly change. There is greater 
          patience and merciful self-forgiveness. In this way, metta bhavana can 
          be used as a skilful means for calming the mind and clearing our attitudes, 
          to provide a suitable base for the practice of vipassana, insight meditation.</p>
        <p align="left">When I was last in Thailand at Wat Pah Pong, I had a conversation 
          with Ajahn Liam, who is now the abbot there. We were talking about practice, 
          and he mentioned that metta bhavana has certain limitations. One is 
          that we can easily become attached to it, and thereby create an obstacle. 
          There is no question about the benefits of this practice, but sometimes 
          people get really quite high. It can be a very joyful and powerful experience, 
          but that' s not liberation. That which brings about insight and understanding 
          is the practice of looking into the mind investigation, or vipassana.</p>
        <p align="left">So for the remainder of this retreat, I want to introduce 
          what might be called the 'wisdom factor'. Having practised metta bhavana 
          for several days, we can begin to investigate the mind. The purpose 
          of this practice is to be able to see what is actually happening here 
          and now; to discern the changeability of what is happening, and to see 
          that it is not going to give us the satisfaction we are seeking. Another 
          thing we realise is that all that is happening can be observed. Seeing 
          this is something of enormous importance to us. We see clearly that 
          it is not ours.</p>
        <p align="left">The 'skilful means' I would like to introduce tonight, 
          and link with what we have been doing, is to simply ask the question, 
          'Who?' 'Who is it that is practising metta bhavana? Who is it that is 
          listening now? Who is it that is sitting, who is in pain, who is wondering, 
          who is confused, who is doubting, who is happy, who isn't happy? Who 
          is this?'</p>
        <p align="left">Intentionally bring up the question 'Who?' and notice 
          clearly what state of mind follows. The mind stops! We can struggle 
          to find some intellectual answer; maybe our name comes to fill in the 
          gap or maybe an exalted, inspired idea like 'The Original Mind'. But 
          the Original Mind is not the thought 'Original Mind'. Buddha-nature 
          is not the thought 'Buddha-nature'. Thinking is just thinking. Thought 
          does not really answer the question 'Who?'</p>
        <p align="left">Now if we are not careful we could use the question 'Who?' 
          like a club or a sledge-hammer. W e could try to pulverise any thoughts 
          that arise in the mind. The questioning needs to be pursued with a sense 
          of inquiry; an almost childlike curiosity. When we see children investigating 
          something new, we see their delight and inquisitiveness. Such an attitude 
          would be wonderful for inquiring into the nature of 'Who?'</p>
        <p align="left">In this way we can get another perspective on those things 
          that disturb us. Restlessness, for instance: 'Who is restless?' The 
          answer comes: 'I am.' Who is that? 'Who is walking? Who is sitting?' 
          This practice can cut away very effectively at our thinking, speculating 
          and fantasising.</p>
        <p align="left">I know, however, from personal experience that not everyone 
          can immediately make use of this technique. So don't feel that it is 
          being offered as THE practice. It is a skilful means with particular 
          benefits. It has a simplicity and clarity that I personally like. If 
          you find you can't do it, or it doesn't make any sense, then go back 
          to the practice of metta bhavana. Continue to nurture that sense of 
          goodwill. This will provide a suitable ambience for the skilful means 
          of asking 'Who?', if or when you choose to use it.</p>
        <p align="left">Sometimes asking 'Who?' can become rather dry even stark 
          and barren whereas metta bhavana can be very uplifting and inspiring. 
          Hopefully, these two skilful means combined will be a good recipe for 
          insightful practice and lead to understanding and peace.</p>
