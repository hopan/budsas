        <p>Venerable Kittisaro (Randolph Weinberg) was born in 1952 in Tennessee. 
          He went to a military high school and excelled at wrestling, becoming 
          Mid-South Wrestling Champion five times, and winner of the 'National 
          Tournament' championship. At Princeton University he studied History 
          and Philosophy of Science, and graduated with high honours (Phi Beta 
          Kappa) in 1974. He intended to go on to study medicine, but studied 
          English at Oxford instead, after winning a Rhodes scholarship. While 
          working on a thesis about Aldous Huxley, he started to yearn for some 
          sense of inner peace.<br>
          His search for quiet places took him to the Buddhist Centre at Oakenholt 
          near Oxford. At a retreat there with Dr. Rewata Dhamma, a Burmese monk, 
          he met Dr. Douglas Burns, a disciple of Ajahn Chah. Hearing about Ajahn 
          Chah and Ajahn Sumedho, he decided to go to Thailand to become a monk 
          himself. He became a samanera at Wat Pah Pong in February 1977, and 
          received upasampada from Ajahn Chah four months later.<br>
          During his second year in Thailand, Venerable Kittisaro contracted typhoid 
          and nearly died. Still not fully recovered, he was called back to the 
          U.S. because of family illness. Instead of returning to Thailand, he 
          went on to England, and joined the monks who were then moving to Chithurst. 
          His physical condition continued to deteriorate, however; eventually 
          he was diagnosed to have Chrone's Disease. After several years of serious 
          illness, his health began to improve slowly, and he has now made a reasonable 
          recovery.<br>
          From 1985 to 1988 he was senior incumbent of the Devon Vihara.</p>

        <p align="left"> Q: Could you outline for us your daily routine?</p>
        <p align="left">IN THE MONASTERY WE RISE AT 4 O'CLOCK. From then until 
          about 4.45 a.m., we get energised doing exercise and so on. At 5 o'clock, 
          there is morning chanting, with an offering of candles, incense, flowers 
          and bowing. The idea is to begin the day by offering that which is beautiful. 
          These actions are a way of pointing our whole being towards Buddha, 
          being collected and awake. So we're setting a direction for the day. 
          Then we make the dedication: 'May my life today be of benefit to all 
          beings.'</p>
        <p align="left">The sitting meditation that follows is usually for an 
          hour. At 6.30 we clean the house, then have tea and a drink of gruel 
          (like liquidy porridge). I do a reading from the Teachings, or give 
          a talk. Then the monks go on 'alms round' through the villages. As 'alms 
          mendicants', it's our duty just to be visible: not to bother people, 
          not to harass them, but to let it be known there's a monk about. If 
          anybody wants to make offerings or talk to us, then we are available. 
          We now have about fifteen houses in the area where they make regular 
          invitation. So we just walk about quietly with our bowl. We have our 
          meal for the day at 10.30 a.m. This is made up of what's been offered, 
          either on the alms round or by other supporters who have visited the 
          monastery. Then we have a short rest.</p>
        <p align="left">In the afternoon there's work. I do a lot of receiving 
          guests and travelling to give talks, leading retreats and study. There's 
          always a lot of work to do on the property. We have tea in the afternoon 
          at about five. Then another service, or chanting, at 7.30 p.m., which 
          anyone can come to. On at least two evenings a week I give a formal 
          talk on some aspect of the teaching. Once a week there's an all-night 
          vigil, when we practise sitting and walking meditation until just before 
          dawn.</p>
        <p align="left">It takes years to learn how to live in a community: how 
          to learn to live with one another, how to live as a celibate, how to 
          live with simple possessions. We emphasise learning how to let go of 
          status, seeing it as just a form of self-conceit. For the rest of my 
          life I will always bow to those who have been in the Order longer than 
          I. That doesn't mean I have to believe they're better than I am just 
          because I'm in that relationship to them; that's how the conventional 
          relationship is with those who are senior. I can use the situation to 
          learn to be humble. In a monastery everyone merges; there are no limits 
          on who can be wise! Now I find a sense of beauty in bowing to the elders.</p>
        <p align="left">Q: 
          Do lay Buddhists adapt these principles to their situation?</p>
        <p align="left">There are 
          five principles to follow: refrain from killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, 
          lying and intoxicants. These guidelines enable us to look into our life 
          and see that which causes conflict: to see the impulse which is always 
          wanting something. We look into our heart and see that which exploits 
          and is bound by sexual energy, which doesn't use it wisely. We see the 
          impulse to distort the truth. And recognise how drugs and alcohol are 
          unskilful ways of avoidance. When someone is not living by these principles 
          their ability to endure hardships is wasted away. But if we do accord 
          with them, then the result of that spiritually is that we become able 
          to bear with things. If we're not able to bear with things, we're not 
          able to understand suffering.</p>
        <p align="left">Q: What does Buddhism teach about love?</p>
        <p align="left">Buddhism teaches that love has to be understood. Generally 
          we attach to an idea of love: love is liking something. We tend to use 
          the word very loosely. However in the Buddhist sense, to really love 
          something, means to allow it to be, to know it as it is: a willingness 
          to listen and be attentive. When a mother loves her child, she is attentive 
          to that child's needs. That doesn't mean she always likes it -- for instance, 
          when the child is screaming and not sleeping at night -- but she's willing 
          to be with that child. For the mother, the child just is the way it 
          is. As I understand it, the Buddha taught that the purest form of love 
          is to not fight something: not struggling against something, but allowing 
          it to live, to be present in our consciousness. Then we can be attentive 
          to it.</p>
        <p align="left">Then you say: 'Well, gosh, that seems pretty cold -- that won't 
          change the world!' But when you give attention to something without 
          demanding that it be different, that very attentiveness has a profound 
          transforming effect. This is what I found with my own body and illness. 
          For some reason I didn't die, and now I'm at least able to go around 
          and meet people. For many years all I could do was just be with the 
          body, be with the discomfort, be with the pain as it was. But allowing 
          all that to be in the mind, just as it was, caring for it -- gave so 
          much nourishment.</p>
        <p align="left">We find in physics now that they don't talk about 
          an 'objective observer' and 'the observed' any more. Physicists have 
          come around to seeing in terms of 'the participant'. The mere fact of 
          looking at something means you start to change it. Now if you look at 
          someone you love and you see something you don't like and try to make 
          them be different, you're actually forcing -- and that can be quite cruel. 
          So the Buddha would say that hatred can never be stilled by hatred. 
          Aversion won't cease by fighting it: only through kindness, through 
          not hating something, can a condition live, and then die, naturally. 
          Hatred has to die a natural death. As soon as we try to kill hatred 
          we actually reproduce it all over the place. And when hatred ceases, 
          love remains.</p>
        <p align="left">Q: What do you think about doctrinal statements on such 
          things as how the world began and so on?</p>
        <p align="left">They're just endless speculation 
          -- even though they may be fun to sit down and talk about! The Buddha 
          had a simile that relates to this. He talked about a man who had been 
          shot by a poisonous arrow. Before allowing the arrow to be removed this 
          man demanded to know: 'Who shot me? What kind of bow was it? What kind 
          of arrow was it? Which direction did it come from?' The doctor said: 
          'If I answer all those questions, you'll be dead.'</p>
        <p align="left">People used to come 
          to the Buddha and ask, 'Is the world finite or infinite? What happens 
          to an enlightened being after they die? What was the beginning of the 
          world?', and all of these marvellously intriguing questions. The Buddha 
          said: 'If you talk about these questions, you're going to be dead, and 
          miss this wonderful opportunity as a human being to be free.'</p>
        <p align="left">We need 
          to be free from ignorance, to taste freedom itself -- freedom from imagining 
          that we're a body, freedom from that which ties us down to the finite. 
          The Buddha's teaching always comes back to that which frees you from 
          ignorance and suffering. It's not skilful to spend a lot of time on 
          such doctrinal statements. Time is precious! Pull out the poisoned arrow. 
          Go straight to the root of the problem.</p>
        <p align="left">Q: What is the Buddhist attitude 
          to social work and engagement in social issues -- doing practical things 
          to help? Is Buddhism entirely impractical?</p>
        <p align="left">First of all, I think the 
          idea that 'people who are just contemplating don't have any effect on 
          the world', needs to</p>
        <p align="left">be considered. I know that in our monastery when 
          someone is peaceful, it has an effect on the others; when someone is 
          being very irritable all the time, that also has an effect on the others.</p>
        <p align="left">Then 
          there's this idea that a great gap exists between action and contemplation. 
          Again in physics, they're beginning to see that the act of looking at 
          something has a tremendous effect. The way we look at things creates 
          our world, our whole attitude. All our indignation, all our liking and 
          disliking comes from our attitude.</p>
        <p align="left">A Buddhist contemplative approach 
          would be considering the Four Noble Truths. The First Noble Truth says: 
          'There is suffering.' Normally we think, 'I am suffering. I want to 
          get out of suffering,' and so we focus on hope, on wanting to get out. 
          The pain looks like something we want to get away from. The Buddha says 
          you'll never get away from it that way. We like to grab hold of pleasure 
          -- but the pleasure changes, because it's a relative truth. Buddhism 
          swings you right out -- the First Noble Truth -- to look right at pain 
          or unhappiness.</p>
        <p align="left">It is the same thing as when Jesus said: 'Pick up your 
          cross.' We've got to bear the cross: the whole symbol of surrendering, 
          rather than using his powers to fly up into the sky. We turn to pain 
          and look right at it, feel it and investigate it: 'What is it?' Notice 
          how thoughts say, 'This is pain, this is horrible, I can't take this 
          any more.' We begin to watch the nature of these ideas that we tack 
          onto the pain: making it my pain, and unendurable.</p>
        <p align="left">Mysteriously, once 
          we start to look at pain it changes too, because it's not a solid thing. 
          So this is what the physicists are learning: just the act of observing 
          something is actually participating in changing it. By looking at suffering, 
          we're actually part of the transformation of it. Understanding it, standing 
          under it, bearing with it, we become free from false notions of pain 
          and pleasure. By investigating it, already we see it as something that 
          appears to us, and then dispassion arises.</p>
        <p align="left">Now, what about the kind 
          of action you're talking about? Buddhists are encouraged to be open 
          and see what needs to be done, but not to look too far away too soon. 
          It's easy to get fired up about doing something 'important', but what 
          about the ordinary things like getting along with our family, and business 
          companions? If we do not have time for these things, then our work becomes 
          misguided. We may be talking about harmony and peace, but have not yet 
          dealt with the basic problem.</p>
        <p align="left">So yes: as we meditate and learn a proper 
          perspective on things, we learn to do whatever we can do. Depending 
          on our abilities and the situation we're in, we dedicate our lives to 
          being of benefit to the whole. As a Buddhist monk there are certain 
          things I can do and certain things I can't. My job as a monk is to learn 
          to live simply: eating very simply, having simple robes, learning to 
          rely on that which is offered. Also learning to be available for whoever 
          comes, to develop a willingness to be interrupted. That's being just 
          one tiny cog in this whole cosmos.</p>
        <p align="left">When each person starts to contemplate 
          what Right Speech is, and what Right Livelihood is, they find from their 
          own heart the most appropriate way to be of benefit to the whole. And 
          at the same time, they're not forgetting to be mindful and attentive. 
          Mindfulness is that which sees that what we do is kept in balance -- 
          sees that we're not being guided by Wrong View.</p>
        <p align="left">It's a slow process 
          maybe, but it encourages each of us to grow up. We learn to use the 
          wisdom we have, to open up from being concerned with just this body 
          or just this family, or just this country, or just this political party. 
          If we just take sides with one little group, it can lead to so much 
          trouble. But the open mind simply senses suffering wherever it happens 
          to be, and makes an effort to alleviate it.</p>
        <p align="left">Yes, it's a crime that 
          the world has so much suffering in it now. We have so much power and 
          yet we haven't alleviated a lot of the basic problems. But the problems 
          are not going to be solved by trying to force people. They'll be solved 
          by really giving attention to them and each person doing what they can.</p>
        <p align="left">Q: 
          Is it really a question of understanding yourself before you can help 
          anybody else?</p>
        <p align="left">There's a problem in the logic in that. When you write 
          it down in a sentence it sounds like you have to do all the self-understanding 
          first, and then, after you've become a Buddha, go out and help people; 
          and before that you can't do anything. Really it doesn't work that way. 
          Both aspects work together all the time. In my own case when I was in 
          Thailand I used to feel really good being someone who was helpful in 
          the monastery -- helping my teacher, helping all the monks do yoga, always 
          running around doing something 'helpful'. Then when I became ill and 
          unable to do anything, I was totally incapable of being at peace with 
          things. There was no real wisdom. A lot of my action had been coming 
          from desperation. This desperation had actually tainted some of what 
          I was doing.</p>
        <p align="left">This is why in Buddhism we always talk about balance, 
          and the importance of having a regular time for real quietude. Just 
          how much time one spends being quiet is up to each person -- a minute, 
          or just five minutes of sitting down and being still is useful. Then 
          we can notice the pull of what we think we have to do; the guilt of 
          thinking we're being selfish -- or whatever there is. Getting those feelings 
          in perspective -- seeing that which is running us around all the time, 
          puts us in a better position for understanding life.</p>
        <p align="left">If we wait around 
          until we're perfectly enlightened -- I tell you what, I wouldn't be here 
          tonight talking to you all! You'd have to wait until the cows come home, 
          and they wouldn't be coming home! Because there's always another doubt 
          that comes in: maybe I'm not ready, yet.</p>
        <p align="left">If the thought comes: 'Am 
          I ready yet?', I see that as a thought -- right here and now. If, when 
          I'm meditating that thought comes, I see that it has a beginning ... 
          'Am I ready yet?'... and that that thought has an end; and noticing 
          that when that thought ends, there's peace in the mind. When I can see 
          that the thought is just a thought which comes and goes, I can see it 
          as a changing condition in the mind. I don't have to make a problem 
          out of it any more. I don't have to wait for the time when there are 
          no more doubting thoughts. I just know it's a doubting thought and</p>
        <p align="left">I 
          can offer what I'm able to. This brings forth patience and equanimity. 
          And this is what we can do in an immediate sense.</p>
        <p align="left">How many times has 
          someone passed us on the road too quickly and we've let out a whole 
          chain of profanities? So we start with the little things. If we want 
          to be like Jesus and save the world, that's fine, but where have we 
          got to start? The Buddha started with the little things; he said, let's 
          be honest, climb the tree from the bottom, you don't jump into Nibbana, 
          you don't jump into God; you first learn to be patient with what's already 
          happening -- like a headache. Then one is building up mindfulness in 
          this present moment.</p>
        <p align="left">Q: Is it going to lead to a universal impracticality 
          if we take up Buddhism? ... How do you feel about going into our technological 
          world and making the changes that are needed?</p>
        <p align="left">One thing I need to say 
          is that it isn't really for me to make proclamations about what 'Buddhists' 
          think and feel. Are such statements really useful? In Buddhism the whole 
          teaching is about a path towards Awakening. Each of us is seeing this 
          room from a different perspective, and so for me to tell others what 
          they should see or do is basically impossible.</p>
        <p align="left">As a general reflection, 
          though, I feel we have tremendous power now to manipulate things. We 
          have the ability to create all sorts of things through science, and 
          we're beginning to understand some of the laws of how materials -- what 
          we call the 'aggregate of form' -- how these operate. We have great power 
          to change things, to move things, to dig up the earth, to send people 
          to the Moon, to blow up the planet. We have tremendous abilities to 
          produce. Our language and society is all about being productive.</p>
        <p align="left">Well, 
          the religious impulse realises that we have gone too far into the world 
          of manipulating things to become as we want them. There's an idea that 
          if we eradicate enough diseases through this marvellous science then 
          we'll be disease-free, pain-free, trouble-free, and then we'll be happy. 
          But that's a materialistic extreme. And when we go to an extreme we 
          only see life as it could be -- through concepts. There's tremendous 
          power in the desire to create. But this desire to make things be as 
          we want them can also become very cruel. Although we have this tremendous 
          power, we have still hardly moved in our ability to get along with one 
          another -- we're still fighting, getting separated, and misunderstanding 
          each other.</p>
        <p align="left">So the religious impulse tells us how to appreciate things. 
          It talks about opening the heart. When we were children and went to 
          the seashore we would look at the vastness with our eyes wide open. 
          Wind blowing in ... thousands of waves ... the roar of the sea ... The 
          mind had no way to manipulate that vastness. So when our mind is open, 
          we're just listening and watching. And in that state of wonder, the 
          state of awe, the state of communion, we're actually appreciating. Now 
          that's the state of love, the state of truly being with something as 
          it is, whether it's horrible or pleasant. And in that state we are a 
          part of the whole thing -- we are connected to the whole.</p>
        <p align="left">But that can 
          also become an extreme! What are we going to do about all that needs 
          to be done if we're attached to being in a state of awe? So it's not 
          a matter of one extreme or the other.</p>
        <p align="left">There's nothing good or evil 
          about modern medicine, or nuclear technology, or any of these things. 
          But often the human minds that are using them have become divorced from 
          reality. So rather than make proclamations about what people should 
          do in the active sense, I'd encourage everyone to open up to life ... 
          and then we start to see how we actually feel about pain -- 'I don't 
          like it.' When compassion arises we are able to suffer with others; 
          we actually vibrate with them. We truly realize that they're suffering 
          and then we're simply not inclined to do things that hurt. But if you 
          just tell someone 'don't do that', 'be compassionate', such issuing 
          proclamations is using force. You might get people to act the way you 
          want them to, but there would still be avijja -- ignorance. So the Buddha 
          taught that the source of the entire problem is ignorance. We point 
          at that, and out of awareness naturally comes forth compassion -- that 
          being at one with the whole.</p>
