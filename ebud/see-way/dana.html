        <p align="left">Venerable Vajiro (Phil Gunton) was born in Kuala Lumpur, 
          Malaysia, in 1953. He was educated at Lancing College in England, and 
          went on to study Economics at Bath University. Upon graduating in 1974, 
          he took up a career in accountancy. During this period, a friend encouraged 
          him to go on a ten-day meditation retreat with John Coleman at the Oakenholt 
          Buddhist Centre near Oxford. He attended further retreats there in 1976 
          and 1977.<br>
          Hearing about the visit Ajahn Chah and Ajahn Sumedho made to Oakenholt 
          in 1977, he went to meet them at the Hampstead Vihara. He eventually 
          moved next door to the vihara, while continuing his training as an accountant. 
          In 1978, however, he asked to join the community as an anagarika; he 
          then stayed a while at Chithurst, before travelling to Wat Pah Pong 
          in Thailand. He became a samanera there in 1979, and received upasampada 
          from Ajahn Chah the following year.<br>
          Venerable Vajiro returned to England in 1984, and assisted with the 
          establishment of Amaravati Buddhist Centre. He presently resides at 
          Chithurst Monastery.</p>

        <p align="left"> THE FEELING OF SEPARATION is an experience that all living 
          beings have. We come across it within ourselves and can see it in animals 
          also. There's a recognition that 'this' is separate from 'that'; this 
          body is separate from that one. And we make various attempts to get 
          over this sense of separation. Perhaps the most primitive reaction to 
          it, is 'taking'. We take from the environment around us -- absorbing 
          into ourselves. We take food and we take power. This 'taking' can be 
          one way of trying to cope with the sense of separation.</p>
        <p align="left">A slightly 
          more refined way of trying to cope with this experience is 'making a 
          bargain', one being with another -- a sort of agreement. We give something 
          to get something in return: 'If I give this much, then I expect that 
          much back'. Using such bargaining structures is perhaps the most common 
          way we relate with each other as humans -- the shopping we do, agreements 
          we make with our spouse, or with the children: 'I'll give you this and 
          you give me that.' So this can be another way of dealing with this feeling 
          of separateness.</p>
        <p align="left">Then there is sharing. That's a little bit more open, 
          isn't it? There's a recognition of the separation of one being from 
          an other, and a willingness to share. In this way both parties are benefiting 
          from the arrangement. It's akin to a bargain, but it's a little more 
          spacious, both expecting some sort of enjoyment from it -- some sort 
          of gratification.</p>
        <p align="left">But with each of these ways of relating, there's 
          always reinforcement of the sense of separateness. With taking, with 
          bargaining, and even with sharing there's still a sense of one being 
          separate from the other. So its not really transcending or getting beyond 
          our separateness. This is where dana works so well. With dana or real 
          giving, real generosity, there is no expectation of return. It's not 
          a bargain, it's not even a sharing. It's not that we share something 
          with another, and keep some for ourselves. We actually give completely, 
          without expecting anything back.</p>
        <p align="left">A lot of our giving is not giving 
          completely. Its imperfect giving. But this is something that can be 
          worked on. We can consider how to perfect giving over a period of time. 
          It is the first of the 'Ten Paramitas'*. We understand from the texts 
          that it was the last of the ten that the Buddha perfected, but as Theravadin 
          Buddhists, we have it first on the list.</p>
        <p align="left">I think Ajahn Buddhadasa once 
          said that if we perfect one of the paramitas fully, then all the others 
          are perfected also. That's very helpful when considering dana. We can 
          see how if we practise giving without expecting anything in return, 
          all the paramitas can be fulfilled at that moment.</p>
        <p align="left">One has to use wisdom 
          -- pañña -- to know for example, the right time and place and the right 
          things to give. And to give honestly -- sacca -- requires that we look 
          at our intention clearly. And patience -- khanti: we must be patient 
          in the act of giving, and with our limitations in learning to give. 
          There's renunciation there too: we give something that we perceive as 
          being 'ours'. And we have to use energy -- viriya. Also, whenever we 
          give, there's the chance that our offering could be rejected, so we 
          must develop metta and upekkha. And we have to 'resolve' to do it; it 
          requires a determination to give -- this is developing adhitthana. Also, 
          resolving to share the merit of the act of generosity -- making a dedication.</p>
        <p align="left">Now 
          how can we notice these qualities -- giving, renunciation, honesty -- 
          the whole spectrum of perfections that can exist in that simple act 
          of giving? How do we really work with giving? When I was first in Thailand, 
          I remember that receiving generosity was not easy. As a strong young 
          man, walking on alms round and having the old village people come running 
          out to offer a little bit of rice, a piece of fruit, a couple of pieces 
          of palm sugar or whatever.... At times I thought: 'What on earth have 
          I done to deserve this? I should really be helping these old villagers.'</p>
        <p align="left">And 
          yet, for those people practising generosity, they felt it was a privilege. 
          You know, they'd be more annoyed if we didn't come on alms round. They 
          would be round at the monastery saying: 'Well, why didn't you come today? 
          Are you ill or something?' or 'You haven't been doing your duty.' I 
          remember talking to Ajahn Jagaro at the time about how I felt, and he 
          said: 'You'll never really learn how to give until you learn to receive, 
          and you'll never learn how to receive until you learn to give.'</p>
        <p align="left">There 
          are two sides to giving; there's receiving also. The gratitude -- the 
          appreciation of the spirit of giving. That doesn't necessarily mean 
          liking what is offered; but appreciating the loveliness of the act of 
          generosity -- the act of giving without expecting anything in return. 
          The humbling quality which comes with this gratitude is very helpful 
          in transcending the sense of separation. This helps in going beyond 
          the feeling of selfishness, of being separate.</p>
        <p align="left">We can give in many 
          ways, of course: give materially, food, shelter, medicine, clothing, 
          money.... We can give time, encouragement, kindness, love.... And all 
          of these can be bargained with, taken, shared, or given. But it's not 
          the quantity, or the thing itself that's important. It's the attitude 
          of not expecting anything in return or not making some sort of agreement 
          about it. When we do give in this way, then we find that there's no 
          disappointment, and there's no fear either. There's no conceit and no 
          arrogance. There's just giving.</p>
        <p align="left">Eventually, we come to recognise the 
          'giving of attention' -- giving attention to 'this' moment and not expecting 
          anything from it. We say that in Buddhist practice, all you have to 
          do is 'be mindful'. What this actually means is that that is all we 
          are doing; mindfulness is all that is happening. We're not expecting 
          something back. To expect a return would be striking a bargain; 'giving' 
          would not be perfected, and the sense of separation would not be transcended.</p>
        <p align="left">Giving 
          attention to the moment is what we can practise all the time. Giving 
          attention to the breath, not expecting anything from the breath. Giving 
          attention to the posture, to the movements of the body. Giving attention 
          throughout our life is a way of practising generosity: not expecting 
          anything in return, not bargaining, not taking anything, not even sharing, 
          just giving. That giving doesn't indulge and doesn't repress. It doesn't 
          seek anything or try to get rid of anything. With such generosity, with 
          dana, we can see the possibility of the perfection of humanity.</p>
        <p align="left">Classifying 
          these ways of relating into taking, bargaining, sharing and giving may 
          not come directly from the scriptures, but I hope it is helpful in your 
          practice. To me, 'giving' is the beginning and the end of the religious 
          life.</p>
        <p align="left">*The Ten Paramitas ['virtues' or 'perfections'] are: generosity, 
          moral discipline, renunciation, wisdom, energy, honesty, determination, 
          patience, loving-kindness, and equanimity.</p>
