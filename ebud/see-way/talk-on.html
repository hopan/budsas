        <p>Venerable Gavesako (Mitsuo Shibahashi) was born in Japan in 1951. An 
          experienced mountaineer, he formed part of a team planning to climb 
          in the Himalayas. Having arrived in India before the rest of his party 
          in order to acclimatise, he decided to stay at an Indian ashram. By 
          the time the party arrived, his interest in meditation had eclipsed 
          his former interest in climbing, and he decided to stay on at the ashram, 
          spending two years there in all. As it turned out, the climbing party 
          met with disaster when some of its members were killed in an avalanche.<br>
          Eventually visa difficulties forced him to move to Thailand, where he 
          hoped to continue to develop his meditation practice. Having met Western 
          monks in Bangkok he went up to Wat Pah Pong and was ordained as a bhikkhu 
          by Ajahn Chah in 1975. He has done many periods of tudong practice, 
          and has spent long periods looking after Ajahn Chah in the later years 
          of his illness.<br>
          In 1989 he was invited back to Japan to spend several months teaching 
          meditation.</p>

        <p align="left"> Taking suffering as our teacher.</p>
        <p align="left">DON'T DESPISE SUFFERING; DON'T RUN A WAY FROM IT or be 
          afraid. Suffering warns us not to be complacent. Be wise. Know and see 
          things as they really are; see the truth. If we can bear with it, then 
          the more suffering the better. This way we won't have to be afraid of 
          anything, but we must be patient and persistent. We must be daring. 
          Wherever there is suffering, observe it closely. Suffering needs to 
          be recognised. We must study it and look into it. If we observe like 
          this we will become aware of desire tanha and attachment upadana. Desire 
          and attachment are what cause suffering, and this same desire and attachment 
          blind us to suffering. We suffer but we don't see suffering. So we must 
          make our minds resolute, go right inward in order to see suffering. 
          When we see it we will know it clearly. There will arise ñana-dassana, 
          knowledge and vision according to reality; knowledge that it is only 
          suffering that arises, only suffering that exists, and only suffering 
          that ceases. Other than suffering, nothing arises and nothing ceases.</p>
        <p align="left">Sabbe dhamma nalam. abhinivesaya: all things are not worthy 
          of clinging to. Sabbe dhamma anatta: all things are not self.</p>
        <p align="left">Whatever arises must in time cease. If we can leave things 
          be, let suffering go, neither delighting nor despising, there will be 
          no suffering; or if there is, it will be just as if there isn't.</p>
        <p align="left">Depression is a guest.</p>
        <p align="left">This feeling of depression has just come for a visit; 
          soon it will leave. Having gone it will come again. If we don't attach 
          to it, it won't stay. So we don't delight in following our moods. When 
          guests come, if we drive them away they'll become angry; but we mustn't 
          be too welcoming either, or they will settle down to stay! Just let 
          them be and they will leave of their own accord. They're only visitors, 
          they are not residents. If they come, we know thus: 'Oh, they've come. 
          ' We note it and then leave them be. We establish our mind in equanimity. 
          Centre your mind, not delighting, not despising, not being frightened; 
          neither taking nor rejecting, just keep knowing. The goal is non-suffering: 
          a mind that is calm, clean and clear.</p>
        <p align="left">Have you ever experienced so much suffering that you wanted 
          to die? </p>
        <p align="left">If we're suffering or depressed, we simply know that suffering 
          or depression exists. It' s not necessary for thoughts to proliferate 
          on it. We are patient and observe those feelings not taking delight 
          in them, and not rejecting them either. Holding our mind still, not 
          letting it lean to the right or to the left. Centring our mind. Just 
          knowing. Sitting, just know; walking, just know. If we keep observing 
          we will begin to understand more clearly. We will see that these things 
          in themselves are empty. We will see that both suffering and depression 
          are merely sensations; they are not our self nor do they belong to us. 
          It is only clinging: clinging to the idea that one is depressed, to 
          the idea that one is suffering. Actually those things can change, and 
          they will change of themselves when new sensations arise. They are all 
          aniccam., dukkham., anatta uncertain, unsatisfactory and not-self.</p>
        <p align="left">We suffer because we cling.</p>
        <p align="left">We experience suffering and depression only because of 
          clinging and attachment. We must lift our minds to do the work of enquiry 
          using patience and forbearance. If we closely observe the impermanent 
          nature of these feelings, in due course we will see they do change. 
          When we see this, we will know what is meant by sabbe dhamma anatta 
          all things are not-self. Then we will see clearly.</p>
        <p align="left">Don't think that it' s you that is suffering. </p>
        <p align="left">Suffering is not you; you are not suffering. Suffering 
          doesn't abide within you, and you do not abide in suffering. Suffering 
          arises, exists and ceases. We have the task of simply knowing that suffering 
          arises, knowing that suffering exists, and knowing that suffering ceases. 
          Regardless of however much suffering there may be, if we can observe 
          in this way we will be able to bear with it; we must endure. A wise 
          person can endure suffering.</p>
        <p align="left">Dhamma is taking things 50%.</p>
        <p align="left">If we have thoughts like: 'That person is wrong; they 
          shouldn't have done such a thing;' remember first that we may also be 
          wrong; they may not be wrong at all. Take it only 50%. Considering like 
          this we won't allow our thoughts to cause us to suffer.</p>
        <p align="left">If someone tells us: 'They've been saying horrible things 
          about you,' or 'Such and such a person is really awful,' don't believe 
          it 1 00% but don't reject it either. Take it only 50%. Don't get caught 
          in reacting and feeling unhappy. They may not have actually said such 
          things; the person relating the stories may just be giving their own 
          version. Don't act on other people' s thoughts. Often we become angry 
          and upset for no reason other than our own thinking. Be mindful and 
          consider carefully before taking action.</p>
        <p align="left">If you are doing something for your partner and at the 
          same time thinking: 'This is totally unreasonable. Why did they ask 
          me to do such a thing... ?', this is not right. Don't react like that. 
          Don't hold onto such feelings just because it appears unreasonable. 
          They may not have meant what you thought they meant. Thoughts are all 
          aniccam, uncertain; they change. Your partner may change their mind; 
          they may have misinterpreted their own thoughts or have not meant what 
          they said. Don't allow these feelings to confuse you. If we are mindful, 
          we won't suffer. Don't believe anything 100%; not ourselves, not another, 
          not any condition. Don't be upset or frightened. Don't be surprised 
          at anything you hear or see. Remember: everything is uncertain; only 
          take it 50%. </p>
        <p align="left">If you are still suffering, you must look even closer.</p>
        <p align="left">Contemplate the Four Noble Truths regularly. If we are 
          still suffering it means we still don't have Right View. When suffering 
          arises, we look inward, not outwards and we don't blame others. We just 
          look at our own body and mind. Look and see how desire and attachment 
          are the cause of suffering. They are Mara; our most bitter enemies. 
          Tackle those thoughts with persistence. Know those thoughts. When we 
          know them for what they are, we will be untroubled. We won't become 
          upset. We will no longer be deceived by these things and won't cling 
          to them. Instead, there will be established the One Who Knows, the Awakened 
          One, the Radiant One. There! That's the Buddha. You don't have to search 
          elsewhere. Even if you have to pay for this with your life, it' s worth 
          it. </p>
        <p align="left">We must have Right Thought and Right View.</p>
        <p align="left">Whatever we are doing, we must have mindfulness, clear 
          comprehension, and satisfaction. If we are sweeping the floor, the act 
          of sweeping the floor is the most important thing in the world; anything 
          else is of no importance. When we are sweeping the floor, we know we 
          are sweeping the floor we are mindful of the act of sweeping the floor. 
          We must do it with total satisfaction.</p>
        <p align="left">If we are squeezing the juice from oranges, the act of 
          squeezing the juice from oranges is the most important thing in the 
          world; anything else is of no importance. When we are squeezing the 
          juice of oranges, we know that we are squeezing the juice of oranges. 
          We are mindful of the act of squeezing the juice of oranges. We must 
          do it with total satisfaction.</p>
        <p align="left">Whatever it is that we are doing, sweeping the floor, 
          squeezing juice, cleaning the bathroom; this is our practice. We must 
          not think that we do what we do just to please others. Do not think 
          that we have to do it. Do not be worried by what other people might 
          think. We do that which it is our duty to do. And we always do our best. 
          If we look at things this way, if we think in this way, then we won't 
          suffer. We will know peace. We will have great happiness all the time. 
          This is Right Thought and Right View.</p>
