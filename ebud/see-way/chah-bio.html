          VENERABLE AJAHN CHAH was born on June 17, 1918 in a small village near 
          the town of Ubon Rajathani, North East Thailand.</p>
        <p>After finishing his basic schooling, he spent three years as a novice 
          before returning to lay life to help his parents on the farm. At the 
          age of twenty, however, he decided to resume monastic life, and on April 
          26, 1939 he received upasampada (bhikkhu ordination).</p>
        <p>Ajahn Chah's early monastic life followed a traditional pattern, of 
          studying Buddhist teachings and the Pali scriptural language. In his 
          fifth year his father fell seriously ill and died, a blunt reminder 
          of the frailty and precariousness of human life. It caused him to think 
          deeply about life's real purpose, for although he had studied extensively 
          and gained some proficiency in Pali, he seemed no nearer to a personal 
          understanding of the end of suffering. Feelings of disenchantment set 
          in, and finally (in 1946) he abandoned his studies and set off on mendicant 
          pilgrimage.</p>
        <p>He walked some 400 km to Central Thailand, sleeping in forests and 
          gathering alms food in the villages on the way. He took up residence 
          in a monastery where the vinaya (monastic discipline) was carefully 
          studied and practised. While there he was told about Venerable Ajahn 
          Mun Buridatto, a most highly respected Meditation Master. Keen to meet 
          such an accomplished teacher, Ajahn Chah set off on foot for the North 
          East in search of him.</p>
        <p>At this time Ajahn Chah was wrestling with a crucial problem. He had 
          studied the teachings on morality, meditation and wisdom, which the 
          texts presented in minute and refined detail, but he could not see how 
          they could actually be put into practice. Ajahn Mun told him that although 
          the teachings are indeed extensive, at their heart they are very simple. 
          With mindfulness established, if it is seen that everything arises in 
          the heart-mind . . . right there is the true path of practice. This 
          succinct and direct teaching was a revelation for Ajahn Chah, and transformed 
          his approach to practice. The Way was clear. </p>
        <p>For the next seven years Ajahn Chah practised in the style of the austere 
          Forest Tradition, wandering through the countryside in quest of quiet 
          and secluded places for developing meditation. He lived in tiger- and 
          cobra-infested jungles, using reflections on death to penetrate to the 
          true meaning of life. On one occasion he practised in a cremation ground, 
          to challenge and eventually overcome his fear of death. Then, as he 
          sat cold and drenched in a rain storm, he faced the utter desolation 
          and loneliness of a homeless monk.</p>
        <p>In 1954, after years of wandering, he was invited back to his home 
          village. He settled close by, in a fever-ridden, haunted forest called 
          'Pah Pong'. Despite the hardships of malaria, poor shelter and sparse 
          food, disciples gathered around him in increasing numbers. The monastery 
          which is now known as Wat Pah Pong began there, and eventually branch 
          monasteries were also established elsewhere.</p>
        <p>In 1967 an American monk came to stay at Wat Pah Pong. The newly ordained 
          Venerable Sumedho had just spent his fist vassa ('Rains' retreat) practising 
          intensive meditation at a monastery near the Laotian border. Although 
          his efforts had borne some fruit, Venerable Sumedho realised that he 
          needed a teacher who could train him in all aspects of monastic life. 
          By chance, one of Ajahn Chah's monks -- one who happened to speak a little 
          English! -- visited the monastery where Venerable Sumedho was staying. 
          Upon hearing about Ajahn Chah, he asked to take leave of his preceptor, 
          and went back to Wat Pah Pong with the monk.</p>
        <p>Ajahn Chah willingly accepted the new disciple, but insisted that he 
          receive no special allowances for being a Westerner. He would have to 
          eat the same simple alms food and practise in the same way as any other 
          monk at Wat Pah Pong.</p>
        <p>The training there was quite harsh and forbidding. Ajahn Chah often 
          pushed his monks to their limits, to test their powers of endurance 
          so that they would develop patience and resolution. He sometimes initiated 
          long and seemingly pointless work projects, in order to frustrate their 
          attachment to tranquillity. The emphasis was always on surrender to 
          the way things are, and great stress was placed upon strict observance 
          of the vinaya.</p>
        <p>In the course of events, other Westerners came through Wat Pah Pong. 
          By the time Venerable Sumedho was a bhikkhu of five vassas, and Ajahn 
          Chah considered him competent enough to teach, some of these new monks 
          had also decided to stay and train there.</p>
        <p>In the hot season of 1975, Venerable Sumedho and a handful of Western 
          bhikkhus spent some time living in a forest not far from Wat Pah Pong. 
          The local villagers there asked them to stay on, and Ajahn Chah consented. 
          Thus Wat Pah Nanachat ('International Forest Monastery') came into being, 
          and Venerable Sumedho became the abbot of the first monastery in Thailand 
          to be run by and for English-speaking monks.</p>
        <p>In 1977, Ajahn Chah was invited to visit Britain by the English Sangha 
          Trust, a charity with the aim of establishing a locally-resident Buddhist 
          Sangha. He took Venerable Sumedho and Venerable Khemadhammo along, and 
          seeing the serious interest there, left them in London at the Hampstead 
          Vihara (with two of his other Western disciples who were then visiting 
          Europe).</p>
        <p>He returned to Britain in 1979, at which time the monks were leaving 
          London to begin Chithurst Buddhist Monastery in Sussex. He then went 
          on to America and Canada to visit and teach.</p>
        <p>After this trip, and again in 1981, Ajahn Chah spent the 'Rains' away 
          from Wat Pah Pong, since his health was failing due to the debilitating 
          effects of diabetes. As his illness worsened, he would use his body 
          as a teaching, a living example of the impermanence of all things. He 
          constantly reminded people to endeavour to find a true refuge within 
          themselves, since he would not be able to teach for very much longer.</p>
        <p>Before the end of the 'Rains' of 1981, he was taken to Bangkok for 
          an operation; it, however, did little to improve his condition. Within 
          a few months he stopped talking, and gradually he lost control of his 
          limbs until he was virtually paralysed and bed-ridden. From then on, 
          he was diligently and lovingly nursed and attended by devoted disciples, 
          grateful for the occasion to offer service to the teacher who so patiently 
          and compassionately showed the Way to so many.</p>
