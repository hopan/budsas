        <p>Venerable Khemadhammo (Alan Adams) was born in Portsmouth, England 
          in 1944, and trained at drama school to become an actor. In his seven-year 
          acting career he travelled worldwide (including a 14,000-mile tour of 
          the U.S.) and spent three years with the National Theatre Company. Becoming 
          interested in Buddhism, he eventually decided to go to Thailand to become 
          a bhikkhu.<br>
          In 1971 he became a samanera at Wat Mahathat with Tan Chao Khun Demp 
          Siddhumani. One year later he went to Wat Pah Pong, and received -- upasampada 
          -- (1972). He accompanied Ajahn Chah and Ajahn Sumedho to England in 
          1977, taking up residence at the Hampstead Vihara. During this time 
          he developed an interest in working with prisoners, which Ajahn Chah 
          encouraged. This work has developed steadily over the years, and in 
          1984 Venerable Khemadhammo formed a Buddhist prison chaplaincy organization, 
          'Angulimala'. Officially recognized by the Home Office, its patrons 
          include Venerable Dr. Saddhatissa, Venerable Sangharakshita, Ajahn Sumedho 
          and Lord Avebury.<br>
          Venerable Khemadhammo spent five years at a vihara which he founded 
          on the Isle of Wight, during which time he featured in the BBC television 
          documentary 'In More Ways Than One'. In 1985 he moved to his current 
          residence, the Forest Hermitage, in Warwickshire. A stupa was built 
          there in 1988, known as the 'English Shwe Dagon'. Presently he lives 
          with several other bhikkhus, continuing to visit prisons, teach meditation, 
          and lecture regularly on Buddhism for Warwick University's Open University 
          Programme.</p>

        <p align="left"> PAIN AND SUFFERING ARE ONLY TOO WELL KNOWN to require 
          much of an introduction. Suffering describes the experience of varying 
          degrees of discomfort, and pain is the alarm which forces us to attend 
          to that discomfort. Neither the experience nor the alarm are pleasant 
          and, naturally, we would all prefer a world in which neither existed. 
          The search for perfect health, or for a system whereby perfect health 
          might be attained, is a response to this wish for a more satisfactory 
          state of affairs.</p>
        <p align="left">Let us think of a house in which many important and valuable 
          objects are kept and which is equipped with the very latest electronic 
          alarm system. While all is left undisturbed the system remains quiet. 
          There may be the minor irritation of having to check and maintain it 
          and it may occasionally raise a false alarm, but essentially it is silent 
          and of no trouble to the owner. Then suddenly, quite unexpectedly, after 
          months or years of inactivity, one is wrenched from one's slumber by 
          the searing pain of bells, sirens and flashing lights and one knows 
          that something is wrong -- one's treasure is being plundered. How do 
          you respond to that? Some people turn over and go back to sleep; some 
          reach for the bottle, and drug themselves into oblivion; some panic; 
          and some quietly set about dealing with the intrusion. The last is the 
          proper response to pain.</p>
        <p align="left">Now there are two basic approaches: you can fight to get 
          your valuables back, the intruder captured and removed, the status quo 
          restored and the alarm reset; or you can try to accept and understand 
          what has happened. If you only do the former, the best you can achieve 
          is simply to get back to where you started, but with less security. 
          Despite your efforts, your attachments have been threatened and it could 
          happen again -- you've not only gained nothing, but you're losing ground. 
          Conversely, if you choose the latter response, you're bound to benefit. 
          You may not restore your possessions, but you will be encouraging a 
          healthy attitude which, if fully developed, will mean that never again 
          can alarm bells spoil your repose. Tempting, isn't it?</p>
        <p align="left">My Buddhist monastic training, which has included detailed 
          contemplation of the body, has led me to have little sympathy with health 
          regimes, special diets and the like, and in the past I've occasionally 
          enjoyed tweaking a few attachments with dietary advice based on plenty 
          of jam doughnuts. The Buddha has pointed out that it is sheer foolishness 
          to claim that one's body is healthy even for a moment -- in this ever-changing 
          phenomenon, there is always something not quite right. Nevertheless, 
          you will find that the Buddha is referred to as the 'peerless physician', 
          whose concern is the cure of all greed, hatred, and delusion -- the ending 
          of real suffering.</p>
        <p align="left">That analogy is frequently played on and extended. At 
          the opening ceremony of The Forest Hermitage, one of our most senior 
          monks took it up again and compared this place to a small hospital, 
          with myself as the house surgeon. What I am saying, then, is that there 
          is health and Health: the former has its place, but in the long run 
          is futile; while the latter must surely become the purpose of living.</p>
        <p align="left">Of course, by all means take care of your body, but reflect 
          that whatever you do it may still be easily broken and one day it is 
          sure to die. Of the two, a healthy mind is of much more use than a healthy 
          body. If you're in wondrous physical shape, but your mind is disordered, 
          you're in bad trouble. But if your body is wasted, eaten up with disease 
          or otherwise beyond repair, and your mind is bright with wisdom, you'll 
          be all right.</p>
        <p align="left">Let's go back to the analogy of the house: to sit in your 
          house, jealously guarding its contents, polishing and improving the 
          alarm system, equates with the ordinary health of the special diets 
          and fitness regimes; to understand, to develop a healthy attitude, is 
          real Health. Real Health is worthy of us. It comes through facing up 
          to life, including pain and suffering, observing it, investigating it 
          and comprehending its nature and its source. I think it's often obvious 
          that those who've suffered have grown; but we must be careful, as it's 
          not necessarily the case. It's not pain alone that generates the growth, 
          it's how you view and use your experience. You must have the proper 
          response -- then and only then, will wisdom emerge out of suffering.</p>
        <p align="left">I remember being told once by an experienced burglar that 
          he enjoyed the challenge of an elaborate alarm system; and I suspect 
          he might also have said that where there was an alarm, he knew there 
          was something worth having -- and the more complex the alarm, the more 
          valuable and desirable were the things to steal. Think about it: if 
          you haven't got anything or if you have no attachment to things surrounding 
          you, you don't need any protection. If they're there, fine; if they're 
          not there, fine! And you sit undisturbed, content with things as they 
          are. A healthy attitude, then, is found in a mind that has matured and 
          grown out of desire and attachment -- the mind is cool and there are 
          no more alarms to ring. In other words, there is no more pain and suffering.</p>
        <p align="left">The Buddha referred to twelve kinds of suffering, which 
          may be reduced to three, and ultimately to one. The twelve are: birth, 
          decay, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, despair, association 
          with the unpleasant, separation from the beloved, not to get what one 
          desires, and the Five Aggregates. Reduced to three, there are: the ordinary 
          suffering of aches and pains, the suffering dependent on impermanence, 
          and the discomfort of attachment to the Five Aggregates. Reduced to 
          one, it is conditioned existence or just the Five Aggregates that is 
          suffering.</p>
        <p align="left">Most of this is quite obvious, but perhaps I'd better 
          enlarge on these mysterious Five Aggregates, which is how Buddhism analyses 
          a person. They are: Form, Feeling, Perception, Habitual Tendencies, 
          and Consciousness, none of which are stable, lasting or possessed of 
          any inherent self-hood. We sometimes refer to them as a psycho-physical 
          process. Form obviously corresponds to the body: it is just matter, 
          numerous particles vibrating together, in the process of becoming and 
          breaking up, but without any ability to know an object. The remaining 
          four -- feeling, perception, habitual tendencies and consciousness -- 
          correspond to mind, and are capable of knowing an object. These Five 
          Aggregates are all dependent on other things, and exist in interdependence 
          with each other; as a human being, you don't have one without the others. 
          Together they create a formation -- a formation, which, like that of 
          geese or aircraft in the sky, is continually in a state of forming as 
          the components interact and respond to conditions.</p>
        <p align="left">Thus mind affects body and body affects mind. This formation 
          arise dependent on conditions, it grows or develops according to conditions 
          and persists where the conditions persist. For example, sight-consciousness 
          or seeing and the pleasure or pain, perception and other mental factors 
          that accompany a consciousness, depend on there being an object to be 
          seen, eyes and a contact between the two. You don't see without eyes, 
          you don't see what's behind you and you can't see anything if there's 
          nothing to be seen. If you develop awareness and the meditation that 
          produces insight, you will see that your world, the entire range of 
          your experience, is just the Five Aggregates; and that suffering depends 
          on your attachment to them -- an unhealthy attitude.</p>
        <p align="left">Our experiential world is a complex play of these aggregates: 
          consciousness, resting on its physical base, arise where there is an 
          object, and is always accompanied by feeling (liking, disliking or indifference), 
          and perception (recognising and marking the object), as well as a variety 
          of other habitual tendencies that colour the experience. This all happens 
          so quickly that an illusion, analogous to that produced when still pictures 
          or sound vibrations are run at a certain speed, results. This is the 
          illusion of self.</p>
        <p align="left">To be aware, you will need to slow down and watch yourself 
          carefully; then as you go on you will perceive that the phenomena that 
          flow unceasingly before you have no intrinsic substance, are constantly 
          on the move, and that to try to attach, grasp or reject them is bound 
          to be frustrating. Watching the procession of thoughts, feelings and 
          other experiences, self begins to drop out of the picture and attachment 
          to self is correspondingly reduced. There is a shift in attitude and 
          a disengagement. You are beginning to see things in their true nature. 
          This insight accumulates and this is how wisdom is established. Understanding 
          the way things are, there is contentment; you neither want them to be 
          otherwise nor are you attached -- thus, a healthy attitude.</p>
        <p align="left">In his first sermon, the Buddha spoke of Four Noble Truths 
          which he had to understand fully, work with and realize before his attainment 
          of enlightenment was complete. They are: suffering; craving, the origin 
          of suffering; the end of suffering; and the way to realise the end of 
          suffering. Buddhist therapy is essentially a response to suffering and 
          the complete method includes morality, mental training and wisdom.</p>
        <p align="left">For us, meditation is the principal exercise in mental 
          training, and means the process of calming and clarifying the mind. 
          If you can imagine a precious jewel at the bottom of a lake: when the 
          waters are turbulent, whipped up by the violence of the storm and the 
          confusing patterns of the wind, there's no chance of your being able 
          to look over the side of your boat and admire the brilliance of that 
          jewel. The water's stained with mud and sand, frothing and tipping your 
          boat this way and that, and the jewel is totally obscured. But when 
          the storm is over and the waters have become calm, and the mud and sand 
          has settled, then without difficulty you may pull across the lake and 
          looking over the side, be dazzled by the luminous intensity that now 
          shines forth unobstructed.</p>
        <p align="left">In the same way, the confused and turbulent mind obscures 
          one's inherent wisdom. Of course, working with the mind is not quite 
          as simple as the analogy of the jewel in the lake. After all, the absence 
          of wisdom encourages the turbulent mind and we cannot afford to sit 
          back and wait for nature to take its course and the mind to quieten 
          of itself. But, nevertheless, the training is composed of concentration 
          and insight, or calm and clear, which working together support each 
          other. At the Forest Hermitage the general advice that I give is to 
          calm the mind by concentrating on loving-kindness; followed by the practice 
          of vipassana, or insight meditation, which is developed through the 
          cultivation of mindfulness.</p>
        <p align="left">When sitting in meditation, you will experience pain. 
          It may be pins and needles or aching knees, or it may be an unpleasant 
          thought or memory. The way you use it depends on whether it is concentration 
          or insight that you are emphasising in your practice. In both cases 
          the pain is recognised, but when simply trying to concentrate and calm 
          your mind your duty is to avoid dwelling on that pain, by returning 
          to your meditation subject with greater and more intense concentration.</p>
        <p align="left">Using the loving-kindness practice, it may be helpful 
          to view the pain with loving-kindness; this softens your attitude to 
          the pain and brings you back to your meditation subject. Your use of 
          the pain in the concentration practice is simply as a resistance. You 
          will appreciate that working against resistances brings energy and sharpens 
          your attitude to whatever you are doing. Please be quite clear that 
          this is not a case of repression -- you do not try to deny your pain 
          nor even get rid of it -- you simply concentrate with greater intensity 
          on your meditation subject, spurred on by the resistance that your pain 
          has set up.</p>
        <p align="left">When developing insight, however, you use your pain by 
          being mindful of it and watching it. The insight practice is essentially 
          one in which a concentrated awareness is developed, with each and every 
          experience being subject to a bare knowing. There are various techniques 
          which help this process and it is best to familiarise yourself with 
          such a practice, if it interests you, under proper guidance. As soon 
          as pain is seen in this way it loses its power. Sometimes it disappears 
          altogether, but if not, as soon as you start relating to it as just 
          feeling, only sensations, you relax and the discomfort reduces. You 
          then start to examine it and you will find out that it's not PAIN, not 
          a static thing, but rather a shifting, ever-moving succession of experiences 
          that flow into and out of each other. You are now on the way to realising 
          insight. As you work with pain in this way, so you cope with it better 
          and you learn from it. Your pain can teach you a great deal: you will 
          see that it is never still for an instant, that you contribute to it 
          through your fear and dislike of it, that you even attach to it, and 
          that lurking behind it is that ignorant mind that always wants things 
          to be other than they are -- the unhealthy attitude. Suddenly such awfulness 
          is being turned to your advantage and you're winning.</p>
        <p align="left">This is the wonderful thing about insight practice; it 
          uses everything, brings everything alive and turns everything to advantage. 
          Whatever arises, it is your duty to observe it with bare attention. 
          Not doing anything with it, not giving in to the mind of desire and 
          wishing it were otherwise, but content with things as they are, mindful 
          and watchful. In daily life too, be mindful, watchful and content. Things 
          are as they are, they can't be otherwise. They might have been, but 
          they're not. They are as they are. In the future it might all be different, 
          but right now it's as it is and it's wonderful. The present is all we 
          really have and here we will find wisdom. So give up that gaining mind, 
          rest content, be mindful, and understanding the true nature of things, 
          be possessed of a healthy attitude. Let go and be happy.</p>
