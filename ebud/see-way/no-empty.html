        <p align="left">Venerable Amaro (Jeremy Horner) was born in Kent, England 
          in 1956. He studied Psychology and Physiology at Bedford College, University 
          of London. His first spiritual interest arose on reading the works of 
          Rudolph Steiner. Upon completing his degree, he had the chance to travel 
          to Asia -- a friend offered him work as a groom on a cargo plane transporting 
          racehorses to Malaysia.<br>
          He visited North-East Thailand on the recommendation of some people 
          he met while travelling. Looking for a place to stay a few nights (before 
          going on to Japan), he heard about Wat Pah Nanachat and its Western 
          monks. The visit was eventful -- he took an instant liking to the monks, 
          felt immediately at home, and decided to stay. He became an anagarika, 
          and then a samanera four months later (in 1978). The following year 
          he received upasampada from Ajahn Chah.<br>
          Venerable Amaro stayed in Thailand for two years before family illness 
          called him back to England. He then joined Ajahn Sumedho at the newly 
          established Chithurst Monastery. Once while in London, he decided to 
          look up a cousin of his whom he had never met: the illustrious scholar, 
          translator and president of the Pali Text Society, I.B. Horner. Unfortunately, 
          she died before a meeting between them could be arranged.<br>
          In 1983 Ajahn Sumedho asked him to take up residence at Harnham Vihara, 
          and he requested (and was given permission) to make his way there on 
          foot. He wrote a book about the 830-mile walk: Tudong -- the Long Road 
          North, in 1984.</p>

        <p align="left"> BEING ON A RETREAT LIKE THIS, a great sense of fellowship 
          develops: a sense of everybody being on the same journey. Even though 
          we come from an enormous variety of backgrounds, men and women, young 
          and old, we are all heading for the same place. This is something we 
          know in our hearts is true that even though we may have different names 
          for the goal of the spiritual life, something in us knows we are all 
          heading in the same direction.</p>
        <p align="left">The most important thing about religious 
          practice of any sort is that it is to be a process of awakening; it 
          must not get trapped into being an empty ideal that we worship, instead 
          of being a reality we open to. Many rivers of blood have been shed arguing 
          about different names for the goal: 'The Holy City', 'Union with Brahma', 
          'Kismet', 'Nibbana'. As long as there have been people there have been 
          ways of symbolising the state of peace, security and fulfilment. So, 
          if we can avoid getting caught up with the wording of the signpost ending 
          up hanging onto the signpost itself as long as there is the resolution 
          to make the journey, we will arrive, regardless of the name of the destination 
          we have used.</p>
        <p align="left">How could the goals be different? Whether one is brought 
          up a Christian, a Hindu or a Jew, as an English or an Asian person, 
          how could the fundamental nature of the mind be different? How could 
          it possibly be affected just by what we believe? Just as the nature 
          of water is not affected by the shape of the vessel into which it is 
          poured, so too the nature of Ultimate Truth the nationality and the 
          conditioning of the person in whom it is realised does not affect the 
          way it actually is.</p>
        <p align="left">It is very important to remain determined to make 
          the journey, to follow the signposts to awakening. The Buddha was extremely 
          careful in the way he taught, to account for the human tendency to wander 
          off the path. Our minds are so active and bright that we will always 
          find some fascinating things to get involved in along the way: interesting 
          palaces to visit, plants to investigate, people to chat with by the 
          road. So he kept pointing out to people the crucial need to make the 
          journey, rather than to just talk or think about it.</p>
        <p align="left">Around any religious 
          teaching, over the years, there seem to grow up an enormous quantity 
          of metaphysical and philosophical ideas; rites and rituals; traditions 
          of what to eat, how to arrange marriages and funerals; how to talk about 
          the different qualities of our minds and the different factors that 
          influence our lives. Although we might start off with basic symbols 
          to represent simple truths, in time they become things we worship in 
          themselves. The institution becomes more important than the people who 
          comprise it, and it is forgotten what the institution, and the symbol, 
          were actually for. We end up worshipping the signpost rather than allowing 
          it to point out the way to us.</p>
        <p align="left">To avoid this the Buddha kept his teaching 
          very simple. One day he was walking through a forest with his monks; 
          he picked up a handful of leaves and said: 'What do you think, bhikkhus, 
          are there more leaves in my hand or more leaves in the forest?' 'The 
          leaves in your hand are few and the leaves in the forest are many, 'they 
          replied. 'So too, 'said the Buddha, 'the things that I know are comparable 
          to the leaves in the forest, but that which I teach you is just as much 
          as I hold in my hand.'</p>
        <p align="left">All the Buddha knew in terms of how the world 
          works, the history of the universe, the astral realms, the mechanics 
          of nature in all its multifaceted complexity all this he laid aside. 
          He kept his teaching simply to that which was crucial to liberation.</p>
        <p align="left">Because 
          of this he refrained from getting into any kind of metaphysical discussion; 
          he would never engage in that. Whenever anyone would try to draw him 
          on such a point 'What was the Ultimate beginning?', 'What happens to 
          an enlightened being when he dies?' he would remain silent. He simply 
          would not pursue it. Firstly, because these things are all unimportant, 
          in that they do not lead directly to liberation; and secondly, to avoid 
          compounding the wrong views of the questioner. He used a very good simile 
          to explain this once: 'If I had a fire and put it out, and then I asked 
          you: Where has the fire gone north, south, east or west?, what would 
          you answer?' 'Well, it's a foolish question, because those things do 
          not apply. It's just gone out, it hasn't gone anywhere. 'The Buddha 
          replied: 'Exactly so the way you phrase the question assumes a particular 
          kind of answer. So to give any answer is to go along with your mistaken 
          view.'</p>
        <p align="left">So he would only teach that which related directly to what a 
          person can do in order to realise the Truth. Whenever he did talk about 
          Ultimate Reality, he would use the most impersonal and open terms: 'It 
          is wonderful; immanent, peaceful; the Unoriginated, Unconditioned' which 
          do not give a great deal to grab a hold of! It is not some 'thing' one 
          can externalise and idealise, but a quality one can open to and realise.</p>
        <p align="left">The 
          essence of all spiritual practice, in our human condition, is to learn 
          to look beyond the sensory world, learn to abide beyond perception. 
          One way that we can do this is to look upon life as something that flows 
          through the mind. Rather than thinking of oneself as a person who is 
          going places, consider these as images going through the mind. Right 
          now we have the image of the meditation hall, Amaravati; this is what 
          we can perceive. The sound of this voice; the feeling of sitting on 
          a cushion; the sense of sight; see that all these things flow through 
          the mind like a current. When Ajahn Sumedho went travelling recently 
          he said he made the determination before he left that he wasn't going 
          to go around the world, he was just going to let the world go through 
          his mind. Afterwards he said the result was very peaceful: he went everywhere, 
          saw everyone, did everything, but the sense of movement, of a person 
          heading towards somewhere, was absent; there was stillness in its place.</p>
        <p align="left">If 
          we stop looking upon our sensory experience as being so solid and absolute, 
          we see that there are just these perceptions, and the knowing the sense 
          of awareness and being. This is the way that the mind is liberated, 
          the way beyond birth and death. There was a woman staying here in January 
          who had terminal cancer, she came to die here as a nun. This was during 
          a monastic retreat period so we had a lot of opportunity to contemplate 
          the dying process. One afternoon, as I was doing some walking meditation, 
          it struck me very clearly that when you look upon your life as a succession 
          of images that the mind is aware of, then why should that be broken 
          by the moment of death? The body is something that is perceived in the 
          mind so, at the moment of death, if there has been awareness of the 
          body alive, then surely there will just be awareness of the body dead. 
          The body dies just another perception in the mind. What that mind is 
          attached to, where it goes, who it belongs to are all the north, south, 
          east and west of the matter. They are questions which do not really 
          apply.</p>
        <p align="left">This is being with the mind that is beyond birth and death being 
          that knowing, being Buddha. When you see a thought arising in your mind, 
          it appears, has its life span, and then it's gone. Though the birth 
          and death of the body are probably the most powerful experiences we 
          have in a human life, fundamentally there is no difference between them 
          and the perception of a thought. With meditation practice there is the 
          development of understanding how things come out of the void and go 
          back into the void again. The more familiar we get with this process, 
          the more the mysteries of existence resolve themselves. So it's not 
          as though you know the answer, in so many words, to, 'Where do I come 
          from, where do I go?', but you don't need to put it into words. You 
          know the mind out of which everything arises and into which everything 
          disappears.</p>
        <p align="left">By training yourself to just be that knowing, be that which 
          is the source and goal of all things, you see the fear of the unknown 
          dissolve. Death is frightening when we don't understand; but the more 
          one knows the mind, the more it' s no longer the unknown. There is no 
          more fear because you realise, with the death of the body, what is there 
          fundamentally different that could happen? How could it not just be 
          another thing that comes into the mind, that we bear with and then see 
          vanish? Since we know the mind before and after things have been born 
          into it, we know there is nothing to be frightened of.</p>
        <p align="left">In order to 
          be able to deal with life this way we have to develop an undiscriminating 
          attitude, welcoming everything that we experience. Welcoming the pleasant 
          is very easy; pleasure is what we like. But there are unpleasant qualities 
          that keep arising too: feelings of irritation and pride, desire, one's 
          inability to be a perfect human being welcoming all of that is a different 
          story, isn't it?</p>
        <p align="left">I remember talking with Ajahn Sumedho one day about 
          the practice of loving-kindness. 'It' s those foolish and petty, childish 
          emotional reactions I find hard to deal with. 'Right,' he replied, 'but 
          notice the way we describe them petty, foolish, childish does that sound 
          to you like metta? Does that set things up for you to accept life wholeheartedly? 
          Or does it show that you have already prejudged the whole experience? 
          Because that' s what I used to do. You have to welcome it all sincerely.'</p>
        <p align="left">As 
          I began to apply this advice I realised how much of my time had been 
          trying to fend off all those little imps and demons. All those wavelets 
          of desire, fear and discomfort; subtle feelings that had never been 
          very clear. Every time anything arose which brought a dismissive reaction 
          up in my mind, I would say, very carefully and deliberately: 'Oh, jealousy, 
          how nice of you to come! Have a seat. Pride! Hello... cup of tea?' The 
          effect on my mind was astonishing. I realised how much of a problem 
          I had been making out of my life so much judging and choosing over what 
          I wanted to arise in my thoughts.</p>
        <p align="left">I realised also that every time I 
          reacted negatively, pushing things away, that action implied that there 
          was something to fear. That this feeling or this thought was dangerous; 
          that it was going to really hurt me, or invade me; that it was something 
          that was really me and mine. As I began to welcome it all I realised 
          that when you accept everything, only then can you sense that, after 
          all, there is nothing to fear. None of it really belongs to a self or 
          comes from a self. It cannot touch the mind which knows, cannot affect 
          its nature. Whatever shape of vessel you pour the water into, with this 
          same total accommodation, the water changes to the shape of the bottle. 
          It doesn't say: 'I will not be poured into a square bottle, square bottles 
          are not my scene. Round bottles only, please!'</p>
        <p align="left">To push away or grasp 
          a hold of the beautiful and the ugly, the noble and the sordid, is just 
          as absurd really, isn't it?</p>
        <p align="left">When there is complete acceptance, there 
          is just the sense of being the knowing, being that which is aware of 
          all that comes through the mind. This is what the image of the Buddha 
          at the moment of enlightenment symbolises one often sees pictures of 
          the Buddha sitting under the Bodhi tree, with an aura of light around 
          him. Very still. Awake. And all about him there is every kind of alluring, 
          terrifying, heart-rending form imaginable the hordes of Mara. Despite 
          all his efforts, however, Mara fails to move the Buddha, and this is 
          the moment of the Buddha's enlightenment. He knew: the beautiful, the 
          terrifying, the sense of duty all of these were just images in the mind. 
          There is nothing one can grasp, there is nothing to fear, none of it 
          can really touch the mind.</p>
        <p align="left">Now this is a symbol, and whether or not 
          the incident occurred exactly as it is described is not as important 
          as what it symbolises. For one who practises the teaching, what 'Buddha' 
          means in our lives is more important than whether the Buddha Gotama 
          actually lived, taught and did all the things he is said to have done. 
          'Buddha' is that awakened nature of the mind, the heart of the mind. 
          That in you which is wise, which knows, which is clear and bright. And 
          that is what the Buddha on the night of his enlightenment represents 
          that knowing.</p>
        <p align="left">All the hordes of Mara these are just the thoughts and 
          feelings, hopes and fears, memories, pleasures and pains of daily activity. 
          These may not be as grand as the alluring daughters, the terrifying 
          demons or the tears of old King Suddhodana getting the children to school, 
          trying to please the boss, brushing your teeth but for us these are 
          the hordes of Mara. The images of daily life come pouring through the 
          mind but, if we are awake, we can see that none of it affects the mind' 
          s true nature that sense of stillness, knowing, spaciousness and clarity 
          which the Buddha represents.</p>
        <p align="left">Most of the time, however, we find ourselves 
          moving away from that point. That's our habitual reaction to the world 
          grasping after things or running away from things. I remember, when 
          I was a very small child, often trying to jump into the middle of my 
          shadow, but however hard I jumped I just landed on the shadows feet. 
          And I would run after my shadow and then jump but where would I land 
          up? Just in the same place all over again. And this is what we do with 
          our lives the things that we desire, it' s like running after shadows. 
          You try to catch hold, reaching for the desire so close, so close, and 
          then you grasp it and then... and you haven't really got it. Somehow 
          it's not what you expected, it's different, not what you really wanted.</p>
        <p align="left">And 
          then to run from your shadow to be afraid, you keep turning around: 
          'It's still behind me, run faster, got to get away. 'When we stop and 
          look though, we realise: 'Well, it's just my shadow. 'You can't get 
          away from it, but there's nothing in it to be afraid of, it's just a 
          shadow.</p>
        <p align="left">So when we stop and rest in the stillness of knowing, we know 
          in our hearts that all we desire, all we fear, are just shadows. There 
          is no substance there nothing which can make us more complete and nothing 
          which can threaten us. This is the real freedom of mind.</p>
        <p align="left">So being Buddha, 
          being that still, aware, noble being, is both the goal and the practice 
          that we follow the goal of the practice and the substance of the practice 
          are the same. The religious path is thus one of simply learning to rest 
          in being that Knowing, being Buddha, awake and aware.</p>
