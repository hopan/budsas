        <p>Venerable Santacitto (Stephen Saslav) was born of Jewish parents in 
          Brooklyn, New York City in 1947. He excelled at mathematics in high 
          school and went on to study at university.<br>
          In 1967, just after the Six Day War, he went to Israel to work on a 
          kibbutz. Continuing but not completing his university studies in Jerusalem, 
          he left and went hitch-hiking through Africa, where he was drawn to 
          climb Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. Travelling on through the Seychelles, 
          India and Nepal, he ended up working as an English teacher in Bangkok, 
          where he took a meditation course with Sister Sudhamma. Through her 
          he met an American disciple of Ajahn Chah, Dr. Douglas Burns, whose 
          clever persuasion induced him to visit Wat Pah Pong. Although he was 
          unable to speak Thai, he was deeply affected by meeting Ajahn Chah and 
          Ajahn Sumedho, recognising in them the self-actualisation that had profoundly 
          inspired him in Abraham Maslow's book, Toward a Psychology of Being.<br>
          The existence of a path to self-actualisation motivated him to become 
          a samanera for a short experimental period. Finding himself unable to 
          leave, however, he went on to receive upasampada in 1971 at Wat Benjamabopitr 
          under Chao Khun Buddhivongsamuni. His twelve years in Thailand were 
          punctuated by seven months back in Brooklyn, and nine months in France. 
          In 1985, at Ajahn Sumedho's invitation, he moved to Amaravati in England, 
          where he established the multi-faith Christmas Humphreys Memorial Library, 
          and was instrumental in setting up an exhibition on lay people's practice 
          in 1988.<br>
          He is now senior incumbent of the Devon Vihara.</p>

          the easiest way to outgrow ourselves is<br>
          through the response of compassionate action.&quot;<br>
          <img src="line-bot.gif" width="419" height="3"> </font></b></font></p>
        <p align="left"> QUESTION: Could you speak on the differences and similarities 
          of love and compassion?</p>
        <p align="left">ANSWER: Compassion is a sensitivity to the experience 
          of suffering, or dukkha: a sensitivity of heart to the suffering of 
          others. It's a 'non-separation' from our own heart's response on sensing 
          suffering in another. And because it is a kind of suffering in itself, 
          it impels action. However, since it's not a suffering arising out of 
          selfishness -- that is, from our own sense of separateness -- it doesn't 
          impel blind action. In taking one beyond oneself, the experience of 
          compassion is a very powerful opportunity for the arising and development 
          of wisdom. Probably the easiest way to outgrow ourselves is through 
          the response of compassionate action.<br>
          Love is a more directly positive quality. With a positive response of 
          heart we thoroughly accept another's reality, with an acceptance that 
          encompasses any resistance we might feel. Again there is the sense of 
          'non-separation', but this time it is in relationship to happiness.<br>
          With love, because it often involves highly positive feelings, one can 
          easily become lost in it. Hence we have the expression, 'Love blinds.' 
          Compassion, being more in touch with suffering, tends to keep us grounded 
          better than the sometimes eruptive energies involved in love. One can 
          see how, without care and attention, love can easily drift from being 
          a selfless sensitivity, to becoming an attachment. It slowly becomes 
          'self-interested'.<br>
          The best example of selfless love -- and we are all familiar with it 
          -- is the self-sacrificing love of a mother for her child. But it is 
          also a good example of how attachment creeps in. In its original purity 
          of complete acceptance, love is an extremely pleasant experience. But 
          unless we are very clear about feelings of 'getting something out of 
          it', attachment does slowly creep in. And where attachment arises, love 
          is blocked. By limiting our acceptance, the completeness of love disappears.<br>
          Though compassion mightn't be as conducive to attachment as love, 'self' 
          can still get involved if we are not careful. That which might have 
          been compassion to begin with can turn into pity -- 'feeling sorry for 
          someone' -- which doesn't bridge the sense of separateness. Looking down 
          on others doesn't help us grow beyond ourselves.<br>
          If we make the effort to intentionally cultivate love, we find it's 
          a quality that can be directed towards all people, including those who 
          we don't necessarily even consider friends. In such cases, rather than 
          feeling euphoric ecstasy, we experience a simple kindness, a sort of 
          grandheartedness -- a willingness to coexist.<br>
          We must remember, however, that talking about 'pure love' and 'pure 
          compassion' is not with the idea of creating absolutes, but to help 
          guide us in our practice. By recollecting in this way, we can come to 
          appreciate how, the less we allow personal gain to become mixed in, 
          the more all beings benefit.</p>
        <p align="left">Q: Is devotion another kind of love? Can it be a form 
          of cultivating love?</p>
        <p align="left">A: Yes; I would say the experiences of devotion and love 
          are very similar. We could say, devotion is a love directed towards 
          someone for whom we feel respect. It includes a sense of gratitude also 
          for the benefits that we have received.</p>
        <p align="left">Q: Would you say that it's possible to experience a devotional 
          heart quality without a human being as the object -- maybe towards a 
          tree?</p>
        <p align="left">A: Yes; and there also you are feeling gratitude for what 
          the tree gives you by its existence.</p>
        <p align="left">Q: When I see nature, I am so full of gratitude, but that 
          seems to be a kind of attachment. I try to see the attachment, but it's 
          difficult. Someone once told me: 'If you go on like this, you will never 
          be free.' [Laughter] I just love trees and birds and nature . . . and 
          I find I'm having to change . . . I don't know how to deal with it.</p>
        <p align="left">A: It's true that some of these positive qualities of 
          heart may come under the classification of 'attachments', but they can 
          be pretty darned healthy attachments. I sometimes like to look at the 
          practice path as being similar to climbing a ladder; so long as what 
          we're holding on to doesn't obstruct our ability to pull ourselves further 
          upwards, then a so-called attachment might be serving a useful function. 
          However, if we're holding on to a higher rung of the ladder but won't 
          let go of a lower one, then we're stuck. We've got a problem. So holding 
          on to something that is keeping us from going on, even if it's pleasurable, 
          is blocking progress.</p>
        <p align="left">Q: Yes, but I'm not sure that I want enlightenment to 
          be like that. [Laughter]</p>
        <p align="left">A: Eventually, we have to let go of everything -- but in 
          the right time. We shouldn't try to force ourselves to let go of things! 
          It's just that from time to time life happens to present us with opportunities 
          where we can either let go or not let go.</p>
        <p align="left">Q: Is 'letting go' a necessary part of meditation?</p>
        <p align="left">A: It's entirely up to the individual. There is no need 
          to feel that you have to let go of your devotion towards nature. But 
          later on, you may begin to sense something more valuable in your life, 
          the development of which could be aided by a more balanced relationship 
          with nature. For example, you may begin to feel a greater need for the 
          power of equanimity, finding that always gushing outwards towards nature 
          is something that is preventing you from further blossoming. So you 
          may realise that equanimity need not be a negation or rejection. It's 
          more a matter of allowing the appreciation of nature to settle to a 
          deeper level. It's starting to recognise the nature within ourselves 
          as well as the nature 'out there'.<br>
          Generally though, as far as trees are concerned, I would say they are 
          a rung of the ladder which pulls us up; especially in our modern materialistic 
          society. To a large extent we have lost touch with our ability to really 
          be with nature. We've forgotten how it functions to help us tune in 
          to our inner nature. Remembering that, simply being with nature can 
          be a very beautiful stepping-up point. Appreciating trees and birds 
          and external nature, definitely doesn't have to be an obstacle to get 
          rid of. We can learn to use such appreciation as a point of balance 
          in our lives -- not only for ourselves, but to share with others also. 
          This is something we need a lot of.</p>
        <p align="left">Q: It's so sad to hear people always complaining about 
          everything. If only they would just walk outside . . .</p>
        <p align="left">A: Yes, we tend to get lost into our personal space and 
          limit the mind. Just walking outside and opening up can be a way of 
          letting things free.</p>
        <p align="left">Q: Do you think that there is symbolic meaning to the 
          Buddha's getting enlightened under a tree? Maybe it means that we can 
          learn from nature. Trees can teach us how to refine ourselves. We can 
          come to understand how important it is to give back to nature what has 
          been taken away.</p>
        <p align="left">A: That is a very good point; the Buddha was born under 
          a tree, enlightened under a tree, and died under a tree. And he said 
          that sitting under trees was a good thing to do. His recommendation 
          to his bhikkhus was: 'There are these trees, go, sit.'<br>
          Our particular monastic tradition here comes from what is known as the 
          'forest tradition' of Thailand. There's an emphasis in this tradition 
          which says that if one really wishes to practise under ideal conditions, 
          then the forests provide these conditions. In their simplicity we can 
          discover an invaluable reflection of our inner nature.<br>
          To a large extent, Ajahn Chah's teachings were influenced by his vast 
          experience of living in forests. Many of the similes that he used came 
          out of this. His own practice was simply a matter of being a totally 
          open and aware human being in natural surroundings, watching both inwardly 
          and outwardly to see what was happening. Out of such practice came a 
          very deep understanding of himself. But he wasn't trapped by nature. 
          When he needed to go to the city, he could do that quite comfortably 
          without yearning for the forests. He could make the most out of the 
          forest, without becoming dependent upon it. If we become attached to 
          being in the forests -- as monks sometimes do -- then that's a sign that 
          there's still something to learn from nature.</p>
