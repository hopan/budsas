        <p>Venerable Viradhammo (Vitauts Akers) was born at Esslingen in Germany 
          in 1947 to Latvian refugee parents. They moved to Toronto, Canada, when 
          he was 5 years old. He studied engineering at the University of Toronto 
          but became disillusioned with academic life, and left in 1969 to go 
          and work in Germany. Later, while living in India, he encountered Buddhism, 
          meeting the late Samanera Bodhesako, who introduced him to the writings 
          of Venerable Nyanavira Thera. He eventually travelled to Thailand to 
          become a samanera at Wat Mahathat and took -- upasampada -- in 1974 at 
          Wat Pah Pong. He was one of the first residents at Wat Pah Nanachat.<br>
          Having spent four years in Thailand, he went back to Canada and Germany 
          to visit his family in 1977. Instead of returning to Thailand, he was 
          asked by Ajahn Chah to join Ajahn Sumedho at the Hampstead Vihara, in 
          London. In subsequent years, he was involved in the establishment of 
          both Chithurst and Harnham monasteries.<br>
          In 1985, on invitation by the Wellington Theravada Buddhist Association, 
          he moved to New Zealand, accompanied by Venerable Thanavaro. At first 
          they lived in the city of Wellington itself, moving two years later 
          to a 43-acre site in Stokes Valley, 29 km away. The monastery was named 
          'Bodhinyanarama' by Ajahn Sumedho, who conducted the first -- upasampada 
          -- ceremony there in 1989.<br>
          Venerable Viradhammo undertakes a wide range of teaching activities, 
          including monthly visits to a vihara which has been established in Auckland. 
          On occasion he also teaches in the South Island.</p>

        <p align="left"> THIS EVENING WE MIGHT BEGIN by considering the legend 
          of the life of the Lord Buddha. Now we could consider this story as 
          factual history. Or, we could also look at it as a sort of myth -- a 
          story that reflects back on our own development as beings seeking truth.</p>
        <p align="left">In the story we are told that before his enlightenment, 
          the Bodhisatta (Buddha-to-be) lived in a royal family with a lot of 
          power and influence. He was a very gifted person, and had all that any 
          human being could wish for: wealth, intelligence, charm, good looks, 
          friendship, respect, and many skills. He lived the princely life of 
          luxury and ease.</p>
        <p align="left">The legend has it that when the Bodhisatta was first born, 
          his father the king received a prediction from the wisemen. They said 
          there were two possibilities: either this son would become a world-ruling 
          monarch, or he would become a perfectly enlightened Buddha. Of course 
          the father wanted his son to carry on the business of being a monarch; 
          he didn't want him to become a renunciant. So everybody in the palace 
          was always trying to protect the prince. Whenever anyone grew vaguely 
          old or sick they were taken away; nobody wanted the prince to see anything 
          unpleasant that might cause him to leave.</p>
        <p align="left">But then at the age of twenty-nine, curiosity struck. 
          The prince wanted to see what the world outside was like. So off he 
          went out with his charioteer and --what did he see? The first thing he 
          saw was a sick person -- all covered with sores, in pain, and lying in 
          his own filth. A thoroughly wretched human condition.</p>
        <p align="left">'What's that?' the prince asked his attendant. The attendant 
          replied: 'That's a sick person.' After a discussion the prince realised, 
          for the first time, that these human bodies can become sick and painful. 
          The attendant pointed out that all bodies had this potential. This came 
          as a great shock to the prince.</p>
        <p align="left">The following day he went out again. This time he saw 
          an old person: all bent over with age, shaking, wrinkled, grey-haired, 
          barely able to hold himself up. Again, shocked by what he saw, the prince 
          asked: 'What's that?' 'That's an old person,' the attendant replied. 
          Everybody grows old.' So the prince realised that his body too had this 
          potential to become old. With that he went back to the palace quite 
          bewildered by it all.</p>
        <p align="left">The third time he went out, and saw a dead person. Most 
          of the townsfolk were busy, happily waving at their attractive prince, 
          thinking he was having a great time. But behind the crowds, there were 
          people carrying a stretcher with a corpse on it, going to the funeral 
          pyre. That was a really powerful one for him. 'And what is that?!' he 
          asked. So the attendant replied: 'That's a corpse. All bodies go that 
          way; your body, my body, they all die.' That really shocked him.</p>
        <p align="left">The next time the Bodhisatta went out he saw a mendicant 
          monk -- sitting under a tree meditating. 'And who is that?' he asked. 
          The attendant replied: 'That's a sadhu -- someone who is seeking the 
          answers to life and death.'</p>
        <p align="left">So we have this legend. Now what does this mean for you 
          and me? Is it just a historical tale to tell our children, a tale about 
          a person who didn't see old age, sickness or death until he was twenty-nine?</p>
        <p align="left">For me, this story represents the awakening of a human 
          mind to the limitations of sensory experience. Personally I can relate 
          to this from a time when I was at university. I questioned life a lot: 
          'What is it all about?' 'Where is this all going to?' I used to wonder 
          about death, and started thinking: 'What is the point of getting this 
          university degree? Even if I become a famous engineer, or if I become 
          rich, I'm still going to die. If I become the best politician, or the 
          best lawyer, or the best whatever... Even if I was to become the most 
          famous rock star that ever existed... Big deal.' At that time, I think 
          Jimi Hendrix had just taken too much heroin and died.</p>
        <p align="left">Nothing I thought of could answer the question of death. 
          There was always: 'So what?... So if I have a family? So if I am famous? 
          So if I'm not famous? So if I have a lot of money? So if I don't have 
          a lot of money?' None of these things resolved this doubt: 'What about 
          death? What is it? Why am I here? Why seek any kind of experience if 
          it all goes to death anyway?'</p>
        <p align="left">Questioning all the time like this made it impossible 
          for me to study. So I started to travel. I managed to distract the mind 
          for a time, because travelling was interesting: Morocco, Turkey, India... 
          But I kept coming back to this same conclusion: 'So what? So if I see 
          another temple, if I see another mosque, if I eat yet another kind of 
          food -- so what?'</p>
        <p align="left">Sometimes this doubt arises for people when somebody they 
          know dies, or if they become sick, or old. It can also come from religious 
          insight. Something in the mind clicks, and we are awakened to the fact 
          that no matter what experiences we have, they all change, they come 
          to an end, they die. Even if I'm the most famous, powerful, richest, 
          influential person in the world, all that is going to die. It's going 
          to cease. So this question 'So what?' is an awakening of the mind.</p>
        <p align="left">If we were to do this ten-day retreat with the idea of 
          getting 'a meditation experience', then 'So what?' We still have to 
          go back to work, still have to face the world, still have to go back 
          to Melbourne, still have to go back to New Zealand.... So what! What 
          is the difference between 'a meditation experience' and doing a cruise 
          on The Queen Elizabeth II? A bit cheaper maybe!</p>
        <p align="left">The Buddhist teaching is not aimed at just getting another 
          kind of experience. It is about understanding the nature of experience 
          itself. It is aimed at actually observing what it means to be a human 
          being. We are contemplating life, letting go of delusion, letting go 
          of the source of human suffering and realising truth, realising Dhamma. 
          And that's a different process altogether.</p>
        <p align="left">When we're doing 'mindfulness of breathing' -- anapanasati 
          -- we're not doing it with the effort to get something later. We're doing 
          it to simply be with what is: just being with an in-breath, being with 
          an out-breath. And what is the result when we're being mindful in this 
          way? Well, I think we can all see. The mind becomes calm, our attention 
          is steady -- we are aware and with the way things are.</p>
        <p align="left">So already we are able to see that calming the mind is 
          a healthy and compassionate thing to do for ourselves. Also, notice 
          how this practice creates space in the mind. We can see now the potential 
          for really 'being attentive' to life. Our attention is not caught up. 
          We're not being 'kidnapped' all the time. We can really work with attention.</p>
        <p align="left">If we're obsessed with something, then our attention is 
          absorbed into the object of obsession. When we're worried, exhausted, 
          upset, excited, desiring, depressed and so on, our attention energy 
          is lost. So by calming the mind we're creating space and 'freeing' attention.</p>
        <p align="left">And there is a beauty in that. When we go outside after 
          this meditation period, maybe we'll notice things in a different way 
          -- the green trees, the smells, what we're walking on, the little lotuses 
          in bloom. These pleasant experiences calm and relax us and are very 
          helpful -- the same as going on a cruise. In New Zealand they go trekking 
          in the mountains for relaxation.</p>
        <p align="left">But this kind of happiness, or sukha, is not the full 
          potential of the Buddha. A lot of joy can come with this level of practice, 
          but that is not enough. The happiness of a relatively calm mind is not 
          complete freedom. This is still just another experience. It's still 
          caught in 'So what!'</p>
        <p align="left">The complete freedom of the Buddha comes from the work 
          of investigation --dhammavicaya. It is completely putting an end to all 
          conflict and tension. No matter where we are in life, there are no more 
          problems. It's called 'the unshakable deliverance of the heart' -- complete 
          freedom within any experience.</p>
        <p align="left">One of the wonderful things about this Way is that it 
          can be applied in all situations. We don't have to be in a monastery, 
          or even to have a happy feeling, to contemplate Dhamma. We can contemplate 
          Dhamma within misery. We often find that it is when people are suffering 
          that they start coming to the monastery. When they're happy and successful 
          it probably wouldn't occur to them. But if their partner leaves home, 
          or they lose their job, get cancer, or something, then they say, 'Oh, 
          what do I do now?'</p>
        <p align="left">So for many of us, the Buddha's teaching begins with the 
          experience of suffering -- dukkha. This is what we start contemplating. 
          Later on we find that we also need to contemplate happiness -- sukha. 
          But people don't begin by going to the Ajahn, saying: 'Oh Venerable 
          Sir, I'm so happy! Help me out of this happiness.'</p>
        <p align="left">Usually we begin when life says: 'This hurts.' Maybe it's 
          just boredom; for me it was the contemplation of death -- this 'So what?' 
          Maybe it's alienation at work. In the West we have what's called 'the 
          middle-age crisis'. Men around the age of forty-five or fifty start 
          to think: 'I've got it all,' or, 'I haven't got it all, so what?' 'Big 
          deal.' Something awakens and we begin to question life. And since everybody 
          experiences dukkha, in its gross and refined aspects, it's beautiful 
          that the Teaching begins here -- the Buddha says, 'There is dukkha.' 
          No one can deny that. This is what the Buddhist teaching is based upon 
          -- actually observing these experiences we have -- observing life.</p>
        <p align="left">Now the worldly way of operating with dukkha is to try 
          to get rid of it. Often we use our intelligence to try and maximise 
          sukha and minimise dukkha. We are always trying to figure out how to 
          make things more convenient. I remember a discourse that Luang Por once 
          gave about this.</p>
        <p align="left">In the monastery we used to all join in hauling water 
          from the well. There would be two cans of water on a long bamboo pole, 
          and a bhikkhu at each end to carry them. So Ajahn Chah said: 'Why do 
          you always carry water with the monk that you like? You should carry 
          water with the monk you dislike!' This was true. I was a very speedy 
          novice and would always try to avoid carrying water with a slow old 
          bhikkhu in front. It drove me crazy. Sometimes I'd get stuck behind 
          one of them, and be pushing away...</p>
        <p align="left">So having to carry water with a monk I disliked was dukkha. 
          And, as Ajahn Chah said, I would always try to figure out how to have 
          things the way I wanted. That's using intelligence to try to maximise 
          sukha and minimise dukkha. But of course even if we do get what we want, 
          we still have dukkha; because the pleasure of gratification is not permanent 
          -- it is anicca. Imagine eating something really delicious; in the beginning 
          it would feel pleasurable. But if you had to eat that for four hours! 
          It would be awful.</p>
        <p align="left">So what do we do with dukkha? The Buddhist teaching says: 
          use intelligence to really look at it. That's why we put ourselves in 
          a retreat situation like this with the Eight Precepts. We're actually 
          looking at dukkha rather than just trying to maximise sukha. Monastic 
          life is based on this also; we're trapped in these robes. But then we 
          have an incredible freedom to look at suffering -- rather than just ignorantly 
          trying to get rid of it.</p>
        <p align="left">Wearing these robes in the West can be really difficult. 
          It's not like wearing a robe in Thailand! When we first moved to London 
          I felt so out of place. As a lay person I always dressed to not be noticed, 
          but in that situation we were up front all the time. That was dukkha 
          for me; I felt very self-conscious. People were looking at me all the 
          time. Now, if I had had the freedom to maximise sukha and minimise dukkha, 
          I would have put on a pair of jeans, a brown shirt, grown a beard and 
          been one of the mob. But I couldn't do that because I had renunciation 
          precepts. Renunciation is giving up the tendency to always try to maximise 
          pleasure. I really learned a lot in that situation.</p>
        <p align="left">We all have responsibilities: family, job, career and 
          so on. And these are kinds of limitations, aren't they? What do we do 
          with them? Rather than resent these limitations and say: 'Oh if only 
          it were different, I would be happy,' we can consider: 'Now this is 
          a chance to understand.' We say: 'This is the way it is now. There is 
          dukkha.' We actually go towards that dukkha; we make it conscious -- 
          bring it into mind. We don't have to create dukkha especially, there's 
          already enough suffering in this world. But the encouragement of the 
          teachings is to actually feel the dukkha that we have in life.</p>
        <p align="left">Maybe on this retreat you find during a sitting that you 
          are bored and restless, and waiting for the bell to ring. Now you can 
          actually notice that. If we didn't have this form, then we could just 
          walk out. But what happens if I walk out on restlessness? I might think 
          I've gotten rid of restlessness, but have I? I go and watch T.V. or 
          read something -- I keep that restlessness going. And then I find my 
          mind is not peaceful: it's filled with activity. Why? Because I've followed 
          sukha and tried to get rid of dukkha. That is the constant, painful, 
          restlessness of our lives. It is so unsatisfactory, so unpeaceful -- 
          not Nibbana.</p>
        <p align="left">The First Noble Truth of the Buddhist teaching is not 
          saying, 'Get this experience.' It says look at the experience of dukkha. 
          We are not expected to merely believe in Buddhism as a 'teaching', but 
          to look at dukkha -- without judging. We are not saying I shouldn't have 
          dukkha. Nor are we just thinking about it. We're actually feeling it 
          -- observing it. We're bringing it to mind. So, there is dukkha.</p>
        <p align="left">The teaching then goes on to consider that dukkha has 
          a cause and also that it has an end. A lot of Westerners think that 
          Buddhism is a very negative teaching, because it talks about suffering. 
          When I first had the inspiration to become a Buddhist monk, I was in 
          India. Then my grandfather died so I went back to Germany for the funeral. 
          I tried to talk to my mother about ordination. But when I mentioned 
          suffering, she got quite upset; she took it quite personally. She didn't 
          understand what I was saying: that this is simply what human beings 
          have to go through.</p>
        <p align="left">So the Buddha wasn't just talking about dukkha. He was 
          also talking about the cause of dukkha, the end of dukkha and a path 
          to that end. This teaching is about enlightenment -- Nibbana. And that 
          is what this Buddha-image is saying. It's not an image of the Buddha 
          suffering. It's of his enlightenment; it's all about freedom.</p>
        <p align="left">But to be enlightened we have to take what we've got, 
          rather than try to get what we want. In the worldly way we usually try 
          to get what we want. All of us want Nibbana -- right? -- even though we 
          don't know what it is. When we're hungry, we go to the fridge and get 
          something, or we go to the market and get something. Getting, getting, 
          always getting something.... But if we try to get enlightenment like 
          that, it doesn't work. If we could get enlightenment the same way as 
          we get money, or get a car, it would be rather easy. But it's more subtle 
          than that. It takes intelligence --pañña. It takes investigation, dhammavicaya.</p>
        <p align="left">So now we're using intelligence not to maximise sukha 
          and minimise dukkha, but to actually look at dukkha. We're using intelligence 
          to consider things skilfully. 'Why am I suffering?' So you see, we're 
          not dismissing thought, thought is a very important faculty. But if 
          we can't think clearly then it's not really possible to use the Buddhist 
          teachings. However, you don't need a Ph.D. in Buddhism either.</p>
        <p align="left">Once when I was in England, we went to go see a chap in 
          Lancaster. He had just finished a 'Master's' thesis on sunyata -- ten 
          thousand words on emptiness. He wanted to make us a cup of coffee. So 
          he put the coffee in the cups with the sugar and milk, and offered them 
          to us -- forgetting to put in the water. He could do a 'Master's' degree 
          on emptiness, but it was more difficult to mindfully make a cup of coffee. 
          So intelligence in Buddhism isn't just an accumulation of ideas. It's 
          more grounded than that. It's grounded in experience.</p>
        <p align="left">Intelligence is the ability to observe life and to ask 
          the right questions. We're using thought to direct the mind in the right 
          way. We're observing and opening the mind to the situation. And it is 
          in this openness, with the right questions, that we have vipassana practice: 
          insight into the way we are. The mind is taking the concepts of the 
          teaching, and channelling intelligence towards human experience. We're 
          opening, being attentive, and realising the way things are. This investigation 
          of the Four Noble Truths is the classic application of intelligence 
          in Theravada Buddhism.</p>
        <p align="left">So simply observing dukkha is not trying to get an experience, 
          is it? It is accepting responsibility for our dukkha -- our inner conflict. 
          We feel the inner conflict -- 'I am suffering.' And we ask: 'What is 
          the cause?'</p>
        <p align="left">The teaching says, dukkha begins and ends -- it's not permanent. 
          Suppose I'm feeling uncomfortable during the sitting, and I turn to 
          that dukkha and ask: 'What is the cause of this suffering?' 'It's because 
          the body is uncomfortable,' comes the answer. So I decide to move. But 
          after five minutes, I find the body is uncomfortable again. So this 
          time, I look at the feeling a little more closely. And I notice something 
          more: 'I don't want discomfort. I want pleasant feeling.' Ah! So it's 
          not the painful feeling that's the problem -- it's the not wanting the 
          painful feeling. Now that is a very useful insight, isn't it? That's 
          a bit deeper. I find that now I can be at peace with painful feeling 
          and don't have to move. I don't get restless and the mind becomes quite 
          calm.</p>
        <p align="left">So I've seen that the cause of the problem isn't the painful 
          feeling --it's the 'not wanting' that particular feeling. 'Wanting' is 
          quite tricky stuff. It comes in many forms. But we can always apply 
          this same investigation: 'What is it I want now?' The Second Noble Truth 
          -- samudaya -- says that the cause of suffering is attachment to wanting 
          -- tanha. It makes us feel that if we get what we want we'll be fulfilled: 
          'If I have this' or 'If I become that' or 'If I get rid of this and 
          don't have that'.... And that's samsara rolling on. Desire and fear, 
          pushing beings into always becoming: always seeking rebirth, leading 
          endless busy lives.</p>
        <p align="left">But the Buddha says that there is also 'a way out'. There 
          is an end to suffering. The end of suffering we call nirodha -- cessation 
          -- or Nibbana. When I first read about Nibbana, I understood it to mean 
          no greed, no hatred and no delusion. So I thought if only I can get 
          rid of all greed, hatred and delusion, then that would be Nibbana -- 
          it seemed that way. I tried and it didn't work. I got more confused.</p>
        <p align="left">But as I continued to practise, I found that the 'cessation 
          of suffering' meant the ending of these things in their own time -- they 
          have their own energy. I couldn't say to myself: 'OK, Tomorrow I'm not 
          going to be greedy or afraid.' That was a ridiculous idea. What we have 
          to do is to 'contain' these energies until they die -- until they cease. 
          If I felt angry and were to act on it, maybe I would kick someone in 
          the shins. Then they'd kick me back, and we'd have a fight. Or, I'd 
          go back to my hut and meditate, and hate myself. It goes on and on because 
          I've reacted to it. If I'm either following it or trying to get rid 
          of it, then it doesn't cease. The fire doesn't die.</p>
        <p align="left">The Teaching of the Four Noble Truths says then: we have 
          suffering --dukkha; there is a cause -- samudaya; there is an end -- nirodha; 
          and a path to that end -- magga. This is such a practical teaching. In 
          any situation of inner conflict we can take responsibility for what 
          we're feeling: 'Why am I suffering. What am I wanting now?' We can investigate 
          -- using dhammavicaya.</p>
        <p align="left">It is important that we actually apply these Teachings. 
          Luang Por used to say: 'Sometimes people who are very close to Buddhism 
          are like ants that crawl around on the outside of the mango. They never 
          actually taste the juice.' Sometimes we hear the structure of the teachings 
          and think we understand -- 'It's just a way of observing life,' we say. 
          But the teachings are not just an intellectual structure. They are saying 
          that experience itself has a structure which must be understood.</p>
        <p align="left">So we're not merely using intelligence to maximise sukha 
          and minimise dukkha. We are using it to free the mind, to go beyond, 
          to realise the unshakeable deliverance of the heart, to realise Nibbana. 
          We're using intelligence for freedom, not just frivolity; to liberate 
          the mind, not just to be happy. We're going beyond happiness and unhappiness. 
          We're not just trying to get another experience -- it is a different 
          attitude altogether.</p>
