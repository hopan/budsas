        <p>Each morning in Theravada Buddhist monasteries around the world, the 
          above stanza is chanted as part of 'The Homage to the Triple Gem'. It 
          could just as well be said of the teaching example of Meditation Master, 
          The Venerable Ajahn Chah.</p>
        <p>Ajahn Chah, or Luang Por as his disciples called him, possessed that 
          uniquely beautiful quality of being: a quality visible only to a heart 
          seeking The Way of Truth.</p>
        <p>'Beautiful in the beginning', in Ajahn Chah's case, was his commitment 
          to the life of a renunciant monk (dhutanga bhikkhu). He cultivated impeccable 
          discipline and displayed consistent, daring effort to confront all situations, 
          especially those from which he was inclined to turn away. He gave himself 
          completely to the training and eventually the Way became clear.</p>
        <p>'Beautiful in the middle' was the selfless sharing of his realisation 
          with all who came to be near him. Regardless of personal discomfort, 
          he ceaselessly offered his body, speech and mind to assist his disciples, 
          lay and ordained alike, to enter the Way. He said of his own teaching 
          method, that it is the example that counts -- not just the words. Those 
          who were able to spend time with him know full well that this is so.</p>
        <p>And 'beautiful in the end' remains. It is that radiant confidence of 
          heart in thousands of individuals who now walk the Way; that verified 
          faith which most profoundly expresses Dhammam Saranam Gacchami -- 'I 
          go for refuge to the Truth of the Way Things Are.' Without having seen 
          an example of the Way in another, such awakening of confidence might 
          not have taken place; hence it is said 'No gift excels the gift of Dhamma.'</p>
