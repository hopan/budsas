          The following teaching is taken from a session of Questions and Answers 
          that took place at Wat Gor Nork monastery during the Vassa of 1979, 
          between Venerable Ajahn Chah and a group of English-speaking disciples. 
          Some rearrangement of the sequence of conversation has been made for 
          ease of understanding.</font></p>

        <p align="left"> Q: When you teach about the value of contemplation, are 
          you speaking of sitting and thinking over particular themes, the thirty-two 
          parts of the body, for instance?</p>
        <p align="left">A: That is not necessary when the mind is truly still. 
          When tranquillity is properly established the right object of investigation 
          becomes obvious. When contemplation is 'True', there is no discrimination 
          into 'right' and 'wrong', 'good' and 'bad'; there is nothing even like 
          that. You don't sit there thinking, 'Oh, this is like that and that 
          is like this,' etc. That is a coarse form of contemplation. Meditative 
          contemplation is not merely a matter of thinking -- rather it's what 
          we call 'contemplation in silence'. Whilst going about our daily routine 
          we mindfully consider the real nature of existence through comparisons. 
          This is a coarse kind of investigation but it leads to the real thing.</p>
        <p align="left">Q: When you talk about contemplating the body and mind, 
          though, do we actually use thinking? Can thinking produce true Insight? 
          Is this vipassana?</p>
        <p align="left">A: In the beginning we need to work using thinking, even 
          though later on we go beyond it. When we are doing true contemplation 
          all dualistic thinking has ceased; although we need to consider dualistically 
          to get started. Eventually all thinking and pondering comes to an end.</p>
        <p align="left">Q: You say that there must be sufficient tranquillity 
          (samadhi) to contemplate. Just how tranquil do you mean?</p>
        <p align="left">A: Tranquil enough for there to be presence of mind.</p>
        <p align="left">Q: Do you mean staying with the here-and-now, not thinking 
          about the past and future?</p>
        <p align="left">A: Thinking about the past and future is all right if 
          you understand what these things really are, but you must not get caught 
          up in them. Treat them the same as you would anything else -- don't get 
          caught up. When you see thinking as just thinking, then that's wisdom. 
          Don't believe in any of it! Recognise that all of it is just something 
          that has arisen and will cease. Simply see everything just as it is 
          -- it is what it is -- the mind is the mind -- it's not anything or anybody 
          in itself. Happiness is just happiness, suffering is just suffering 
          -- it is just what it is. When you see this you will be beyond doubt.</p>
        <p align="left">Q: I still don't understand. Is true contemplating the 
          same as thinking?</p>
        <p align="left">A: We use thinking as a tool, but the knowing that arises 
          because of its use is above and beyond the process of thinking; it leads 
          to our not being fooled by our thinking any more. You recognise that 
          all thinking is merely the movement of the mind, and also that the knowing 
          is not born and doesn't die. What do you think all this movement called 
          'mind' comes out of? What we talk about as the mind -- all the activity 
          -- is just the conventional mind. It's not the real mind at all. What 
          is real, just IS, it's not arising and it's not passing away. Trying 
          to understand these things just by talking about them, though, won't 
          work. We need to really consider impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and 
          impersonality (anicca, dukkha, anatta); that is, we need to use thinking 
          to contemplate the nature of conventional reality. What comes out of 
          this work is wisdom; and if it's real wisdom everything's completed, 
          finished -- we recognise emptiness. Even though there may still be thinking, 
          it's empty -- you are not affected by it.</p>
        <p align="left">Q: How can we arrive at this stage of the real mind?</p>
        <p align="left">A: You work with the mind you already have, of course! 
          See that all that arises is uncertain, that there is nothing stable 
          or substantial. See it clearly and see that there is really nowhere 
          to take a hold of anything -- it's all empty. When you see the things 
          that arise in the mind for what they are, you won't have to work with 
          thinking any more. You will have no doubt whatsoever in these matters. 
          To talk about the 'real mind' and so on, may have a relative use in 
          helping us understand. We invent names for the sake of study, but actually 
          nature just is how it is. For example, sitting here downstairs on the 
          stone floor. The floor is the base -- it's not moving or going anywhere. 
          Upstairs, above us is what has arisen out of this. Upstairs is like 
          everything that we see in our minds: form, feeling, memory, thinking. 
          Really, they don't exist in the way we presume they do. They are merely 
          the conventional mind. As soon as they arise, they pass away again; 
          they don't really exist in themselves.<br>
          There is a story in the scriptures about Venerable Sariputta examining 
          a bhikkhu before allowing him to go off wandering (dhutanga vatta). 
          He asked him how he would reply if he was questioned, 'What happens 
          to the Buddha after he dies?' The bhikkhu replied, 'When form, feeling, 
          perception, thinking and consciousness arise, they pass away.' Venerable 
          Sariputta passed him on that. Practice is not just a matter of talking 
          about arising and passing away, though. You must see it for yourself. 
          When you are sitting, simply see what is actually happening. Don't follow 
          anything. Contemplation doesn't mean being caught up in thinking. The 
          contemplative thinking of one on the Way is not the same as the thinking 
          of the world. Unless you understand properly what is meant by contemplation, 
          the more you think the more confused you will become.<br>
          The reason we make such a point of the cultivation of mindfulness is 
          because we need to see clearly what is going on. We must understand 
          the processes of our hearts. When such mindfulness and understanding 
          are present, then everything is taken care of. Why do you think one 
          who knows the Way never acts out of anger or delusion? The causes for 
          these things to arise are simply not there. Where would they come from? 
          Mindfulness has got everything covered.</p>
        <p align="left">Q: Is this mind you are talking about called the 'Original 
          Mind'?</p>
        <p align="left">A: What do you mean?</p>
        <p align="left">Q: It seems as if you are saying there is something else 
          outside of the conventional body-mind (five khanda). Is there something 
          else? What do you call it?</p>
        <p align="left">A: There isn't anything and we don't call it anything 
          -- that's all there is to it! Be finished with all of it. Even the knowing 
          doesn't belong to anybody, so be finished with that, too! Consciousness 
          is not an individual, not a being, not a self, not an other, so finish 
          with that -- finish with everything! There is nothing worth wanting! 
          It's all just a load of trouble. When you see clearly like this then 
          everything is finished.</p>
        <p align="left">Q: Could we not call it the 'Original Mind'?</p>
        <p align="left">A: You can call it that if you insist. You can call it 
          whatever you like, for the sake of conventional reality. But you must 
          understand this point properly. This is very important. If we didn't 
          make use of conventional reality we wouldn't have any words or concepts 
          with which to consider actual reality -- Dhamma. This is very important 
          to understand.</p>
        <p align="left">Q: What degree of tranquillity are you talking about at 
          this stage? And what quality of mindfulness is needed?</p>
        <p align="left">A: You don't need to go thinking like that. If you didn't 
          have the right amount of tranquillity you wouldn't be able to deal with 
          these Qs at all. You need enough stability and concentration to know 
          what is going on -- enough for clarity and understanding to arise. Asking 
          questions like this shows that you are still doubting. You need enough 
          tranquillity of mind to no longer get caught in doubting what you are 
          doing. If you had done the practice you would understand these things. 
          The more you carry on with this sort of questioning, the more confusing 
          you make it. It's all right to talk if the talking helps contemplation, 
          but it won't show you the way things actually are. This Dhamma is not 
          understood because somebody else tells you about it, you must see it 
          for yourself -- paccattam.<br>
          If you have the quality of understanding that we have been talking about, 
          then we say that your duty to do anything is over; which means that 
          you don't do anything. If there is still something to do, then it's 
          your duty to do it. Simply keep putting everything down, and know that 
          that is what you are doing. You don't need to be always checking up 
          on yourself, worrying about things like 'How much samadhi' -- it will 
          always be the right amount. Whatever arises in your practice, let it 
          go; know it all as uncertain, impermanent. Remember that! It's all uncertain. 
          Be finished with all of it. This is the Way that will take you to the 
          source -- to your Original Mind.</p>
