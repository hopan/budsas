        <p>Venerable Munindo (Keith Morgan) was born in 1951, and brought up in 
          Morrinsville, New Zealand (North Island). He is the son of a Presbyterian 
          lay preacher, and grandson of two ordained preachers.<br>
          He first came across Buddhism during some time spent at university. 
          On moving to Australia in 1972, he met some bhikkhus from the Sydney 
          Thai Vihara; while living in northern New South Wales he attended a 
          meditation retreat with Ajahn Khantipalo.<br>
          He left Australia in 1973 bound for Indonesia, with the idea of ultimately 
          reaching Japan to practise Zen. He taught English for a while in Bangkok 
          and met Ajahn Sumedho and some Western monks from Wat Bovornives, where 
          he eventually decided to become a samanera. He received upasampada there 
          from Phra Somdet Ñanasamvara in 1974, and spent his first vassa with 
          Ajahn Thate at Wat Hin Mark Peng, on the Laotian border.<br>
          After spending some time spent in a Bangkok hospital with serious health 
          problems, he met Ajahn Sumedho again, and went to Wat Pah Pong. He was 
          reordained there by Ajahn Chah in 1975.<br>
          Ill health caused a return to New Zealand for six months in 1979. During 
          his time there, interest grew -- both in Auckland and Wellington -- in 
          having monks living locally on a more permanent basis.<br>
          In 1980 he travelled to England to join the community at Chithurst; 
          three years later, he was given the responsibility of establishing a 
          vihara in Devon, in the south-west of England. Presently, he lives at 
          Chithurst, assisting the abbot with teaching and training of new monks.

        <p align="left"> IT HAS BEEN VERY PLEASANT spending time with Ajahn Jagaro 
          after not having seen each other for eight years. We've been talking 
          over some of the developments that have taken place in practice and 
          in our various communities. A rewarding reflection has come out of this 
          as to just how steadily the Path does develop.</p>
        <p align="left">It's wonderful to see how the quality of effort that we 
          are able to make in practice naturally grows. I remember how, when I 
          was first ordained in Thailand, the formal 'going for refuge' and 'taking 
          precepts' didn't mean very much to me -- Buddham. saranam. gacchami, 
          Dhammam. saranam. gacchami, Sangham. saranam. gacchami.... But although 
          this formality didn't mean much to me then, I was attracted to these 
          teachings because they spoke somehow, in a meaningful way, of 'True 
          Refuge'.</p>
        <p align="left">My first contact and inspiration with Buddhism had come 
          from reading a book at university. I had a feeling at the time of, 'Great! 
          there is something real -- something of true quality which doesn't require 
          compromising what I feel most deeply to be right.' And that was wonderful. 
          It often is this way in the beginning when we make contact with something 
          we can really trust in; we have a wonderful feeling about our discovery.</p>
        <p align="left">Then we find the Teaching says that realising this 'true 
          quality', or to make this quality real in one's life, requires the cultivation 
          of awareness. We are already 'kind of' aware, but our awareness doesn't 
          do what it needs to do, which is to see the facts clearly. The Buddha 
          said that when we see the facts of life -- when we see what is, as it 
          is -- then there are no more problems. The Buddha had no problems because 
          he could always see the facts. If it's not like that for us, then it's 
          not because of life, but because of the way we see it; and that's a 
          very helpful reflection. When I'm having problems, I can consider: the 
          Buddha's Way meant he had no problems, whereas 'my way' means I have. 
          Therefore, one way has to go: either 'my way' or the Buddha's Way. So 
          we take up this training, or the Way of Dhamma, to be free from 'my 
          way'.</p>
        <p align="left">And this way of Dhamma begins with this first sense of 
          trust; we feel that Truth is accessible, and verifiable to us as human 
          beings. We don't have to wait until we die until we know what's what.</p>
        <p align="left">We often find in life, that we are faced with a difficult 
          situations which we want to work with, but we're not up to it. The point 
          of such meetings as this is to actually do something about our ability 
          to work; we have awareness, and we are choosing to work with it. We 
          are not just to using awareness as we do in daily life, but we have 
          set this time aside to directly cultivate it; to sit, to be still, to 
          train the mind.</p>
        <p align="left">When our community in England first moved to Chithurst 
          House, it was not an easy situation. One hundred and twenty acres of 
          forest had been given to us, with a lake and an old derelict mansion. 
          But the local council said we had to apply for 'change of use'. So that 
          was done -- but the answer was 'No!' So there we were with a wonderful 
          forest in beautiful West Sussex and a potentially ideal house to live 
          in, and yet....</p>
        <p align="left">Fortunately, because of a technical point, we were able 
          to apply again; but it meant we had to wait for many months to know 
          the result. There was tremendous doubt; would we be able to stay or 
          not? You could get caught up in the doubt and not do any work, thinking, 
          'Well, they might throw us out. What's the point?' Or, you could deny 
          doubt, work like a Trojan and get angry at anybody who dared to display 
          any doubt. The training, however, is about seeing just the facts -- and 
          thankfully, Ajahn Sumedho was very clear about that. The fact, then, 
          was that that particular situation was very doubtful -- uncertain. So 
          with right awareness, with balanced awareness, we could simply bear 
          that uncomfortable feeling. We could bear the feeling of insecurity 
          or doubt.</p>
        <p align="left">Insecurity is a very unpleasant feeling. When we are children 
          and feel that way, we seek reassurance from mum and dad. Then as we 
          grow up, we see this feeling of insecurity as a fact of life, and learn 
          to abide in the knowledge of the insecurity of all existence; that is, 
          if we really grow up! If we don't really grow up, we find substitutes 
          for our parents: a partner, possessions, belief systems, philosophies 
          and so on.</p>
        <p align="left">Our training is to actually feel this insecurity, and 
          see it as 'just like this'. But without being balanced we cannot do 
          it. In those early days at Chithurst, it was 'just like that', but there 
          was a real temptation to get caught in an extreme position of either 
          indulging in doubt or repressing it.</p>
        <p align="left">In the Buddhist Way, it is clearly stated that the two 
          extremes of 'blindly believing' on the one hand, and 'repression and 
          denial' on the other, are false. The way that is Real is the Middle 
          Way -- the way of gently bearing things, exactly as they are, in their 
          raw condition. To do this, we have to train the mind until we are no 
          longer pushing and pulling at the states that we experience.</p>
        <p align="left">Pushing and pulling is the way of contending. And it's 
          very easy to contend with life when it's not going the way that 'I' 
          think it should. There was a very difficult period in my training in 
          Thailand after I had already been a monk for about four years. As a 
          result of a motor bike accident I had had before I was ordained, and 
          a number of years of sitting in bad posture, my knees seized up. The 
          doctors in Bangkok said it was severe arthritis, but nothing that a 
          small operation couldn't fix. They said it would take two or three weeks. 
          But after two months and three operations I was still hardly walking. 
          There had been all kinds of complications: scar tissue, three lots of 
          general anaesthetic and the hot season was getting at me; my mind was 
          really in a state. I was thinking: 'My whole life as a monk is ruined. 
          Whoever heard of a Buddhist monk who can't sit cross-legged.' Every 
          time I saw someone sitting cross-legged I'd feel angry. I was feeling 
          terrible, and my mind was saying, 'It shouldn't be like this; the doctor 
          shouldn't have done it like that; the monks' rules shouldn't be this 
          way....' It was really painful, physically and mentally. I was in a 
          very unsatisfactory situation.</p>
        <p align="left">Then I heard that Ajahn Chah was coming down to Bangkok. 
          I thought if I went to see him he might be able to help in some way. 
          His presence was always very uplifting. When I visited him I couldn't 
          bow properly; he looked over at me and asked, 'What are you up to?' 
          I began to complain: 'Oh Luang Por,' I said, 'It's not supposed to be 
          this way. The doctors said two weeks and it has been two months....' 
          I was really wallowing. With a surprised expression on his face he said 
          to me, very powerfully: 'What do you mean, it shouldn't be this way? 
          If it shouldn't be this, way it wouldn't be this way!'</p>
        <p align="left">That really did something to me. I can't describe how 
          meaningful that moment was. He pointed to exactly what I was doing that 
          was creating the problem. There was no question about the fact of the 
          pain; the problem was my denying that fact, and that was something I 
          was doing. This is not just a theory. When someone offers us the reflection 
          of exactly what we are doing, we are incredibly grateful, even if at 
          the time we feel a bit of a twit.</p>
        <p align="left">The pushing away is the distortion of awareness that makes 
          problems out of life. Life can be very painful, but with right awareness 
          there can be a discerning of the facts. When awareness, or mindfulness, 
          matures into truth-discerning awareness (satipañña), we can bear the 
          state we are experiencing and discern the facts. With intelligence free 
          to consider what can be done and our human sensitivity unhindered, we 
          don't have to deny what we feel -- we can learn from life.</p>
        <p align="left">But if our ability to feel is numbed, if our hearts are 
          closed, intelligence simply can't operate. We can go through so many 
          difficult situations in life, thinking: 'Wow! I survived that one. I'll 
          never have to go through that again,' yet before long we do. So whether 
          we learn or not has very much to do with just how accurate our awareness 
          is. It depends on whether we are working with 'right awareness', or 
          the common-or-garden-variety awareness. This practice then is to train 
          awareness -- to balance it, to gentle it, to tame it, until the pushing 
          and pulling tendencies are gone.</p>
        <p align="left">Just as we make problems out of difficult experiences, 
          we can also make problems out of pleasant ones. There was an occasion 
          when I was in New Zealand and visiting a good friend who used to be 
          a monk with us in England. Now he is a doctor in Christchurch. He spends 
          a lot of time in the very beautiful mountains of the South Island. At 
          his invitation I joined him for a few days walking in the Alps. I hadn't 
          been in the mountains for a long time. The air was good, the weather 
          was good and it was particularly nice to be walking with a good friend. 
          We spent time trekking, walking, talking over practice, sitting meditation 
          ... it was wonderful. There was one morning I remember vividly. We had 
          left very early the forest hut where we'd spent the night. It was dawn 
          as we walked down a big stony mountain river bed. The magic light of 
          sunrise was tipping the snow-capped mountains gold. It was so beautiful 
          ... drinking the stream water, breathing crisp mountain air, and being 
          in good company. Then something in my mind started up... a feeling started 
          arising ... and it was beginning to spoil the situation. So gently paying 
          attention to that ... carefully turning towards it and being with that 
          feeling ... the constriction of energy that was taking place ... I could 
          see there was a feeling of ... trying to hold on to the experience -- 
          the experience of simple human enjoyment. I was saying to myself, 'This 
          is how it should be.' In that moment, I could see how I was creating 
          a problem. I was already beginning to imagine how it would be back in 
          the English drizzle saying, 'It shouldn't be this way.'</p>
        <p align="left">So even around pleasure we create problems by not relating 
          directly, truly; by not relating to that which is true, but relating 
          to that which is false, or to our fantasies. With pleasure, we can feel 
          afraid of losing it, and fantasise in an attempt to hold on to it. With 
          pain, we tend to dwell in memories of when it wasn't there, in an attempt 
          to avoid it. This is how it often is in broken relationships. (And death 
          is a kind of broken relationship.) Rather than seeing the fact of the 
          pain, there is a tendency to go into memories of 'how it used to be' 
          or fantasise about 'how it could be'. That is dwelling in what's not 
          real.</p>
        <p align="left">There is a verse in the Dhammapada:<br>
          Mistaking the false for the real, and the real for the false,zxwe remain 
          stuck in the false.zxSeeing the real as real, and the false as false,zxwe 
          attain to the Truly Real.</p>
        <p align="left">To be able to do the work of seeing the false as false 
          and the real as real, we need to cultivate this truth-discerning awareness. 
          We need to operate in a mode whereby we can accept the offerings of 
          life and death completely, whole-heartedly, and discern the facts -- 
          the Truth.</p>
        <p align="left">So being whole-hearted means being wholly and completely 
          sensitive; not being sensitive merely to what we like, which is 'my 
          way', and denying what we don't like. The Buddha's Way means being single-minded 
          about our consideration of life. And it results in an agility of mind 
          which is intelligence; the mind is not merely conditioned; it is free 
          to perform its proper function.</p>
        <p align="left">This is the training, and we can be very grateful that 
          we've been offered this training. The Buddha described this Way as being 
          'Well-Expounded', Svakkhata Dhamma. In other words, he said, 'You've 
          got what you need to do what needs to be done.' We don't have to make 
          shots in the dark hoping that we'll come across something meaningful. 
          Here we have a complete training -- the training of body, speech and 
          mind. We cultivate moral responsibility and work at developing the mind. 
          We make the effort to concentrate the mind and really be in the present. 
          All the difficulties and pitfalls that we experience along the way, 
          we share with each other. We have Good Companions -- Kalyanamitta, members 
          of the Sangha, and Dhamma friends, who can come together for discussion 
          and reflection -- listening to talks and going on retreats. We can actually 
          do what the Buddha wanted us to do.</p>
        <p align="left">The quality of trust we have in the beginning is wonderful. 
          It says: 'Yes, there is something to be realised. Life isn't merely 
          an ordeal that we tolerate until we die. There is a true quality that 
          can be seen and known.' And then, having given ourselves to the training, 
          we find that we begin to go beyond the habitual tendencies of pushing 
          and pulling at the experiences of pleasure and pain. And we continue 
          until we come upon a new way of seeing. We see in a way that we've never 
          seen before. We have a new perspective of things. 'Trust' is now verified. 
          We need no longer be concerned with doubt about the possibility of the 
          Way; we simply get on with it.</p>
        <p align="left">All the training we do, including the traditions that 
          we use, are for this purpose. They make our life situations workable. 
          Anger becomes workable; greed, jealousy, pleasure, pain, all become 
          something to help us grow in the direction of True Understanding. 'I 
          go for refuge to Dhamma -- the way things actually are' takes on a new 
          meaning for us.</p>
        <p align="left">Then finally, and thankfully, there are beings in the 
          world who teach from the perspective of complete trust. The Buddha's 
          Teachings come from the perspective of complete trust. That is where 
          life itself is something that we give ourselves into with an attitude 
          of complete trust. There is no longer any doubt, any confusion, any 
          despair. All that remains is complete trust in Dhamma.</p>
        <p align="left">QUESTION: Would you comment on the statement: 'Accepting 
          things the way they are is a passive avoidance of taking responsibility.'</p>
        <p align="left">ANSWER: If it's avoidance of taking responsibility, then 
          it has nothing at all to do with the spiritual life. This Way means 
          becoming completely responsible -- it means developing the ability to 
          respond whole-heartedly and single-mindedly to whatever situation we 
          may be in. That is far from being passive. It's being perfectly active. 
          It means acting in a complete and perfect way -- doing what is appropriate 
          to the situation. That may mean doing nothing. It may mean doing something. 
          The principle means whatever you do, do completely. Then you can be 
          truly responsible for the outcome. Our sensitivity is right there with 
          us and intelligence isn't hindered; you can say or act as is called 
          for. If nothing is called for, we don't do anything. Even if we get 
          it wrong, which often happens, and we become caught in the false, as 
          soon as we see it, we're real again: no pushing or pulling, just feeling 
          it as it is. This is the vision of the practice.</p>
