        <p>Venerable Brahmavamso (Peter Betts) was born in London in 1951. His 
          first contact with Buddhism came while browsing in a book shop in London 
          while still at school. He went to Cambridge University to study physics, 
          during which time he became a member of the local Buddhist society and 
          started to practise meditation. After graduating with First Class Honours, 
          he taught physics for a while at a secondary school in Devon. However, 
          his contact with Thai bhikkhus in London inspired him to go to Thailand 
          to take up the bhikkhu life himself, and he received bhikkhu ordination 
          at Wat Sraket at the age of 23, with Tan Chao Khun Prom Gunaphorn.<br>
          From 1975, he trained under Ajahn Chah, being one of the first residents 
          at Wat Pah Nanachat. In 1983 he joined Venerable Jagaro at the newly 
          established Bodhinyana Monastery in Perth, Western Australia, where 
          he still lives. He has been actively involved in the major building 
          programme, and teaches Buddhism to a wide and varied audience, ranging 
          from children to local prisoners.<br>
          Venerable Brahmavamso is known amongst the community of Western monks 
          for his erudition in the Vinaya, the monastic code of conduct, and his 
          work in this area currently provides the foundation for Vinaya instruction 
          to Westerners in the monasteries in England, Switzerland, Australia 
          and New Zealand.</p>

        <p align="left"> WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG I WANTED DESPERATELY to become 
          a train driver. My grandfather had taken my brother and me to Euston 
          Station in London where I began an infatuation with those massive, black 
          and green steel machines that hissed, with so much strength. Wouldn't 
          it be wonderful, I dreamt, one day ... if...</p>
        <p align="left">Some years later I wanted desperately to become enlightened. 
          I had read all about it in the books. To a starry-eyed young man, the 
          idea of living in permanent bliss and saving humanity at the same time 
          was irresistibly appealing. Wouldn't it be wonderful, I used to dream, 
          one day ... if...</p>
        <p align="left">When I first heard the story of the Lord Buddha's enlightenment, 
          I was still many glasses of beer away from being a monk. I was a student, 
          doing most of those outrageous activities students enjoyed in the late 
          sixties -- and regretted in the late seventies. But I had been meditating 
          off and on -- mostly the former -- for some time, and I had begun to notice 
          some unmistakable changes in my daily life. I was attending the Vesak 
          celebration at the local Buddhist Society and as the Venerable Sri Lankan 
          monk was reading out the Enlightenment Story, I became more and more 
          inspired and excited. I especially relished the bit where the Buddha-to-be 
          sat at the root of the Bodhi Tree and made that earth-shaking resolution:<br>
          'Though my blood dries up and my bones turn to dust, I will not move 
          from this spot until I have penetrated to Supreme and Complete Enlightenment!'<br>
          Wow! As the story moved on, a thought began to solidify in my mind. 
          I could hardly wait until the end of the chanting. I impatiently gulped 
          down the cup of tea which was all but obligatory at the occasion, and 
          then I hurried back to my room at college. I had heard enough talks 
          on Buddhism, I had read plenty of books on the subject. I had been meditating 
          for a whole year now, at least once a week -- well most weeks anyway. 
          If the Buddha could do it, why not me?</p>
        <p align="left">Thus it was that I, in the arrogant stupidity of youth, 
          a novice meditator who could hardly manage to sit still for thirty minutes, 
          decided that it was time to become enlightened. It was now or never, 
          I resolved, for the next day I had an exam. I locked the door of my 
          room. I sat down on my meditation cushion. I collected myself. Then 
          I pronounced in a low, clear, solemn voice:<br>
          'Though my blood dries up and my bones turn to dust, I will not move 
          from this very cushion until I, also, become enlightened.'<br>
          That was it. No more mucking about. I was dead serious.</p>
        <p align="left">Forty minutes later I was in extreme agony. Though my 
          blood appeared as liquid as ever and no disintegration of my bones was 
          discernible yet, my knees were giving me hell! What was really worrying 
          me though, was that over half an hour had gone by and I hadn't seen 
          the anticipated brilliant and flashing lights yet. There hadn't even 
          been a twinkle to suggest that I was getting near. It was very depressing 
          -- and very painful. I gave in. I got up very disappointed. Not becoming 
          enlightened had spoiled the whole day.</p>
        <p align="left">A few years later and a little more sensible -- though 
          only a little -- I was at London airport being sent off to Thailand by 
          two Thai bhikkhus. I was going to Bangkok to be ordained. I still remember 
          the parting words of the senior bhikkhu, who was my teacher then: 'Please 
          come back when you become enlightened.' I was planning to be a monk 
          in Thailand for two years at most. I had told my relatives and friends 
          that I'd be back within two summers. After all, two whole years as a 
          Buddhist monk in Thailand -- surely that is long enough even for those 
          of slow intelligence to become enlightened. As for me, I had a degree 
          from university, so there was no doubt in my mind that I would be back 
          in England within two years, enlightened. Once I had got that out of 
          the way, I planned to get married and go live in a commune -- in Wales 
          of course. I had made enquiries before I left.</p>
        <p align="left">Two years down the track, it was becoming obvious that 
          this enlightenment business might not be so easy. For some reason, though 
          I was a Westerner with a good degree from a top university, I was acting 
          more stupidly than the Thai monks who had barely finished grade four 
          in village schools. My conceit was taking a fair hammering. The strange 
          thing was that, even though I still wasn't enlightened, I was enjoying 
          the peace, simplicity and morality of monastic life. I didn't want to 
          leave. What I had in mind to do on the commune in Wales had lost its 
          appeal.</p>
        <p align="left">In my fourth Rains Retreat I was pulling out all the stops. 
          Word had come to Thailand that Chithurst House had been bought, a Sangha 
          was being established in England and they needed more bhikkhus. This 
          would be a great time to become enlightened. I was in a very quiet monastery. 
          My meditation practice was in high gear. All the omens were favourable. 
          Then it happened!</p>
        <p align="left">Walking on my meditation path one evening, my mind already 
          calm from many hours of sitting, I suddenly understood the cause of 
          all problems and my heart immediately felt the joy of release. All around 
          seemed brilliant. Bliss filled my whole being. Energy and clarity were 
          there in abundance. Though it was late at night I sat in meditation 
          perfectly mindful, perfectly still. Then I lay down to rest, sleeping 
          oh-so-lightly for just a few hours. I rose at 3 a.m. and was first in 
          the grass Meeting Hall for the morning meditation. I sat through until 
          dawn as if without effort and without the slightest drowsiness. That 
          was it! It was immeasurable joy being enlightened. Pity it didn't last 
          long.</p>
        <p align="left">The monastery where this happened was very poor and the 
          food was very coarse. It was the sort or North-eastern Thai monastery 
          where you were happy to eat just one meal a day -- facing such an ordeal 
          twice in one day being beyond the pale! The morning after my experience 
          of 'release', though, the fare was more reasonable. Along with the staple 
          'rotten-fish curry', which is actually made from stewing small fish 
          which have been kept most unhygienically until they go 'off', there 
          was a saucepan of pork curry. That day even the Thai abbot visibly reacted 
          at the sight of the reeking fish stew and took a whopping big helping 
          from the pot of pork curry. I didn't mind; I was second in line and 
          there was plenty left for me. However, the pot of pork never reached 
          me. Instead, the abbot poured what was left of the pork curry into the 
          mess of rotten fish stew and stirred it all up saying that it all gets 
          mixed up in the stomach anyway. I was incensed! Of all the hypocrites! 
          If he really thought that, then why didn't he mix the curries before 
          he took out his share. I peered angrily into the saucepan he handed 
          me -- rotten smelly pieces of rubbery fish swimming alongside my delicious 
          pork -- my one lucky meal ruined. Oooh, that abbot, was I mad at him! 
          Was I angry! Then a thought struck me with a depressing thud, or rather 
          a sickening squelch -- maybe I wasn't enlightened at all. Enlightened 
          beings aren't supposed to get angry. Arahants don't care if they eat 
          putrid fish or delicious pork. I had to admit I was angry -- therefore 
          I had to own up that I wasn't enlightened. What a let-down. Utterly 
          depressed, I scooped a ladle of rotten fish cum pork into my bowl. I 
          was too disappointed to notice the taste of what I ate that day.</p>
        <p align="left">In spite of these spiritual hiccups coming from Dhamma-indigestion 
          (a poor ability to assimilate the Teachings), my following years as 
          a bhikkhu were definitely producing results of more tranquillity, clarity 
          and joy. It was the humble insights, the sort which arrive without a 
          fanfare, which were proving the more effective. My wish to become enlightened 
          now appeared suspiciously akin to my childish wish to become a train 
          driver, or to my later ambitions to become the first English astronaut 
          ... a professional footballer ... a lead guitarist in a rock band ... 
          the greatest lover in my college ... (I am too embarrassed to mention 
          my other aspirations). In a way, wanting to become enlightened was even 
          more foolish. At least I had some idea of what driving a train was about. 
          As for enlightenment, I wasn't quite sure what that was! And whenever 
          I would try to find out by asking one of the senior monks, I would never 
          get a straight answer. So there I was in a very foreign land, eating 
          rotten fish and things much worse, enduring ravenous mosquitoes and 
          unending heat, trying so hard and giving up so much -- and for what? 
          I wasn't quite sure. So the only rational thing to do was to give up 
          trying to become enlightened until I knew what enlightenment was! I 
          didn't want to give up being a bhikkhu, I understood that and it made 
          sense. I just had to let go of chasing my fantasies, and my idea of 
          enlightenment was the ultimate fantasy.</p>
        <p align="left">On the other side of insight one seldom thinks that one 
          is now wise, for one is overwhelmed by the thought of how stupid one 
          has been. How could I have been so thick? It is written in so many of 
          the Buddhist scriptures, and it is emphasized by so many fine teachers, 
          that BECOMING IS SUFFERING -- becoming anything. The Buddha, speaking 
          as plain as ever, thundered that he didn't recommend ANY becoming. Becoming 
          is what the ego does all day. Becoming fashions the identity. Becoming 
          is the 'skin' which holds together the bubble of self. Stop all becoming 
          and the illusion is shattered.</p>
        <p align="left">So that was the end of my becoming enlightened. I focused 
          instead on the question of WHO it was who wanted to become enlightened, 
          if there was anyone there at all? I investigated no-self, which is much 
          more illuminating than trying to become enlightened. But still people 
          ask me, as they do of other bhikkhus, the bottom-line question: Are 
          you enlightened? Now I have a splendid answer, which I plagiarise from 
          the late Venerable Ananda Mangala Mahanayakathera (I know he won't mind) 
          who, terrific teacher that he was, gave the perfect reply to this very 
          question:<br>
          'No sir!', replied the venerable Sri Lankan thera, 'I am not enlightened. 
          But I am highly eliminated!'</p>
