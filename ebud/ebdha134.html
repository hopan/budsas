<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he authentic teachings
  of the Buddha Gotama have been preserved and handed down to us and are to be found in the
  Tipitaka. The Pali word, 'Tipitaka', literally means 'the three baskets' (ti- three <b>+ </b>pitaka-
  basket). All of the Buddha's teachings were divided into three parts. The first part is
  known as the Suttanta Pitaka and it contains the Discourses. The second part is called the
  Vinaya Pitaka and it contains all the rules the Buddha laid down for monks and nuns. The
  third part is known as the Abhidhamma Pitaka and comprises the Buddha's teachings on his
  psycho-ethical philosophy. It is known, that whenever the Buddha gave a discourse to his
  ordained disciples or lay-followers or prescribed a monastic rule in the course of his
  forty-five year ministry, those of his devoted and learned monks, then present would
  immediately commit his teachings word for word to memory. Thus the Buddha's words were
  preserved accurately and were in due course passed down orally from teacher to pupil. Some
  of the monks who had heard the Buddha preach, in person were Arahants, and so by
  definition, 'pure ones' free from passion, ill-will and delusion and therefore, without
  doubt capable of retaining, perfectly the Buddha's words. Thus they ensured that the
  Buddha's teachings would be preserved faithfully for posterity. Even those devoted monks
  who had not yet attained Arahantship but had reached the first three stages of sainthood
  and had powerful, retentive memories could also call to mind and word for word what the
  Buddha had preached and so could be worthy custodians of the Buddha's teachings. One such
  monk was Ananda, the Buddha's cousin and chosen attendant and constant companion during
  the last twenty-five years of the Buddh's life. Ananda was highly intelligent and gifted
  with the ability to remember whatever he had heard spoken. Indeed, it was his express wish
  that the Buddha always relate all of his discourses to him and although he was not yet an
  Arahant, he deliberately committed to memory and word for word all the Buddha's sermons
  with which he exhorted monks, nuns and his lay followers. The combined efforts of these
  gifted and devoted monks made it possible for the Dhamma and Vinaya, as taught by the
  Buddha to be preserved in its original state.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Pali Tipitaka and its allied literature
  exists as a result of the Buddha's discovery of the noble and liberating path of the pure
  Dhamma. This path enables all those who follow it to lead a peaceful and happy life.
  Indeed, in this day and age we are fortunate to have the authentic teachings of the Buddha
  preserved for future generations through the conscientious and concerted efforts of his
  ordained disciples down through the ages. The Buddha had said to his disciples that when
  he was no longer amongst them, that it was essential that the Sangha should come together
  for the purpose of collectively reciting the Dhamma, precisely as he had taught it. In
  compliance with this instruction the first Elders duly called a council and systematically
  ordered all the Buddha's discourses and monastic rules and then faithfully recited them
  word for word in concert.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The teachings contained in the Tipitaka are
  also known as the Doctrine of the Elders <i>(Theravada). </i>These discourses number
  several hundred and have always been recited word for word ever since the First Council
  was convened. Subsequently, more Councils have been called for a number of reasons but at
  every one of them the entire body of the Buddha's teaching has always been recited by the
  Sangha participants, in concert and word for word. The first council took place three
  months after the Buddha's death and attainment of Parinibbana and was followed by five
  more, two of which were convened in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. These
  collective recitations which were performed by the monks at all these Buddhist Councils
  are known as the 'Dhamma Sangitis', the Dhamma Recitations. They are so designated because
  of the precedent set at the First Buddhist Council, when all the Teachings were recited
  first by an Elder of the Sangha and then chanted once again in chorus by all of the monks
  attending the assembly. The recitation was then judged to have been authentic, when and
  only when, it had been approved unanimously by the members of the Council. What follows is
  a brief history of the Six Councils.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><b>THE FIRST COUNCIL</b></font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">King Ajatasattu sponsored the First Council.
  It was convened in 544 B.C. in the <i>Satiapanni </i>Cave situated outside Rajagaha three
  months after the Buddha had passed away. A detailed account of this historic meeting can
  be found in the <i>Cullavagga </i>of the Vinaya Pitaka. According to this record the
  incident which prompted the Elder Mahakassapa to call this meeting was his hearing a
  disparaging remark about the strict rule of life for monks. This is what happened. The
  monk Subhadda, a former barber, who had ordained late in life, upon hearing that the
  Buddha had died, voiced his resentment at having to abide by all the rules for monks laid
  down by the Buddha. Many monks lamented the passing of the Buddha and were deeply grieved,
  however, the Elder Mahakassapa heard Subhadda say: &quot;Enough your Reverences, do not
  grieve, do not lament. We are well rid of this great recluse (the Buddha). We were
  tormented when he said, 'this is allowable to you, this is not allowable to you' but now
  we will be able to do as we like and we will not have to do what we do not like.'
  Mahakassapa was alarmed by his remark and feared that the Dhamma and the Vinaya might be
  corrupted and not survive intact if other monks were to behave like Subbhada and interpret
  the Dhamma and the Vinaya rules as they pleased. To avoid this he decided that the Dhamma
  must be preserved and protected. To this end after gaining the Sangha's approval he called
  to council four hundred and ninety-nine Arahants and Ananda. With the Elder Mahakassapa
  presiding, the five-hundred monks met in council during the rainy season. The first thing
  Mahakassapa did was to question the foremost expert on the Vinaya of the day, the
  Venerable Upali on particulars of the monastic rule. This monk was well qualified for the
  task as the Buddha had taught him the whole of the Vinaya, himself. First of all the Elder
  Mahakassapa asked him specifically about the ruling on the first offence <i>(parajika), </i>with
  regard to the subject, the occasion, the individual introduced, the proclamation, the
  repetition of the proclamation, the offence and the case of non-offence. Upali gave
  knowledgeable and adequate answers and his remarks met with the unanimous approval of the
  presiding Sangha. Thus the Vinaya was formally approved.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Elder Mahakassapa then turned his
  attention to Ananda in virtue of his reputable expertise in all matters connected with the
  Dhamma. Happily, the night before the Council was to meet, Ananda attained Arahantship.
  The Elder Mahakassapa, therefore, was able to question him at length with complete
  confidence about the Dhamma with specific reference to the Buddha's sermons. This
  interrogation on the Dhamma sought to verify the place where all the discourses were first
  preached and the person to whom they had been addressed. Ananda, aided by his word-perfect
  memory was able to answer accurately and so the Discourses met with the unanimous approval
  of the Sangha. The First Council also gave its official seal of approval for the closure
  of the chapter on the minor and lesser rules, and approval for their observance. It took
  the monks seven months to recite the whole of the Vinaya and the Dhamma and those monks
  sufficiently endowed with good memories retained all that had been recited. This historic
  first council came to be known as the <i>Pancasatika </i>because five-hundred fully
  enlightened Arahants had taken part in it.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><b>THE SECOND COUNCIL</b></font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Second Council was called one hundred
  years after the Buddha's Parinibbana in order to settle a serious dispute over the 'ten
  points'. This is a reference to some monks breaking of ten minor rules. They were given
  to:</font></p>
  <ol>
    <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Storing salt in a horn.</font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Eating after mid-day.</font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">To eating once and then going again to a
      village for alms.</font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Holding the <i>Uposatha </i>Ceremony with
      monks dwelling in the same locality.</font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Carrying out official acts when the
      assembly was incomplete.</font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Following a certain practice because it was
      done by one's tutor or teacher. </font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Eating sour milk after one had had his
      mid-day meal.</font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Drinking strong drink before it had been
      fermented.</font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Using a rug which was not the proper size.</font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Using gold and silver.</font></p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Their misdeeds became an issue and caused a
  major controversy as breaking these rules was thought to contradict the Buddha's original
  teachings. King Kalasoka was the Second Council's patron and the meeting took place at
  Vesali due to the following circumstances. One day, whilst visiting the Mahavana Grove at
  Vesali, the Elder Yasa came to know that a large group of monks known as the Vajjians were
  infringing the rule which prohibited monk's accepting gold and silver by openly asking for
  it from their lay devotees. He immediately criticized their behaviour and their response
  was to offer him a share of their illegal gains in the hope that he would be won over. The
  Elder Yasa, however declined and scorned their behaviour. The monks immediately sued him
  with a formal action of reconciliation, accusing him of having blamed their lay devotees,
  the Elder Yasa accordingly reconciled himself with the lay devotees, but at the same time,
  convinced them that the Vajjian monks had done wrong by quoting the Buddha's pronouncement
  on the prohibition against accepting or soliciting for gold and silver. The laymen
  immediately expressed their support for the Elder Yasa and declared the Vajjian monks to
  be wrong-doers and heretics saying, &quot;the Elder Yasa alone is the real monk and Sakyan
  son. All the others are not monks, not Sakyan sons.&quot;</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The stubborn and unrepentant Vajjian monks
  then moved to suspend the Venerable Yasa Thera without the approval of the rest of the
  Sangha. When they came to know of the outcome of his meeting with their lay devotees. The
  Elder Yasa, however escaped their censure and went in search of support from monks
  elsewhere, who upheld his orthodox views on the Vinaya. Sixty forest dwelling monks from <i>Pava
  </i>and eighty monks from the southern regions of <i>Avanti </i>who were of the same mind,
  offered to help him to check the corruption of the Vinaya. Together they decided to go to
  Soreyya to consult the Venerable Revata as he was a highly revered monk and an expert in
  the Dhamma and the Vinaya. As soon as the Vajjian monks came to know this they also sought
  the Venerable Revata's support by offering him the four requisites which he promptly
  refused. These monks then sought to use the same means to win over the Venerable Revata's
  attendant, the Venerable Uttara. At first he too, rightly declined their offer but they
  craftily persuaded him to accept their offer saying, that when the requisites meant for
  the Buddha were not accepted by him, Ananda would be asked to accept them and would often
  agree to do so. Uttara changed his mind and accepted the requisites. Urged on by them he
  then agreed to go and persuade the Venerable Revata to declare that the Vajjian monks were
  indeed speakers of the Truth and upholders of the Dhamma. The Venerable Revata saw through
  their ruse and refused to support them. He then dismissed Uttara. In order to settle the
  matter once and for all, the Venerable Revata advised that a council should be called at
  Valikarama with himself asking questions on the ten offences of the most senior of the
  Elders of the day, the Thera Sabbakami. Once his opinion was given it was to be heard by a
  committee of eight monks, and its validity decided by their vote. The eight monks called
  to judge the matter were the Venerables, Sabbakami, Salha, Khujjasobhita and
  Vasabhagamika, from the East and four monks from the West, the Venerables, Revata,
  Sambhuta-Sanavasi, Yasa and Sumana. They thoroughly debated the matter with Revata as the
  questioner and Sabbakami answering his questions. After the debate was heard the eight
  monks decided against the Vajjian monks and their verdict was announced to the assembly.
  Afterwards seven-hundred monks recited the Dhamma and Vinaya and this recital came to be
  known as the <i>Sattasati </i>because seven-hundred monks had taken part in it. This
  historic council is also called, the <i>Yasatthera Sangiti </i>because of the major role
  the Elder Yasa played in it and his zeal for safeguarding the Vinaya. The Vajjian monks
  categorically refused to accept the Council's decision and in defiance called a council of
  there own which was called the Mahasangiti.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><b>THE THIRD COUNCIL</b></font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Third Council was held primarily in order
  to rid the Sangha of corruption and bogus monks who held heretical views. The Council was
  convened in 326 B.C. at Asokarama in Pataliputta. It was presided over by the Elder
  Moggaliputta Tissa and one thousand monks under the patronage of the Emperor Asoka.
  Tradition has it that he won his throne through shedding the blood of all his father's
  sons save his own brother, Tissa Kumara who eventually ordained and achieved Arahantship.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Asoka was crowned in the two hundred and
  eighteenth year after the Buddha's Parinibbana. At first he paid only token homage to the
  Dhamma and the Sangha and supported members of other religious sects as well as his father
  had done before him. However, all this changed when he met the pious novice-monk Nigrodha
  who preached to him the, <i>Appamada-vagga. </i>Thereafter, he ceased supporting other
  religious groups and his interest in and devotion to the Dhamma deepened. He used his
  enormous wealth to build, it is said, eighty-four thousand pagodas, temples and viharas
  and to support the Bhikkhus with the four requisites daily and lavishly. His son Mahinda
  and his daughter Sanghamitta were ordained and admitted to the Sangha. Eventually, his
  generosity was to cause serious problems within the Sangha. In time the order was
  infiltrated by many unworthy men, holding heretical views and who were attracted to the
  order because of the Emperor's generous support and costly offerings of food, clothing,
  shelter and medicine. Large numbers of faithless, greedy men espousing wrong views tried
  to join the order but were deemed unfit for ordination. Despite this they seized the
  chance to exploit the Emperor's generosity for their own ends and donned robes and joined
  the order without having been ordained properly. Consequently, respect for the Sangha
  diminished. When this came to light some of the genuine monks refused to hold the
  prescribed purification or Uposatha ceremony in the company of the corrupt, heretical
  monks.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">When the Emperor heard about this he sought
  to rectify the situation and dispatched one of his ministers to the monks with the command
  that they perform the ceremony. However, the Emperor had given the minister no specific
  orders as to what means were to be used to carry out his command. The monks refused to
  obey and hold the ceremony in the company of their false and 'thieving', companions <i>(theyyasinivasaka).
  </i>In desperation the angry minister advanced down the line of seated monks and drawing
  his sword, beheaded all of them one after the other until he came to the King's brother,
  Tissa who had ordained. The horrified minister stopped the slaughter and fled the hall and
  reported back to the Emperor Asoka who was deeply grieved and upset by what had happened
  and blamed himself for the killings. He sought Thera Moggaliputta Tissa's counsel. He
  proposed that the heretical monks be expelled from the order and a third Council be
  convened immediately. So it was that in the seventeenth year of the Emperor's reign the
  Third Council was called. Thera Moggaliputta Tissa headed the proceedings and chose one
  thousand monks from the the sixty thousand participants for the traditional recitation of
  the Dhamma and the Vinaya, which went on for nine months. The Emperor, himself questioned
  monks from a number of monasteries about the teachings of the Buddha. Those who held wrong
  views were exposed and expelled from the Sangha, immediately. In this way the Bhikkhu
  Sangha was purged of heretics and bogus bhikkhus.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">This council achieved a number of other
  important things as well. The Elder Moggaliputta Tissa in order to refute a number of
  heresies and ensure the Dhamma was kept pure, complied a book during the council called,
  the <i>Kathavatthu. </i>This book consists of twenty-three chapters, and is a collection
  of discussions <i>(katha) </i>and refutations of the heretical views held by various sects
  on matters philosophical. It is the fifth of the seven books of the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The
  members of this Council also gave a royal seal of approval to the doctrine of the Buddha,
  naming it the <i>Vibhajjavada, </i>the Doctrine of Analysis. It is identical with the
  approved <i>Theravada </i>doctrine.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">One of the most significant achievements of
  this Buddhist assembly and one which was to bear fruit for centuries to come, was the
  Emperor's sending forth of monks, well versed in the Buddha's Dhamma and Vinaya who could
  recite all of it by heart, to teach it in nine different countries. These <i>Dhammaduta </i>monks
  included the Venerable Majjhantika Thera who went to Kashmir and Gandhara. He was asked to
  preach the Dhamma and establish an order of monks there. The Venerable Mahadeva was sent
  to Mahinsakamandala (modern Mysore) and the Venerable Rakkhita Thera was dispatched to
  Vanavasi (northern Kanara in the south of India.) The Venerable Yonaka Dhammarakkhita
  Thera was sent to Upper Aparantaka (northern Gujarat, Kathiwara, Kutch and Sindh). The
  Venerable Maharakkhita Thera went to Yonaka-loka (the land of the lonians, Bactrians and
  the Greeks.) The Venerable Majjhima Thera went to Himavant (the place adjoining the
  Himalayas.) The Venerable Sona and the Venerable Uttara were sent to Suvannabhumi (now
  Myamar). The Venerable Mahinda Thera, The Venerable Ittiya Thera, the Venerable Uttiya
  Thera, the Venerable Sambala Thera and the Venerable Bhaddasala Thera were sent to
  Tambapanni ( now Sri Lanka). The Dhamma missions of these monks succeeded and bore great
  fruits in the course of time and went a long way in ennobling the peoples of these lands
  with the gift of the Dhamma and influencing their civilizations and cultures.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><b>THE FOURTH COUNCIL</b></font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Fourth Council was held in Tambapanni
  (Sri Lanka) in 29 B.C. under the patronage of King Vattagamani. The main reason for its
  convening was the realization that it was now not possible for the majority of monks to
  retain the entire Tipitaka in their memories as had been the case formerly for the
  Venerable Mahinda and those who followed him soon after. Therefore, as the art of writing
  had, by this time developed substantially it was thought expedient and necessary to have
  the entire body of the Buddha's teaching written down. King Vattagamani supported the
  monk's idea and a council was held specifically to reduce the Tipitaka in its entirety to
  writing. Therefore, so that the genuine Dhamma might be lastingly preserved, the Venerable
  Maharakkhita and five hundred monks recited the words of the Buddha and then wrote them
  down on palm leaves. This remarkable project took place in a cave called, the Aloka lena,
  situated in the cleft of an ancient landslip near what is now Matale. Thus the aim of the
  Council was achieved and the preservation in writing of the authentic Dhamma was ensured.
  In the Eighteenth Century, King Vijayarajasiha had images of the Buddha created in this
  cave.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><b>THE FIFTH COUNCIL</b></font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Fifth Council took place in Mandalay
  Burma now known as Myanmar in 1871 A.D. in the reign of King Mindon. The chief objective
  of this meeting was to recite all the teachings of the Buddha and examine them in minute
  detail to see if any of them had been altered, distorted or dropped. It was presided over
  by three Elders, the Venerable Mahathera Jagarabhivamsa, the Venerable Narindabhidhaja,
  and the Venerable Mahathera Sumangalasami in the company of some two thousand four hundred
  monks (2,400). Their joint Dhamma recitation lasted for five months. It was also the work
  of this council to cause the entire Tipitaka to be inscribed for posterity on seven
  hundred and twenty-nine marble slabs in the Myanmar script after its recitation had been
  completed and unanimously approved. This monumental task was done by some two thousand
  four hundred (2,400) erudite monks and many skilled craftsmen who upon completion of each
  slab had them housed in beautiful miniature <i>'pitaka' pagodas </i>on a special site in
  the grounds of King Mindon's <i>Kuthodaw Pagoda </i>at the foot of Mandalay Hill where it
  and the so called 'largest book in the world', stands to this day.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><b>THE SIXTH COUNCIL</b></font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Sixth Council was called at <i>Kaba Aye </i>in
  Yangon, formerly Rangoon in 1954, eighty-three years after the fifth one was held in
  Mandalay. It was sponsored by the Burmese Government led by the then Prime Minister, the
  Honourable U Nu. He authorized the construction of the <i>Maha Passana Guha, </i>'the
  great cave', an artificial cave very like India's <i>Sattapanni </i>Cave where the first
  Buddhist Council had been held. Upon its completion The Council met on the 17th of May,
  1954. As in the case of the preceding councils, its aim first objective was to affirm and
  preserve the genuine Dhamma and Vinaya. However it was unique in so far as the monks who
  took part in it came from eight countries. These two thousand five hundred learned
  Theravada monks came from Myanmar, Cambodia, India, Laos, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and
  Vietnam. The late Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw was appointed the noble task of asking the
  required questions about the Dhamma of the Venerable Bhadanta Vicittasarabhivamsa who
  answered all of them learnedly and satisfactorily. By the time this council met all the
  participating countries had had the Pali Tipitaka rendered into their native scripts, with
  the exception of India.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The traditional recitation of the Buddhist
  Scriptures took two years and the Tipitaka and its allied literature in all the scripts
  were painstakingly examined and their differences noted down and the necessary corrections
  made and all the versions were then collated. Happily, it was found that there was not
  much difference in the content of any of the texts. Finally, after the Council had
  officially approved them, all of the books of the Tipitaka and their Commentaries were
  prepared for printing on modern presses and published in the Myanmar (Burmese) script.
  This notable achievement was made possible through the dedicated efforts of the two
  thousand five hundred monks and numerous lay people. Their work came to an end in May,
  1956, two and a half millennia after the Lord Buddha's Parinibbana. This council's work
  was the unique achievement of representatives from the entire Buddhist world. The version
  of the Tipitaka which it undertook to produce has been recognized as being true to the
  pristine teachings of the Buddha Gotama and the most authoritative rendering of them to
  date.</font></p>
