        <P>For the last quarter century the American-born monk Bhikkhu Bodhi has 
        immersed himself in the P<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āli</FONT> Canon 
        and is now a respected interpreter of its content and meaning. His 
        English translations of the Majjhima Nikaya and Samyutta Nikaya (Wisdom 
        Publications, 1995 and 2000) have become favorites of Western students 
        of the dharma. Inquiring Mind conducted an e-mail interview with Bhikkhu 
        Bodhi in the fall of 2005 upon the publication of his new anthology of 
        sutta passages, In the Buddha’s Words (Wisdom, 2005).</P>

      <P>Inquiring Mind:</B> How did you become interested in translating the 
      suttas?</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>Bhikkhu Bodhi: </B>When I first ordained I did not have any intention 
      to become a translator. My first Buddhist teacher, a Vietnamese monk with 
      whom I lived in California back in the late 1960s, impressed on me the 
      importance of learning the canonical languages of Buddhism, beginning with 
      P<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āli</FONT>, as a tool for understanding the 
      Dhamma. When I arrived in Sri Lanka and took ordination as a Therav<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āda</FONT> 
      monk in 1972, I was eager to learn P<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āli</FONT> 
      in order to gain direct access to the original collections of the Buddha’s 
      discourses. I deliberately choose Ven. Balangoda Ananda Maitreya to be my 
      teacher because at the time he was reputed to be one of the top 
      scholar-monks in Sri Lanka. He was certainly the foremost Sinhalese 
      scholar-monk fluent in English and was also a very gentle and lovable 
      person.</P>
      <P>In 1974, I spent time with the German monk Nyanaponika Mahathera, the 
      president and editor of the Buddhist Publication Society in Kandy. While 
      staying with him, I used his notebook translations from the 1950s to 
      improve my knowledge of commentarial-style P<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āli</FONT>. 
      At the end of 1975, I moved to Kandy to live with Ven. Nyanaponika. He had 
      seen some of my personal translations and suggested I translate the 
      Brahmajala Sutta (the first sutta in the Digha Nikaya) with its commentary 
      and subcommentaries. The resulting work, which commenced my &quot;career&quot; as a 
      translator, was published as The Discourse on the All-Embracing Net of 
      Views (1978).</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>IM:</B> What observations have you made regarding the role of the 
      suttas to Western students of the Dhamma in particular? And how/why has 
      this motivated you to help make English-language translations available to 
      Westerners?</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>BB:</B> During the period immediately preceding my departure for Asia 
      and ordination as a monk in 1972, the interest in Buddhism among young 
      Americans tended to be anti-intellectual. While most Westerners who went 
      to Asia in quest of Therav<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āda</FONT> 
      teachings found themselves in forest monasteries in Thailand or meditation 
      centers in Burma, my karmic connections led me to Sri Lanka and to 
      teachers who were steeped in the scriptures and were ready to guide a 
      Western student eager to learn them.</P>
      <P>When I started to read the P<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āli</FONT> 
      suttas, I was exhilarated by their clarity, intellectual rigor, delicate 
      beauty and subtle emotional fervor, which shimmers just beneath their 
      tranquil surface. I started translating suttas and passages from the 
      commentaries simply to make them intelligible to myself, not to publish 
      them. In time, though, I came to see that Western Buddhism was 
      characterized by a gaping void: lack of a clear knowledge of the Buddha’s 
      own teachings. I thus thought it extremely important that the suttas be 
      translated in lucid, contemporary language accompanied by a body of 
      annotations that brings out their deeper meanings and practical relevance. 
      This to date has been my life’s work.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>IM:</B> What role has scholarship and study of the suttas had in your 
      own practice and spiritual development?</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>BB:</B> Many new Western Buddhists take the word <I><B>practice</B></I> 
      as almost synonymous with meditation and then drive a sharp wedge between 
      study and practice. They assume that if a monk is devoted to scholarship, 
      he can’t be a serious practitioner, as if scholarship were somehow 
      antithetical to real practice. I have to admit that my own meditation 
      practice has fallen far short of my ideal, but I ascribe this largely to a 
      chronic health condition (a personal karmic obstacle with which I must 
      deal) rather than to a dedication to scholarship and a concern to 
      translate the Buddhist scriptures.</P>
      <P>We should remember that in Buddhist Asia down through the centuries, in 
      virtually all traditions, the main task of the monastic order has been the 
      preservation and transmission of the Buddhist teachings, done primarily 
      through the intensive study, investigation and propagation of Buddhist 
      scriptures and philosophy. This has formed the foundation stone upon which 
      all higher achievements in Buddhist practice have rested, the skeleton 
      that has supported the muscles and organs of Buddhism. While all 
      traditions preserve accounts of unlettered meditators who have attained 
      deep realization, the most outstanding representatives in all traditions 
      have been those who combine both doctrinal sophistication and meditative 
      realization. One suspects that even the hagiographical stories of 
      illiterate sages are pious exaggerations.</P>
      <P>The interrelationship of study and scholarship with practice is, I 
      feel, a complex issue about which there is no single answer suitable for 
      everyone. Some people will naturally gravitate towards one or another of 
      these two poles. What can be said unequivocally is that scholarly 
      knowledge without practical application is barren; vigorous meditation 
      practice without the guiding light of clear conceptual understanding is 
      futile. Without knowledge of the texts, I fear, within a couple of 
      generations a practice tradition will easily become diluted, chewed up and 
      digested by the surrounding culture, especially when that culture is a 
      theistic or a materialistic one.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>IM:</B> Please comment on the value of sutta study in the practice of a 
      contemporary Western lay Buddhist.</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>BB:</B> To explain the value of sutta study in one’s practice, let’s 
      first raise the questions: What is practice? What is practice all about? 
      If we don’t press hard on these questions, we’ll instinctively bring into 
      our practice our own unexamined assumptions about the purpose of practice, 
      and then our practice can easily become subservient to our personal 
      agendas or our cultural biases rather than a means to fulfilling the goal 
      set for it by the Buddha. It seems to me that this is what has happened in 
      Western Buddhism and explains why it has been transforming the tradition 
      in ways that some might consider a compromise with modern psychology or 
      secular humanism.</P>
      <P>Studying the Dhamma, however, isn’t a matter of picking up a load of 
      cultural baggage from ancient India and dumping it in our backyard. It 
      must be done with careful discrimination and critical thought. Properly 
      undertaken, the study of the Dhamma is precisely the way we learn and 
      internalize the framework of the Buddha’s teachings. It is how we acquire 
      a sound understanding of the principles that underlie and permeate the 
      teachings, and even more importantly, how we nurture the seeds of wisdom 
      in our minds.</P>
      <P>Our first task in treading the Buddha’s path is, after all, to acquire 
      right view, the first factor of the Noble Eightfold Path, our navigator 
      along the entire spiritual journey. Right view initially arises through 
      &quot;hearing,&quot; which includes reading Buddhist texts and studying the Dhamma 
      under qualified teachers, and through &quot;reflection,&quot; reasoned contemplation 
      of the teachings intrinsically and in relation to our own life. It is when 
      our view is clear and sharp that our faith in the Buddha becomes well 
      established, and it is on the basis of right view and sound faith that 
      meditation practice can move towards its intended aim.</P>
      <P>True wisdom emerges by investigating what is wholesome and what is 
      unwholesome: what leads to our own true welfare and happiness and promotes 
      the well-being of others, and what leads to harm and suffering for 
      ourselves and others. All this comes from careful study of the scriptures, 
      and this is only a minute fraction of what one finds in the texts. What we 
      learn we have to examine, reflect upon and inwardly absorb through 
      contemplation, and then penetrate by direct insight.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>IM:</B> What are some ways one might incorporate reading/study of the 
      suttas into one’s practice?</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>BB:</B> First one has to know where to begin. For a newcomer to the 
      suttas, I suggest starting with a little gem, Ven. Nyanatiloka’s 
      anthology, The Word of the Buddha (published by the Buddhist Publication 
      Society, available from www.pariyatti.com). An alternative is the 
      schematic selection of texts on the Access to Insight website; I also 
      recommend the webmaster’s essay &quot;Befriending the Suttas.&quot; As the next step 
      – or perhaps even for beginners – I would throw modesty to the winds and 
      recommend In the Buddha’s Words (after all, they’re mostly his words, not 
      mine). Then, for one who wants to go on to a full collection, I suggest 
      the Majjhima Nikaya. Our Bodhi Monastery website contains almost three 
      years’ worth of my lectures on the Majjhima suttas 
      (www.bodhimonastery.net/mntalks_audio.html). These can help serious 
      students obtain a detailed understanding of these texts.</P>
      <P>Then <I><B>how</B></I> to study: I suggest the first time one simply 
      read each sutta through to gain an initial acquaintance with it. Then read 
      it a second time and make notes. After one becomes familiar with a range 
      of texts, list a number of topics that seem to be dominant and repeated 
      themes, and use these as the rubrics for future readings. As one proceeds, 
      make notes from the texts and sort them under these topics, adding new 
      topics whenever necessary; always include the textual references. Over 
      time – after a year or a couple of years – one will gradually acquire a 
      &quot;global view&quot; of the Dhamma, so that one can see how virtually all the 
      teachings fit together into a consistent whole, like the pieces of a 
      jigsaw puzzle.</P>
      <P>I also want to emphasize that the suttas stem from the earliest period 
      of Buddhist literary history and thus constitute the common heritage of 
      the entire Buddhist tradition. So to study them is not a task solely for 
      followers of Therav<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āda</FONT> Buddhism or of 
      Therav<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āda</FONT>-based vipassana; it is a 
      task, indeed a responsibility, of Buddhists belonging to all schools who 
      want to understand the taproot of Buddhism.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>IM:</B> What are some pitfalls or potential dangers in the use of the 
      scriptures?</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>BB:</B> One potential danger in the use of the scriptures was clearly 
      pointed out by the Buddha in the Discourse on the Simile of the Snake 
      (Majjhima Nikaya 22). He speaks of those who learn the suttas but instead 
      of practicing the teaching use their knowledge to criticize others and 
      prove their skill in debates. The Buddha compares this to grasping a water 
      snake by the tail: the snake will turn around and bite one’s arm, causing 
      death or critical pain. I have seen numerous Westerners, myself too at 
      times, fall into this trap. Though one starts with the best intentions, 
      one grasps the teaching with a dogmatic mind, uses one’s knowledge to 
      dispute with others, and then becomes locked in a &quot;battle of 
      interpretation&quot; with those who interpret the texts in different ways. 
      Another danger is to let one’s capacity for critical thought fly out the 
      window and buy into everything the suttas say. After all, there is quite a 
      lot in the suttas that can’t stand up against modern scientific knowledge. 
      We can’t criticize Christian creationists while we become Buddhist 
      variants of the same.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>IM:</B> What are some of your favorite sutta passages?</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>BB:</B> When I first began to read Buddhist texts while I was in 
      graduate school, I was naturally impressed by the Buddha’s teachings on 
      dependent origination, the five aggregates, nonself, etc., which take us 
      to the heart of the Dhamma. But one of the suttas that made the strongest 
      impressions on me is not to be found among these deep texts on meditation 
      and realization. When I read the suttas on dependent origination and 
      nonself, I thought: the Buddha is certainly enlightened, but maybe not 
      perfectly so. However, when I came to the Sigalaka Sutta (Digha Nikaya 31) 
      my doubts were dispelled. When I read this sutta, particularly the section 
      on &quot;worshipping the six directions&quot; (In the Buddha’s Words, pp. 116–18), 
      and saw how one who had fathomed the deepest truths of existence could 
      also teach in detail parents how to bring up their children, a husband and 
      a wife how to love and respect each other, and an employer how to care for 
      his workers, I then knew: This teacher is indeed perfectly enlightened. To 
      my mind, this sutta showed that the Buddha possessed not only the 
      &quot;ascendant wisdom&quot; that rises up to the highest truth, but the &quot;descending 
      wisdom&quot; embraced by compassion that drops down again to the level of the 
      world and, in the light of the fullest realization, teaches and guides 
      others in the way that suits them best.</P>
      <P>One of the features of the suttas that impressed me the most, when I 
      first read them and even now, are the similes. It seems that the Buddha 
      was capable of picking up any natural phenomenon or any object from 
      everyday life and turning it into a striking simile that conveys an 
      important point about his teaching. The sun, moon and stars; flowers and 
      trees, rivers, lakes and oceans; the changes of the seasons; lions, 
      monkeys, elephants and horses; kings, ministers and warriors; craftsman, 
      surgeons and thieves – the list of things that enter into his similes 
      becomes almost endless. Sometimes you might be reading a series of suttas 
      that seem as dry as dust, and suddenly you come across a simile so fresh 
      and vivid that the image never fades from your mind even after decades.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>IM:</B> What are some of the particular challenges you face as a 
      translator?</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>BB:</B> Any language, I have found, has an underlying conceptual scheme 
      built into it by the metaphors that govern its vocabulary and by the 
      connotations and nuances of its words. Thus in translating from one 
      language into another, one is always faced with the problem of dissonance 
      between their two underlying conceptual schemes. This leads to conflicts 
      that often can only be resolved by sacrificing important conceptual 
      connections in the original language for the sake of elegance or 
      intelligibility in the target language. This problem becomes all the more 
      acute when one is translating from an ancient language utilizing a 
      somewhat archaic set of conceptual metaphors into a modern language 
      pertaining to a very different culture.</P>
      <P>We can see this problem in some of the simplest P<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āli</FONT> 
      words. For instance, the word <I>samadhi</I> can be translated as 
      &quot;concentration, composure, collectedness, mental unification, etc.,&quot; but 
      none of these renderings convey the idea that samadhi denotes a specific 
      meditative state, or set of meditative states, in the Buddhist (and 
      broader Indian) system of spiritual cultivation. Even the word <I>sati,</I> 
      rendered <I>mindfulness</I>, isn’t unproblematic. The word derives from a 
      verb, sarati, meaning &quot;to remember,&quot; and occasionally in P<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āli</FONT> 
      sati is still explained in a way that connects it with the idea of memory. 
      But when it is used in relation to meditation practice, we have no word in 
      English that precisely captures what it refers to. An early translator 
      cleverly drew upon the word <I>mindfulness</I>, which is not even in my 
      dictionary. This has served its role admirably, but it does not preserve 
      the connection with memory, sometimes needed to make sense of a passage.</P>
      <I>
      <P>Satipatthana</I> is often translated &quot;<I>foundation of mindfulness</I>,&quot; 
      which sounds elegant; but if one knows P<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āli</FONT> 
      one might suspect that the compound represents not <I>sati + patthana</I> 
      (which gives us &quot;foundation of mindfulness&quot;), but <I>sati + upatthana</I>, 
      &quot;establishment of mindfulness&quot; (the <I>u</I> dropping off through union of 
      vowels). Then, if one knows the texts in the original, one will have 
      encountered a number of phrases that pair<I> sati</I> with words related 
      to <I>upatthana</I>, such as <I>upatthitassati</I>, &quot;one with mindfulness 
      established,&quot; but no other phrases that pair it with forms related to 
      patthana. And this would confirm the case for &quot;establishment of 
      mindfulness&quot; over &quot;foundation of mindfulness.&quot; However more graceful the 
      latter might sound, the accent is on the internal process of setting 
      mindfulness up rather than on the object to which it applies.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>IM:</B> As you look at the adaptations being made to traditional Therav<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āda</FONT> 
      teachings by Western teachers, which ones do you see as being useful and 
      which not so useful?</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>BB:</B> I’m reluctant to make judgments about what other teachers are 
      doing, but I will merely point to one important adaptation that has taken 
      place in the contemporary teaching of vipassana meditation that can easily 
      pass unnoticed. I get the impression that the purpose for which 
      mindfulness meditation is being taught in the West has undergone a sea 
      change from its traditional function, perhaps because many Western 
      teachers are teaching outside the framework of classical Buddhist 
      doctrine. Mindfulness meditation, it seems, is now taught mainly as a 
      means to heighten our experience of the present moment. The aim of the 
      practice is to enable us to accept everything that happens to us without 
      discrimination. Through heightened mindfulness of the present moment, we 
      learn to accept everything as intrinsically good, to see everything as 
      instructive, to experience everything as inherently rewarding. We can thus 
      simply abide in the present, heartily accepting whatever comes, open to 
      the ever-fresh, ever-unpredictable flow of events.</P>
      <P>Now at a certain level, such a style of teaching does impart valuable 
      lessons to us. It is certainly much better to accept whatever comes than 
      to live eagerly pursuing pleasure and anxiously fleeing pain. It is much 
      wiser to see the positive lessons inherent in pain, loss and transience 
      than to bemoan our miserable fate. However, to present this as the main 
      point of the Buddha’s teaching would be, in my view, a misinterpretation 
      of the Dhamma. The Buddha’s teaching, as given in the suttas, has quite a 
      different logic behind it. The teaching isn’t designed to culminate in 
      acceptance of the world, but to lead out beyond the confines of 
      conditioned experience to that which transcends the world, to the ageless 
      and deathless, which is also the cessation of suffering. Simply 
      maintaining awareness of the present in order to arrive at a detached 
      acceptance of the present could easily lead through the back door to a 
      reconciliation with samsara, to a <I><B>reaffirmation</B></I> of samsara, 
      not to release from samsara.</P>
      <P>In the classical teaching, through mindful attention to the present, we 
      zoom in on the arising and passing away of phenomena in order to gain 
      insight into their impermanence. But we don’t affirm the impermanence of 
      things; it is not in this way that we reach the end of suffering. The 
      insight into impermanence, <I>anicca</I>, becomes, rather, the gateway to 
      the insights into <I>dukkha</I>, the flawed nature of all conditioned 
      things, and <I>anatta</I>, the selfless nature of all phenomena. And 
      insight into these three characteristics brings disenchantment with all 
      conditioned things. From disenchantment comes dispassion, and from 
      dispassion liberation, the realization of <I>nibbana</I> here and now.</P>
      <P>The core of the Buddha’s teaching is not simply the thesis that 
      removing clinging enables us to live free from anxiety and grief. This is 
      a partial statement of the relationship between the first two Noble 
      Truths, but it doesn’t take us deep enough. A deeper analysis of the Four 
      Noble Truths has to bring in the five aggregates of clinging as the 
      essential meaning of the truth of suffering; it has to bring in the truth 
      that suffering originates from the craving for sense pleasures and the 
      craving for continued existence; and it has to bring in the truth that 
      suffering – the suffering of our bondage to the round of birth and death – 
      ends only with the exhaustion of craving. If this isn’t done, even the 
      teaching of the Four Truths, the heart of the Dhamma, won’t be complete.</P>
      <P>Of course, any teacher has to determine when it’s appropriate to 
      present such radical teachings full strength. Even the Buddha himself 
      fully taught the Four Noble Truths only when he was sure his audience 
      included people who could comprehend them. But for the proper Dhamma to 
      flourish there has to be at least an acknowledgment of the claims these 
      teachings make upon us, even if we decide that we must first prepare the 
      ground for them with more expedient adaptations of the liberating path.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>IM:</B> It’s striking in the suttas that the Buddha never recommends to 
      anyone his own path of the bodhisattva leading to buddhahood, but talks 
      instead only of arahantship as the goal. Why do you think this is?</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>BB:</B> This is a question to which I have given a great deal of 
      thought but haven’t been able to arrive at a final answer. Several ideas 
      about the Buddha found in the suttas conjointly point toward an embryonic 
      doctrine of a <I>bodhisattva</I> career during the Buddha’s own lifetime. 
      It thus seems hard to believe that while the Buddha was alive there 
      weren’t people who were inspired by his own example as compassionate 
      liberator and, rather than aim at direct attainment of <I>arahantship</I>, 
      instead aspired to attain the supreme enlightenment of buddhahood at some 
      future time. It also seems hard to believe that they wouldn’t have 
      approached the Buddha to ask for guidance in pursuing this goal and 
      received a fitting reply.</P>
      <P>But if this is the case, then the question arises: Why don’t we find 
      any teachings on the path to buddhahood in the suttas? Why should they 
      appear for the first time only in later texts like the Jatakas, Avadanas 
      and the early Mahayana sutras?</P>
      <P>I can’t provide a definite answer to this difficult and tantalizing 
      question, but I can offer two competing hypotheses, neither of which is 
      satisfactory. (1) In the oldest period the Buddha was viewed merely as the 
      first of the arahants, surpassing the others simply in his pedagogic 
      skills and personal charisma. Objection: This hypothesis implies that 
      almost everything that we find in the suttas about the Buddha’s powers, 
      types of knowledge and exalted stature is later accretion, which undercuts 
      the credibility of the texts themselves. (2) The early Buddhist councils 
      were held by monks who pursued the arahant ideal, so they deliberately 
      excluded texts irrelevant to their concerns, including those on the 
      bodhisattva path. Objection: The extant collections include texts giving 
      the Buddha’s advice to householders, housewives and kings on the 
      fulfillment of their respective duties, so they might just as well have 
      included texts giving his advice to bodhisattvas.</P>
      <P>So neither of these hypotheses works. The easiest answer I’ve been able 
      to come up with – though it’s not an entirely satisfactory one – is that 
      by his character and conduct the Buddha served as the model for 
      bodhisattva-aspirants, but since his teaching is ultimately about the 
      attainment of liberation, he cannot teach competing conceptions of the 
      final goal. Hence his teaching must finally exalt the person who realizes 
      the final goal, the arahant, and describe the path to arahantship. In any 
      case, the arahant’s path described in the early teachings served as the 
      foundation for the bodhisattva path as elaborated in later Sectarian 
      Buddhism and the Mahayana, so that the latter becomes impossible without 
      the former.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>IM:</B> Some people feel that the commentaries, especially those by 
      Buddhaghosa, present a different viewpoint – a more narrow interpretation 
      of Dhamma practice – than the suttas. How do you see the basic Dhamma 
      understanding of the suttas as compared to that in the commentaries? In 
      what ways are they the same or different?</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>BB:</B> The relationship between the suttas and the commentaries is an 
      extremely complex one and it is risky to make blanket judgments about it. 
      The commentaries are not original works by Buddhaghosa, but edited 
      versions of more ancient commentaries that had been preserved in Sri 
      Lanka. Their historical origins are obscure, but clearly they begin with 
      the suttas themselves; that is, there are suttas that are commentaries on 
      other suttas (e.g. MN 141, SN 12:31, SN 22:3, 4). During the early period 
      of oral transmission, the ancient Buddhist teachers must have developed a 
      body of commentary to go along with the root text, and this no doubt 
      accumulated with each generation in the way a rolling snow ball gathers 
      snow.</P>
      <P>The old Sri Lankan commentaries upon which Buddhaghosa drew – no longer 
      extant – were probably an archaeological treasure trove of material from 
      several centuries, perhaps beginning with the personal disciples of the 
      Buddha. Even in the commentaries we inherit, the most ancient layers seem 
      to precede the division of the original unitary Sangha into different 
      Buddhist schools, for they contain material that has found its way into 
      the exegetical traditions of various sects. The later material originates 
      from the teachers of the Therav<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āda</FONT> 
      lineage after it emerged as a distinct school and thus reflects its own 
      methods of interpretation. There was also a tendency for the schools to 
      exchange interpretative material, but unlike other schools, the 
      conservative Theravadins, to their credit, rigorously kept the newer 
      material outside the canonical works directly ascribed to the Buddha.</P>
      <P>To understand what the commentaries are doing at the doctrinal level, 
      we have to remember that the suttas themselves are not uniquely Therav<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āda</FONT> 
      texts. They are the Theravadin transmission of a class of scriptures 
      common to all the early Buddhist schools, each of which must have had its 
      own way of interpreting them. The commentaries that come to us from 
      Buddhaghosa (and others) take up the task of interpreting these texts from 
      the standpoint of the Therav<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āda</FONT> 
      school. Their view is thus necessarily narrower than that of the suttas 
      because it is more specific: they view the thought-world of the suttas 
      through the lens of the methods of exegesis developed by the early 
      Theravadin teachers, using these methods to explicate and elaborate upon 
      the early teachings.</P>
      <P>If we compare the suttas to a vast expanse of open territory, 
      reconnoitered from above as to the main features of its topography but 
      with its details only lightly sketched, then we might compare the 
      commentaries to a detailed account of the lay of the land. The question 
      is: Are the commentaries simply coming in and describing the landscape in 
      greater detail, or are they bringing in construction crews and building 
      housing schemes, shopping malls and highways on the virgin territory. The 
      answer, I think, would be a combination of both.</P>
      <P>To be brief, I would say there are two extreme attitudes one could take 
      to the commentaries. One, often adopted by orthodox Theravadins, is to 
      regard them as being absolutely authoritative almost on a par with the 
      suttas. The other is to disregard them completely and claim they represent 
      &quot;a different take on the Dhamma.&quot; I find that a prudent middle ground is 
      to consult the commentaries and use them, but without clinging to them. 
      Their interpretations are often illuminating, but we should also recognize 
      that they represent a specific systematization of the early teaching. They 
      are by no means necessitated by the early teaching, and on some points 
      even seem to be in tension with it</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>IM:</B> Many of the suttas end by stating that those listening to these 
      words understood, were very pleased, and oftentimes enlightened by their 
      hearing and understanding. That’s really quite amazing to contemplate.</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>BB:</B> The suttas themselves do not give an explanation, except to say 
      that while the Buddha was speaking, the listener’s mind became &quot;ready, 
      receptive, free from hindrances, elated and confident.&quot; But often they say 
      that before he spoke, the Buddha gave the discourse out of consideration 
      for a particular person or group of people in the audience, so he must 
      have known in advance that this person or group of people had the capacity 
      to realize the truth. I would attribute their agility in penetrating to 
      the truth of the Dhamma to three factors. The first is their accumulation 
      of sufficient<I> paramis</I>, or spiritual perfections, in previous 
      births. I fully believe in the principle of rebirth, and I believe that 
      enlightenment is to a great extent the fruit of one’s efforts expended 
      over many lives in the development of such virtues as generosity, moral 
      discipline, patience, energy, meditation, wisdom, lovingkindness, 
      determination and so forth. So although these people might not have 
      practiced Dhamma in this life before they met the Buddha Gotama, they 
      would have fulfilled their paramis under numerous Buddhas of the past.</P>
      <P>The second factor is a deep but unconscious yearning for purification 
      and understanding of truth. This yearning might not have been operating at 
      the surface level of their minds – they might have been busy merchants, 
      humble housewives or simple servants – but in their quiet moments, some 
      urge towards truth, goodness and spiritual beauty must have gripped their 
      minds and caused a deep feeling of unrest in their hearts, an anguish that 
      was only quenched when they met the Buddha and heard him preach.</P>
      <P>A third factor, in some cases, could have been a stark encounter with 
      suffering, either gross or subtle, that tore the veil of delusion away 
      from their eyes and set them in quest of a path to final deliverance. When 
      two or three of these factors were fulfilled, they were like lotus flowers 
      at the surface of the pond, awaiting only the rising of the sun to 
      blossom. The appearance of the Buddha was the rising of the sun, and his 
      teaching of the Dhamma was the shedding of the sun’s rays that opened the 
      lotuses of their minds to the ultimate truth.</P>
