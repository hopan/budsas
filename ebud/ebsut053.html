      <TD WIDTH="100%"><FONT SIZE="6">R</FONT>hys Davids in his Buddhist India 
      (p. 188) has given a chronological table of Buddhist literature from the 
      time of the Buddha to the time of Asoka which is as follows:--<P>1. The 
      simple statements of Buddhist doctrine now found, in identical words, in 
      paragraphs or verses recurring in all the books.</P>
      <P>2. Episodes found, in identical words, in two or more of the existing 
      books.</P>
      <P>3. The Silas, the Parayana, the Octades, the Patimokkha.</P>
      <P>4. The Digha, Majjhima, Anguttara, and Samyutta Nikayas.</P>
      <P>5. The Sutta-Nipata, the Thera-and Theri-Gathas, the Udanas, and the 
      Khuddaka Patha.</P>
      <P>6. The Sutta Vibhanga, and Khandhkas.</P>
      <P>7. The Jatakas and the Dhammapadas.</P>
      <P>8. The Niddesa, the Itivuttakas and the Patisambbhida.</P>
      <P>9. The Peta and Vimana-Vatthus, the Apadana, the Cariya-Pitaka, and the 
      Buddha-Vamsa.</P>
      <P>10. The Abhidhamma books; the last of which is the Katha-Vatthu, and 
      the earliest probably the Puggala-Pannatti.</P>
      <P>This chronological table of early Buddhist; literature is too 
      catechetical, too cut and dried, and too general to be accepted in spite 
      of its suggestiveness as a sure guide to determination of the chronology 
      of the Pali canonical texts. The Octades and the Patimokkha are mentioned 
      by Rhys Davids as literary compilations representing the third stage in 
      the order of chronology. The Pali title corresponding to his Octades is 
      Atthakavagga, the Book of Eights. The Book of Eights, as we have it in the 
      Mahaniddesa or in the fourth book of the Suttanipata, is composed of 
      sixteen poetical discourses, only four of which, namely, (1.) Guhatthaka, 
      (2) Dutthatthaka. (3) Suddhatthaka and (4) Paramatthaka share the common 
      title of Atthaka and consist each of eight stanzas. That is to say, the 
      four only out of tile sixteen poems fulfil the definition of an Atthaka or 
      octade, while none of the remaining poems consists, as it ought to, of 
      eight stanzas. The present Atthakavagga composed of sixteen poems may be 
      safely placed anterior to both the Mahaniddesa and Suttanipata. But before 
      cataloguing it as a compilation prior to the four Nikayas and the Vinaya 
      texts, it is necessary to ascertain whether the Atthakavagga presupposed 
      by the four Nikayas was a book of four poems bearing each the title of 
      Atthaka and consisting each of eight stanzas or it was even in its 
      original form an anthology of sixteen poems. Similarly in placing the 
      Patimokkha in the same category with the Silas and Parayanas it would be 
      important to enquire whether the Patimokkha as bare code of monastic rules 
      was then in existence or not, and even if it were then in 
      existence,whether it contained in its original form 227 rules or less than 
      this number. There are clear passages in the Anguttara Nikaya to indicate 
      that the earlier code was composed of one and half hundred rules or little 
      more (sadhikam diyaddhasikkhapadasatam, A. N., Vol. II, p.232) . As 
      Budddhaghosa explains the Pali expression, &quot; Sadhikam 
      diyaddhasikkhapadasatain &quot;, it means just 150 rules. According to a more 
      reasonable interpertation the number implied in the expression must be 
      taken more than 150 and less than 200. If the earlier code presupposed by 
      the Anguttara passages was composed of rules near about 150 and even not 
      200, it may be pertinently asked if the Patimokkha, as we now have it;, 
      was the very code that had existed prior to the Anguttara Nikaya. Our 
      doubt as to the antiquity of the Patimokkha as a bare code of rules is 
      intensified by the tradition recorded by Buddhaghosa in the Introduction 
      to his Sumangalavilasini, (pt. I.,p. 17) that the two codes of Patimokkha 
      were to be counted among the books that were not rehearsed in the First 
      Buddhist Council.</P>
      <P>The putting of the first four Nikatyas under head No. 4 with the 
      implication that these were anterior to the Suttanipata and the remaining 
      books of the Pali canon are no less open to dispute. With regard to the 
      Dighanikaya it has been directly pointed out by Buddhaghosa that the 
      concluding verses of the Mahaparinibbana Suttanta relating to the 
      redisribution of Buddha's bodily remains were originally composed by the 
      rehearsers of the Third Buddhist Council and added later on by the 
      Buddhist teachers of Ceylon. A material objection to putting the Digha and 
      the Anguttara Nikayas in the same category is that in the Digha Nikaya the 
      story of Mahagovinda (Digha, II., pp. 220 foll.) has assumed the earlier 
      forms of Jatakas characterised by the concluding identification of Buddha, 
      the narrator of the story, with its hero, while in the Anguttara Nikaya 
      the story is a simple chronicle of seven purohitas without the 
      identification. The four Nikayas are interspersed with a number of 
      legendary materials of the life of the Buddha which appear at once to be 
      inventions of a later age when the Buddha came to be regarded and 
      worshipped as a superhuman personality.(1) Our case is that without 
      discriminating the different strata of literary accretion it will be 
      dangerous to relegate all the four Nikayas to the early stage of the Pali 
      canon.</P>
      <P>The Suttanipata figures promniently in the fifth order of the 
      chronology suggested by Rhys Davids. Without disputing that there are 
      numerous instances of archaism in the individual suttas or stanzas 
      composing this anthology, we have sufficient reasons to doubt that the 
      anthology as a whole was at all anterior to the Niddesa which heads the 
      list of the Pali Canonical texts representing the eighth order. By the 
      Niddesa we are to understand two separate exegetical works counted among 
      the books of the Khuddaka-Nikaya, (l) the Mahaniddesa being a philological 
      commentary on the poems of the Atthakavagga (forming the fourth book of 
      the Sutta-Nipata) and (2) the Cullaniddesa being a similar commentary on 
      the poems of the Parayanavagga (forming the fifth or the last book of the 
      Sutta-Nipata). The two questions calling for an answer in this connection 
      are (vide B. M. Barua's Atthakavagga and Parayanavagga as two independent 
      Buddhist anthologies -- Proceedings and Transactions of the Fourth 
      Oriental Couference, Allahabad, 1928, pp. 211-219) (1) was the Mahaniddesa 
      composed, being intended as a commetary on the Atthakavagga, the fourth 
      book of the Sutta-Nipata or on the Atthakavagga, then known to the 
      Buddhist Community as a distinct anthology? and (2) was the Cullaniddesa 
      composed, being intended as a colmmentary on the Parayanavagga, the fifth 
      book of the Sutta Nipata or on the Parayanavagga then known to the 
      Buddhist community as a distinct collection of poems? With regard to the 
      second question it may be pointed out that the poems of the Parayana 
      group, as these are found in the Sutta-Nipata, are Prologued by 56 
      Vattugathas, while the Cullaniddesa is found without these introductory 
      stanzas. The inference as to the exxclusion is based upon the fact that in 
      the body of the Cullanid-desa, there is nowhere any gloss on any of the 
      introductory stanzas. We notice, moreover, that the glosses of the 
      Cullaniddesa are not confined to the sixteen poems of the Parayanavagga, 
      the scheme of the Canonical Commentary including an addi tional sutta, 
      namely, the Khaggavisana, which now forms the second sutta of the first 
      book of the Sutta-Nipata, From the place assigned to this particular sutta 
      in the Cullaniddesa, it is evident that when the Cullaniddesa was 
      composed, it passed as a stray sutta, not belonging to any particular 
      group, such as the Uragavagga. The stray nature of the Khaggavisana Sutta 
      may be taken as conclusive also from its mixed Sanskrit version in the 
      Mahavastu (Senart's edition, Vol. I., pp. 357-359), in which, too, it is 
      not relegated to any group. If any legitimate hypothesis is to be made 
      keeping the above facts in view it should be that the scheme of anthology 
      in the Cullaniddesa rather shows the anthology of the Sutta-Nipata yet in 
      the making than presupposing it as a fait accompli.</P>
      <P>Even with regard to the first question concerniug the chronological 
      order of the Mahaniddesa and Sutta-Nipata, a similar hypothesis may be 
      entertained without much fear of contradiction. The Mahaniddesa, according 
      to its internal evidence, is an exegetical treatise which was modelled on 
      an earlier exegesis attempted by Mahakaccana on one of the Suttas of the 
      Atthakavagga, namely, the Magandiya Sutta (Mahaniddesa, pp. 197 ff). The 
      modern exegesis of Mahakaccana forming the corner stone of the Mahaniddesa 
      can be traced as a separate sutta of the Samyutta Nikaya, Vol. III., p.9, 
      where the Sutta commented upon by Mahakaccana is expressly counted as a 
      sutta of the Atthakavsagga (Atthakavaggike Magandiya panhe). Once it is 
      admitted that the Atthaka group of poems had existeed as a distinct 
      anthology even before the first redaction of the Samyutta Nikaya sand 
      Mahakaccana's model exegesis on one of its suttas and, moreover, that the 
      Mahaniddesa as an exegetical work wars entirely based upon that; earlier 
      model, it is far safer to think that the Mahaniddesa presupposes the 
      Atthakavagga itself as a distinct collection of poems rather than the 
      Atthaka- vagga of the Sutta-Nipata. Though the scheme of anthology in the 
      Mahaniddesa includes only the poems of the Atthaka group, there is a 
      collateral evidence to prove that in an earlier stage of Pali Canonical 
      literature two stray poems were associated with those of the Atthaka group 
      just in the same way that the stray poem, Khaggavisana suttta, has been 
      associated in the Cullaniddesa with the poems of the Parayana group.</P>
      <P>The Divyavadana, (Cowell and Neil Ed., p. 35) for instance, mentions 
      that Purna, an associate of Sthavira Mahakatyayana, recited the Munigatha 
      and Sailagatha along with the poems Munigatha of Arthavarga (Pali 
      Atthakavagga with the implication that the (corresponding to Pali 
      Munisutta) and Sailagatha (corresponding to Pali Selasutta), included 
      respectively in the Uragasutta, the first book and in the Mahavagga, the 
      third book of the Sutta-Nipata, were associated with the poems of the 
      Atthaka group. To put forward another argument the Nalaka Sutta in the 
      third book of the Sutta-Nipata is prologued by twenty Vatthugatha or 
      introductory stanzas which are absent from its mixed Sanskrit version in 
      the Mahavastu (Vol. III pp.386, ff.). Judged by the theme and metre of the 
      Vatthugatha, they stand quite apart from the Sutta proper. The Sutta 
      proper is a moral discourse of the Buddha which is quite on a par with 
      several suttas in the Sutta-Nipata and other texis, while in the 
      Vatthugatha, we come to hit all of a sudden on a highly poetical 
      composition serving as a historical model to the Buddhacarita of 
      Agvaghosa. The Moneyasute (Moneyya Sutta) is one of the seven tracts 
      recommended by King Asoka in his Bhabru Edict for the constant study of 
      the Buddhists. This Sutta has been rightly identified by Prof. D. Kosambi 
      (Indian Antiquary, 1912, Vol. XLI, pp. 37-40) with the Nalaka Sutta in the 
      Sutta-Nipata which, as pointed out above, has a counterpart in the 
      Mahavastu (Mahavastu Ed. Senart, vol. II., pp.30-43 &amp; Vol.III., pp. 382 
      ff.)where it does not bear any specific title. Judged by its theme, 
      Moneyya Sutta is more an appropriate title than Nalaka. The importance of 
      its naming as Nalaka arises only when the Vatthugatha or the introductory 
      stanzas are prefixed to the Sutta without any logical connection between 
      the two. Considered in the light of Asoka's title Moneya-sute and the 
      counterpart in the Mahavastu as well as of the clear anticipa tion of 
      Asvaghosa's Buddhacarita in the Vatthugatha, it appears that the 
      christening of the Moneyya sutta as Nalaka and the edition of the 
      introductory stanzas took place some time after Asoka's reign and not 
      before. Some stanzas of the Padhana Sutta have been quoted in the 
      Kathavatthu which, according to the Buddhist tradition, was a compilation 
      of Asokan time. The stanzas are quoted without any mention of the Sutta or 
      of the text on which these have been drawn. The Pali version of the) Sutta 
      is to be found only in the Sutta-Nipata, Book III. The inference that call 
      legitimately be drawm from the quotation is that the Papdhana Sutta had 
      existed in some form prior to the compilation of the Kathavatthu, leaving 
      the question of the Sutta- Nipata altogether open.</P>
      <P>The Khuddakapatha figures as the last book in the fifth order, it being 
      supposed to be earlier than the Sutta Vibhanga, the Khandhakas, the 
      Jatakas, the Dhammapadas, the Peta and Vimanavatthus as well as the 
      Kathavatthu. Buddhaghosa in the introduction to his Sumangalavilasini, 
      informs us that the Dighabhanaka list of the Pali Canonical texts 
      precluded these four books, namely, the Buddhavamsa, the Cariyapitaka, the 
      Apadana and the Khuddakapatha while the Majjhimabhanaka list included the 
      first three of them. The preclusion may be explained either as due to 
      sectarian difference of opinion or due to the fact that when the 
      Dighabhanaka list was drawn up these four texts were non-existent. If a 
      comparison be made between the Khuddakapatha and the Khandheakas, it will 
      be noticed that the first short; lesson (saranattayam) of the 
      Khuddakapatha was nothing but a ritualistic elaboration of an earlier 
      refuge formula that can be traced in a passage of the Khandhakas. The 
      second lesson may be regarded as rnade up of an extract from another 
      passage occurring in the Khandhakas. The same observation holds true also 
      of the fourth lesson, the Kumarapanham. The sources being not mentioued, 
      it is indecisive whether the Khuddakapatha has drawn upon the Khandhakas 
      or on some isolated passages. But if judging by the nature of differences 
      in the common passages we are to pronounce our opinion on the relative 
      chronology of the two texts, the priority must be accorded rather to the 
      Khandhakas than to the Khuddakapatha. The Tirokuddasutta of the 
      Khuddakapatha is the first and the most important sutta of the Petavatthu. 
      The existence of this sutta previous to the reign of king Asoka is clearly 
      proved by certain quotations in the Kathavatthu from it. Here again we are 
      to grope in the dark whether the quotations were from the Tirokudda as an 
      isolated Sutta or from a sutta in the Petavatthu or in the Khuddakapatha. 
      If any inference may be drawn from the high prominence that it enjoys in 
      the Petavatthu our opinion will be rather in favour of priority of the 
      Petavatthu. Now coming to the Kathavatthu, we have already mentioned that 
      it contains certain significant quotations from two suttas, the Tirokudda 
      and the Nidhikanda, both of which are embodied in the Khuddakapatha, but 
      there is nothing to show that when the Kathavatthu was compiled with these 
      quotations the Khuddakapatha itself was then in actual existence, it being 
      quite probable that the quotations were made front the two isolated 
      suttas, we mean when these suttas had not come to be included in the 
      Khuddakapatha.</P>
      <P>The Abhidhamma treatises figure as latest compilations in the 
      chronological table of Rhys Davids. Of the seven Abhidhamma books, the 
      Kathavatthu is traditionally known as a compilation of Asokan age. The 
      credibility of the tradition can be proved by a very peculiar dialectical 
      style of composition developed in the all-important book of Buddhist 
      Controversies and the traces of which can also be found to linger in some 
      of the inscriptions of Asoka, namely the Kalsi Shahabazgarhi and 
      Manserahversions of the ninth Rock Edict (Vide B. M. Barua's old Brahmi 
      Inscriptions, p. 284). Another and more convincing piece of evidence may 
      be brought forward to prove the credibility of the tradition. Prior to the 
      despatch of missionaries by Asoka, Buddhism as a religious movement was 
      confined, more or less, within the territorial limits of what is known in 
      Buddhist literature as the Middle Country (Majjhimadesa) and the Buddhist 
      tradition in Pail is very definite on this point. The Sanci stupas which 
      go back to the date of Asoka enshrine to the relies of the missionarieswho 
      were sent out to the Himalayan tracts as also of the &quot; good man &quot; 
      Mogaliputa, aptly identified by Dr. Geiger with Moggaliputta Tissa, the 
      traditional author of the Kathavatthu. Curiously enough, the Kathavatthu 
      contains the account of a controversy, (I.3) in which it has been 
      emphatically pointed out that up till the time of this particular 
      controversy, the Buddhist mode of holy life remained confined to the 
      places within the middle country and had not gained ground in any of the 
      outlying tracts (paccantimesu janapadesu), the representatives of Buddhism 
      whether the monks or the laity having had no access to those regions (B.M. 
      Barua, Old Brahmi Inscriptions, p.284). The account clearly brings out one 
      important historical fact,namely, that so far as out; the outlying tracts 
      are concerned, there were undeniably at that time other modes of Indian 
      holy life. It is interesting to find that the 13th Rock Edict of Asoka is 
      in close agreement with the Kathavatthu regarding this point. For in this 
      important edict issued in about the 13th or 14th regnal year of King 
      Asoka, His Gifted Majesty definitely says that there was at the time no 
      other tract within his empire save versions and except the Yona region 
      where the different sects of Indian recluses, the Samanas and Brahmanas 
      were not to be found and where the inhabitants had not adhered to the 
      tenets of one or other of those sects (Vide Inscriptions of Asoka by 
      Bhandarkar and Majumdar. pp. 49-50- &quot;Nathi cha she janapade yata nathi ime 
      nikaya anamta yenesha bamhmane cha shamane cha nathi cha kuva pi 
      janapadashi (ya) ta nathi manushanam ekatalashi pi pashadashi no nama 
      pashade&quot;). Squaring up the two-fold evidence, it is easy to come to the 
      conclusion that the compilation of the Kathavatthu could not be remote 
      from the reign of Asoka.</P>
      <P>In the Kathavatthu, there are quotations the sources of which can now 
      be traced in some of the passages in the Vinaya Pitaka, Digha Nikaya, the 
      Majjhima Nikaya, the Samyutta Nikaya, the Anguttara Nikaya and some of the 
      books of the Khuddaka Nikaya. A few of the quotations can be traced in the 
      Dhammasangani and the Vibhanga among the Abhidhamma books. As the passages 
      are quoted in the Kathavatthu without any mention of the sources, rather 
      as wellknown and authoritative words of the Buddha, it cannot be 
      definitely maintained that the quotations were cited from the canonical 
      texts in which the individual passages are traceable. There were suttas in 
      some definite collections but until other definite evidences are 
      forthcoming, it will be risky to identify them with the Nikayas and the 
      Vinaya texts as they are known to us. Even with regard to this point our 
      position remains materially the same if we take our stand on the evidence 
      of the Inscriptions of Asoka, particularly on that of the Bhabru Edict. 
      The Bhabru Edict clearly points back to a well-known collection of 
      Buddha's words, the words which came to be believed as at; once final and 
      authoritative (ekemchi bhamte Bhagavata Buddhena bhasite save se 
      subhasite). But here again we are helpless as to by what name this 
      collection was then designated and what were its divisions? If such be the 
      state of thing, it will be difficult to regard all the Abhidhamma books in 
      the lump as the latest productions among the books of the Pali Pitakas. As 
      for the chronology of the Pali canonical texts, the safer course will be 
      to fix first of all the upper and lower limits and then to ascertain how 
      the time may be apportioned between them in conceiving their chronological 
      order. As regards the upperlimit certain it is that we cannont think of 
      any text on Buddhism before the enlightenment of the Buddha. Whatever be 
      the actual date of the individual texts, it is certainly posterior to the 
      great event of Buddha's enlightenment, nay, posterior even to the 
      subsequent incident of the first public statement or promulgation of the 
      fundamental truth of the new religion. The upper limit may be shifted on 
      even to the demise of the Buddha, even to the demise of the Buddha, the 
      first formal collection of the teachings of the Buddha having taken place, 
      according to the unanimity of the Buddhist tradition, after that memorable 
      event. Looked at from this point of view, the period covered by the career 
      of 45 years of Buddha's active missionary work may be regarded just as the 
      formative period which saw the fashioning of the early materials of the 
      Buddhist Canon. With regard to the lower limit we need not bring it so far 
      down as the time of the Pali scholiasts, Buddhadatta, Buddhaghosa and 
      Dhammapala, that is to say, to the fifth century A. D. Going by the 
      tradition, the Buddhist canon became finally closed when it was committed 
      to writing for the first time during the reign of King Vattagamani of 
      Ceylon (Circa 29-17 B.C.). The truth of this tradition can be 
      substantiated by the clear internal evidence of the text of the Milinda 
      Panha which was a compilation of about the first century A. D. As is 
      well-known, in several passages, the author of the Milinda Panha has 
      referred to the Pali books or to some chapters of them by name and the 
      number of books mentioned by name is sufficiently large to exhaust almost 
      the traditional list. Further, it is evident from references in this text 
      that when it was compiled the division of the canon into three Pitakas and 
      five Nikayas was well established. The Dhammasangani, the Vibhanga, the 
      Dhatukatha, and the rest were precisely the seven books which composed the 
      Abhidhamma Pitaka and the Digha, Majjhima, Samyutta, Ekuttara (Anguttara) 
      and Khuddaka were the five Nikayas which composed the Sutta Pitaka. The 
      Simhalese commentaries, the Mahaatthakatatha, the Mahapaccariya, the 
      Mahakurundiya, the Andhaka and the rest, presupposed by the commentaries 
      of Buddhadatta, Buddhaghusa and Dhammapala point to the same fact, namely, 
      that the canon became finally closed sometime before the begining of the 
      Christian era. Thus we can safely fix the fast quarter of the first 
      century B. C. as the lower limit.</P>
      <P>The interval of time between these two limits covers not less than four 
      centuries during which there had been convened as many as six orthodox 
      councils, three in India and three in Ceylon, the first during the reign 
      of King Ajatasattu, the second in the reign of King Kalasoka (Kakavarni of 
      the Puranas), the third in the reign of Asoka, the fourth in the reign of 
      King Devanam Piyatissa of Ceylon, the fifth in the reign of King 
      Dutthagamani and the sixth or the last in the reign of King Vattagamani. 
      The Pali accounts of these councils make it clear that the purpose of each 
      of them was the recital and settling of the canonical texts. If these 
      councils can be regarded as certain definite landmarks in the process of 
      the development of Pali canonical literature, we can say that during the 
      first four centuries after the Buddha's demise, Pali literature underwent 
      as many as six successive redactions. Going by the dates assigned to these 
      councils, we may divide the interval into such short- er periods of Pali 
      literary history as shown below:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>First period --- (483--383 B.C.)<BR>
        Second period --- (383--265 B.C.)<BR>
        Third period --- (265--230 B.C.)<BR>
        Fourth period --- (230--80 B.C.)<BR>
        Fifth period --- (80-20 B.C.)</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Keeping these periods in view, we can easily dispose of some of the 
      Pali books. We may take, for instanices, the Parivarapatha which is the 
      last treatise to be included in the Vinayapitaka. This treatise, as early 
      stateed in the Colophon (nigamana) was written in Ceylon by Dipa, 
      evidently a learned Buddhist scholar of Ceylon as a help to his pupils to 
      the study of the contents of the Vinaya (Parivarapatha, p.226, 
      &quot;Pubbacariyamaggan ca pucchitva'va tahim tahim Dipanamo mahapanno 
      sutadharo vicakkhano imam vitthara samkhepam sajjhamaggena majjhime 
      cintayitva Iikhapesi sissakanam sukhavaham Parivaran ti yam vuttam sabbam 
      vatthum salakkhanam attham attena saddhamme dhammam dhammena pannatte &quot;). 
      As such the Parivarapatha was composed as a digest of the subject-matter 
      of Vinaya or Buddhist discipline. We say that this treatise was composed 
      in Ceylon because there are references within the text itself that it had 
      been written after the Vinayapitaka was promulgated by Thera Mahinda and a 
      number of his disciples and by their disciples in Ceylon. The succession 
      of his disciples from the time of Thera Mahinda as set forth in the 
      Parivarapatha (pp. 2-3) may suffice to show that the date of its 
      composition could not be much earlier than the reign of Vattagamani. Even 
      we may go so far as to suggest that the Parivarapatha was the Vinaya 
      treatise which was canonised at the council held during the reign of 
      Vattagamani. For it is clearly stated in that the author caused the 
      treatise to be written (likhapesi), a mode of preserving the scriptures 
      which would be inconceivable before the reign of Vattagamani.The reference 
      to the island of Tambapanni or Ceylon is not only in the verses which one 
      might set aside as interpolation but in the prose portions which form the 
      integral parts of the text.</P>
      <P>Now if we fix our attention on the traditional verses embodied in the 
      Parivarapatha (pp.2-3 edited by Oldenberg) we have to infer therefrom that 
      the five Nikayes, the seven treatises of the Abhidhammapitaka and all the 
      older texts of the Vinayapitaka were made known to the people of Ceylon by 
      the wise Mahinda who arrived in Ceylon from Jambbudipa(India) after the 
      third Buddhist council had been over. (Parivarapathapp. 2-3, &quot;Upali 
      Dasako, c'eva Sonako Siggavo tatha, Moggaliputtena Pancama ete 
      Jambusirivhaye tato Mahindo Ittiyo Uttiyo Sambalo tatha Bhaddanamo ca 
      pandito, ete naga mahapanna Jambudipaidhagata, Vinayam te vacayimsu 
      pitakam Tambapan niya nikaye panca vacesum satta c'eva pakarane&quot;).</P>
      <P>The Mahavagga and the Cullavagga are two among the earlier and 
      important texts of the Vinayapitaka. Twentytwo Khandhakas or stock 
      fragments are distributed into the two texts, ten into the Mahavagga and 
      the remaining twelve into the Cullavagga. These fragments constituting the 
      separate divisions are arranged in a chronological order, and they are 
      intended to present a connected account of the ecclesiastical history of 
      the Buddhists from the time of the enlightenment of the Buddha down to 
      that of the second Buddhist council which was convened, according to the 
      Cullavagga account, a century after the demise of the Buddha 
      (Vassasataparinibbute Bhagavati). The growth of the two texts may be 
      sought to be accounted for by these two hypotheses: (1) that the 
      Khandhakas were being added as they came into existence from time to time, 
      or (2) that they were arranged all at the same time according to a set 
      plan. Whatever be the actual merit of these hypotheses, none of them 
      prevents us from maintaining that the series of the Khandhakas was closed 
      with the inclusion of the account of the second Buddhist council and that 
      nothing material was added after that, nothing, we mean to say, except the 
      Uddanas or mnemonics in doggerel verses appended to each of the 
      Khandhakas. Had the compilation of the Khandhakas remained open after the 
      second Buddhist council, it would have included an account of the later 
      councils, particularly of one held during the reign of Asoka. This line of 
      argument is sufficientiy strong to establish that the compilation of the 
      twenty two Khandhakas as we find them embodied in the Mahavagga and 
      Cullavagga was anterior to the reign of Asoka, as well as that its history 
      is primarily associated with the tradition of the second Buddhist council. 
      Assuming then that the closing of the collection of the Khandhakas in the 
      shape of the Mahavagga and the Cullavagga could not be removed from the 
      first century of the Buddha era, we may briefly examine what inferences 
      can be drawn from the Cullavagga accounts of the first and second Buddhist 
      councils regarding the development of the Canonical texts. First with 
      regard to the carlier Vinaya texts, the Cullavagga account of the second 
      Buddhist council (Chap. 12) has referred to the following authorities by 
      name, namely: </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>(1) Savatthiya Suttavibhanga<BR>
        (2) Rajagahe Suttavibhanga<BR>
        (3) Savatthiys Suttavibhanga<BR>
        (4) Savatthiya sutta<BR>

        (6) Savatthiya sutta<BR>
        (7) Rajagahe sutta<BR>
        (8) Rajagahe uposathasamyutte<BR>
        (9) Campeyyake Vinaya Vatthusmin.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The Suttavibhanga passages referred to in the Cullavagga account have 
      been all found out by Prof. Oldenberg in the Suttavibhanga and what is 
      more, the identified passages have satisfied the context supplied 
      (Savatthiya, Rajagahe Kosambiya). Keeping this fact in view can it be 
      doubted that the Suttavibhanga of the Vinayapitaka was current as an 
      authoritative text on Vinaya when the Cullavagga account referring to its 
      passages was written? Now with regard to the remaining two references, 
      namely, Rajagahe Uposathasamyutte and Campeyyake Vinayavatthusmin traced 
      respectively in the Mahavagga (II., 8. 3) and Mahavagga (IX. 3.5), it is 
      curious that the first reference is to a Samyutta passage and the second 
      to a Vinayavatthu. Although the Samyutta passaga has found its place in 
      the Mahavagga, so long as the fact remains that the reference is to a 
      passage in the Sutta collection, our inference must be that the Mahavagga 
      in its extant form was not yet in existence. The second reference is 
      important as pointing back to the existence of certain Vinayavatthus 
      serving as materials for a compilation like the Mahavagga.</P>
      <P>Turning at last to the Cullavagga account of the first Buddhist 
      council, it will be a mistake to suppose that the account as we have it in 
      the Cullavagga is as old as the time of the counci1 itself. The account 
      must have been posterior to the time when the scriptural authorities of 
      the Buddhist community comprised (1) Ubhato Vinaya-the disciplinary code 
      of the bhikkhunis, and (2) Panca-Nikaya-the five Nikayas, Digha, Majjhima 
      and the rest. Some of the Burmese manuscripts read Ubhato Vibhanga in lieu 
      of Ubhato Vinaya.* That may be a mistake. But the contents mentioned in 
      the Cullavagga account are uudoubtedly the contents oh the two vibhangas, 
      the Bhikkhu and the Bhikkhuni. The list of the Sikkhapadas codified as 
      bare rules in the two Patimokkhas is important as showing that the author 
      of the Cullavagga account kept in his mind nothing but the Suttavibhanga 
      with its two divisions: the Bhikkhu-Vibhanga and the Bhikkhuni-Vibhanga. 
      Further, when this account was written, the five Nikayas were well-known. 
      But the contnts mentioned are found to be only those of the first two 
      suttas of the Digha Nikaya, Vol. I., we mean the Brahmajala and the 
      Samannaphala-Suttantas. In the absence of the remaining details and of the 
      names of the separate texts it is impossible to say that the Digha-Nikaya 
      as presupposed was completed in all the three volumes as we now get or the 
      five Nikayas as presupposed contained all the fourteen suttanta texts as 
      we now have them. One thing is, however, certain that there is yet no 
      reference to the Abhidhamma treatises. For the reference to the 
      Abhidhamma-Pitaka we have to look into the Uddanagathas in which there is 
      mention of the three pitakas (Pitakam tini). But nothing should be built 
      upon it with regard to the development of canonical texts in so early a 
      period as this on the strength of these uddana gathas which are appar 
      ently later additions.</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>[* It may be observed that in giving an account of the first Buddhist 
        council, Buddhaghosa makes mention of Ubhato-Vibhanga signifying &quot; 
        thereby the whole text of theSutta Vibhanga completed in 64 bhanavaras 
        (Snmagalavilasini, pt.1., p.13)]</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The line of investigation hitherto followed has compelled us to 
      conclude that the Suttavibhanga with its two great divisions, e.g., the 
      Bhikkhu and the Bhikkhuni Vibhangas were extant as authoritative texts on 
      the questions of Vinaya previous to the compilation of the Mahavagga and 
      the Cullavagga. The hisori cal references that may be traced in the 
      Suttavibhanga appertain an to earlier times and cannot, therefore, justify 
      us in assigning the text to a period far removed from the demise of the 
      Buddha. but we have still to enquire whether or not the Suttavibhanga can 
      be regarded us the first or the earliest landmark of the Vinaya tracts. It 
      may be sound to premise that the first landmark of the Vinayapitaka is not 
      the landmark of the Vinaya tracts. The point at issue really is whether or 
      not the text of the Sutta Vibhanga forming the first landmark of the 
      Vinayapitaka presupposes certain earlier literary developments and if so, 
      where can this be traced? This is to seriously ask what; was the earlier 
      and more probable denotation of the term ubhato-vinaya, the two-fold 
      Vinaya. If we decline to interpret it in the sense of two-fold Vibhanga, 
      we must be raising this important issue just to remove an anomaly arising 
      from the two-fold significaion of the Pancanikaya divisions of the Pa1i 
      canon. Buddhaghosa, the great Pali scholiast, says that in their narrower 
      signification the five nikayas denoted the five divisions of the texts of 
      the Suttapitaka, and that in their wider signification the five nikayas 
      included also the texts of the remaining two pitakas, namely, the Vinaya 
      and the Abhidhamma, the Vinaya and Abhidhamma treatises being supposed to 
      be included in the Khuddakanikaya [Sumangalavilasini, pt. I., p.23, cf., 
      Atthasalini, p.26; Katamo Khaddakanikayo? Sakalam Vinayapitakam 
      Abhidhammapitakam Khuddakapathadayo ca pubbe-nidassita-pancadasa bheda 
      (pubbe dassitacuddasa pabheda iti pathantaram), thapetva cattaronikaye 
      avasesam Buddhavacanam]. Buddhaghosa also informs us that the Anumana 
      Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaya was known to the ancients as bhikkhuvinaya 
      and the Singalavada sutta of the Digha Nikaya was venerated as gihi 
      Vinaya.(1) It such terms as bhikkhuvinaya and gihivinaya had been current 
      among the Buddhists of olden times, it is pertinet to enquire whether the 
      expression &quot;the two-fold vinaya. &quot;was originally used to denote the 
      Bhikkhuvinaya and bhikkhunivinaya or the bhikkhuvinaya and gihivinaya. If 
      we examine the contents of the Anguttara or the Ekuttara Nikaya, we need 
      not be surprised to find that Anguttara abounds in the Vinaya passages. In 
      each nipata of this Nikaya we come across passages relating to the 
      two-fold Vinaya namely the Bhikkhu and Gihi. Looked at from this point of 
      view, the Anguttara Nikaya may justly be regarded as a sutta store-house 
      of distinct Vinaya tracts. In this very nikaya we hit upon a vinaya tract 
      (A. N., I., pp 98-100) which sets forth a rough sketch (matika) not of any 
      particular vinaya treatise but of the whole of the Vinaya pitaka. The list 
      of Vinaya topics furnished in this particular tract cannot be construed as 
      a table of contents of any particular text of the Vinaya pitaka. Similar 
      Vinaya tracts are scattered also in the suttas of other nikayas. The con 
      sideration of all these facts cannot but lead one to surmise that the 
      treatises of the Vinaya pitaka point to a sutta background in the vinaya 
      materials traceable in the Nikayas particularly in the Anguttara. The 
      Sutta background of the Vinaya texts is clearly hinted at in the 
      concluding words of the Patimokkha. &quot; So much of the words of the Blessed 
      One handed down in the Suttas, embraced in the suttas, comes into 
      recitation every half-month&quot; (Vinaya texts, S. B. E., Vol. I. p. 69). As 
      for the date of the composition of the two Patimokkha codes, one for the 
      bhikkhus (monks) and other for the bhik- khunis (nuns), it is important to 
      bear in mind that according to an ancient Buddhist tradition cited by 
      Buddhaghosa, the Patimokkha codes as they are handed down to us are two 
      among the Vinaya texts which were not rehearsed in the first Buddhist 
      council (SumangalavilasinI, pt. I., p. 17). It may he readily granted that 
      the codification of the Patimokkha rules in the extant shape was not 
      accomplished immediately after the demise of the Buddha. It is one thing 
      to sa this and it is quite another that the rules themselves in a 
      classified form had not been in existence from the earlier times. The 
      Cullavagga account of the first Buddhist council throws some clear light 
      on the process of codification. It is said that the utterance of the dying 
      Buddha authorising his followers to do away with the minor rules of 
      conduct (Khuddanu-Khuddakani sikkhapadani), if they so desired, formed a 
      bone of contention among the bhikkhus who took part in the proceedings of 
      the first Buddhist Coundil (See Milinda Panha, pp.142-144). They were 
      unable to decide which were precisely the minor rules they were authorised 
      to dispense with. Some suggested all but the four Parajika rules, some, 
      all but the four Parajika and thirteen Samghadisesa rules, some, all but 
      the four Parajika, 13 Samghadisesa and two Aniyata rules and thirty 
      Nissaggiya rules; some, all but the four Parajika, 13 Samghadisesa, two 
      Aniyata, thirty Nissaggiya and ninety-two Pacittiya rules and some 
      suggested all but 4 Parajika, 13 Samghadisesa, 2 Aniyata, 30 Nissaggiya, 
      92 Pacittiya and 4 Patidesaniya rules. The suggestion stopped with the 4 
      Patidesaniya rules and did not proceed beyond them, leaving us in the dark 
      as to what the bhikkhus meant by all but 11 all these &quot; (counted by 
      names). The Patimokkas code in its final form includes two hundred and 
      twenty-seven rules, that is to say, the seven adhikarana samathas and 
      seventy-five sekhiya rules in addition to those mentioned in the 
      Cullavagga account. Omitting the 75 sekhiya rules the total of the 
      Patimokkha precepts of conduct would come up to 152, If the theras of the 
      first Buddhist Council had in their view a Patimokkha code in which the 75 
      Sekhiya rules had no place, the total of precepts in the code recognised 
      by them was 152. Now we have to enquire if there is any definite literary 
      evidence to prove that in an earlier stage of codification, the total of 
      the Patimokkha precepts was fixed at 152. Happily the evidence is not far 
      to seek. The Anguttara Nikaysa, as we heave seen above, contains two 
      passages to indicate that the earlier Patimokkha code contained one and 
      half hundred rules or little more (Sadhikam diyaddhasikkhapadasatam). * 
      The earlier Patimokkha code with its total of 152 rules may be shown to 
      have been earlier than the Suttavibhanga on the ground that the 
      Sutta-Vibhanga scheme makes room for the 75 Sekhiya rules, thereby 
      rocognising the Patimokkha total to be 227 which was possible only in the 
      second or final stage of codification of the Patimokkha rules.</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>[ * Cf. Miinda Panha which refers to the some total of the Patimokkha

      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>In dealing with the chronology of the seven treatises of the 
      Abhidhammapitaka, we can only maintain that the order in which these 
      treatises are enumerated can be interpreted as the order of the 
      chronology. Any attempt at establishing such an interpretation would be 
      vitiated by the fact that the order of enumeration is not in all cases the 
      same. The order in which these are mentioned in the Milinda Panha (p.12) 
      and which has since become classical is as follows:-- (I) Dhammasangani 
      (Dhammasamgaha as Buddhaghosa calls it-vide Sumangalvilasini,p.17),(2) 
      Vibhanga,(3) Dhatukatha,(4) Puggalapannatti, (5) Kathavatthu, (6) Yamakra 
      and (7) Patthana.</P>
      <P>A somewhat different order is evident from a gatha occurring in 
      Buddaghosa's Sumangalavilasini, Pt. I., p. 15: <I>&quot;Dhammasamgani - 
      Vibhanganca - Kathavatthunca - Puggalam Dhatu - Yamaka - Patthanam 
      Abhidhammoti vuccati.&quot;</P>
      </I>
      <P>It be noticed that in the gatha ordor the Kathavatthu stands third 
      instead of fifth and the Dhatukatha stands fifth instead of third. We have 
      already noted that according to general interpretsaion of the five nikaya 
      divisions of the Pail canon, the Ahhidhamma treatises come under the 
      KhuddakaNikaya. This is apparently an anomaly which cannot be re moved 
      save by a liberal interpretation making it signify a sut- tanta 
      back-ground of the Abhidhammapitaka. Thus an enquiry into the suttanta 
      back-ground becomes a desideratum and we may lay down a general canon of 
      chronology in these terms. The closer connection with the Sutta materials, 
      the earlier is the date of composition. Among the seven Abhidhamma 
      treatises, tho Puggalapannatti and the Vibhanga stand out pro minently as 
      the two texts which bear a clear evidence of emergence from a Sutta 
      back-ground. The Puggala classifications in the Digha, Samyutta and 
      Anguttara Nikayas are seen to constitute at once the sutta back-ground and 
      the stereotyped Vibhangas or Niddesas, mostly contained in the Majjhima 
      Nikaya may be take to repesent the Sutta background of the Vibhanga. The 
      exact position of the Puggalapannatti in relation to the Suttanta 
      collections has been properly examined by Dr. Morris in his edition of the 
      Puggala Pannatti published for the P. T. S. London, Introduction, pp X-XI.</P>
      <P>We have just one remark to add, namely, that compared with the Suttanta 
      materials utilised in it, the Puggalapannatti is the least original 
      treatise of the Abhidhammapitaka and its inclusion in the Abhidhamma 
      Pitaka would have been utterly unjustifiable but for the Pannatti 
      classifications in the matika No. 1. Whatever be the actual date of its 
      compilation in respect of subject matter and treatment, it deserves to be 
      considered as the earliest of the Abhidhamma books.</P>
      <P>In the opinion of Mrs. Rhys Davids, the Vihhangs is &quot;anticipated&quot; by 
      the Dhammasangani, although &quot; it is by no means covered by the latter work 
      either in method or in matter&quot; (Vibhanga, P. T. S., Preface XIV). &quot;In 
      other words, the present hook (the Vibhanga) seems by Buddhists to have 
      ranked secpnd in the seven of its Pitaka not accidentally, but as a sequel 
      to the Dhammasangani requiring, in those who came to the study of it, a 
      familiarity categories and formulas of the latter work-that is with the 
      first book of the Abhidhamma &quot;, (Ibid, XIII). Thus whether the Vibbanga is 
      anticipated by the Dhammasangani or the latter is anticipated by the 
      former is the point at issue.</P>
      <P>Examining most of the chapters of the Vibhanga we find that each of 
      them has a Abhidhamma superstructure (Abhidharmma-bhajaniya) built upon 
      and kept distinct from a Suttanta exegesis (Suttantabhajaniya) the 
      counterpart of which is to be found in the first four nikayas and mostly 
      in the Majjhima, as it will appear from the following table:---</P>

      exegesis in its different chapters that the Vibhanga marks that stage of 
      the developmet of the Abhidhamms pitaka when the Abhidhamma or 
      Transcendental method of exegesis had not yet gained an independent 
      foothold, when, in other words, it ramained combined with the Suttanta or 
      earlier method. The predilection is as yet for attempting the exegesis of 
      the formulations in the Suttas. An independent treatment of pure topics of 
      Psychological ethics, such as we find in the Dhammasangani is far beyond 
      the scheme of the Vibhanga. In the progressive working out of exegetical 
      schemes, the Niddesa or detailed specification of meanings of terms comes 
      second to the uddesa or matika. Now if we compare the treatment of 
      Rupakkhandha in the Vibhanga (pp. 12-14) with that in the Dhammasangani 
      (pp. 124 ff.), we cannot but observe that all that the Vibhanga has to 
      present is merely the uddesa or matika of the Rupakkhandha section of the 
      Dhammasangani. The Niddesa of the rupa-matika is to be found in no other 
      Abhidhamma books than the Dhabmmsasangani. Mrs. Rhys Davids admits (in a 
      way arguing in ourofavour) that the contents of the Vibhanga are by no 
      means covered by the Dhammasangani. The Vibhanga has, for instsnce, a 
      section entited Paccayakaravibhanga, an exegesis on the causal relations. 
      The paccayas fall outside the scope of the Dhammasangani and they form the 
      subject matters of the great Abhidhamma treatise, the Patthana or the 
      Mahapatthana; but compared with the Patthana, the Vibhanga treatment of 
      the subject is crude and vague, which is to say earlier. Considered in 
      this light, the Vibhanga seems to stand out as a common presupposition of 
      both the Dhammasangani and the Patthana. It is much easier to proceed from 
      the contents of lhe Vibhanga to the two highly systematic treatises of the 
      Dhammasangani and the Patthana then to proceed from the latter to the 
      former. The Dhatukatha being nothing but a supplement to the text of the 
      Dhammassangani may he briefly disposed of as a Abhidhamma treatise 
      dependent; on and necessarily later than the Dhammasangani.</P>
      <P>It is not only with regard to the Dhammasangani (with its supplement, 
      the Dhatukatha and the Patthana that the Vibhanga represents the immediate 
      background; it appears equally to have been the background of the Yamaka. 
      It is easy to account for the dialectical method of the study of the 
      Abhidhamma matters by keeping the Panhapucchakas appended to the different 
      chapters of the Vibhanga. All these considera tions lead us to couclude 
      that strictly speaking the Vibhanga making &quot; an extended application of 
      (the) organun or vehicle for the cultivation of the moral intellect &quot; is 
      the first and the earliest of the Abhidhamma books.</P>

      <P>Although one can conceive in this manner the chronological succession 
      of the five Abhidhamma books (leaving out the Puggalapannatti which is 
      rather a suttanta text and the Kathavatthu which forms a class by itself), 
      it is difficult to determine the actual dates of their composition. One 
      thing is certain that the seven books of the Abhidhammapitaka were 
      well-known and very carefully read especially in the Himalayan monastery 
      when the Milinda panha was composed in about the first century A. D. There 
      is no reason for doubt that the Pali canon when committed to writing 
      during the reign of king Vattagamani in Ceylon, it included all these 
      books in it. We have shown that when the Uddanagathas of the Cullavagga 
      (Chap. II) of' the Vinayapitaka were added, the three pitakas of the Pali 
      canon had already come into existence. The question, however, is how far 
      the date of the books of the Abhidhammapitaka can be pushed back. Here the 
      only anchor-sheect is the Kathavatthu, the third or the fifth Abhidamma 
      book which according to tradition, was a compilation of the Asokan age. We 
      have already adduced certain proofs in suport of this tradition and have 
      sought to show that when certain controversies which find a place in the 
      Kathavatthu took place, Buddhism as a religion had not overstepped the 
      territorial limits of the middle country. But according to Buddhaghosa's 
      commentary, the Kathavatthu contains discussion of doctrines held by some 
      of the Buddhist schools, e. g., the Hemavata, the Andhaka, the Pubbaseliya 
      and the Aparaseliya, which could not be possible if the Kathavatthu had 
      been closed in the time of Asoka. If it was a growing compilation, we have 
      necessarily to suppose that although it commenced in Asokan time, it was 
      not brought to a close till the rise of the later Buddhist schools 
      mentioned above.</P>
      <P>Turning at last to the Suttapitaka comprising the live nikaytas, we can 
      definitely say that it had reached its final shape before the composition 
      of the Milinda Panha in which authoritative passages are quoted from the 
      texts of this pitaka, in certain instances by a mention of the name of the 
      sources. Wwe can go further and maintain that the Suttapitaka was closed 
      along with the entire Pali canon and when the canon was finally rehearsed 
      in Ceylol and committed to writing during the reign of King Vattagamani. 
      The tradition says that previous to the reign of Vattagamani the texts 
      were handed down by an oral tradition (mukhapathavasena) from teacher to 
      teacher (acariyaparamparaya) the process of transmission be ing compared 
      to the carrying of earth in baskets from head to head. Buddhaghosa says 
      (Sumangalavilasini, pt. I, pp. 12 foll.) that immediately after the demise 
      of the Buddha and after the session of the first Buddhist Council, the 
      task of transmitting and preserving each of the five nikayas to an 
      individual thera and his followers, which ultimatly gave rise to some 
      schools of bhanakas or chanters. The existence of the distinct schools of 
      reciters of the five nikayas is clearly proved (as shown by Dr B. M. 
      Barua, Barhut Inscriptions, pp. 9-10), by the Milinda Panha where we have 
      mention of the Jatakabhanakas (the repeaters of the Jatakas) in addition 
      to the Dighabhanake, the Majjhimabhanaka, Samyuttabhanaka, 
      Anguttara-bhanaka and Khuddaka- bhanaks, (Milinds Paiiha, pp. 341 foll.). 
      The terms 'pancanekayika' (one well versed in the five nikayas) and 
      bhanaka as well, occur as distinctive epithets of some of the Buddhist 
      donors in the Sanci and Barhut inscriptions which may be dated in the lump 
      in the middle of the second century B. C. The inference from the evidence 
      of these inscriptions has already been drawn by Prof. Rhys Davids to the 
      effect that before the use of Pancanekayika (one well-versed in the five 
      nikayas) suttantika (a man who knows the Suttanta by heart), Suttantakini 
      (a feminine form of Suttantika) and Petaki (one who knows the pitaka by 
      heart)as distinctive epithets, the pitaka and five nikaya divisions of the 
      Pali canon must have been well-known and well-established. We say of the 
      Pali canon because substi tution of nikaya for the term 'Agama' is 
      peculiar to the Pali tradition. The term &quot; Pancanikaya &quot; occurs as we saw 
      also in the Vinaya Cullavagga(Chap. II) which we have assigned to a period 
      which immediately preceded the Asokan age. But even presuming that the 
      five nikaya divisions of the growing Buddhist canon were current in the 
      third century B. C., it does not necessarily follow from it that all the 
      books or Sutt-as or individual passages comprising the five nikayas were 
      composed at that time. All that we can make bold to say that the first 
      four nikayas were, to all intents and purposes, the complete, while the 
      Khaddakanikaya series remained still open. We have pointed out that this 
      account in the Vinaya Cullavagga clearly alludes to the Digha as the first 
      of the five nikayas as well as that the first two suttas were the 
      Brahmajala and Samannaphala while as to the number and succession of the 
      remaining suttas, we are kept completely in the dark. Strain- ing the 
      information supplied in the Vinaya Cullavagga we can proceed so far no 
      doubt, that the first volume of the Digha Nikaya was mainly in the view of 
      its compilers. </P>
      <P>Comparing the Suttas comprised in the remaining two volumes and marking 
      the differences in theme and tone, it seems that these two volumes were 
      later additions. The second volume contains two suttas, namely, the 
      Mahapadhana and MahaGovinda which have been mentioned in the Cullaniddesa 
      (p. 80) as two among the notable illustrations of the Suttanta Jatakas, 
      the Jatakas as found in the earliest forms in Pali literature. We have 
      already drawn attention to the earlier chronicles of the seven purohitas 
      in the Anguttara Nikaya where it is far from being a manipulation in a 
      Jataka form. The casting of this chronicle in a Jataka mould as we find it 
      in the Maha-Govinds Suttanta could not have taken place in the life-time 
      of the Buddha. The second volume contains also the Payasi Suttanta which, 
      as shown by the previous scholars, brings the story of Payasi to the death 
      of Payasi and his after life in a gloomy heaven. Thus suttanta contains 
      several anecdotes forming the historical basis of some of the Jataka 
      stories. </P>
      <P>In the face of all these facts, we cannot but agree with Prof. Rhys 
      David who places the date of this suttanta at least half a century after 
      the demise of the Buddha. The third volume of the Digha includes in it the 
      Atanatiya suttanta which is otherwise described as a rakkha or a saving 
      chant manipulated apparently on a certain passage in the them know 
      Mahabharata. The development of these elements such as the Jataka stories 
      and the Parittas could not have taken place when Buddhism remained in its 
      pristine pur ity. These are later accrotions or interpolations, the works 
      of fable and fiction, we mean of imaginnative poetry that crept, according 
      to a warning given in certain passages of the Anguttara Nikaya, under the 
      influence from outside. But there is no reason for surprise that such 
      developments had already taken place as early as the fourth century B.C. 
      for the passages strike the note of alarm are precisely one of those seven 
      important tracts recommended by Asoka in his Bhabru Edict under the 
      caption 'Anagatabhayani. </P>
      <P>The growth of these foreign elements must have caused some sort of 
      confusion otherwise it would not have been necessary to discuss in a sutta 
      of the Samyutta Nikaya the reasonable way of keeping genuine the 
      utterances of the Buddha distinct from others that crept in under the 
      outside influence and were characterised by poetical fancies and 
      embellishments (kavikata). (Samyutta Nikaya, pt. II, p.267). We may then 
      be justified in assigning the whole of the Digha Nikaya to a pre-Asokan 
      age, there being no trace of any historical event or development which 
      might have happened after King Asoka. The only exception that one has to 
      make is only in the case of the concluding verses of the Mahaparinibbana 
      Suttanta which were interpolated according to Buddhaghosa in Ceylon by the 
      teachers of that island. Like the first volume of the Digha Nikaya, the 
      whole of the Majjhima Nikaya strikes us as the most authoritative and 
      original among the collections of the Buddha's teachings. There is no 
      allusion to any political event to justify us in relegating the date of 
      its compilation to a time far removed from the demise of the Buddha. If it 
      be argued that the story of Makhadeva, as we find it embodied in the 
      Makhadeva sutta of this Nikaya, has already assumed the form of a Jataka, 
      of a Suttanta-Jataka, mentioned in the Cullaniddesa, it cannot follow from 
      it that the Nikaya is for that very reason a much later compilation. For 
      the Makhadeva story is one of those few earliest Jatakas presupposed by 
      the Pali</P>
      <P>Canonical collection of 500 Jatakas. The literary developments as may 
      be traced in the suttas of the Majjhima Nikaya are not of such a kind as 
      to require more than a century after the demise of the Buddha.</P>
      <P>Now concerning the Samyutta which is a collection of kindred sayings 
      and the third of the five nikayas, we may point out that it has been 
      guoted by name in the milinda panda, as also in the Petakopadesa under the 
      We can simple title of Samyuttaka and that as such this Nikaya had existed 
      as anauthoritative book of the Pali both the Milinda panha and the 
      Patakapadesa. go so far as to maintain that the Samyutta Nikaya had 
      reached its final shape previous to the occurrence of Panca nekayika as a 
      personal epithet in some of the Barhut and Sanci-inscriptions, nay, even 
      before the closing of the Vinaya Cullavagga where we meet with the 
      expression &quot; Pancanikaya&quot;. In dealing with the account of the Second 
      Buddhist. Council in the Vinaya Cullavagga (Chap. XII), we have noted that 
      a canonical authority has been alluded to as &quot;Rajayahe uposatha Samyutte&quot; 
      at Rajagaha in the Uposatha Samyutta. </P>
      <P>The translators of the Vinaya Texts (pt. 11, p. 410) observe that the 
      term 'Samyutta' &quot;must here be used for khandhaka&quot;, the passage referred to 
      being the Vinaya Mahavagga (II. 8.3. the Uposatha Khandhaka). But looking 
      into the Mahavagga passage, We find that it does not fully tally with the 
      allusion, as the passage has nothing to do with Rajagaha. In the absence 
      of rajagaha giving a ture clue to the tracing of the intended passage, it 
      is difficult to premise that the passage which the compilers of the 
      Cullavagga account kept in view was the khandhaka passaga in the Vinaya 
      Mahavagga. Although we have so far failed to trace this passage also in 
      the Samyutta Nikaya, the presumption ought to be that the intended passage 
      was included in a Samyutta collection which was then known to the 
      compilers of the Cullavagga. The Suttas in the Samyutta Nikaya do not 
      refer to any political incident justifying one to place the date of its 
      compilation far beyond the demise of the Buddha. As contrasted with the 
      Ekuttara or Anguttara Nikaya the Samyutta appears to be the result of an 
      attempt to put together relevant passages throwing light on the topics of 
      deeper doctrina1 impotance while the former appears to be numerical 
      groupings of relevant passage throwing light on the topics relating to the 
      conduct of the monks and house-holders. Considered in this light, these 
      two Nikayas must be regarded as fruits of a critical study of suttas in 
      some previous collections.</P>
      <P>Now coimg to deal with the Ekuttara or Anguttara Nikaya, we have sought 
      to show that its main bearing is on the two-fold Vinaya, the Gahapati 
      Vinaya and the Bhikkhu Vinaya. This Nikaya contains a 
      section(Mundarajavagga in the Pancaka Nipata)commemorating the name of 
      King Munda who reigned, as shown by Rhys Davids, in Rajagaha about half a 
      century after the demise of the Buddha The Nikaya made within the fifty 
      years from the Buddha's demise. There is, however, no other historical 
      reference to carry the Mahaparinibbana compilation beyond the first 
      century from the Mahaparinibhana of the Buddha. The date proposed for the 
      Anguttara Nikaya will not, we think, appear unreasonable if it be admitted 
      that the suttas of this nikaya form the real historical back-ground of the 
      contents of the Vinaya texts.</P>
      <P>We have at last to discuss the chronology of the fifteen books of the 
      Khuddaka Nikaya, which are generally mentioned in the follwiug order:--</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>(1) Khuddaka Patha, (2) Dhammapda, (3) Udana, (4) Itivuttaka, (5) 
        Sutta Nipata (6) Vimanavatthu, (7) Petavatthu, (8) Thera-therigatha, (9) 
        Jataka, (11) Niddesa. (Culla and Maha.) (12) Patisanibhidamagga, (13) 
        Apadana, (14) Buddhavamsa, and (15) Cariyapitaka.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>This mode of enumeration of the fifteen books of the khuddaka Nikaya 
      (pannarasabheda Khuddakanikaya) can be traced back to the days of 
      Buddhaghosa (Sumangalavilasini, pt.I.,p,17).It is obvious that in this 
      list the Cullaniddesa and the Mahaniddesa are counted as one book; while 
      counting them as two books, the total number becomes sixteen.There is no 
      justifica- tion for regarding the order of enumeration as being the order 
      of chronology. In connection with the Khuddaka Nikaya, Buddhaghosa 
      mentions the following facts of great historical importance. He says that 
      the Dighabhanakas classified the books of the Khuddaka Nikaya under the 
      Abhidhamma Pitaka enumerating them in the following order:--</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>(1) Jataka, (2) Mahaniddesa, (3) Cullaniddesa, (4) Patisambhidamagga, 
        (5)Suttanipata, (6) Dhammapada (7) Udana, (8) ltivuttaka, (9) 
        Vimanavatthu, (10) Petavatthu, and (11) Therigatha, and leaving out of 
        consideration the four books, namely, the Cariyapitaka, the Apadana, the 
        Buddhavamsa, and the Khuddakapatha.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Buddhaghosa informs us thak the Majjhi- mabhanaka list contained the 
      names of 15 books counting the Cariyapitaka, the Apadana and the 
      Buddhavamsa as the three books in addition to those recognised by the 
      Dighabhanakas(Sumanangalavilasini, Pt.I., p.15) It is important to note 
      that the Majjhimabhanaka list has taken no cognisance of the Khuddakapatha 
      mentioned as the first book in Buddhanaka list was drawn up, the Khuddaka 
      Nikaya comprised just 12 books and when the Majjhima Nikaya list was made 
      it came to comprise altogether 15 books, the Mahaniddesa and the 
      Cullaniddesa having been counted as two books instead of as one. It is 
      also easy to understand that from that time on ward the traditional tota1 
      of the books of the Khuddaka Nikaya became known as fifteen, and so strong 
      was this tradition that to harmonise with it, the sixteen books had to be 
      somehow counted as fifteen, the Mahaniddesa and the Cullaniddesa being 
      treated as a single book. </P>
      <P>From this we may proceed to show that the Khuddakapathe appearing as 
      the first book of the Khuddaka Nikaya in Buddhaghosa's list, is really the 
      last book taken into the Khuddaka Nikaya sometime after the 
      Majjhimabhhanaka list recognising 15 books in all had been closed. We need 
      not be surprised if the Khuddakapatha was a compilation made in Ceylon and 
      was given a place among the books of the Khuddaka Nikaya either 
      immediately before the commitment of the Pali Canon to writing duriug the 
      reign of King Vattagramani or even after that, although before the time of 
      Buddhaghosa. The commentaies of Buddhabhosa are our oldest authorities 
      that mention the Khuddakapatha as a canonical book. It does not find 
      mention in the Milinda Panha nor in any other work, canonical or 
      ex-canonical, which was extant before the time of Buddhagosa. The text is 
      made up of nine lessons or short readings all culled certain earlier 
      canonical sources, the arrangement of these lessons being such as to make 
      it serve as a very useful handbook for the beginners and for the clergy 
      ministering to the needs of the laity. </P>
      <P>The consideration of two points may suffice to bear out our contention. 
      The first point is that the first lesson called the sarana- ttaya presents 
      a doveloped mode of refuge formula of the Buddhists which is not to be 
      found precisely in this form anywhere in other portions of the Pali canon. 
      As for the second point we may note that the third lesson called the 
      Dvattimsakara (the thirty-two parts of the body)enumrrates mattake 
      matthalungam which is not to be found in the list furnished in the 
      Mahasatipatthana Suttanta of the Digha Nikaya, the Satipatthana Sutta of 
      the Majjhima Nikaya and numerous other discourses.</P>
      <P>We have seen that the Buddhavamisa, the Cariyapitaka and the Apadana 
      are the three books which found recognition in the list of the 
      Dighabhanakalist, Majjhimabhanakas and were taken no notice of in the 
      Apart from other arguments, one has to presume that these three books were 
      complied and received into the canon after the list was once known to have 
      been complete with 12 books. These three books, as far as the subject 
      matters go, are interconnected, the Buddhavamsa enumerating the doctrine 
      of pranidhana us an essential condition of the Bodhisatta life, the 
      Cariyapitaka enumerating the doctrine of cariya or practices of a 
      Bodhisatta and the Apadana the doctrine of adhikara or competence for the 
      attainment of the higher life. These three books presuppose a legend of 24 
      previous Buuddhas which is far in excess of the legend of six Buddhas 
      contained in other portions of the Canon. The Buddha- vamsa and the 
      Cariyapitaka present a systematic form of the Bodhistta idea that was 
      shaping itself through the earlier Jatakas and the Apadana furnishing the 
      previous birth stories of the theras and the theris cannot but be regarded 
      as a later supplement to the Thera-Theri-gatha.</P>
      <P>Besides the Thera-Theri gatha, the Vimanavatthu or the book of stories 
      of heaven is just another canonical work which is presupposed by the 
      Apadana. It is important to note that the Vimanavatthu contains one story, 
      namely, the story of Serissaka, the incident of which, according to the 
      story itself, took place hundred years, calculated by human computation 
      from the death of the chieftain Payasi. &quot; Manussakam Vassasatam atitam 
      Yadagge kayamhi idhuappanno &quot; (Vimanavatthu, P.T. S., p. 81).</P>
      <P>The Payasi Suttanta of the Digha Nikaya clesrly shows that the death of 
      Payasi could not have taken place until a few years after the Buddha's 
      demise. Thus going by the consideration of this point, we are compelled to 
      assign a date of its composition to an age ahead of a century and a half 
      from the demise of the Buddha. So the canonisation of this book could not 
      have taken place earlier than the time of the third Buddhist Council, we 
      mean the time of King Asoka. Our suggestion for the date of the 
      Vimanavatthu will gain in significance as we consider the contents of the 
      Petavatthu, the book of stories of hell. We have noticed aboue that in all 
      the three lists of the books of the Khuddaka Nikaya the name of the 
      Petavatthu stands after that of the Vimanavatthu. From the occurrence of 
      certain common stories, a suggestion has already been made that it was 
      somehow an offshoot of the Vimanavatthu. Now in one of the stories 
      (Petavatthu, IV. 3, p. 57)(1), we have allusions to the Moriya(Maurya) 
      king, who is identified in the commentary with king Asoka (2). If this 
      construction of the word Moriya is correct, it leaves no room for doubt 
      that the Peta Vatthu, as we mow have it, was a post-Moriyan or post-Asokan 
      compilation.</P>

      <P>The Cullaniddesa is a canonical commentary of the Khaggavisana sutta 
      and the Parayana group of sixteen poems, all of which find place in the 
      anthology called the Sutta Nipata. We have sought to show that the 
      Cullaniddesa indicates a stage of development of the Pali canon when the 
      Khaggavisana sutta hang on the Parayanavagga as an isolated poem, without 
      yet be- ing included in a distinct group such as the Uragavagga of the 
      Sutta Nipata. Though from this line of argument it follows that the 
      Cullaniddesa is earlier than the Sutta-Nipata, it cannot at the same time 
      be denied that it is posterior not only to such Suttanta-Jatakas as the 
      Mahapadaniya, Mahagovinda, Mahasudassaniya and the Maghadeva suttanta 
      contained in the Digha and Majjhima Nikayas but also to a collection of 
      500 Jatakas (Pancajatakasatiani) (Culianiddesa, p.80). As such the 
      Cullaniddesa cannot be dated much earlier than the reign of Asoka.</P>
      <P>The Mahaniddesa too is a canonical commentary on the atthaka group of 
      sixteen poems forming the fourth book of the Sutta-Nipata. As shown before 
      the exegeses attempted in this book were all modelled on an earlier 
      exegesis of Mahakaccana in the Samyutta Nikaya. If this canonical 
      commentary came into existence when the Atthakavagga was yet currrnt as an 
      isolated group, the date of its composition cannot but be anterior to that 
      of the Suttanipate. A clear idea of the date of this work can be fomed 
      from its list of places visited by the Indian seagoing merchants. The 
      Mahaniddesa list clearly points to a time when the Indian merchants 
      carried on a sea-borne trade with such distant places as Java in the east 
      and Paramayona in the west and it alludes as well as to sea route from 
      Tamali to Java via Tambapanni or cetlon which was followed in the 5th 
      century A. D. by the Chinese pilgrim, Fa-Hien. We can expect to come 
      across such a list only in the Milinda Panha which may be dated in the 1st 
      or 2nd century A. D. Such a wide expansion of India's maritime trade as 
      indicated in the Mahaniddesalist would seem impossible if the book was a 
      composition much earlier than the second century B. C. Now turning to the 
      Suttanipata we have been inclined to place it later than the two books of 
      the Niddesa on the ground that when it was compiled, the Atthakavagga and 
      the Parayanavagga came to represent two distinct books of a comprehensive 
      anthology and the Khaggavisana sutta ceased to be a stray poem hanging for 
      its existence on the Parayana group. But our main reason for dating it 
      posterior to the Cullaniddesa is that the Parayanavagga in the Suttanipata 
      is prefaced by a prologue which is absent from the Cullaniddesa scheme. 
      Similarly the Nalakasutta perhaps known originally as Moneyya sutta as 
      evidenced by the titles suggested in Asoka's Bhabru Edict as a prologue 
      clearly anticipating the poetical style of Asvaghosa's Buddhaearita. In 
      spite of the fact that the suttas embodied in it were gleaned from earlier 
      collections, the Sutta-nipate scheme of anthology does not seem to have 
      been carried into effect before the 2nd century B.C.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Jatakas as a book of the Khuddaka Nikaya, we have 
      just seen above that the Cullaniddesa points to a canonical collection of 
      500 Jatakas. That five hundred was the original total of the Jatakas is 
      proved on the one hand by the 500 Jataka representations witnessed by 
      Fa-Hien round the Abhayagiri monastery of Ceylon and on the other band by 
      the mechanical multiplication of the stories in order to raise the total 
      from 500 to 550 from the days of Buddhaghosa. The Milinda Panha alludes to 
      the existence of the repeaters of the Jatakas apart from the repeaters of 
      the five Nikayas. We are unable to decide whether the Milinda reference is 
      to the canonical books of the Jataks or to a commentary collection which 
      was then in exislence. The numerous illustrations of the jatakas on the 
      ancient Buddhist railings such as those at Barhut and Bodhagaya, 
      unmistakably presuppose the existence of the legendary story of the 
      Buddha's life past and present. But the canonical collection of 500 
      Jatakas referred to in the Cullaniddesa appear to be earlier than the 
      scriptural basis of the Buddhist sculptures</P>
      <P>and whatever the actual data of composition might be it was certainly 
      later than that of the Suttanta Jatakas scattered throughout the first 
      four Nikayas. We may say indeed that the canonical collection took a 
      definite shape near about the early Maurya period.</P>
      <P>The Thera-Theri-Gathas are two campanion anthologies of the stanzas 
      that are supposed to have been uttered by the theras and theris 
      surrounding the Buddha during the lifetime of the Master, or at least 
      shortly after his death. (Theragabha Oldenberg's preface, XI).</P>
      <P>&quot;The separate uddanas or indices which occur regularly at the end of 
      each nipata and at the end also of the whole work, and give the names and 
      numbers of the theras (and the theris) and the number of verses in each 
      chapter and in the whole work respectively seem to be based on a recension 
      or condition of the text different from that which now lies before us &quot; 
      (Ibid, p.XIV). In the opinion of Dhammapala, the commentator, the 
      Theragatha anthology had reached the final shape not earlier than the time 
      of Asoka. He points out that the Thera Tekicchakari whose gathas are 
      embodied in the Theragatha lived under King Bimbisara, the father of 
      Dhammasoka. He further adds that the verses uttered by this thera were 
      received into the canon by the fathers who assembled in the third Buddhist 
      Council. Dhammapala attributes some of the gathas to Vitasoka, the younger 
      brother of Dhammasoka and certain other verses to Tissakumara, the 
      youngest brother of King Asoka. If we can at all depend for chronology on 
      the information supplied by Dhammapala, the anthologies of 
      Thera-Theri-gatha must be taken as compilations that had received their 
      final shape at the Third Buddhist Council and not before.</P>
      <P>The Pali Dhammapada is just one and undoubtedlly the earliest of the 
      six copies of the anthologies of the Dhammapada class. The earliest 
      mention of the Pali Dhammapada by name is to be found in the Milinda Panha 
      which is a composition of the first or secnd century A.D. From the mere 
      fact that there were certaiu quotations in the Kathavatthu and Mahaniddesa 
      ofstanzas now traceable in the Dhammapada, no definite conclusion can be 
      drawn as to the actual date of its composition. The Dhammapada hardly 
      includes any stanzas that might be supposed to have been drawn upon the 
      canonical collection of Jatakas. But as shown by the editors of the 
      Prakrit Dhammapada there are a few gathas which were evidently manipulated 
      on the basis of the gathas in the Jatakas. Similary it cannot be 
      maintained that the Dhammapada contains any stanzas that were diretly 
      derived from the Suttanipata, for the suttas which singled out as the 
      source of some of the gathas of the Dhammapada are to be found also in 
      such earlier collections as the Digha or the Majjhima or the Samyutta or 
      the Anguttara. The Thera and Theri-gathas are the two anthologies of the 
      Khuddaka Nikaya which appear to have been presupposed by the Dhammapada. 
      As re gards external evidence, there is only one tradition, namely, that a 
      powerful discourse based on the Appamadavagga of the Dhammapada served to 
      attract the attention of King Asoka to Buddhism, clearly pointing to the 
      existence of the Dhammapada as a distinct anthology as early as the third 
      century B.C.</P>
      <P>Itivuttaka, the Udana and the Patisambhidamagga are the remaining three 
      books of the Khuddaka Nikaya of which the date of composition must depend 
      upon mere conjecture till accidentally we obtain any reliable date. The 
      Itivuttaka is a book of questions of genuine sayings of the Buddha, making 
      no re- ference to any canonical work or to any historical event 
      ascertaining its date, though it seems that it was the result of an 
      afterthought, of a critical study of the authentic teachings of the Buddha 
      in a certain light and for a specific purpose. The Udana is a curious 
      medley of legends and historical records, presened in a particular setting 
      with a view to emphasising some prononne ed opinions of the Buddha on 
      certain contrversial matters. The Patisambhidamagga presents a systematic 
      exposition of certain important topics of Buddhism, and as such it 
      deserves to be classed rather with the books of the Abhidhammapitaka than 
      with those of Suttanipata. It is quite possible that before the 
      development of the extant Abhidhamma pitaka, it passed as one of the 
      Abhidhamma treatises, Concering there three books the utmost that we can 
      say that they are mentioned even in the list of the Dighabhanakas, being 
      counted there as three among the twelve books of the Khuddaka Nikaya, and 
      that if the tradition about this list is at all credible, these three 
      books must have existed when the list was drawn up, say, in the second 
      century B. C.</P>
