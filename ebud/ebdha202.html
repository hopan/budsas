    face="Times New Roman">he recent upsurge of interest in Buddhism, both East and West, has
    been marked by a vigorous practical orientation and a drive to discover the peace and
    freedom to which the practice of Dhamma leads. This zeal for practice, however, has often
    been accompanied by another trait which may not be so fruitful, namely, a tendency to
    neglect or even belittle the methodical study of the Buddha's teachings. The arguments
    offered in defense of this attitude have already become familiar currency among us. It is
    said, for example, that study is concerned with words and concepts, not with realities;
    that it leads only to learning, not to wisdom; that it can change only our ideas but fails
    to touch us at the deeper levels of our lives. To clinch the case the testimony of the
    Buddha himself is enlisted, with his famous remarks that to learn much without practicing
    is like counting the cows of others or like carrying a raft on one's head instead of using
    it to cross the stream. </font><a
    href="http://cambodianbuddhist.org/english/website/index.html"></a><p><font
    face="Times New Roman">This contention, to be sure, has its aspect of truth, but also
    suffers from a one-sided emphasis which may actually thwart rather than aid our progress
    on the Buddhist path. It is certainly true that learning without practice is fruitless,
    but the other side of the issue also should be considered. Should a person gather cows if
    he knows nothing about how to take care of them? Should he try to cross a rough and
    dangerous river without knowing how to operate a raft? The Buddha himself insisted that
    his followers learn and transmit the Dhamma both in the letter and the spirit, but rather
    than appealing to traditional formulations, let us inquire ourselves into the value and
    function of Dhamma study. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The point at issue, it must be stressed, is not study as
    an academic discipline or the accumulation of a wealth of learning, but the acquisition of
    a sound and solid working knowledge of the basic Buddhist doctrines. Now to see why this
    is so essential, we must recall that the entire practice of the proper Buddhist path
    develops out of the act through which we enter the path -- the going for refuge to the
    Triple Gem. If we have taken this step honestly, with correct motivation, it implies that
    we have acknowledged our need for spiritual guidance and have entrusted ourselves to the
    Buddha as our guide and to his teaching as our vehicle of guidance. By taking refuge in
    the Dhamma we accept not merely a technique of meditation that we can use at liberty for
    our own self-appointed purposes, but a profound and comprehensive teaching on the true
    nature of the human condition, a teaching designed to awaken in us a perception of this
    truth as the means for reaching the full and final end of suffering. The liberation
    offered by the Dhamma comes, not from simply practicing meditation in the context of our
    own preconceptions and desires, but from practicing upon the groundwork of the right
    understanding and right intentions communicated to us by the Buddha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This cognitive character of the Buddhist path elevates
    doctrinal study and intellectual inquiry to a position of great importance. Though the
    knowledge that frees the mind from bondage emerges only from intuitive insight and not
    from a mass of doctrinal facts, genuine insight always develops on the basis of a
    preliminary conceptual grasp of the basic principles essential to right understanding, in
    the absence of which its growth will inevitably be obstructed. The study and systematic
    reflection through which we arrive at this preparatory right view necessarily involve
    concepts and ideas. But before we hasten to dismiss Dhamma study as being therefore only a
    worthless tangle of verbiage, let us consider that concepts and ideas are our
    indispensable tools of understanding and communication. Concepts, however, can be valid
    and invalid tools of understanding; ideas can be fruitful or useless, capable of bringing
    immense benefit or of entailing enormous harm. The object of studying the Dhamma as part
    of our spiritual quest is to learn to comprehend our experience correctly: to be able to
    distinguish the valid from the invalid, the true from the false, the wholesome from the
    unwholesome. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is only by making a thorough and careful investigation
    that we will be in a position to reject what is detrimental to our growth and to apply
    ourselves with confidence to cultivating what is truly beneficial. Without having reached
    this preliminary conceptual clarification, without having succeeded in &quot;straightening
    out our views,&quot; there can indeed be the earnest practice of Buddhist meditation
    techniques, but there will not be the practice of the meditation pertaining to the
    integral Noble Eightfold Path. And while such free-based meditation may bring its
    practitioners the mundane benefits of greater calm, awareness and equanimity, lacking the
    guidance of right view and the driving power of right motivation, it is questionable
    whether it can lead to the penetrative realization of the Dhamma, or to its final goal,
    the complete cessation of suffering. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is almost impossible to give a single word of counsel
    on the subject of study applicable to all followers of the Dhamma. Needs and interests
    vary so greatly from one person to another that each will have to strike the balance
    between study and practice that suits his or her own disposition. But without hesitation
    it can be said that all who earnestly endeavor to live by the Buddha's teaching will find
    their practice strengthened by the methodical study of his Dhamma. Such an undertaking, of
    course, will not be easy, but it is just through facing and surmounting the challenges we
    meet that our understanding will ripen and mature in the higher wisdom. </font></p>
