<HR>

<CENTER><P><I>Venerable Thich Bao Lac is the President of the United

Vietnamese Buddhist Congregations of New South Wales, Australia, and Abbot

of the Phap Bao Temple in Sydney. This is his Vesak Address delivered on

the 26th of May, 1996</I></P></CENTER>

<P>Twenty six centuries ago the Lord Buddha entered this Samsara world

with the vow the show all sentient beings the path to liberation. Nowadays

humankind has made enormous technological progress. We are now able to

explore outer space thousands of light years away from the planet earth,

whereas our spiritual life has been almost neglected. Except for certain

superficial hypotheses about our inner mind by Jungian psychologists, our

spiritual life has made no progress at all. All of us must agree that we

are in a spiritual crisis. Yet, more than two thousand years ago, not only

did the Lord Buddha have a vision of thousands of universes in the cosmos,

the Honoured One also shed light on the inner spiritual world and showed

us our sources of suffering. 

<P>In the nuclear age, there needs only a slight

misunderstanding between the super powers for our planet earth to be destroyed

in a blink of eye. The real danger, however, is not the bombs themselves

but some sick minds behind the scene who are troubled with their inner

life. To destroy the source of troubles we have to pacify our mind as the

Lord Buddha taught: See your own real mind - you can realise Buddhahood.

Only if we all have a peaceful mind, can lasting peace be achieved. The

technological progress does not bring about peace and happiness. 

<P>Greed, Anger and Hatred are the enemies that every Buddhist must subdue. In Buddhist

terminology, they are the three poisonous things that everyone must overcome.

Until they are subdued no peace in mind can be achieved. The Lord Buddha

taught: "The most glorious conquest is the conquest of yourself." After many

years of wandering and learning different doctrines, the Lord Buddha finally

found the path to liberation to cease all the suffering of the sentient

beings. And the World Honoured One's teachings are very simple: "Wisdom

and Compassion". Wisdom can help us to see the roots of our suffering and

compassion can help us live harmoniously with ourselves, with other sentient

beings and with the environment on the planet earth. 

<P>The Lord Buddha once told his disciples to recite a gatha when drinking a glass of water, because

there are 84,000 living micro-organisms in it. That gatha has the power

to make those living things have a better existence in the next life. Any

disciple who forgets to recite that gatha when drinking water would have

violated the first precept, refraining from taking life just as if they

had eaten the flesh of living things. The World Honoured One likes us to

respect these micro-organisms, just as we do to other living things like

trees, animals or human beings! 

<P>The path to liberation is one of the most

simple but the most powerful and effective in creating a loving, caring

and peaceful world. It can create a humane and just society. If every one

of us lives in mindfulness, cultivates our spiritual life and treats other

beings with mutual respect and understanding, we would have created the

Pure Land (Tinh Do) or heaven on earth. There is no need to go far way

to find the solution to our society which has been riddled with violence

and hatred; just go back to see your mind and subdue it. 

<P>With all humility we can say that the Lord Buddha deserves to be called the Greatest Teacher

of all time. I would like to quote a European writer's opinion about the

Buddha's teaching as follows: "Here is the teaching we can follow with confidence".

Where in the world of religions, cults and creeds can we find a master

of such brilliance? In a pageant of stars, he was a giant of the greatest

magnitude. Little wonder that scientists, philosophers and men of literature

have proclaimed him the 'Greatest Man Ever Born'. 

<P>The radiance of this great teacher goes through a world of suffering and darkness like a beacon

light to guide and illuminate mankind. Many brilliant brains have contributed

to the technological progress and the material civilisation is now at its

peak and we are all proud of this. But Greed urges humankind to possess

more and more. The two World Wars no doubt were originated in human greed.

Even though the cold war is over, nobody can be sure that we will enjoy

everlasting peace. While new technological advances continue, what does

the future hold for us? 

<P>We are living in a time when individualism becomes

a cult. We have created many super-human beings and put them on the pedestal:

movie stars, sports stars heroes and now, we are coming to the age of communication

super-highways. Youth nowadays has so many attractions in life yet there

are almost no ethical models to admire and no civic lessons are taught

seriously at school. We are surrounded by a culture of violence. Family

life, the fabric of any society, is gradually disintegrating. This is the

red alert that we must heed.

<P> Concerning the future of humankind, a French

intellectual, Pierre Garreau said: "In the time when the Lord Buddha was

born, ethical guidance was needed but it is more so in our time". Our world

is in a crisis and the symptoms appearing in the way of life of the young

is most is most easily recognisable. We really need the total transformation

of our spiritual outlook. As Andre Malraux realised that, ever since the

Roman Empire, there has never been a crisis as deep as the one we have

in our time. In the West this is a period of falling idols. In the 19th

century, most philosophers only believed in the &quot;ism &quot; and many

idols kept on falling or expired. The feudal world, the democratic regimes

and other forms of dictatorship all crumbled. At that time people had nowhere

to turn and they only hoped that, in the 20th century, science would bring

in a new era. The values initiated by Buddhism are still very much attractive

while many other values have quickly crumbled. Andre Malraux also commented

that the Buddhist Community was established the earliest and it still survives

in our time, while other idols eventually disintegrated. (Pierre Garreau-

Key-note Speech on the Vesak Day 2517 at the Buddhist University of Van

Hanh, Saigon)

<P>Facing the danger which may make our civilisation as we know

it disintegrate, we just can't sit there. We have to do something as in

an old saying 'something is better than nothing'. We have to come back

to our inner life, see our true mind and subdue it in any way we can. We

have to fight against our real enemies : Greed, Anger, Hatred and Craving

for all material things. To celebrate Vesak Day in a meaningful way, we

should heed carefully the Lord Buddha's message of compassion, understanding,

mutual respect. In that spirit we pray that the leaders of the super powers

will sit down and work out a way to make our world a better and a pleasant

place for us and, particularly for future generations, to live in. </P>
