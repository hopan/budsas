    <p><strong>Do Buddhists pray?</strong><br>
    Buddhist don&#146;t pray to a Creator God, but they do have
    devotional meditation practices which could be compared to
    praying. Radiating loving-kindness to all living beings is a
    practice which is believed to benefit those beings. The
    sharing of merit is a practice where one dedicates the
    goodness of one&#146;s life to the benefit of all living
    beings as well as praying for a particular person.</p>
    <p>For further discussion on the nature of Buddhist devotion
    and faith, see <strong>DEVOTION.ZIP</strong> in <a
    href="http://www.buddhanet.net/ftp03.htm">BuddhaNet&#146;s
    file library - General section</a></p>
    <p>In Tibet prayer is going on most of the time. Tibetans
    pray in a special way. They believe that when certain sounds
    and words, called mantras, are said many times they arouse
    good vibrations within the person. If a mantra is repeated
    often enough it can open up the mind to a consciousness which
    is beyond words and thoughts.</p>
    <p>In Japan millions of Buddhists pray to Amida Buddha, the
    Buddha of Infinite Light. They believe that Amida has created
    a Pure Land in the west and that those who have faith and
    repeat Amida&#146;s name in prayer will go there. Yet they
    also believe that Amida is really within them.</p>
    <p><strong>How do you become a Buddhist?</strong><br>
    In one way being a Buddhist means belonging to a particular
    community of people and following a path of life taught by
    the Buddhas (enlightened beings). Members of the Buddhist
    community are formally joined by taking refuge in the Buddha,
    the Dharma (the teaching) and the Sangha (the community of
    noble disciples).</p>
    <p><strong>Why do Buddhists chant?</strong><br>
    It reminds one of the Dharma so that it is not forgotten;
    when meditation is not possible and when bare mindfulness
    does not give much consolation, it can be used to great
    advantage as an extension of meditation into words to produce
    calm, some peace within; and certainly, it expresses
    one&#146;s strong confidence in the Dharma. Reciting the same
    chants day after day also has an advantage - the making of
    wholesome repetitive karma which of course will bear very
    good fruit.</p>
    <p><strong>What about Buddhist shrines and images?</strong><br>
    The shrine found in Buddhist homes or temples is a focal
    point of Buddhist observances. At the centre of the shrine,
    there is usually an image of the Buddha. This image may be
    made of a variety of materials such as marble, gold, wood or
    even clay. The image is a symbol that helps people to recall
    the qualities of the Buddha.</p>
    <p>The shrine may also have such objects as a volume of
    Buddhist scriptures to represent the Dharma. Some shrines may
    include other items such as images, pictures or photographs
    of Buddhist monks and masters to represent the Sangha. When a
    Buddhist stands before a shrine, the objects he sees on it
    help him to recall the qualities that are found in the
    Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. This inspires him to work towards
    cultivating these qualities in himself.</p>
    <p><strong>Why do Buddhists bow?</strong><br>
    In Buddhism, the traditional gesture of reverence to the
    Triple Gem is to place the palms of both hands together and
    raise them high in front, usually up to the level of the
    forehead. In order to express deep veneration, a Buddhist may
    bow or prostrate before the image of the Buddha, members of
    the Sangha and the masters of the Teaching. When a Buddhist
    prostrates before an image, he acknowledges the fact that the
    Buddha has attained the perfect and supreme Enlightenment.
    Such an act helps the Buddhist to overcome egoistic feelings
    and he becomes more ready to listen to the Teaching of the
    Buddha.</p>
    <p><strong>Are there Buddhist holy places?</strong><br>
    The four holy sites as places of pilgrimage for Buddhists are
    Lumbini where the Buddha was born, Bodh Gaya where the Buddha
    was enlightened under the Bodhi tree, Sarnath where the
    Buddha gave his first teaching of the Dharma and Kusinagara
    where the Buddha passed away. See &quot;In Search of the
    Buddha&quot; on <a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/">BuddhaNet</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>What about Buddhist festivals?</strong><br>
    Buddhist festivals are always joyful occasions. Every May, on
    the night of the full moon, Buddhists all over the world
    celebrate Vesak for the birth, enlightenment and death of the
    Buddha such a long time ago.</p>
    <p>In the Theravada tradition, practices observed by
    laypeople at Vesak include the observance of eight precepts
    (the regular five plus not taking food after midday and
    celibacy and not over indulging in sleep). Also the laypeople
    may participate in chanting and meditation and listening to
    sermons.</p>
    <p>In Thai villages people get ready during the day. They
    clean their houses and hang up garlands of flowers. The men
    take clean sand from the river bank and spread it over the
    temple courtyard, where everyone walks with bare feet.
    Statues of the Buddha are brought out of the temple to be
    washed and polished and all the books come out to be dusted.
    When it is dark, the villagers gather with candles or small
    oil lamps. The biggest Buddha statue is put on a platform
    outside the temple and lights shine all round it. Scented
    water is thrown onto it. Holding their lights, everyone
    starts to move round the Buddha statue so that in the end it
    is encircled with light.</p>
    <p><strong>What about Buddhist marriage ceremonies?</strong><br>
    Monks are prohibited from being marriage celebrants but they
    can &quot;bless&quot; the couple by reciting the Dharma
    (chanting) after the secular ceremony.</p>
    <p><strong>What is a Buddhist funeral like?</strong><br>
    A simple ceremony where the good deeds of the departed are
    remembered, a Loving-kindness meditation can be done and a
    sharing of merits.</p>
    <p><strong>What is a Stupa?</strong><br>
    When the person who has died is a Buddha (enlightened one) or
    an Arhant (saint) or an especially great teacher, relics are
    collected after the cremation. These may be placed in a stupa
    or pagoda (burial mound) or in a Buddha-rupa (image of the
    Buddha). Whenever the Buddhist sees a stupa in the
    countryside or a Buddha-rupa in a shrine room it is a
    reminder of the dharma (teaching) and it is honoured because
    of that.</p>
