    <p>I like to welcome you once again. Like yesterday, I'll be
    giving a talk and then after that, a discussion, then we'll
    be meditating and then ending with some chanting.</p>
    <p>The subject of today's talk as you know is &quot;<i>The
    importance of the practice of mindfulness</i>&quot;, which is
    something very very important for the practice of meditation.</p>
    <p>I am very happy to see some of you reading the little
    booklet we are bringing out today on the Satipatthana Sutta
    which really deals with the practice of mindfulness. It is
    also very nice to see some of you meditating.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Absence of Mindfulness or
    Awareness: We Become Machines</b></font></p>
    <p>Yesterday I suggested you make an effort to do some
    practice of mindfulness today, so that what I'm going to say
    will make some sense in your experience. If we do not
    practise mindfulness or awareness, what will happen to us is
    we become more and more like machines. We will be doing
    things mechanically, habitually, repetitively and
    automatically. I think in this modern world there are lots of
    technology and machines, so that I think in a way human
    beings are being more and more machine like, automatic. So by
    doing this we are forgetting the reality, the art of living.
    And what is very unfortunate is when human beings are
    becoming more and more like machines, they are also losing
    the importance of feelings. So when human beings don't feel
    the very important aspect of feelings in them, then they
    cannot feel love for oneself, they cannot feel love for
    others, they cannot feel warmth for oneself, warmth for
    others. Perhaps let me explain why there is such a lot of
    violence in the modern world. So we become more and more
    violent to ourselves and more and more violent towards
    others, all these are related in a way to the absence of
    awareness, to the absence of knowing what is in our mind and
    body. So this is the first point I want to make about the
    importance of mindfulness or awareness.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Experience the Present Moment</b></font></p>
    <p>Another very important aspect of mindfulness is that it
    helps us to experience the present moment, the <i>&quot;here&quot;</i>
    and the <i>&quot;now&quot;.</i> In a way it is funny to think
    that most of the time during the day we either live in the
    past about what has happened or we live in the future on what
    is going to happen. The past and the future are not real but
    only the present is real, so it shows that human beings,
    because of their lack of awareness, are living in an unreal
    world which does not correspond to reality. To make this
    clearer, let me give an example of what is happening now.
    Physically you can be present here, you may even see me but
    mentally you can be completely elsewhere. So to be completely
    present, to know what I'm saying, you have to be here and now
    and being present, otherwise as I said, physically you'll be
    present but mentally you'll be elsewhere. A meditation master
    described his practice as: When I eat I eat, when I walk I
    walk, when I sleep I sleep. The words sound very simple but
    it means that he was most of the time being present with what
    he was doing. An interesting question arises: what did he
    mean when he said &quot;when he sleeps he sleeps&quot;? One
    interpretation of this is that even when we are asleep, with
    the dreams that we see, we are in a way half awake. So we
    don't really experience deep sleep. However, for most of us,
    when we are awake during the day, what happens? We are half
    asleep! This is what we call &quot;<i>living</i>&quot;. So if
    you really want to start living, you have to develop this
    very very important quality of being present, of being alert,
    of being awake. That is why the Buddha is called the fully
    awakened one. The whole practice of meditation and practice
    of mindfulness is a way of awakening our mind, awakening the
    Buddha nature in us. And when we awaken the Buddha nature in
    us, the quality of living becomes so different. Now please
    realize that being in the present doesn't mean that we don't
    have to use what we consider as the past and the future.
    Sometimes we have to plan about the future. If you did not
    plan about the future, you couldn't have been present here.
    And if you forget the past, you'll not be able to go back to
    your home. So again what is important for us to realize is
    that through awareness to see for ourselves how we are using
    the past and the future. Psychologists say that sometimes
    depression and sadness are due to the way we are relating to
    the past, and anxiety in relation to the future. So here
    again with awareness, we need to understand how we use the
    past and the future consciously and deliberately, and then at
    other times being present in the here and now.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Use Awareness in Everyday Life</b></font></p>
    <p>Related to that is something which I'm going to emphasize
    very much and I consider very important. It is to use
    awareness in everyday life. Even small things like brushing
    our teeth, combing our hair, drinking, eating. As I said
    earlier, we have been so used to doing these things like
    machines. So if you can really learn to practise awareness,
    mindfulness in everyday life, then meditation becomes a way
    of life.</p>
    <p>I live in a lay meditation centre in Sri Lanka. What we
    emphasize in our centre is: how to integrate daily life, how
    to integrate your ordinary life with meditation. Otherwise
    what happens is that life is one thing, meditation is
    another. So if you are really serious about the practice, as
    I said, meditation has to be a way of living. So when you
    read the text that we are distributing today and the text
    which mentions the practice of awareness, you'll see the
    Buddha telling us to be mindful of most of the things that
    happen to us during the day. You'll be surprised to read that
    the Buddha says even when we are in the toilet, be mindful,
    be aware, be conscious of what is happening in the toilet. I
    call this <i>the toilet meditation</i>. Sometimes when I
    visit some rich homes and when I go to their toilets I see
    lots of books, magazines and things like that in the toilet,
    so I would suggest that next time when you are in your
    toilet, you'll see such a difference if you can just be
    conscious, just be present while you are in the toilet.</p>
    <p>Another very important aspect is eating. We do such a lot
    for the purpose of eating but do we really eat consciously?
    Is your awareness present while you are eating? Are you
    conscious of what you are tasting? Are you conscious of what
    you are chewing? Now chewing is a very very important aspect.
    If you can make an effort to consciously chew our food,
    you'll realize a difference when you are eating. So when you
    consider this, you'll realize that <i>meditation is related
    to ordinary things, not extraordinary things, not special
    things.</i> Some have the wrong idea that meditation is
    having some special experience, some extraordinary
    experience. But when you consider some of the meditation
    techniques, they are ordinary things, simple things like
    being aware of the breath, being conscious of walking, being
    aware of eating. <i>So meditation is simple, practical,
    ordinary things in life which we do consciously and then
    these ordinary things become extraordinary.</i> If you can
    learn to do these ordinary things, then you'll realize that
    even for ordinary things you can do as if for the first time.
    Then you see others. Can you see them as if you are seeing
    for the first time? Can you relate to yourself as if you are
    relating to yourself as if for the first time without our
    past images, without our past judgments about ourselves and
    others? Can you see a tree or flowers or Buddha image as if
    for the first time? Please try that and you'll see that the
    quality of seeing is so different, it becomes so alive, it
    becomes so fresh, it becomes so innocent.</p>
    <p>There is a very important book. It is called &quot;The
    Dhammapada&quot;. And in &quot;The Dhammapada&quot; it is
    said that if you are not aware, if you are not mindful, if
    you are not awake, you are like people who are dead. So being
    like a dead person and being like a machine are the same.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Explore &amp; Investigate
    Unpleasant Experience</b></font></p>
    <p>Another very important aspect of awareness is learning to
    explore, investigate with awareness our unpleasant
    experience. There is a beautiful simile which I like in one
    of the Buddhist texts. It compares the doctor who is a
    surgeon and is trying to operate. So the doctor has to find
    out where he has to operate, where the wound is. So to find
    out, he has to use an instrument. So once with this
    instrument he finds out what the problem is, then with the
    surgeon's knife, he cuts it off, he heals it, he cures it. So
    what the simile is saying is that with awareness we can find
    out, we can explore, we can investigate, we can discover and
    with wisdom, we can work with the problem that we discovered.
    So in everyday life, we have problems like anger, anxiety,
    fears, sadness, guilt, so all these things really create
    suffering for us. Like the surgeon's instrument, we can find
    out, we can learn, we can discover, we can explore, we can
    experiment with them. And then when you explore you'll
    realize that you are creating the problem, and then when you
    see that, you can use wisdom to free yourself from that. You
    can use wisdom to understand what is happening in our mind
    and body. So through this understanding, we can bring about a
    change or even working with them, investigating them,
    exploring them. That unpleasant experience itself becomes an
    object of meditation. So please realize that meditation is
    not always having pleasant, positive experiences. Actually
    unpleasant experiences do not create any problems for us
    unless we of course identify ourselves with them. But the
    real challenge we have is also learning how to work with
    these unpleasant experiences, how to work with physical pain,
    how to work with mental pain. This is much more important
    than just experiencing pleasant positive experiences. I'll be
    giving a separate talk on emotions so when I speak on
    emotions I might try to relate, speaking about emotions in
    this culture. What are the emotions that bother you? What are
    the emotions that create suffering for you? So I'll be
    presenting tools, presenting ways and means of working with
    these tools using meditation. I'm afraid I have to stop now.
    So I've touched on some important aspects of mindfulness and
    awareness. Like yesterday, I would like to hear questions,
    specially practical questions relating to your life.</p>
    <hr align="left" width="25%">
    <p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Q&amp;A</b></font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">When we notice emotion arising, like anger,
    who exactly is observing this anger?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>This is the
    beautiful thing, quality of awareness. So with this quality
    of awareness, we can know: Ah, now I am angry and now I have
    fear and now there is no fear. So this was the point I was
    trying to make. If you do not have awareness, you don't know
    what is happening in your mind and then by this knowing, we
    can understand and then develop wisdom and then develop
    mastery over what is happening in our mind.</p>
    <p>The question you want to know is who is observing the
    anger. This itself is a very important area to inquire. Thing
    like this can be a very powerful technique. When we are
    angry, when we have fear, when we have doubts, ask the
    question: who is experiencing this? And when you really
    inquire into it deeply, you'll realize that there is no
    &quot;who&quot; apart from what you are experiencing. Then
    you'll realize that these states of mind arise and pass away
    due to certain conditions, but we have a sense of ownership
    and say: this is <i>my</i> anger, <i>my</i> fear, <i>my</i>
    joy, <i>my</i> sadness. So this question on &quot;who&quot;
    helps us to realize that there is no owner but just
    conditions arising and conditions passing away. This is the
    deepest aspect of the Buddha's teaching.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">When we see our own children doing something
    wrong we will get angry, but if we see other people's
    children doing something wrong, we won't get angry and the
    same applies to our wife or spouse. So is it correct to say
    that we should get angry with everything we see or what
    attitude should we take to handle the situation?</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Very good
    question. Because you realize that you are angry only when
    your child behaves in a particular way, or only when your
    wife behaves in a particular way, but others' children can
    behave in any way. You have a very important realization. And
    the important realization is as I said earlier, people with
    whom we identify ourselves with, people whom we think we own,
    they should behave in one way, other people can behave in any
    other ways. So we can even carry the point further. When your
    son becomes sick you become sad. When the neighbour's son
    becomes sick, no problem. When your mother dies, sadness.
    When your friend's mother dies, no problem. Aren't we funny ?
    So when you inquire into this: why am I doing this? Then
    you'll realize that we have this sense of <i>ownership</i>.
    This is <i>mine</i>. It belongs to <i>me. </i>And for what
    belong to me, only things expected by us should happen to
    them, for others, there is no problem. So the real practice
    again, the real deep practice is: can we see everything as
    far as possible without the sense of ownership? Can we relate
    to suffering in whatever form it arises? It can be with your
    son, it can be with the neighbour's son, it can be with
    anyone. This is real loving kindness. I'll be speaking on
    loving kindness and on that day, we'll be distributing a very
    important book on loving kindness and in that book it is said
    that the best way, the most noble way is like a mother having
    affection to her only child. If we can relate to every one in
    this way, isn't that a beautiful way to live? There is a
    beautiful phrase in this connection: boundless compassion,
    compassion which has no boundary, which has no division. So
    slowly, gently, gradually, this is what we have to develop,
    developing the qualities of the heart. I'll be speaking more
    about this when we are talking about loving kindness which is
    something I emphasize very much. As I said earlier, human
    beings now are losing these qualities of the heart. So it is
    very important for us to at least to know this and make an
    effort to open our hearts to ourselves, to open our hearts to
    others.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">During my meditation sometimes I get a little
    confused. It seems that I'm watching my thoughts or my own
    mind and be aware of what I'm thinking. Now can you tell us
    is this the right direction: to watch with our mind, what our
    mind is working on?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>As I said
    earlier, you can say it is mindfulness or awareness that
    helps us or you can say it is the mind watching the mind but
    what is important is not the way to understand but the
    practical watching, the practical observing, the practical
    mindfulness that is more important than the theoretical
    question : is it the mind watching or is it the awareness
    watching? But what is important is to develop this quality of
    alertness, of vigilance, of being awake, of knowing what is
    happening, this is what is important. So after the
    discussion, we'll be trying to practise this.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">You said earlier that we do things
    mechanically. I can observe that I am a machine but I don't
    want to be a machine. For example, breakfast. I have the same
    breakfast every day and I know I'm like a machine. How can we
    not behave like a machine although we observe the fact that
    we are acting like a machine?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>I'm happy my
    friend Peter has asked that question. A very very important
    practical question: how to start the day with breakfast? So
    I'll give some practical suggestions: how to relate to such a
    situation without being like a machine. I know with breakfast
    you have very little time. But even with little time, please
    try tomorrow when you eat breakfast how far you can practise
    these things:</p>
    <p>When you see the food on the table, it can be fruits, it
    can be bread, it can be anything. Spend a few minutes just
    trying to see it as if for the first time. Look at the fruits
    and the bread very closely and see the different aspects of
    what you see at that time. </p>
    <p>Another very beautiful practice in traditional Buddhist
    countries is before we eat, to feel grateful for those who
    have prepared the meal or at least to feel grateful that I'm
    able to eat my breakfast. There are people in this world who
    do not have breakfast early in the morning. So to feel
    grateful. As you know, machines cannot feel grateful.</p>
    <p>The third suggestion is, as I said earlier, please feel
    the difference, make an effort tomorrow when you eat your
    breakfast, take your time and try to consciously chew your
    food, eating very slowly and consciously. There is a saying
    among the Red Indian Americans that they drink their food
    which means that they chew their food until it becomes
    liquid. And you'll realize that when you chew your food
    slowly and consciously, you don't require much food, this is
    a very important discovery you might make.</p>
    <p>Another very important point the Buddha had told
    meditators about eating is to avoid two extremes. Do you know
    what the two extremes are? One extreme is eating too much and
    the other extreme is eating too little. So how to know you
    are eating the right quantity? Very interesting question. How
    do we know it? By listening to the body while eating. If you
    are listening to music while you are eating, you'll not be
    able to listen to your stomach. I like this phrase very much:
    listening to your body, listening to yourself, listening to
    your thoughts, listening to your emotions. So if you can eat
    your breakfast in this way, it's a wonderful beginning of the
    day and then during the day you can have this kind of
    awareness as far as possible, not the whole time, not to have
    moment to moment of awareness. But if you can have moment to
    moment awareness, it is excellent. Then during the day, as I
    have said, you'll be living not as machines but as human
    beings.</p>
    <p>One last suggestion is at the end of the day, it is a very
    good practice to take your mind backwards and find out how
    you spent the day. Find out the moments when you are
    conscious, when you are aware and the moments when you were
    like a machine. And just find out how many times you got
    angry and also find out the times when you are not angry,
    this is very important. So when you do this kind of
    reviewing, sometimes you'll be surprised what a good person
    you have been. And this kind of reflection, this kind of
    reviewing can bring about a self transformation in a very
    natural way because you learn to see more and more inwards
    rather than outwards.</p>
    <p>So now we have to stop our discussion. Now what I would
    like to suggest is to take a small break and during this
    break you can go to the toilet, you can do some walking but
    as we did yesterday and as we were discussing mindfulness,
    please find out in this break how far you can be conscious,
    how far you can be mindful of what is happening in your mind
    and body. To do this exercise you have to be completely
    silent. So with a silent mind, please make an effort to get
    an idea of what mindfulness is and then when you come back, I
    will try to give a guided meditation in the practice of
    mindfulness, so this would be a kind of preparation for the
    meditation. Thank you very much. I will ring the bell in a
    few minutes, then please come back. Continue to have this
    awareness, mindfulness.</p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#800000">[Break]</font></p>
    <p>To begin with, we try to feel happy. Feeling happy that
    you came here at 7:30 to listen to a talk and now that you
    are practising meditation. So let us spend some time now just
    feeling happy with ourselves, that we get this opportunity to
    learn to meditate.</p>
    <p>Feeling happy that you are trying to develop this quality
    of mindfulness, awareness, of being awake.</p>
    <p>Try to feel that happiness in the area of your heart. Let
    us now feel grateful that we have got this opportunity to
    meditate.</p>
    <p>Feeling grateful is a very important spiritual quality
    that you may develop.</p>
    <p>Can we feel grateful that we can sit completely still? And
    can you become conscious, aware that your body is sitting
    completely still, completely relaxed?</p>
    <p>Let us now experiencing what it is to be in the present.
    So can you be with the peace and stillness in this room? Can
    you feel it now? Not thinking about the past, not thinking
    about the future but feeling the peace in this room now.</p>
    <p>The past is gone, we cannot change the past. The future
    has yet to come. So let us experience the joy of the present
    moment.</p>
    <p>So if thoughts about the past and thoughts about the
    future would arise in your mind, gently let go of them and
    come back to the present moment, the here and the now.</p>
    <p>So with awareness, you are learning to let go of your
    thoughts, you are learning to control your thoughts, you are
    learning to develop mastery over your thoughts, by learning
    to let go of them and then come back to the present moment.</p>
    <p>Just feeling, just knowing the stillness, the peace in
    this room.</p>
    <p>Maybe you don't even hear any sound. </p>
    <p>Now please open your eyes consciously and mindfully. And
    you change your posture, please do it slowly, consciously,
    mindfully. Please do not think that the meditation is over.</p>
    <p>Let us now do some chanting. The chanting can be also a
    meditation. Using the chant to experience the present moment
    and also there will be some pauses between the chants, just
    feel the stillness, the space that the chanting creates in
    your mind.</p>
    <p>So firstly there'll be Pali chant and then there'll be
    Chinese chant.</p>
