    What We Can Try to Do During the Retreat</font></h2>
    <hr width="25%">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin:</b></font></p>
    <p>We should be really happy to have this opportunity to
    spend some days here with a group of spiritual friends in
    this very beautiful place. We should also learn to feel
    grateful that we have this opportunity to do this. So I like
    to offer some suggestions of what we can try to do during the
    next few days.</p>
    <p>So what we will be trying to do is to learn to develop
    certain spiritual qualities, learn to develop certain skills
    which will help us in the spiritual path.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Experiment in Lighthearted Way</b></font></p>
    <p>We will try to experiment with it in a very lighthearted
    way. This is one of the guidelines that I like to emphasize.
    It is learning to see the practice as something we can enjoy.
    That we can learn to develop a taste for it. While I say
    this, I like to also emphasize that we should also learn to
    open ourselves to any unpleasant experiences, physical pain,
    mental pain. Normally we don't like unpleasant experiences.
    We don't like to look at the dark side in us. So I like to
    suggest that during the next few days, we should make an
    effort naturally, that if they are arising, just allow them
    to arise as well, without repressing them, without trying to
    put them away, without trying to deny them, without feeling
    bad about them. If they arise, let them arise and learning to
    make friends with them, learning to see them as learning
    opportunities.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Awareness</b></font></p>
    <p>Another quality is the practice of awareness, being alert,
    being awake. Now in this connection I like to emphasize that
    what we might try to do, to see how far we can have the
    continuity of awareness as far as possible, moment to moment
    awareness as far as possible, whether you are in this room or
    whether you are outside should not make a difference. Then we
    learn to see meditation as a part of life. It's a way of
    living. It's an art of living.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Loving Kindness</b></font></p>
    <p>Another spiritual quality that we need to develop is
    loving kindness. Here, we are in a beautiful situation where
    we are with a group of spiritual friends, so how can we
    relate to each other, how can we develop sensitivity to each
    other? The Buddha said helping others is helping yourself,
    helping yourself is helping others. So it is beautiful to
    develop this quality, while trying to help yourself you are
    helping others and then eventually, learn to see no
    difference between ourselves and others. Now I like to go
    over the schedule and I will emphasize some other skills,
    some other qualities that we can develop.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Wake Up</b></font></p>
    <p>So as you know we wake up at 4:45 in the morning. So when
    you wake up, actually your practice should begin. At home,
    when we wake up, it's a different situation from when you are
    waking up here. To give a practical example, when you go to
    the toilet, there will be someone in the toilet. Now how do
    you relate to that situation? So you can observe your mind
    and see whether you are having suffering or can you see the
    situation and not suffer as a result of the situation? So in
    relation to such a situation, we learn to develop another
    very important quality of patience, learning to wait. And
    maybe there'll be other situations, other challenges you
    might have to face when you wake up. So this is what I want
    to emphasize, to see these challenges, to see these
    situations as learning experiences. So meditation should
    begin.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Group Meditation &amp; Breakfast</b></font></p>
    <p>Then we will be meeting here at 5:00 a.m. for group
    meditation and it will be a beautiful time of the morning to
    practise meditation. And then we will have breakfast. Here
    again eating can be a very very important meditation. We have
    a very good opportunity to develop awareness whilst eating.
    And with awareness we can observe our likes, our dislikes,
    judgments we make. And while eating I like to emphasize three
    aspects: chewing, swallowing, tasting. I like you to find out
    at what point we really taste our food. And also let us learn
    to keep the quantity of food, trying to avoid eating too much
    and trying to avoid too little, learning to discover the
    middle way in relation to eating.</p>
    <p>Another quality we can develop tomorrow in breakfast is
    that as we are eating food, we can develop loving kindness
    while we are eating. Not thinking of only ourselves but
    seeing how others are eating, in what way can you help
    others, to be open to the needs of others. We will try to
    develop that quality also while we are eating as a group.
    Isn't that beautiful?</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Working Meditation</b></font></p>
    <p>After breakfast, we will be having what is called working
    meditation. Now working meditation is learning when we do
    work, we do it mindfully, to work consciously, to have your
    complete and full attention on what you are doing. And what
    is important is learning to see work as not something
    different to meditation.</p>
    <p>Another very important aspect of working meditation is
    learning to develop certain qualities while we are working.
    Can you see working meditation as developing compassion in
    action, loving kindness in action? If you are working in the
    kitchen, can you see there's some work that helps me to
    develop loving kindness to those meditators who are eating?
    So let me cook with loving kindness, that can be a quality
    that we can develop in working meditation. If you are
    sweeping the place, feel that I'm sweeping the place so it
    can look very clean and look very beautiful so that
    meditators can feel comfortable. So please learn to see
    working meditation as action in compassion, implementing
    loving kindness with the action.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Group Meditation</b></font></p>
    <p>Then we have group meditation. So during group meditation,
    we will be practising three postures: sitting, standing and
    walking. And let us see how far we can have continuity of
    awareness from one posture to the other.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Individual &amp; Outdoor
    Meditation</b></font></p>
    <p>Then we have what is called individual and outdoor
    meditation. So one aspect of individual and outdoor
    meditation is learning to spend some time alone with
    ourselves. So you have some very beautiful places here so
    please find one such place where you can be completely alone
    with yourself. And see when you are alone with yourself how
    you are relating to yourself. See whether after some time you
    might feel lonely, you feel bored with yourself. It is very
    interesting that we cannot spend some time alone with
    ourselves without suffering from loneliness and boredom. We
    don't seem to like ourselves! It shows that some of the
    things we do is an escape from ourselves. So tomorrow let us
    learn not to escape from ourselves but to be with ourselves,
    and if we feel lonely, bored, without giving in to them, we
    learn to go through them. And going through them, we will
    start to make a connection with ourselves where we learn to
    be our best friend, we learn to be self-contained within
    ourselves.</p>
    <p>Another aspect is learning to develop sensitivity to
    nature. I was very happy when I came here, I saw the moon. I
    was able to see the stars in the sky. I was able to hear the
    insects around us. I was able to see some beautiful trees,
    some beautiful flowers. All these make me very very happy. I
    think in this modern world, we have lost this sensitivity to
    nature, we have lost the way to commune with nature. So I
    would suggest that you develop this very very important
    quality, to develop a sensitivity to nature and learning to
    see actually no difference between yourself and nature,
    learning as I said, to be a part of nature, seeing things
    very clearly, very sharply, hearing things sharply and
    clearly. As we go along, I will be suggesting other things we
    can do during individual and outdoor meditation.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Lunch, Rest &amp; Interview</b></font></p>
    <p>Then after that we will have lunch. And after lunch there
    will be a time for a rest. As you will be waking up very
    early, we need to rest and we should learn to feel friendly
    to our body. And after rest, we have another session of
    individual and outdoor meditation. And during these two
    times, individual and outdoor meditation in the morning and
    in the afternoon, I would like to meet each one of you. So
    we'll be having a piece of paper somewhere so you can write
    your name. I like to meet about four persons in the morning
    and four persons in the afternoon. So please come and see me
    and you can discuss with me any difficulties, any problems
    you have in meditation and if you have any personal problems,
    I would also like to hear and then try to use meditation to
    help you with the problems and difficulties.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Yoga</b></font></p>
    <p>After that, there's yoga. Actually you see a connection
    between yoga and meditation. One thing is with yoga
    exercises, we learn to be aware of the body. It is very very
    important to make a connection with our body, again learning
    to be friendly to our body, learning to be kind to our body.
    Another important aspect of yoga is learning to relax. When
    you can learn to relax, it will help you very much in
    meditation, relaxing the mind, relaxing the body. It is
    possible that maybe due to a sitting posture or due to other
    reasons, we might have tension, pain and discomfort in your
    body and some of the yoga exercises will help you to work
    through them and you are fortunate to have a very good yoga
    teacher to help us here.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Snack and Activities at Night</b></font></p>
    <p>And after yoga, there is group meditation. And after group
    meditation, there is a snack. So again I like the word snack
    without calling it dinner. But normally I think you are used
    to dinners, so tomorrow when you have to eat a snack, it will
    be a very interesting learning experience.</p>
    <p>After the snack, we will have a short sitting. After
    sitting we will have a discussion. After discussion, we will
    do some chanting and end the day with loving kindness
    meditation.</p>
    <p>So by 9:00 p.m. we will go to sleep, as we have to get up
    early.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Practice of Silence</b></font></p>
    <p>Another important thing that we will be practising is the
    practice of silence. In the Dhamma it is called the noble
    silence. So we are developing a very noble quality of being
    silent. Talking, speaking is a very very strong habit that we
    have. And you'll also see a connection between silence and
    awareness. And silence enables us to be with ourselves, be
    with our mind and body all the time or most of the time. Now
    a question arises: How can we be silent and still practise
    loving kindness? Here, I like to suggest that we can still
    relate to other people, connect with other people in silence
    with loving kindness. Normally, we know only to communicate
    with words. So during this retreat we learn how to
    communicate with others in silence. One way of doing this is
    to learn to feel the people around you. Another way is to
    smile with the people around you. So these are making
    connection with other people. And then when you look around,
    when you look at people, you might see opportunities where
    you can give a helping hand in complete silence. So I would
    like you to develop this quality of communicating with others
    without words, in silence and see whether one can make a
    deeper connection non-verbally.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Practice with the Door</b></font></p>
    <p>Now another point I like to make is that there are very
    interesting doors here. So one has to have lots of awareness
    to open the doors and to close the doors otherwise you can
    make a big noise. So this will help us to develop awareness
    and learn to develop sensitivity to other people. In a way
    this is also making a connection with other people. Let me
    open very slowly and close slowly so others will not be
    disturbed by what I am doing. You see from this small act of
    opening the door and closing the door what spiritual
    qualities that we can develop. In the little booklet that has
    been translated on loving kindness, there is a very very
    interesting reference there. The Buddha was addressing a
    group of monks and the Buddha was telling the monks that if
    you can practise loving kindness during the time it takes to
    snap your fingers, you're worthy of being monks. So to snap
    your fingers takes only a few seconds. So it shows even for a
    few seconds, you can really have feeling, have loving
    kindness. You can make such a difference when you're doing
    these few acts of loving kindness, small acts with lots of
    loving kindness.</p>
    <p>So I like to pause and if you have any questions, any
    clarifications to make, you have the opportunity to do so.</p>
