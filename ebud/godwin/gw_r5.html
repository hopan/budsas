    <p>I will touch on some aspects where we can work with our
    thoughts in the context of meditation.</p>
    <p>One thing we can discover is that our thoughts arise
    mechanically. They just pop up. Take what is happening now.
    You are listening to me but you are in your thoughts that are
    going through your mind. You don't want these thoughts to
    arise but they just pop up and then we do something very
    interesting, some thoughts we allow them to arise and pass
    away, while others, we get hold of them, we identify
    ourselves with them. They can overwhelm us, they can control
    us. So this is one of the things that we can know with
    awareness, so that when thoughts arise, without getting hold
    of them, if you can just allow them to go away, then there is
    no problem. So this is one aspect for us to learn and
    discover.</p>
    <p>Another is the connection, relationship, between thoughts
    and our state of mind. So as I said, when we get hold of our
    thoughts, when we identify ourselves with the thoughts, then
    our state of mind changes. That is why I have been suggesting
    for us to learn that when thoughts come, just learning not to
    react to them.</p>
    <p>Another interesting area which we have been working with
    is the connection between thoughts and emotions. What comes
    first, thoughts or emotions?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000">(Everyone answered: Thoughts)</font></p>
    <p>I hope that you really discovered it, that you really
    learnt it.</p>
    <p>So in other words, if you learn to handle thoughts, work
    with thoughts, we develop mastery over emotions. Another
    thing is when we have an emotion, it is only thoughts that
    make it bigger. It can really blow up the emotion you are
    having.</p>
    <p>Another interesting aspect is how we create stories out of
    our thoughts and we don't realize that we create the stories
    but we become victims of the stories that we create
    ourselves. Sometimes the stories can even become films,
    movies in our own mind, from what has happened in the past
    and what is going to happen in the future, we can be creating
    sometimes very destructive films, movies and we are the
    director, we are the producer, we are the actor and we are
    the victims, all in that. I will give an example of what the
    stories and how the story can very soon become a kind of
    reality at that moment.</p>
    <p>This is a story from the Buddhist literature. So there was
    a young monk who wanted to give up his robes. He hasn't told
    his chief monk about his plans but one day the chief monk was
    having a headache, so he told this young monk to give him a
    massage, to rub some oil on his head. So while massaging his
    head, he was thinking: Now, maybe in a month or two I will be
    giving up my robes. And after I give up my robes, maybe I
    will find a job and when I find a job, I will get some money
    and when I find enough money, maybe I will find a girl and
    get married to this girl and sometimes these wives can be
    very very impossible people and if my wife becomes difficult
    or impossible, I'll give her a good beating. And he beat this
    old monk on his head. </p>
    <p>We are laughing but this is what we also do with our
    thoughts. So it shows that these thoughts can be so creative
    that they can create fantasies for us and we take the fantasy
    as real. And there is a connection, relationship, between the
    stories and emotions. In the Dhamma, there is a very
    interesting Pali word to describe this process which takes
    place in our mind. And what it means is constructing,
    manufacturing, concocting, projecting, all these things we do
    with our thoughts, and it is said there is a direct
    relationship between concepts and suffering. This is how our
    suffering is created. So this is why it is very very
    important to learn to work with thoughts, to understand the
    thoughts, to understand really the nature and construction of
    thoughts so that as I said earlier, if we can learn to have a
    very spacious mind, allowing these thoughts to come to go,
    emotions to come and go, sensations to arise and pass away,
    and we are in that spaciousness, not reacting to it and at
    that moment, it is freedom. In the Tibetan tradition, they
    use a very very nice simile. It has compared the mind to a
    spacious sky and the thoughts to clouds. So the clouds do not
    affect the sky, the sky does not affect the clouds. So this
    shows that it is important to have that spaciousness,
    spacious mind, allowing anything to arise and pass away.</p>
    <p>Another aspect of thought is that we have a very strong
    conditioning to identify ourselves with them and say:
    &#145;These are <i>my</i> thoughts. <i>I</i> am
    thinking.&#146; Again, without realizing it is the thoughts
    that have created the thinker. This is why I have been
    suggesting on a few occasions, just to see thoughts as
    thoughts without a owner, without the idea that these are <i>my</i>
    thoughts but just thoughts arising and passing away.</p>
    <p>So it is funny how we have this idea of ownership. We
    start owning everything, thoughts, emotions, sensations,
    persons, possessions. So when we start owning things, we
    don't like to let go of the things we own. This is why we
    find it difficult to let go of emotions because we think this
    is <i>my</i> anger, <i>my</i> fear, <i>my</i> anxiety, <i>my </i>sadness,
    so whatever we consider <i>mine</i>, we don't want to let go.
    This is the deeper aspect of the Dhamma, to indicate to us,
    actually there is no owner. There are just thoughts, there
    are just sensations, there are just emotions. It is this
    sense of ownership which is in a way creating our suffering.
    Nothing should happen to my mother, anything can happen to
    other mothers. Nothing should happen to my body but other
    bodies, there's no problem whatsoever. And then in the same
    way, we have this identification with possessions: My cup. It
    should be with me but other cups, there is no problem. We
    even draw the distinction about cats. This is my cat. This is
    the neighbour's cat. So the neighbour's cat should not come
    and attack my cat. How can the neighbour's cat do that? So it
    is an interesting question to reflect: What happens at the
    time of death about all the things we think we own? If you
    really own them, we should be able to take them with us even
    after death.</p>
    <p>So these are really very very deep profound aspects of the
    Buddha's teaching. To see the connection with our sense of
    ownership, with the sense of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;me&quot;
    and how that is creating the suffering. So these are some
    areas, some aspects that we can find out for ourselves in the
    practice of meditation in everyday life. So in everyday life,
    it is very important to use awareness, just to know what
    thoughts are going through your mind and how it is affecting
    us, how it is related to emotions. So if you can really
    constantly practise this, be aware of this, then very slowly
    there can be a shift from what is happening to you.</p>
    <p>We are saying we have certain worries, we have certain
    problems, what happens to that worry, what happens to that
    problem when your thoughts are with something else? The
    problem may not be solved but still at that moment, it is not
    a source of suffering. If someone close to you is sick, then
    whenever we think about that person, that is creating the
    suffering, that is creating the worry but when our thoughts
    are with something else, that person would be still having
    that illness but it is not a source of suffering. So it shows
    how thinking, thoughts, are really directly related to our
    suffering.</p>
    <p>So I presented certain aspects, areas, where we use
    thoughts destructively. Yesterday, we discussed about images
    that arise in relationships and images are created again by
    our concepts and our thoughts, but thoughts can also have a
    use, one can also use them creatively. How can we use them
    creatively? It is by using thought to reflect, to
    contemplate, to analyse. So this is a very very important
    exercise, very important meditation for us to develop. Using
    thoughts to reflect. This question of reflection, we should
    constantly reflect on our behaviour: How am I behaving? Is my
    behaviour creating suffering for oneself, creating suffering
    for other? Especially it is very important for us to see for
    ourselves how we create our own suffering. So it is only when
    we see very clearly how we create our own suffering, then you
    realize only we can bring about the change, then we take
    responsibility for our suffering and then we can change that
    situation. This brings up the four noble truths the Buddha
    discovered.</p>
    <p>The first noble truth is the fact of suffering. How is
    suffering considered a noble truth? What is noble in
    suffering ? What is your response?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 1: </b>Because if we do
    not understand suffering, we would not practise.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Godwin:</b></font><font
    color="#7F0000"><b> </b></font>You can say that. It is noble
    because when we suffer, then as I said, we can reflect on
    what is causing the suffering. So when you suffer, don't see
    it as something negative, see it as a noble truth. But what
    is more important is the second noble truth. It is from that
    to find out: Now what is causing the suffering? Who is
    causing the suffering? Now this is a very very difficult
    teaching for you to realize that you are creating the
    suffering, because it is very easy sometimes for us to hold
    others as responsible for our suffering, then you don't have
    to do anything about your suffering, others have to do
    something about it. So if you can see the second noble truth
    very clearly, the third and the fourth just follow from that.</p>
    <p>Sometimes I define meditation as discovering the medicine
    for the sickness we have created ourselves. So during the
    last few days, we have been discovering the medicine and I am
    very happy looking at the faces, the medicine seems to be
    helping, working. Now what is important is to continue to
    take the medicine in everyday life. This is what we will be
    doing tomorrow, being the last day. So tomorrow I would like
    you to go over the medicine that we have been taking, the
    different techniques we have been practising, reflect on the
    different discussions we have been having. So before you
    leave, you must be very very clear whether you are clear
    about the medicine that you have to take. So tomorrow we will
    have a discussion on how to integrate meditation in daily
    life. So reflect on all the problems, all the difficulties
    you may encounter, or you are encountering in everyday life
    and then we will discuss how one can find the solution from
    the Buddha's teaching.</p>
    <p>Now any questions about what I have been saying. Please
    ask questions, don't think whether it is a good question, bad
    question, silly question, profound question, just ask.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 2: </b>Talking about
    meditation, I want to know whether we meditators should act
    like a stone? It seems that all the meditators behave like a
    stone. To me, the feeling is like many stones. Because this
    morning when I was doing the standing meditation and I just
    stood by the window and saw the nature, it was so beautiful,
    the wind moving and they danced, and I thought: Can we do
    dancing meditation and it was so peaceful? So I want to know.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Was I behaving
    also like a stone?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 2: </b>Frankly, yes, but
    luckily you do laugh sometimes and you laugh very genuine and
    you laugh very brilliant so I don't think you are really like
    a stone most of the time.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>Godwin: </b></font>I have been
    emphasizing the practice of loving kindness and the practice
    of loving kindness is completely opposite to being like a
    stone. It is really developing friendliness, feelings, this
    is why I always emphasise when I say: Can you feel that you
    are your best friend? Can you really feel for other people
    around you? So stones cannot feel I'm afraid. You described
    nature. You have been emphasizing very much to make a
    connection with nature. And I am happy to say that there is a
    beautiful atmosphere of people helping each other, being
    friendly with each other, so I don't get the impression that
    they are, specially people working in the kitchen, behaving
    like stones. I think what you are confusing is detachment and
    having no feelings. So here, the whole emphasis on feeling. I
    have been emphasizing the experience of joy, lightness,
    friendliness, and then I think Jack has been emphasizing the
    importance of feeling the body. Perhaps he will tell you that
    some of you maybe relating to your body as stones and only
    with yoga. So that it is confusing, non-reacting mind,
    non-suffering mind with feelings. I wanted to mention this on
    the last day, I should also like to repeat that there is a
    beautiful atmosphere here, a group of spiritual friends
    interacting with each other. In fact one of the meditators
    told me this morning when we came, he had difficulties with
    feelings but when people started smiling at him and showing
    friendliness, for the first time, he experienced some
    feelings. That was very nice for me to hear from him.</p>
    <p>Anything else?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 2: </b>Master, you have
    not answered my question. Can we do dancing meditation?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Oh dancing, I
    did not hear the word dancing. During individual and outdoor
    meditation, you are free to dance on your own, the only thing
    is not force it, it should come naturally from your heart,
    otherwise the dance is not something real, it is just because
    you want to dance, you dance. When there is joy, when there
    is lightness, when there is loving kindness, I think whether
    you dance or whether you don't dance, it does not matter,
    this is what is beautiful about it.</p>
    <p>Anything else?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 3: </b>Can mind power be
    as strong and firm as a stone?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>I wouldn't
    like to call that as stone. I would say rather than seeing it
    as a stone, it should be seen as something warm, it should be
    seen as something gentle, soft, tender. These are the
    spiritual qualities that come with the practice. So it is
    completely different from the aspect of a stone which is
    something with no feelings. Something beautiful about human
    beings is that we have this ability to feel and we should
    allow this feeling to arise but then this feeling should be
    worked with, understood, it has to be understood.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 4: </b>You said earlier we
    should not create an image of ourself. When we practise
    meditation on loving kindness, we create an image of ourself
    that we are of loving kindness, so are the two contradictory?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Very good
    question, very good question. So in a way, we need to have
    images, even expectations. What is important for us to
    realize is, in what way are we using them destructively. So
    that here, we don't have these qualities in us, instead of
    loving kindness, we have hatred, hatred to ourselves, hatred
    to others, so it is very very important to bring about a
    shift in us by learning to be your best friend, learning to
    be a friend to others. In a way, it is no harm having an
    image: I want to be a person who is friendly and try to
    practise. Or you can still practise without an image but just
    developing these qualities and from that, allow your
    behaviour to emerge from that, so one can really practise at
    two levels if you like. You like to have an image, you can
    have it but otherwise, you can just practise without an image
    and allow your behaviour to arise from whatever spiritual
    qualities that you have developed. What is important is to
    see whether that image corresponds to reality. This is what
    we have to work with. Images create problems sometimes if the
    images are unrealistic. Again, this is how suffering is
    created, where you have an image of how things should be and
    then what happens in reality is another thing and this is how
    suffering is created. So there are different aspects of this
    question. I'm very happy good questions are being asked. Very
    good.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 2: </b>When you get
    enlightened, then we have no more thoughts?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>I think in a
    way there is nothing wrong with thoughts. This is what I have
    been trying to impress on you. So what I have been trying to
    impress on you is: How we use thoughts destructively? So this
    is what you have to see in everyday life: When we use
    thoughts destructively, how that is creating suffering. I
    also said how one can use thoughts creatively. So thoughts
    have a really very positive use. So I would suggest an
    enlightened person would have thoughts but such a person will
    not use thoughts destructively.</p>
    <p>There is a very interesting quotation by the Buddha
    himself in relation to his own thoughts. Anyway, I would like
    to mention the details. One of his disciples told the Buddha,
    &#145;You have so many powers, you have so many miracles, you
    can have miraculous powers in you.&#146; And the Buddha said,
    &#145;My greatest miracle is when a thought arises, I know a
    thought has arisen, when a thought continues, I know when a
    thought continues, when the thought disappears, I know the
    thought disappears.&#146; So this shows it is not the absence
    of thought. I like that quotation very much, so we can try to
    work on the third aspect: When a thought disappears. So for
    someone to have that type of mind, you have to have a very
    very calm mind, alert mind, just to know when a thought
    disappears. </p>
    <p>So that's about thoughts of an enlightened person. I think
    we should not worry too much about enlightened people.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 2: </b>Actually, my
    question was because when I watched the grasshoppers for some
    time, it's so still, it's so calm, it seems that it is, the
    grasshopper is in meditation and I start to think: What is
    difference between his meditation and my meditation? So this
    thing about our thoughts.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>So you can
    think about the grasshoppers and you can leave the
    enlightened person alone. I think we have enough problems
    with the unenlightened mind of ours. So anything else?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 5: </b>Today, during the
    meditation, I tried to put more effort on observing the
    thoughts and I discovered that when I put more effort on
    observation, there's less passing thoughts. It's just like
    you said, when you want to invite the emotions they do not
    come, when you invite the thoughts, they do not come also.
    It's very interesting.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>It's a very
    important discovery. When we don't want thoughts to arise,
    they arise and when want thoughts to arise, they don't arise.
    When we don't want emotions they arise and when we want
    emotions they don't arise. Why is the mind acting in
    opposition to us? This is a very important question to
    reflect. Is this the nature of the mind? Or have we
    conditioned the mind in this way? Any thoughts about this?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 1: </b>Sometimes we have to
    force it to arise.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 2: </b>Does it work?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 1: </b>Think the thing you
    like to think about. Like if you want to have a coffee, you
    can say, &#145;The coffee is tasty.&#146; Then it would be
    tasty.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>I think what
    it shows is that we cannot tell the mind: Have thoughts, have
    no thoughts. It doesn't work that way. It's like telling a
    child: Do this, don't do this. And the child likes to do what
    you don't want him to do. So this is why again I emphasize
    such a lot on friendliness. So if you want to understand a
    child, you have to be very friendly and see what the child
    wants, so in the same way, if we want to understand our mind,
    we cannot be telling the mind to do this and don't do this,
    but rather, with friendliness, try to understand it. So when
    there's friendliness, when there's gentleness, when there's
    openness, then the mind may start co-operating with us,
    otherwise we tell the mind to behave in one way and it is
    going the other way and we get angry about it. So it becomes
    a battle and becomes another big fight. For meditation, for
    most people, it is a fight. Fighting the mind. I often tell
    meditators, you have enough battles in life, please do not
    make meditation another battle. So with friendliness, we need
    to understand how our mind and body works and then, through
    that understanding, developing mastery is another thing. When
    I spoke on loving kindness, I mentioned that one of the
    benefits is that when there is loving kindness, the mind
    becomes calm naturally.</p>
    <p>Anything else?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 1: </b>Your teaching of
    loving kindness is like teaching us to be a bodhisatta. I
    would like to practise this too but the difficulty is I
    cannot be a bodhisatta. For example, I go pass a beggar in
    the street. I wish to give him $10.00, but then after
    thinking, I would only give him $5.00 because I need the
    other $5.00 for my lunch box. My question is how to be a
    bodhisatta.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>I am very
    happy that you are now 50% bodhisatta! Because from $10.00,
    you give $5.00, you are 50% bodhisatta! So mathematically,
    you are 50% bodhisatta. So I'm sure very soon you will make
    the other 50%. So one day, you will come, you give the beggar
    the $10.00 and you forget about the lunch.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 1: </b>What about my lunch
    box ?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 2: </b>Dhammika told us of
    an incident when he was walking along with you. You came upon
    a beggar and you gave him everything from your pocket and
    then you had no money left and you had to walk a long way to
    where you needed to go. This is something we should learn. Do
    you remember?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>No.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 3: </b>My thoughts are
    formed by words. I do not know whether the thoughts of others
    are also formed by words.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Very
    interesting discovery you have made that thoughts are really
    words. Words and pictures, and they give rise to feelings.
    Let's take a couple of examples. Let us think of breakfast
    tomorrow. Let us close our eyes and see what happens to our
    mind when we think of breakfast tomorrow. Peter ?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 1: </b>The usual things.
    Nothing unusual. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>So it means
    that we see bread, we see coffee, whatever is there we see,
    so actually these are pictures that come and then with the
    pictures, some feelings will come depending on our likes and
    our dislikes. So actually our thoughts come in the form of
    images, words and feelings. So it sounds so simple and then
    what happens to us is with these things, this creates our
    suffering, pictures, films. What is interesting is that
    techniques like focusing on breathing, so that when there are
    no thoughts, so none of these things are present, pictures,
    words, but just dealing with the sensations. And these words
    and pictures are always from the past. We can never see
    pictures and images which we have not experienced before. So
    only when they are absent, something new can happen. So this
    is the beauty of some of the meditation techniques that help
    us to have no pictures and so on. This is what I have been
    encouraging you to do. Make your own discoveries about your
    thoughts, make your own discoveries about your emotions, make
    your own discoveries about how suffering is created. We are
    so fortunate to have this mind and body in us. Sometimes I
    tell meditators that they can be our laboratories and we can
    make experiments, we can make discoveries, we can learn from
    them. Without taking anything for granted, then our whole
    life becomes learning and we should develop a taste for it,
    you should develop a curiosity for it, we should find this
    very interesting, entertaining sometimes, amusing. So then
    when you leave this place, you can continue to discover, you
    can continue to learn, you can continue to find out, then we
    have this openness that we can learn from anything, we can
    learn from anyone, not only from the so-called teachers, but
    life becomes the teacher, your mind and body become your
    teacher and I think it is a beautiful way to live.</p>
    <p>Yesterday we were talking about relationships. Just
    watching the dogs that come here shows very interesting
    relationships there. What have we learnt from just watching
    the three dogs that come here? Have you watched them?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 6: </b>Very friendly.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Yeah, but two
    were friendly and one was always there.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 4: </b>One is an opponent of
    the other two. One is the enemy of the other two.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Yes, it is
    very interesting to see their relationship.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 7: </b>Just like humans.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Yes, just like
    humans. Fascinating to watch them.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 7: </b>The same greed and
    hatred. I think I will not give them anymore bread because
    they fight over it.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Talking about
    dogs, I like to share with you an experience in one of the
    retreats I gave in a foreign country. So on the last day, I
    was having a talk with the meditators and one of them told
    the group that whatever she has learnt from me from the
    course, she has learnt from her dog. So I became curious
    about her dog. I told her please tell something more about
    your dog and she said, &#145;Well, you tell us to just live
    in the present and this is what my dog does, you tell us to
    feel grateful, that's what my dog does.&#146; And she went on
    to describe the behaviour of the dog and what happens in the
    retreat. Then I asked her, &#145;Is there is no difference
    between me and your dog?&#146; She said, &#145;Yes, you talk
    but my dog doesn't talk.&#146; I like that story very much.
    Anything else? Any question?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 8: </b>You taught us the
    practice of loving kindness and how we should be friendly
    with ourselves and others and how we should reflect on wounds
    that we have and forgive others. But how do we know we are
    really being sincere in forgiving ourselves and in forgiving
    others?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Very good
    question. I will give a practical example. Supposing you have
    a wound in relation to what you have done to another: Guilt.
    So before healing the wound, whenever a thought came in
    relation to our act, whenever the thought came, you would
    suffer from guilt. So the wound will be healed when the
    memory comes on reflection and then there is no guilt. In the
    same way, someone has been very unfriendly and unkind to you
    and whenever the memory comes in relation to his or her act,
    you feel hatred, you feel anger, you feel ill will. So the
    wound is healed when the memory comes about that person but
    no hatred, no ill will comes. I'm happy you reminded us of
    wounds, so tomorrow is the last day you have for healing
    wounds. So I would like to suggest you to try to heal them
    and leave all the wounds here when we go out of here.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 9: </b>About wounds to
    others, for example, one of my male friends thinks I wounded
    him but this is not so, I did nothing wrong. How can I help
    him to get rid of the wound?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>So other
    people have wounds in relation to our behaviour. We might try
    to heal their wounds by trying to explain to them, and if you
    have really created the wound, say sorry to them and then try
    to help them to heal their wound. You can always try.
    Sometimes we find it difficult, they may find it difficult to
    heal them but what is important is not for you to suffer as a
    result of that because what can you do about it, you have
    done your best, and then the other person doesn't want to do
    that. So let us not create a wound in our own mind in
    relation to that wound.</p>
    <p>So I like to say something about what we should do
    tomorrow. So one thing I suggest, try to go over different
    things we tried to do here in the last few days and if there
    are any doubts, any difficulties, please raise them in
    tomorrow's discussion or when we meet individually. And also
    please reflect on how you can integrate meditation in
    everyday life and if there are any questions, problems, in
    relation to that, you can prepare the questions and you can
    present them in the discussion. So tomorrow's discussion will
    be related to that.</p>
    <p>And the last suggestion is, I like you to go over the
    different techniques we have practised and if you have any
    questions, any difficulties, you can also present them. So I
    wouldn't be telling you what to do tomorrow, so you are free
    to do whatever technique you like to practise and explore by
    yourself tomorrow. It is very important to learn to be your
    own teacher, learning to be a light unto yourself as the
    Buddha said.</p>
    <p>So let's us do some chanting.</p>
