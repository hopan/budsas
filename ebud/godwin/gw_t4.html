<blockquote>
    <p>I like to welcome you once again. As you notice, the talk
    this evening is on focusing our attention on our in-breath
    and our out-breath. This is one of the most well known and
    popular meditation techniques in all the Buddhist traditions.
    And it is also said that the Buddha became enlightened with
    the help of this technique. So let us see why this technique
    is so important.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Just to Know What Is Happening in
    Our Mind and Body</b></font></p>
    <p>In Pali, this technique is described as Anapanasati, which
    means mindfulness of the in-breath and the out-breath. So in
    this meditation, the whole emphasis is on developing
    awareness and developing mindfulness. As we know, breathing
    takes place mechanically. So what is happening mechanically,
    we are trying to develop mindfulness, awareness. And as the
    whole emphasis is on mindfulness, what is very important for
    you to remember is that whatever is happening in our mind and
    body when we are practising this technique, we should learn
    to just to know, just to be mindful, just to be conscious of
    what's happening. So when you have thoughts, please don't
    consider them as a disturbance or as a distraction, but
    rather be aware that you are having thoughts. If you are
    hearing sounds, you just know you are hearing sounds. So if
    you are feeling different sensations in the body, whatever
    sensations you are experiencing, just know that you are
    experiencing different sensations. So you know these things
    are happening, you become mindful of these things and then
    just come back to your breath. So there is no need to have a
    battle when we are meditating on this technique. I often say
    that you have enough battles in life, please do not make
    meditation another battle. The whole idea of meditation is to
    experience freedom, to experience joy, to experience
    lightness, to be free of suffering but if you make it a
    battle, meditation itself becomes a source of suffering. So
    please remember this, please realize this, that the whole
    emphasis of this technique is just knowing or just being
    mindful or just being conscious of what is happening and then
    to spend more and more time with your breath, without a
    battle.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Experience the Present Moment</b></font></p>
    <p>Another very important aspect of this technique is that it
    helps us to experience the present moment even for a few
    minutes. Because breathing is always taking place now, it is
    always happening now, if we are mindful or conscious of
    breathing even for a few minutes, you can experience what it
    is to be here, what it is to be present. Otherwise, most of
    the time we are lost with either the past or the future and
    we even don't know whether we are in the past or the future.
    So there can be lot of confusion, lot of disorder in our
    minds but this technique, just by being in the present, it
    helps us to experience the present moment even for a few
    moments.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>See Our Breath as Our Friend</b></font></p>
    <p>Another important point to remember is that we need to
    make a connection with our breath and the way we can make a
    connection with our breath is to see our breath as our
    friend. So let us see in what way the breath is our friend.
    One thing is that he or she is the only friend who is with us
    all the time. I don't think we have any friend who is with us
    all the time. So breath is the only friend who is with us all
    the time, always. Another reason is even when we are
    sleeping, our friend is active. Do you have any friends who
    will be with you when you are sleeping? But the breath,
    whether you are sleeping or whether you are not sleeping,
    it's always with us.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Our &quot;Friend&quot; Helps Us
    to Recover from Emotions</b></font></p>
    <p>Another reason why he or she is our best friend is, as I
    said earlier, it is always helping us to experience the
    present moment. And the moment you experience the present
    moment, those moments are moments of freedom. Related to that
    is that our friend, the breath, whenever we are having an
    emotion, if you at that moment think of your friend, please
    try that, there is an immediate recovery from that emotion
    and then you can experience some space because you come back
    to the present moment. A friend of mine asked me yesterday
    that when he is at the traffic lights, he becomes impatient.
    I think we can all relate to this situation, especially when
    we are late for an appointment and you see only the red
    light. So poor red light. You can be angry with the red
    light, you can be impatient about the red light and this can
    create lots of suffering for us. So I told my friend, the
    next time he finds himself in such a situation, just relax,
    spend some time with your breath. So earlier you were hating
    the red light, now you can feel grateful for the red light
    because thanks to the red light, you can be with your friend,
    the breath. So I like to repeat that whenever you are having
    any unpleasant emotions, it can be stress, it can be anger,
    it can be fear, it can be anxiety, it can be guilt, any
    unpleasant emotion that create our suffering, no sooner you
    think of your friend and spend sometime with the in-breath
    and the out-breath, what happens to that emotion? I will tell
    you a simple reason why we can find relief in such a
    situation. The simple reason is when we are having an
    emotion, what make it bigger, what make it worse are our
    thoughts. So that in such a situation, if you can spend a few
    minutes with our friend, there is no room for thoughts to
    arise and there is an immediate recovery.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Our &quot;Friend&quot; Can Help
    Us When We Die</b></font></p>
    <p>Another moment, a very important moment our friend can
    help us is at the time we die. In fact in one of the texts,
    it is said that if you learn to practise this technique and
    if you learn to make a connection with your breath, at the
    moment you are dying and if you are conscious, immediately
    your attention can come to the breath. I'm very much
    interested in this work people do with dying people, helping
    dying people to die peacefully. It is interesting that one of
    the techniques they used is focusing on breathing. So isn't
    it really valuable our friend helps us to live peacefully and
    helps us to die peacefully.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Forget Our Identification</b></font></p>
    <p>Another beautiful aspect of our friend is that when we are
    with our friend even for a few minutes, all our
    identifications, that you are Chinese, Sri Lanka, German,
    English, all this is forgotten. In this world, there are
    these different divisions, racial divisions, religious
    divisions. Some of the problems in the modern world, maybe
    they recognize these divisions. So when you are with the
    breath, all these identifications drop away and then it is
    just the in-breath and the out-breath. So breathing is just
    breathing whether it is a Buddhist, whether it is a
    Christian, whether it is a Hindu, it is just the breath.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Experience the Calmness &amp;
    Wisdom</b></font></p>
    <p>Another aspect, maybe the last one, as time is running
    out, is that when we are with the breath, we can experience
    some calm, some space, some stillness in our mind. In
    Buddhist terms, this aspect is described as Samadhi, which is
    calm, tranquility, stillness. So it is interesting that this
    technique has the aspect of experiencing Samadhi, calm, and
    also as I said, it helps us to experience some insight, some
    wisdom. As I said, it helps us to see thoughts as just
    thoughts, just to mirror our thoughts, just experiencing the
    sensations, just experiencing sounds, so we can have this
    very important Buddhist insight: learning to see things just
    as they are.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>How This Technique Help Us in
    Everyday Life</b></font></p>
    <p>An interesting question is: does this technique help us in
    everyday life or only helps us when we are sitting on a
    cushion? So I would suggest that as I said, whilst sitting,
    we have this insight, we develop the skills, we develop
    awareness, we develop a non-reactive equanimous mind and
    then, what is more important, is to have such a mind in
    everyday life. So what I try to do in my talk is to present
    some points, some aspects about the importance of this
    technique of being aware of our breathing. Maybe there are
    more points but I think I have no time. I would like to now
    invite any questions about what have been said and any
    questions about this practice.</p>
    <hr align="left" width="25%">
    <p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Q&amp;A</b></font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">I would like to know what is the difference
    between the meditation we are learning now and the meditation
    that are taught by other religion?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>It's a very
    theoretical question but I always prefer simple practical
    question but still I will respond to that theoretical
    question. When you say other religion, it can include so many
    religions. So in religion where there is always some emphasis
    on meditation, there is always an emphasis on making the mind
    calm and making the mind still. In fact, in Christianity,
    there is this beautiful saying: Become still and be like God.
    So that in different religion, they may use different
    techniques but the principle is using those techniques to
    experience some calmness, some stillness, some spaciousness.
    Another similarity is that any tradition where there is
    meditation, there has to be an element of awareness, there
    has to be an element of knowing, understanding what is
    happening in the mind. So I would suggest that these two
    aspects are there in any spiritual tradition where there is
    meditation.</p>
    <p>Anything else? I would like some practical questions
    relating to the technique.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">How can I know what to do with the breathing
    and how to feel the effects of the breathing?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>You don't have
    to experience the effects of breathing. In fact when I give a
    guided meditation, I would try to suggest what has to be
    done. What has to be done is something very simple. Just feel
    what happens when the body is breathing. So using the
    sensations and the movements in the body, to be conscious, to
    be aware. So I would like to repeat that you don't have to do
    anything special. It is just being conscious of your
    in-breath and your out-breath.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">When we are meditating, we may feel tired and
    sleepy. What should we do in that situation?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Very good
    practical question. So one suggestion is, just open your
    eyes. Another is, it is interesting in the Buddhist text, it
    is emphasized to have your spine erect. So if you can have
    your spine erect, then to a great extent it is very difficult
    to feel sleepy or drowsy. Another suggestion is, I mean you
    are welcomed to stand up. So you can try some of these things
    and then I would say that they should immediately work.
    Anything else?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">The first question is, in Chinese, we say
    that we have got only one mind and we cannot use one mind for
    two things at the same time. And during our daily life, we
    have to attend work and most of the time we are very busy, so
    how can we deal with our work and make friends with our
    breathing at the same time? And the second question is you
    said earlier that breathing is our best friend and is with us
    all the time even when we are sleeping, so when we have
    dreams or when we are in deep sleep, how can we take care of
    our breathing at that time?</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>I'll start
    with the last question. What is interesting about our friend
    is that there are times when we can ignore it. Because when
    you are dreaming and when we are sleeping, to think of your
    breath, we have to have awareness and consciousness. Unless
    you are a very advance meditator, you can have some element
    of awareness while you are sleeping and dreaming, otherwise I
    mean who is the person who has awareness when you are
    sleeping and dreaming. So my response is, this is a situation
    where you can just leave our friend alone and he or she would
    not mind it at all. So the first question was that in
    everyday life we have to do different things. Now when we
    have to do different things, how can we do different things
    and still take care of our friend. As I said, to think of
    your friend, you have to stop your work. This is why I said
    when the traffic lights are red, when you are just doing
    nothing, just be conscious of your friend rather than be
    impatient about the red light. When you are having a
    particular emotion and when you are bothered about that
    emotion and at that moment, you will not be trying to do
    different things and at that moment, just come back to the
    breath. But still I like to respond, what we might try to do
    as meditators when we have to do different things. So here
    what happens is when we have to do different things, what can
    affect us is that we might have the idea: I have to do many
    things but it is possible I might make a mistake. Sometimes
    this is what creates the tension. As I said yesterday, in
    cultures where the emphasis is on doing things perfectly,
    rightly, you want to do always, everything rightly and
    perfectly. So I think in a way, in such situations, if you
    can just let go of this idea of perfection, this can be
    helpful. This is one suggestion.</p>
    <p>Another interesting point is that although we have to do
    different things, we can, as you rightly said, do only one
    thing at a time. So that if we can learn to be conscious of
    whatever we are doing at a particular situation, then one can
    develop what is called moment to moment awareness in relation
    to what has to be done.</p>
    <p>Maybe one last suggestion which can be very helpful is
    when you are working, when you have to do different things,
    as I said earlier, what is important is to become conscious
    of your state of mind. Are you anxious, are you stressful,
    are you insecure, are you relaxed? So it is very important
    for those who are really interested in everyday practice to
    constantly check out your state of mind. Whether you are
    working or whether you are not working, try to develop this
    practice of constant watching, awareness of what is happening
    in your mind. So when you have to do different things, after
    being aware of different things, just watch your state of
    mind. Is it reacting or is it responding? These are two very
    interesting words: reacting, responding. Responding is doing
    what is necessary without reacting. Reacting is getting
    anxious, getting fearful, getting stressed, tense and so on.
    So as you are still human and as you're still practicing, it
    is human that we will start to react in certain situations.
    So if you are able to be conscious even at the time you are
    reacting, at least later on, when there is space, where there
    is clarity, when you have recovered from that emotion, you
    can look back and find out: why did I react? Why couldn't I
    have responded to that situation? Then as I said yesterday,
    we learn from our mistakes, we can learn even from our
    reactions. So this kind of inquiry has to be done without
    giving yourself a minus. You do have to do this kind of
    enquiry in a very friendly, gentle, playful way. And then you
    can experiment with it, you say now tomorrow let me go and
    see how will I work. Will I react, will I respond? And in the
    reaction, how long will it last? So you are going with an
    open mind to see what is going to happen. These are very
    interesting, beautiful aspects of meditation, to see it as
    experimenting, experimenting with yourself. So when you try
    one experiment, you don't take up a position. So without
    taking up a position, you're just learning, finding out,
    exploring, experimenting. We can experiment, explore, learn
    from any situations.</p>
    <p>So there's time for one last question please.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">I am aware of myself being aware of the
    thoughts, then in that case, I cannot concentrate on my
    meditation, so what can I do?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>So the
    question is, if as I understood it correctly, if you are
    observing the thoughts, that is not meditation. If that is
    not meditation, what exactly was the question you didn't
    understand.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Interpreter: </b></font><font
    color="#800000">His question is when he meditates, he is
    aware of the passing thoughts and at that stage, he is O.K,
    he can still concentrate but when he is aware that he is
    aware of the passing thoughts, then that affects his
    concentration.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>So this is
    another point we have to remember, this word &quot;<i>concentration</i>&quot;.
    Those who are listening to me carefully will remember I have
    not used the word &quot;concentration&quot; at all, but
    rather than &quot;concentration&quot;, the words I use are
    &quot;awareness&quot;, &quot;mindfulness&quot;, &quot;just
    knowing&quot;. I purposely avoid the word
    &quot;concentration&quot; because this is what is creating
    the vacuum. This is what is creating the suffering. So what I
    would suggest is, whatever is happening, if the mind is
    concentrated, just know that the mind is concentrated and
    when the mind is not concentrated, just know the mind is not
    concentrated. What is the problem? It is very important when
    we sit for meditation, not to have an expectation, an idea, a
    model of what should happen or what should not happen. In the
    Zen tradition, there is a beautiful word for it, to have the
    beginner's mind, or the &quot;<i>don't know</i>&quot; mind.
    And expectation is what creates suffering in our life. When
    we have expectations and when they do not correspond to our
    expectations, we are suffering in life and this is how
    suffering is created in meditation. It is very interesting.
    So when we meditate without having any expectation, you will
    just try to know what is happening from moment to moment. And
    it is very very important not to give pluses and minuses when
    we are meditating. So someone is expecting to concentrate and
    then when you think you are concentrated, you give yourself a
    big plus and holding on to the concentration and that's how
    tension is created. And when the mind is not concentrated,
    big minus. So in meditation also we are rating, giving
    pluses, giving minuses, giving pluses, giving minuses. This
    is what we are doing in ordinary life, so at least in
    meditation, please learn just to be open to whatever is
    happening.</p>
    <p>So now I like to suggest that you take a small break and
    during the break, please make an effort to have mindfulness
    and when you move around, please make an effort to move
    slowly and with awareness so that you begin preparing your
    mind for the meditation. Please learn to walk slowly please.</p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#800000">[Break]</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Please sit in
    a relaxed position. It is very important to sit with a
    relaxed body. Please realize we are not going to do something
    special so you can just relax.</p>
    <p>So let us spend some time with our body. Just feel the
    body. The different sensations, the different movements in
    your body.</p>
    <p>If there are thoughts, just let go of the thoughts and
    come back to the body. So feeling the body is one thing,
    thinking about the body is another, please see the
    difference. Here, we are learning to feel our body.</p>
    <p>Let us learn to feel friendly and gently and kind towards
    our body.</p>
    <p>Let us now feel what it is to sit with our body completely
    still.</p>
    <p>Now please allow the body to breath naturally.</p>
    <p>No need to control our breath or to manipulate our
    breathing, not to manipulate our natural breathing.</p>
    <p>Let us spend a few minutes just learning to allow the body
    to do what it likes.</p>
    <p>Now just feel what happens in the body when the body is
    breathing, the different sensations, the different movements
    in the body when the body is breathing.</p>
    <p>Do you feel any sensation in the area of the nostrils? Do
    you feel any sensation in the area of the chest? Do you feel
    the rise and the fall of the abdomen?</p>
    <p>Experiencing the present moment with the help of the
    sensations and movements in your body because they are
    happening now.</p>
    <p>When the body is inhaling you know that the body is
    inhaling. When the body is exhaling you know that the body is
    exhaling.</p>
    <p>Not thinking about the past, not thinking about the
    future. Experiencing the joy of the present moment with the
    help of the in-breath and the out-breath.</p>
    <p>Please do not try to stop thoughts or control thoughts.</p>
    <p>If thoughts are there, just know you are having thoughts
    and come back to your friend, the breath.</p>
    <p>Just feel relaxed with your breath.</p>
    <p>Let us feel friendly and gentle towards our mind and body.</p>
    <p>No pluses to what is happening, no minuses to what is
    happening. Just knowing whatever is happening.</p>
    <p>Now please open your eyes slowly and when you change your
    posture, please do it slowly, consciously. And please don't
    think that the meditation is over. Just continue to know what
    is happening in the mind and body from moment to moment.</p>
    <p>Now let us do some chanting. So when you are chanting,
    please have your body still and please don't make any noises
    because chanting itself is a meditation. Like using the
    breath to experience the present moment, using the chanting
    to experience the present moment and to create space in our
    mind through our chanting. I like to suggest not to look at
    the paper because these are simple words and you will be able
    to pick up the words.</p>
