  <p><font color="#7F007F" face="Times New Roman"><b>Godwin:</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As this is the last discussion, I'd like to share with you
  some of the things I learned during the last few days about the meditators I have been
  meeting. These are some of the things that I have already spoken about but I'd like to
  emphasize them so that you have to really make an effort to work with them.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><b>Suffering from Guilt</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One problem I encountered with many meditators is
  suffering from guilt. Maybe there are some historical or social reasons why there seems to
  be a lot of guilt in this culture because in old cultures like the Tibetan culture, Sri
  Lanka culture and other cultures, there is even no word for &#145;guilt&#146;. I read
  somewhere that his holiness the Dalai Lamma was surprised when he encountered many
  Westerners suffering from guilt. So people who generally suffer from guilt, from the past,
  they seem to remember mostly the wrong things they have done in the past. So we seem to
  have a selective memory in this connection. So the good things they have done they have
  completely forgotten and they remember only their shortcomings, only their failures, and
  they don't realize that they are punishing themselves with the guilt that they are holding
  on. In a way it is unfortunate that traditional Buddhism is also sometimes seems to be
  emphasizing this, specially with the doctrine of Kamma. This is why I never speak about
  Kamma because what happens is you think you have done some wrong things and you think you
  are going to suffer because of Kamma. So it is really unfortunate that the Buddhist
  doctrines are used to create more suffering. And of course they only think of bad Kamma,
  they never think of the good Kamma. So the whole idea of Buddhism as I have been
  emphasizing is to develop more joy, freedom from suffering, so I'm very sorry to see that
  Buddhism is used to create more and more suffering. Just to give an example, when I was in
  Hong Kong, I met a woman, a very good woman, a very kind-heartened woman. A Buddhist
  teacher had told her that there was a devil inside her and this teacher said, &#145;I can
  see it in your face.&#146; So when I met her she was really suffering from what she heard
  from this Buddhist teacher. So this brings up something about the tradition, that we have
  to be clear what is taught in the culture and what is really taught in the teachings. It's
  interesting to some extent even in Sri Lanka I meet Buddhists who seem to emphasize more
  on the suffering aspect, so I tell them, &#145;Please, that is only the first noble truth,
  what about the other noble truths?&#146; So this is one area I like you to reflect and as
  I have been emphasizing, please use loving kindness, gentleness, learning to be your best
  friend and seeing your worth, seeing your potentialities, seeing that you have the Buddha
  nature in us.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><b>Fearing of Making Mistake</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another point related to this is the fear of making
  mistakes. I'm not asking you to deliberately make mistakes but when we have made a
  mistake, we should learn how to relate to that mistake. So this is why I have been
  emphasizing to see them as learning experiences, as valuable experiences, feeling grateful
  for such situations because we can learn from them.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><b>Integrate Meditation with Daily Life</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another thing that I discovered here, I've mentioned this,
  is to associate meditation only with sitting, or a particular time, particular posture and
  so on. So as I have been emphasizing, if you are really serious about meditation, it has
  to be a way of living, specially in everyday life, in relationships that you are having
  whether in the place of work, at home or whatever. They should be areas of meditation for
  you to work with. So it's really a way of understanding, it's a way of knowledge, it's a
  very of developing wisdom and then trying to integrate that in our daily life. So what
  happened, I saw that some meditators here they associate meditation only with sitting, so
  that when they sit, it is something special. So when we sit, if you think it is something
  special, you're bound to have special problems. Even the way you are breathing, you try to
  do it differently. And then when you sit, you want to achieve suddenly states of calm and
  special experience, but in other times, you're not worried about it. So it is clear it's a
  kind of fragmentation, a duality between the person who is sitting and the person who is
  outside. So as I said, if you can see meditation as something that you do most of the
  time, it's just being aware, it's just understanding what is happening, then when you sit,
  it is just continuing that. This is why I was emphasizing we have one day for working on
  thoughts, one day for working on emotions, so for us to see how we use thoughts
  destructively, how we use emotions destructively, to see how they work, the conditions
  arising, so that with that in everyday life, we'll be able to handle our thoughts and our
  emotions when they arise.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So some teachers say that when you are sitting, please see
  the sitting as nothing special because nothing special is happening. They are the same
  things, thoughts, sensations, emotions, sounds. So how can it be different? The difference
  is there when we know it, when we understand it, when we are clear about what is
  happening.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><b>Repressing Unpleasant Experiences</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I think another thing I discovered, I must say that most
  of these things are humanness but I'd like to spotlight on some aspects because it is
  relevant to this culture I think. Another is I think is repressing, pushing away, denying,
  not looking at unpleasant experiences. So again we have this kind of duality, that
  meditation spiritual life is having pleasant experiences and that we should not have
  unpleasant experiences, again a battle, again a split, again a division, again a duality.
  I would suggest, please don't be surprised. The pleasant experiences are not so important,
  what are more important are unpleasant experiences because there is no problem with
  pleasant experiences. So the problem is with the unpleasant experiences and we don't
  realize that by repressing, by pushing them away, by not looking at them, we give them
  more power. So it's a kind of vicious circle, it's a kind of dependent origination. How
  one thing is leading to another and how one thing is leading to suffering. So this is why
  again I have been emphasizing so much, be open to unpleasant experiences, let them arise,
  don't push them away. So then the power that we have given, we give them power by
  repressing and by pushing because we are afraid, but when we take away the power, you'll
  realize that they are no problem.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In a way I can relate this to some of the exercises I gave
  in relation to nature. Seeing things very sharply, seeing things very clearly because when
  you learn to observe external things very clearly, then you learn to see everything, all
  the things that you can see, the pleasant ones, unpleasant ones, you just notice whatever
  there is without exclusion, without selecting. It is interesting in the Dhamma you get
  this phrase,<i> externally and internally</i>. Then you learn to notice so many things
  that are happening inside you, internal. Then when you see more and more things that are
  happening inside you, then you see more and more your real qualities, our shortcomings,
  they become also very very clear to us. And as I said, it is very important to experience
  them completely and fully and see how they create suffering. The Buddha emphasized very
  much for us to experience these things fully and completely and see how that is creating
  suffering. Now we even don't know that is creating suffering, we are just accepting the
  Buddha's word or just because someone says it. So when we have things like anger, fear,
  jealousy and so on, we must see hat it does to us. If there's a resistance to them,
  there's a dislike to them, we don't really experience them. The simple point is if you
  don't experience them, how can you work on them. And then when they are not there, just to
  know that they are not there and just to see the difference, so then you naturally see the
  difference and then as it is said in the Dhamma, the natural unfolding arises in your
  practice.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><b>Greed and Need</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I think another aspect is pampering. One of my friends
  said the word pampering is too mild, maybe we should say we are spoiling ourselves. In the
  talks I gave at the nunnery, I spoke about consumerism, materialism and so on. So we are
  living in such a culture in which very very easily you can be spoilt. Very easily you can
  start pampering yourself, sometimes without even knowing what you are doing to yourself.
  So it becomes a kind of self indulgence without realizing. So this is why I suggested that
  sometimes you have to say no to things in a friendly gentle way. Sometimes you have to say
  yes. In relation to saying yes, now when you need something you should ask the questions:
  Do I really need this or am I buying this or I want to get this just because the society,
  the expectation in society that I should be wearing this or I should be like this or I
  should like that. So it is really funny as we give lot of power to other people, we have
  given lot of power to society, social values and then we don't realize we became victims
  of this, we don't realize the society is manipulating our needs, our greed. So we don't
  know what is greed, what is need, what is what you really need. In the kitchen in our
  centre, we have a poem: &quot;Those who see the difference between the need and the greed,
  whatever his creed he is a saint indeed&quot;. This was composed by a friend of me and
  what made him compose this is what he saw in India. He told me that he was going to one of
  the Indian temples and outside the temple there was a beggar who was seated and he had a
  piece of cloth in front of him for the money and the beggar had his eyes closed. When my
  friend saw this beggar's face with his eyes closed, he was so impressed, inspired by the
  serenity, the calmness that the beggar was sitting like this. So he was so curious that he
  stood with him and just spent some time with him. And suddenly this man got up, picked up
  some coins and threw the other coins on the floor and he went to a shop nearby, he took
  something to eat, something to drunk and he disappeared. So this incident really had a
  strong impact on my friend and when he was reflecting on this incident, this poem came to
  his mind. I'm not telling you to throw away your money, but what I am suggesting is to use
  the money functionally. We need money, we need material possessions but what is important
  is they're possessing us now. So what we need to do is not to allow them to control us but
  for us to learn to control them. So when there is a change which takes place inside you,
  then a very beautiful spiritual quality comes into being, which is contentment. It is
  rarely that I meet someone who is really contented with himself, with herself, with
  whatever they're having. This spiritual qualify is very much emphasized in the Dhamma.
  There's a beautiful Pali word for this: Santutthi. Contentment is the greatest wealth.
  It's very interesting.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><b>Contentment: No Complaints</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And another aspect related to contentment is having no
  complaint. Human beings are very good at complaining. We can complain about anything, even
  people who try to help us if they make one mistake, we start complaining about them. So if
  you can lead your life in a way where you have no complaints, and then when you die, you
  can say: I have no complaints. There is an interesting story in this connection. There was
  a zen student under a zen Master and he was practising for many years. So one day the zen
  Master called his student and said, &#145;I have taught whatever I can, now you must go
  and meet another teacher.&#146; So he gave an address of another zen teacher. So when he
  found the place and when he found this teacher, she was a poor woman, not very impressive
  at all, just a woman there. So he thought he was in the wrong place but then he realized
  it was the right place, the right teacher, and she was also not teaching him anything, she
  was doing her things normally. So as a meditator, he just started observing this woman. So
  when he started observing this woman, two words came to his mind: No Complaints.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So these are just some suggestions that I like to share
  with you for your continuation of your practice. And I'm very happy to say that you have a
  very good organization, that you have a group and you have a good teacher, you have very
  good spiritual friends so one really benefit from such a group. So I like to ask everyone
  to help this organization, to help this group. So in a way it will be helping yourself, in
  a way, it will be helping others.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, I like to say one thing. It is also related to the
  Buddha's teachings. Some of you have been calling me Master. I just allowed you to do
  that. Actually in the Dhamma, in the Pali tradition, the word &#145;teacher&#146; is not
  used. Two beautiful words are used: <strong>spiritual friend</strong>. This is how I like
  to see myself, as a spiritual friend. And it's a very beautiful relationship to have. When
  you say you are the Master, then again a big division between the Master and the student
  but when you are a spiritual friend and we are spiritual friends, then we are exploring
  together, investigating together, learning together, sharing from each other, it's a
  beautiful way to relate to each other. And then there's another danger I like to also warn
  you about. So with the Master you just accept whatever the Master says. You accept him as
  authority. There is no place for authority in the Buddhist teaching. I like to conclude by
  quoting from a very well known Buddhist text. A group of spiritual people called Kalamas
  who were exposed to different teachers came to the Buddha and said, &#145;We are confused,
  so many teachers are saying so many different things. What should we do? Please help
  us.&#146; The Buddha said something very radical at that time. So he told this groups of
  people, &#145;Don't accept anything just because it is in the traditions.&#146; What a
  statement to make! &#145;Don't accept anything just because it is in the scriptures. Don't
  accept anything just because it is logical, reasonable, rational. Don't accept anything
  just because a teacher tells you but accept only when you know in your own experience what
  is conducive to happiness, what is creating suffering and what can help you to overcome
  suffering.&#146; When you know that in your own experience, then accept that experience.
  So experience is our teacher. Life is the best teacher you can have. So with these words,
  I like to conclude what I'm saying about the Dhamma.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now I like to thank some people. Firstly I like to thank
  everyone who is here. I think everyone here gave real commitment to the practice and it
  was nice that there was a nice group, atmosphere building up. And I like to thank the
  organisers. It's a very good team, they are working very well as a team and their
  organisation is excellent. Unlike Sri Lanka, everything here is very clear! Everything is
  written, everything is on paper! It's very very impressive for me, for someone from Sri
  Lanka.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#7F0000" face="Times New Roman"><b>Male 1: </b>That's why we are
  suffering!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>I feel that
  these organizers are not suffering.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Special thanks for the very sweet lady who was at the
  kitchen. Always with a smile.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#7F0000" face="Times New Roman"><b>Male 2:</b> No complaint too!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>And I must
  also make special thanks to those who helped her. I was very impressed to see how they
  were working. And watching them working and helping in the kitchen, the impression I got
  was that they are really enjoying what they do. So as I said, working meditation, work can
  give us lots of sources of happiness. It can be seen as action in loving kindness. Of
  course, I like to thank the yoga teacher.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#7F0000" face="Times New Roman"><b>Yoga Teacher: </b>Please don't call me
  Master! Just a yoga friend!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Very good,
  very good. So we should thank our yoga friend. And I should also like to make special
  mention of the interpreters. It was a very difficult job because sometimes they had to
  even come for interviews. So they had to stop their practice and then sometimes listen to
  the problems of other people. So I had a feeling that they did an excellent job, no
  complaints.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So let us now do some chanting and then loving kindness
  meditation. </font></p>

  <h3 align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Eulogy by Bhikkhu Bodhi,
  Sri Lanka, March 2000</font></h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Mr Godwin Samararatne passed away peacefully in March
    2000. Below is the Eulogy by Bhikkhu Bodhi, Buddhist Publication Society, Kandy, Sri Lanka</em></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-oOo-</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>Acharya Godwin Samararatne </strong></em></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In late March death snatched from our midst, too soon, one
  of Sri Lanka's most beloved Buddhist teachers, Godwin Samararatne. For close to twenty
  years, Godwin had been the resident meditation teacher at the Nilambe Meditation Centre
  near Kandy. He had also taught meditation within Kandy itself, at the Lewella and Visakha
  Meditation Centres (two affiliates of Nilambe), at the University of Peradeniya, at
  private homes, and at the Buddhist Publication Society. But Godwin did not belong to Sri
  Lanka alone. He belonged to the whole world, and he was loved and esteemed by people clear
  across the globe. Thousands of people from many lands came to Nilambe to practise
  meditation under his guidance, and they also invited him to their own countries to conduct
  meditation courses and retreats. Thus over the past two decades Godwin, in his own quiet
  way, had become an international Buddhist celebrity, constantly in demand in countries
  ranging from Europe to Hongkong and Taiwan. He was also a regular visitor to South Africa,
  where he conducted his last meditation retreat earlier this year. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What was so impressive about Godwin, however, was not what
  he did but what he was. He was above all a truly selfless person, and it was this utter
  selflessness of the man that accounts for the impact he had on the lives of so many
  people. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I use the word &quot;selflessness&quot; to describe him in
  two interrelated senses. First, he was selfless in the sense that he seemed to have almost
  no inner gravitational force of an &quot;I&quot; around which his personal life revolved:
  no pride, no ambition, no personal projects aimed at self-aggrandizement. He was
  completely humble and non- assertive, not in an artificial self-demeaning way, but rather
  as if he had no awareness of a self to be effaced. Hence as a meditation teacher he could
  be utterly transparent, without any trips of his own to lay upon his students. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This inward &quot;emptiness&quot; enabled Godwin to be
  selfless in the second sense: as one who always gave first consideration to the welfare of
  others. He was ready to empathize with others and share their concerns as vividly as if
  they were his own. In this respect, Godwin embodied the twin Buddhist virtues of
  loving-kindness and compassion, maitri and karuna. Even without many words, his dignified
  presence conveyed a quietude and calm that spoke eloquently for the power of inner
  goodness, for its capacity to reach out to others and heal their anxiety and distress. It
  was this deep quietude and almost tangible kindness that drew thousands of people to
  Godwin and encouraged them to welcome him into their lives. The trust they placed in him
  was well deposited, for in an age when so many popular &quot;gurus&quot; have gained
  notoriety for their unscrupulous behaviour, he never exploited the confidence and good
  will of his pupils. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Though Godwin taught the practice of Buddhist meditation,
  particularly the way of mindfulness, he did not try to propagate &quot;Buddhism&quot; as a
  doctrine or religious faith, much less as part of an exotic cultural package. His
  inspiration came from the Dhamma as primarily a path of inner transformation whose
  effectiveness stemmed from its ability to promote self-knowledge and self- purification.
  He saw the practice of meditation as a way to help people help themselves, to understand
  themselves more clearly and change themselves for the better. He emphasized that Buddhist
  meditation is not a way of withdrawing from everyday life, but of living everyday life
  mindfully, with awareness and clear comprehension, and he taught people how to apply the
  Dhamma to the knottiest problems of their mundane lives. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">By not binding the practice of meditation to the
  traditional religious framework of Buddhism, Godwin was able to reach out and speak to
  people of the most diverse backgrounds. For him there were no essential, unbridgeable
  differences between human beings. He saw people everywhere as just human beings beset by
  suffering and searching for happiness, and he offered the Buddha's way of mindfulness as
  an experiential discipline leading to genuine peace of heart. Hence he could teach people
  from such different backgrounds -- Western, Asian, and African; Buddhist, Hindu,
  Christian, and Muslim; Sri Lankan Theravadins and Chinese Mahayanists -- and all could
  respond favourably to his guidance. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If it was not for a chronic liver condition that he had
  patiently endured for years, with hardly a word of complaint, Godwin might well have lived
  on to actively teach the way of mindfulness for at least another decade. But this was not
  to be, for in late February, almost immediately upon his return from a teaching engagement
  in South Africa, his illness flared up and a month later claimed his precious life. Those
  of us who have been touched by him will long bear in our hearts the memory of his calm,
  gentle personality, and of the impact his life had on our own. May he quickly attain the
  Supreme Bliss of Nibbana. </font></p>
