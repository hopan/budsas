    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin:</b></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Consumerism</b></font></p>
    <p>Most people believe that materials are important.
    Happiness lies in material things. In fact, the more
    materials you get, the more dissatisfied you are; the more
    dissatisfied you are, the more materials you want to get.
    Buddha has given a very powerful simile to describe this
    condition. He compared this to a dog with a bone. So the dog
    doesn't let go of the bone and is just holding on to it and
    is still hungry and still dissatisfied and still suffers from
    fear in losing that bone. Related to this serious problem of
    materialism is another aspect of this, another manifestation
    of this, now called consumerism. So it's a real challenge for
    modern man to live in consumer societies and still how not to
    be affected by the consumerism around you. As I see it,
    consumerism has many aspects but I see two dangerous aspects
    in consumerism. One is people are not clear about what they
    need and what their greed is. It's interesting, according to
    the Dhamma, we need certain things, food, clothing, shelter
    and medicine, what is called the four requisites. So the four
    necessary things are things that human beings need. So
    there's a place for material things but then as I said, when
    they become our goals and then when you are confused about
    greed and need, this is where it can lead to dissatisfaction
    and suffering as I mentioned. </p>
    <p>Another dangerous aspect of consumerism is that the
    society that you live in starts manipulating you, and the
    danger is that you don't know that you are being manipulated.
    So you become like puppets, puppets in the hands of society
    that can create your own desires, can create your own greed
    and it leads to more and more frustration. So isn't this a
    sad situation of the human condition where human beings have
    the potentialities of becoming free, of becoming enlightened?
    We have the Buddha nature in us but this aspect is not looked
    at and then we become victims of the society that we live in.
    The simile that has come to my mind about this situation is
    that though we are grown up, we have become still dependent
    on what I call &quot;<i>toys</i>&quot;. I'm interested to
    know the toys that human beings go into in this culture, this
    country. What I mean by toys are external things where you
    think are happiness, joy, peace and you start acquiring toys
    and you change one toy for another and your whole life is
    being spent on getting toys and then you are dissatisfied. So
    can I hear from you some of the toys that you are interested
    in acquiring.</p>

    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>In a way
    houses are necessary but then you are not satisfied with a
    small house, so the house becomes bigger and bigger and then
    that can become a toy and you are still dissatisfied. May be
    a beautiful new house but you're not happy. May be until you
    go into a bigger house. That can be a problem.</p>

    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Now that toy
    has even been introduced to Sri Lanka. Anyway we can draw up
    a long list of toys. An interesting question is: is
    meditation also a toy? Is there a relationship between these
    toys and meditation?</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">Yes.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>I would
    suggest that with meditation, you become your own toy. This
    is the importance of the Dhamma. This is the importance of
    the Buddha's wonderful teaching. When you become your own
    toy, you can be happy, contented, peaceful with yourself. So
    the need for external toys, external things drop away because
    you find the joy and happiness from within. A very important
    aspect of this is learning to enjoy your own company. When
    mediators come to the centre I live in Sri Lanka, I tell them
    to spend some time alone and see what happens when you are
    alone and see what happens when you are alone with yourself.
    It's interesting. Some of the people who come there have
    never spent some time completely alone with themselves,
    without any toys. So what happens? They become lonely, they
    become bored. What does it show about ourselves? We cannot
    stay with us for more than 10 or 15 minutes at least and we
    want to escape from ourselves. So the importance of the
    Dhamma is that you realize that, you work through that and as
    I said, you learn to be your best friend. You learn to be
    self-contained, self-contented with oneself. Such a person is
    described in the Dhamma as someone who is at home wherever he
    is. So such a person can be happy with oneself, being alone,
    and such a person can be happy with others.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Not to Create Suffering Because
    of Making Mistakes</b></font></p>
    <p>I like to touch on another aspect which shows the
    importance of the Dhamma is that with the practice of the
    Dhamma in any situation in life, you can see the Dhamma in
    any situation in life, as I said yesterday, even unpleasant
    experiences will become learning experiences. I know in this
    culture, people are afraid to make mistake because of the
    emphasis on wanting to be perfect. With this model of
    perfection, what happens is that when we make a mistake, we
    beat ourselves, we hate ourselves, we lose our
    self-confidence, we see ourselves as worthless. In my
    language, you see only minuses in yourself and when you see
    minuses in yourself, you see minuses in others so that you
    can create a hell for only minuses. So the importance of the
    Dhamma is that it enables us not to create suffering in this
    way because of our mistakes but as I said, we learn to ask
    the question: what can I learn from my mistakes? What does it
    indicate about myself? So that this kind of inquiry has to be
    done in a very friendly, gentle, understanding way without
    any minuses. Then our mistakes themselves help us to grow in
    the spiritual path. Isn't that a beautiful way of living?
    Learn from our mistakes and then when you see mistakes in
    others, you also learn to relate to the mistakes of others in
    an entirely different way. So we learn to appreciate our
    humanness, not the idea of perfection. Then we learn to
    appreciate the humanness of others. So the importance of the
    teaching is that we see clearly how we create our own
    suffering and through that realization, then it becomes
    clear, only we can be free of the suffering ourselves. Then
    we become self-reliant. Then we learn to have self-confidence
    that whatever arises, I know how to handle them with the help
    of the Dhamma. Then you learn to be your own teacher. And as
    the Buddha said, you learn to be a light unto yourself.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Life Becomes Your Teacher</b></font></p>
    <p>One last point on this point. I have had the good fortune
    to meet many masters, many gurus, many teachers from many
    traditions. Do you know which master, which guru has inspired
    me? It is life itself. Life becomes our best teacher. So
    thanks to the Dhamma, when you realize the importance of the
    Dhamma, life becomes your teacher. And sometimes life can be
    a very hard teacher also, but it is always a good teacher. It
    can indicate to us what we are really are. So now I will stop
    and if you have any questions, please ask them. In the last
    few days, you have been asking very good practical questions
    relating to life, so I hope today also. I touched on some
    areas which are related to your life here, so please feel
    free to ask any questions and let us see how the Dhamma, how
    the Buddha's teachings can help us to work with these
    problems.</p>
    <hr align="left" width="25%">
    <p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Q&amp;A</b></font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">I remember in the Nikaya or Agamma, Buddha
    always taught his students to be their own uniba, it means an
    island. Even when he was dying, the last lesson he gave his
    students was: be your own island. I think this bears very
    direct similarity to what you told us. We always have to
    learn form ourselves.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Yes and also
    and I said, from life. So it means that when we live, if you
    are really sensitive and open, and if you are really
    practising the teaching, then as I said, you learn how to
    relate to everything, what happens to you in life, what
    happens in relation to others, to the teaching. So as I said
    these experiences we have in life, they are used for our
    spiritual growth. There's a teacher who said that compost.
    Compost have things which are not considered useful,
    considered as dirty which we throw away. So all these things,
    if we can collect them, they can be used for the growth of
    vegetables and fruits. So I would say that what we learn from
    life, our mistakes can be seen as compost, that they can be
    used for our own spiritual growth. It's only then, as it was
    said, that we can be an island to oneself, that you can be
    self-reliant on oneself but what is important is if you have
    the conclusion that you know everything, that is the end of
    learning. So it is very important to have this &quot;<i>don't
    know</i>&quot; mind whereby we can learn from anything and we
    can learn from anyone. This is something very very important
    in the Buddha's teaching. Any other questions?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">How can we be our own toy and be satisfied
    with ourselves, how can we be our good friends?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>It is
    interesting that for different reasons, we become our own
    enemies. And then we think that the enemy is outside
    ourselves. So we are trying to find the enemy outside
    ourselves without realizing the biggest enemy is inside
    ourselves. One aspect of being your enemy is as I said,
    seeing only your mistake, seeing only your shortcomings,
    seeing only your minuses. This can be a very very
    self-destructive aspect where you are your own enemy.</p>
    <p>Another aspect related to this point is that you don't see
    the positive side in you, you don't see the good things that
    you have been doing. I meet many good people and they are
    following the spiritual path, but because of this tendency to
    be self-destructive, they don't see their own worthiness,
    they don't see their value, they refuse to see the Buddha
    nature in them. So when you realize this, when you know this,
    that you are your own enemy, then you learn to work on this
    condition, on this situation. This is the importance of
    awareness which we discussed yesterday. So with awareness,
    you catch yourself, you realize what you are doing to
    yourself, that you are your own enemy.</p>
    <p>And another aspect is this very beautiful meditation of
    loving kindness. I emphasize this meditation very much. On
    Friday, I think I will be talking about meditation on loving
    kindness and it is psychologically very interesting. This
    meditation of loving kindness begins with oneself. So it
    shows that we cannot be friendly to others unless we are
    friendly to ourselves. So meditation on loving kindness helps
    us to be our own best friend, it helps us to make a
    connection with ourselves.</p>
    <p>Another aspect of meditation on loving kindness is it
    helps us to forgive ourselves. As I said earlier, accept our
    humanness and when we learn to accept our humanness, then we
    learn to accept the humanness of others. So then it helps to
    be friendly with ourselves and friendly to others.</p>
    <p>Another aspect of being your best friend is that we don't
    realize how we affect our own body in a unwholesome,
    unskilful way with our behaviour. So when you make this
    connection with yourself, there is a change that takes place,
    a transformation takes place so that whatever you do, your
    words, your thoughts, will be always be related to the
    skilful, the wholesome way, which should be helping you in
    your spiritual path. I'll be speaking more about this on the
    day I will be speaking on loving kindness and on that day, we
    will be distributing a very very important little booklet on
    the practice of loving kindness. Any other question?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">You warned us of the dangers of consumerism
    and materialism, obviously there is certain renunciation to
    those things. Could you give us some advice on how to begin
    the renunciation so it's not all at once and such an
    overpowering obstacle?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>As I said,
    these are one of the greatest challenges we have: how to live
    in a materialist society where there is consumerism and still
    not be affected by them. So I'll try to offer some practical
    suggestions. So one suggestion that I would like to offer is
    that when you see things which you think you need them, again
    this is the importance of awareness, to catch yourself and to
    ask the question: do I really need it? And ask the very
    profound question: Why do I need this? When this obsession
    comes to possess something, we never ask the question: do I
    really need it? Why am I needing it? So when you are living
    in a consumer society and when you raise this question, you
    realize that it is because others are using them, and because
    others are using them, you want to be like them. So without
    your knowledge, you get caught in what is called the rat
    race. So your whole life becomes a competition, to compete
    with others.</p>
    <p>Another practical suggestion I like to offer is learning
    to say &quot;<i>yes</i>&quot; to some things and learning to
    say &quot;<i>no</i>&quot; to certain things. What happens to
    us is that due to different reasons, we have been used to
    pampering ourselves. Pampering is always saying yes to
    whatever, the body or the mind. So what is important in the
    practice is again finding out that you're pampering yourself
    and then to say no in a very gentle friendly way. So it is
    very important in life, learning to say no to certain things.
    This is the only way to work on some other things that we
    have become dependent on.</p>
    <p>The third suggestion I like to offer is, in a way, an
    indirect one. So with more and more practice, as I said, when
    you learn to be your best friend, when you have made a
    connection with yourself, then naturally you don't have to
    make an effort. You can live in a consumer society but then
    you are not affected by the environment. In this connection,
    there is a beautiful Buddhist symbol. The Buddhist symbol is
    being like a lotus. Where does the lotus grow? In muddy
    water. Now the lotus flower is able to grow in that muddy
    water without being affected by the muddy water around it. So
    this is the importance of the Buddha's teaching, that when
    you live within society, within the environment, you will be
    able to steady your way and not be affected by what is
    happening externally because a shift has been taking place
    inside you.</p>
    <p>I think there is time for one more question.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">I always feel bored when I'm alone. Can you
    tell us your actual experience on how you enjoy your life
    alone?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>To give a
    brief answer, when we are alone, when we feel lonely, when we
    feel bored, so what we do is, when these states of mind would
    arise, we give in to them, we try to change that by doing
    something. So the simple answer is hereafter when you have
    loneliness, when you have boredom, don't escape from them, go
    through the loneliness, go through the boredom. Yesterday I
    said a very important aspect of meditation is learning to go
    through unpleasant experiences, whether it is physical or
    mental. So in the beginning, it will be very unpleasant but
    then, this is the importance of the practice. So you have to
    go through the unpleasant experience and then, when you go
    through that, then from loneliness you experience what is
    aloneness which is entirely different from loneliness,
    thereby we learn to enjoy our own company.</p>
    <p>So thank you very much for asking very useful practical
    questions. So now let us take a small break. So today the
    break I would like to suggest, to reflect. Reflection can be
    a very important part of meditation. So the reflection I
    would like to suggest is to reflect on the things that we
    have discussed today. And in that reflection, to see what was
    discussed, how it can be relevant, how can it relate to
    yourself. So I like to suggest that during the break, to use
    reflection in this way. And then after that, after some time,
    I will ring the bell, and when you can come back, I will
    present a very important meditation today. So you can do this
    reflection whilst seated or even when walking, whichever you
    prefer, you can just start the reflection.</p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#800000">[Break]</font></p>
    <p>Please sit in a comfortable position because it is very
    important that in meditation not to move when we are
    meditating. Please have your spine erect but relaxed.</p>
    <p>Please allow the mind to do what it likes. If thoughts are
    arising, let any thoughts arise, thoughts about the past,
    thoughts about the future.</p>
    <p>So let us learn to make friends with thoughts and just
    know from moment to moment what thoughts are arising in your
    mind. So it is very important to be alert and to be awake
    from moment to moment.</p>
    <p>Now can you allow any emotion to arise, especially
    emotions we don't like, that we push away, that we repress,
    that we control. Can we allow such emotions to arise? If they
    are arising, can we just allow them?</p>
    <p>If you are having any such unpleasant experience, can we
    learn to make friends with them, can we learn to relate to
    them without a minus?</p>
    <p>And if there are no unpleasant emotions, just to know
    there are no unpleasant emotions.</p>
    <p>So thoughts, emotions, sensations, learning to see them
    just as they are, like a mirror-like mind. No plus, no minus,
    just being with whatever is happening. Be alert and awake.</p>
    <p>Learning to feel friendly towards our thoughts, learning
    to feel friendly towards our emotions, learning to be
    friendly towards our sensations whatever the sensation is.</p>
    <p>Now please open your eyes slowly and when you change the
    posture, please do it with awareness. And please do not think
    the meditation is over.</p>
    <p>Let us now do some chanting. It is very nice that a group
    of spiritual friends can chant together, so please everyone
    just join the chanting.</p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#800000">[Chanting]</font></p>
