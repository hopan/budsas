  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin:</b></font></p>
  <p>I like to welcome you to this one day meditation. I like to offer some suggestions
  about the practice today.</p>
  <p><font color="#000080"><b>Feeling Happy</b></font></p>
  <p>The first suggestion I like to offer is that every one of you should feel happy that
  you are able to come here. Today is a holiday and after working very hard for some days,
  the fact that you have decided to come, you should really feel happy about yourself.
  Usually we feel bad about ourselves but it is also very important to feel good about
  ourselves. So I like to emphasize this point, just to feel good about yourself that you
  are able to come here for meditation.</p>
  <p><font color="#000080"><b>Feeling Grateful</b></font></p>
  <p>The next suggestion is try to feel grateful that you are able to come. I know some who
  want to come today but for different reasons they are unable to come. You should feel
  grateful that you are able to come and that you are here, present.</p>
  <p><font color="#000080"><b>Quality of &quot;Just Knowing&quot;</b></font></p>
  <p>As I have been saying, in meditation a very very important aspect is the practice of
  awareness, mindfulness, just knowing what is happening. So in this one day meditation, we
  will try to develop this very important quality of just knowing whatever is happening in
  our mind and body from moment to moment as far as we can. And even if it is unpleasant
  experience, even if it is something you consider strange, just to know that it is
  happening rather than be worried: Am I doing it rightly? Is it normal to experience these
  things? It is not necessary to have such thoughts but just knowing that this is what I am
  feeling, this is the sensation I am experiencing.</p>
  <p><font color="#000080"><b>Loving Kindness</b></font></p>
  <p>Another important aspect related to this is to be mindful, to be aware with loving
  kindness, just knowing what is happening with friendliness. It can be like a mother who is
  just watching, observing her only child with friendliness. So let us learn today to watch,
  to observe, to find out, just to know what is happening in our mind and body like a mother
  watching her only child, with friendliness, with gentleness, with openness.</p>
  <p><font color="#000080"><b>Learn to Slow Down</b></font></p>
  <p>Related to mindfulness is another suggestion I like to offer, is let us learn to slow
  down today. I know in Hong Kong you have to move very fast because the speed here is very
  fast. Today we will make it a point to learn to relax and just to do things very slowly.
  Slowly and also in a very relaxed way.</p>
  <p><font color="#000080"><b>Practice of Silence</b></font></p>
  <p>Another suggestion I like to offer is the practice of silence. I know it is very
  difficult for some people to be silent because it is a very very strong habit that we
  have. So today let us make an effort just to be silent with ourselves and you will see a
  connection between awareness, mindfulness, and silence. The more aware you are, the more
  silent you become and the more silent you become, mindfulness will come naturally. You'll
  enjoy the space that silence creates in your mind.</p>
  <p><font color="#000080"><b>Learn to Be Alone with Ourselves</b></font></p>
  <p>Another aspect of silence is learning to be alone with ourselves. So today, please try
  to be silent and just being alone with yourselves. As I said in one occasion in one of the
  talks, we have become so dependent on external things, so today we will try just to be
  friendly and to see whether we can be in our own company and enjoy our own company.
  Learning to be our best friend. So it is very very important to make this connection with
  ourselves where we see ourselves as our best friend, the most precious friend we have, we
  try to make a connection with oneself.</p>
  <p><font color="#000080"><b>Develop Self-confidence</b></font></p>
  <p>So today there will be some group discussions. So any problems, any difficulties you
  have, we can discuss the problems or difficulties you may be experiencing but still it is
  very very important in meditation to be self reliant, to have our own methods. The Buddha
  said self-effort is the best effort and being self-reliant. Another very important
  suggestion I like to offer is that we will try to develop self-confidence today. To have
  self-confidence that you can handle whatever is arising in your mind and body. In
  meditation, this is very very important, to have this self-reliance, to have this
  self-confidence, just to know what is happening in the mind and the body and then learning
  from them, being open to them. So today we will try to be like children, trying to learn,
  making discoveries about what is happening in our mind and body. It is very very important
  to have this childlike quality and learning, finding out, being curious about what are
  happening in our mind and body, which are something we take for granted. So see meditation
  as a voyage of self discovery and if you can have this openness, then we can learn from
  any experience we are having today. As I said, it can be pleasant, it can be unpleasant
  but learning to ask the questions: What I can learn from this? What does it show to me?
  And so this kind of attitude to meditation is very very important.</p>
  <p><font color="#000080"><b>Don&#146;t Expect to Achieve Something Special</b></font></p>
  <p>One last suggestion is: please do not have much expectation that you are going to
  achieve something very special. Meditation is nothing special. It's just being open to
  ordinary things. It's nothing extraordinary. Please remember that. Please realize that.
  This is something beautiful about meditation. So it is not results that we are going to
  achieve but the practice itself, that is the result, knowing what is happening is the
  result, not what comes after. Please remember this. Maybe in this culture there is lots of
  emphasis on being goal oriented, of achieving result. So in meditation, the result is the
  practice. This is what is very very interesting about the meditation. So the result is
  just being open, knowing what is happening from moment to moment. So you are experiencing
  every moment.</p>
  <p>These are some very practical suggestions I like to offer you for today. So as you can
  see from the program, there is yoga, there is walking meditation, there is standing
  meditation, there is group discussion, chanting, there will be so many things happening
  today. So let see everything as part of the practice. Even when we have lunch, let us
  learn to make it part of the practice. I will tell you how to eat our lunch with a
  meditative mind.</p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Sitting Meditation</b></font></p>
  <p>Let us now do our sitting meditation. So those who like to stand and move your body
  before the sitting, you are free to do that.</p>
  <p>Now please sit in a comfortable position </p>
  <p>Now please close your eyes and please spend some time just learning to relax yourself,
  just to relax your body. Just to feel comfortable with yourself.</p>
  <p>Now please spend some time feeling happy you are meditating now. Feeling good about
  what you are trying to learn.</p>
  <p>Now what you are going to do in the present meditation is something very very simple.
  So until you hear the bell, just know from moment to moment what you are hearing, the
  thoughts that you are having, the sensations you are experiencing in the body. So it is
  something very simple that everyone can do. What is important is to be alert, to be awake,
  to be present, to be alive from moment to moment.</p>
  <p>If anyone becomes sleepy and drowsy, please open your eyes.</p>
  <p>We hear sounds, we have thoughts, we experience sensations, we may be having emotions,
  just knowing from moment to moment all these things that are happening. Making friends
  with them, learning to say O.K to them.</p>
  <p>If you are having any unpleasant sensations in the body, just be open to them, make
  friends with them, just to be aware of them.</p>
  <p>It's like learning to say O.K to the noises that you are hearing.</p>
  <p>Do you know each thought that arises and passes away in your mind ? </p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#800000">(Bell)</font></p>
  <p>Please open your eyes and when you change your posture, just know you are doing that
  and feel the different sensations in the body. So please continue to know what is
  happening in your mind and body from moment to moment.</p>
  <p>One can meditate in four postures, sitting, standing, walking, lying down. So today we
  will be trying to practise in three postures, sitting, standing, walking.</p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Standing Meditation</b></font></p>
  <p>Now let us do some standing meditation for some time. Please stand slowly, knowing that
  you are going to stand and observing the intention to stand. Now just feel what it is to
  stand. Feel the different sensations, the different movements in your body. If you are
  experiencing any unpleasant sensations, painful sensations in the body just to know them
  and just to be open to them, just to say OK to them. And if you are experiencing any
  pleasant sensations in the body, just to know that you are having pleasant sensations.</p>
  <p>Try to feel every part of your body, the different sensations, the different movements
  in your body. And learn to feel friendly, gentle and kind to your body. And when thoughts
  come, learn to let go of them and come back to the body. So please use your body to
  experience the present moment, the here and the now.</p>
  <p>Please learn to feel the body rather than think about the body, please see the
  difference.</p>
  <p>And just feel what it is to stand completely still.</p>
  <p>Learn to gently let go of the thought and come back to your body. To be in the present
  with the help of your body, the feelings, the sensations, the different movements.</p>
  <p>Finding the sensations and the feelings in the body more interesting than your
  thoughts.</p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#800000">(Bell)</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Walking Meditation</b></font></p>
  <p>Now we will be doing some walking meditation. So the idea of walking meditation is
  again, conscious walking. So you can walk slowly and just being mindful of your walking.
  So when you walk, you have to feel the different sensations in the body while you are
  walking. The thoughts will come but please learn to let go of the thoughts and come back
  to the present, that is walking. So now we have to organize how we can do walking
  meditation. I would suggest that we can do it in two groups. One group can walk on the
  stage and the other group can walk here. So the two groups can get into two circles
  following one after the other. And while you are walking I will try to offer some
  suggestions about the practice.</p>
  <p>Whatever you are doing, please do it slowly, consciously with mindfulness. </p>
  <p>So please walk slowly, consciously. Feeling the sensations in your feet. Using walking
  to experience the present moment.</p>
  <p>Please have your hands in front, folded.</p>
  <p>Please walk slowly so that you can be conscious of all the movements, the sensations in
  your body when you are walking. So let go of your thoughts and come back to the present
  with the help of walking. Just walking in a very relaxed way.</p>
  <p>Learning to enjoy the simple act of walking.</p>
  <p>Please look at the feet of the person in front.</p>
  <p>Please look at the feet of the person in front without looking everywhere.</p>
  <p>When you are lifting your feet you know that you are lifting your feet.</p>
  <p>Just feel the earth with your feet.</p>
  <p>Learning to relax with your walking.</p>
  <p>Learning to walk consciously.</p>
  <p>Can you walk as if you are walking on lotus flowers, gently, tenderly.</p>
  <p>Being conscious of each step.</p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#800000">(Bell)</font></p>
  <p>Now please stand wherever you are.</p>
  <p>Now please stand completely still with your eyes closed.</p>
  <p>You can use the sound to experience the present moment.</p>
  <p>Just being in the present with the help of hearing.</p>
  <p>Can we hear the sounds very sharply, very clearly as if for the first time?</p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#800000">(Bell)</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Yoga</b></font></p>
  <p>Now it's time for yoga. So I like to mention a few points about the connection between
  meditation and yoga. One thing is when you do yoga, you learn to be aware, mindful of your
  body, you learn to relax your body, you learn to be friendly and kind towards the body,
  you learn to use yoga exercises to experience the present moment. These are some aspects
  of yoga in connection with meditation. If there is anyone who will not be doing yoga,
  please refrain from speaking. You can do some walking meditation in some place you like
  to. You can sit on a chair or somewhere calmly just observing your mind, what is happening
  in your mind from moment to moment. So please make use of this opportunity for those who
  are not doing yoga. Now the yoga Master will take over. Thank you.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin:</b></font></p>
  <p>During meditation please don't walk out of this room.</p>
  <p>So I like you to continue to be aware of your body. You can close your eyes and just
  feel the different sensations, the different movements in your body.</p>
  <p>Learning to feel the body, learning to feel friendly towards the body.</p>
  <p>Feel grateful that you have this body and that we can use the body for our practice.</p>
  <p>Now just feel what it is to sit in this posture.</p>
  <p>Can you feel relaxed with this posture?</p>
  <p>If you can relax your body, you can relax your mind.</p>
  <p>Feeling relaxed is not resisting anything in the body and in the mind.</p>
  <p>Let us now spend some time with our breath. So please allow your body to breath
  naturally.</p>
  <p>Let the body breath the way the body likes to breath.</p>
  <p>When the body is exhaling you know that the body is exhaling. When the body is inhaling
  you know that the body is inhaling.</p>
  <p>Having your complete and full attention on the in breath and the out breath.</p>
  <p>It is natural that you will have thoughts. Know that you are having thoughts. Don't
  resist them, don't dislike them, but pay more and more attention on the in breath and the
  out breath.</p>
  <p>If you are having any unpleasant sensations in the body, please learn to be mindful of
  them, to be aware of them, learning to make friends with them, learning to say OK to
  unpleasant sensations.</p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#800000">(Chanting) - (Bell)</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080"><b>Eating as a Meditation</b></font></p>
  <p>In a few minutes we will be eating our lunch. So I like to tell you how eating can be a
  meditation. Here again, we will make an effort to eat mindfully, to eat consciously, to
  eat in the present as far as possible when you are eating. And please make a conscious
  effort to chew your food. So slowly, consciously chewing your food. And when you are
  eating, observe the likes and the dislikes you might have in your mind. Just to know the
  likes and dislikes when they arise. And when there are no likes and dislikes also to know
  that there are no likes, no dislikes. All this can be discovered and learned only if you
  can eat in silence.</p>
  <p>It is also important to learn to avoid the two extremes. Avoid eating too much and for
  eating too little. For meditation it is very important to know the right quantity of food.
  And you can only learn the right quantity of food if you can listen to the body while you
  are eating.</p>
  <p>Now when you turn, don't try to turn very quickly but slowly. Be aware of all the
  movements in your standing. Observing the intention to stand. And please do conscious
  walking from here to the place you are going to eat. So please walk slowly and in complete
  silence.</p>
  <p>We'll be meeting again after one hour for group discussions. So thank you very much.</p>
  <p>So you can patiently wait for the lunch to arrive. So this can be also a very important
  practice.</p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#800000">(Lunch)</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Open Discussion</b></font></p>
  <p>What I would like to discuss with you is what actually happen when you are meditating
  and doing walking meditation, doing yoga and so on. Just to share your experience and ask
  questions in relation to your experience while you were meditating this morning.</p>
  <p>So can I ask are there any problems, questions about sitting meditation? In the morning
  I said just sit and just try to know what is happening in your mind and body. So any
  questions, any difficulties about this?</p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Question: </b></font><font color="#7F0000">When I meditate my
  head kind of vibrates and my body also moves, and the intention is to incline forward or
  to the left and at times to the right. I like to know if there is any problem with that,
  any side effects with that.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Actually I like to meet you individually. I
  saw what has happened to your body so I like to meet you individually and talk to you
  about more aspects, more details about what is happening.</p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Question: </b></font><font color="#7F0000">I want to know if
  there is any &quot;should be&quot; or &quot;should not be&quot; when we meditate. For
  example, when I'm doing the sitting meditation, I can't stop thinking. It seems that when
  I'm doing the walking meditation, the situation is better but when I'm sitting, when
  thinking comes out, I have a conflict whether to stop it or just allow it.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>I'm happy you have raised that
  question because it is a very very common problem. It is not possible to stop thinking.
  The more we try to stop thinking, the more thoughts we have. That is why when I gave the
  guided meditation, I said: it is natural that thoughts will arise. So in the first
  meditation we did, what we are trying to do is also to be aware, to be mindful of the
  thoughts themselves. Thoughts, sounds, sensations whatever there is in the mind and the
  body. So in that meditation if you have thoughts, there is no need to have a conflict.</p>
  <p>And in the second meditation we did, in which we were trying to be aware of our breath,
  when thoughts come, we should be aware, mindful that thoughts are coming, to make friends
  with them, not to have a conflict and then come back to the breath. But then we can be
  aware of the breath for a few minutes, then again thoughts will come. This is the nature
  of the mind that we don't have any control. So meditation is understanding how our minds
  work, making friends with our mind and whatever is happening, and training to slowly,
  gently coming back to the breath. So it is very very important, even when we are not
  sitting, to continue to be aware and mindful of the thoughts that we are having. So even
  while sitting, while eating, we are having thoughts. So whatever we are doing, it's a very
  good practice to be conscious of our thoughts, not only when we are meditating. And we can
  learn a great deal about our thoughts by just watching, just knowing: What are the
  thoughts that I'm having? So most thoughts are either about ourselves and about others.
  And sometimes the thoughts are negative about yourself, negative about others, so it's
  just to know how we are having negative thoughts about ourselves and others and how when
  have negative thoughts, what emotions are created. So these are very important insights to
  develop by watching thoughts. Do we have thoughts more about the past? Do we have more
  thoughts about the future? Why do I have more thoughts about the past? What happens when I
  think about the future? Do I have anxiety? So this is why we have to find out, learn about
  the thoughts and how the thoughts can create emotions and how they can create suffering.
  This is a very very important aspect of the practice. So it is not only stopping thoughts
  but understanding, learning, discovering about them.</p>
  <p>So any other questions? Any other difficulties?</p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Question: </b></font><font color="#7F0000">While I meditate, I
  had lots of thoughts and some are so obvious you don't need to observe them but some are
  delicate minor ones. Is it necessary to observe these thoughts?</font></p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>We should try to observe every thought. On
  one occasion when I gave a guided meditation, I said, &#145;Can you be conscious of every
  thought that arises in your mind?&#146; And it is very important to learn to observe
  thoughts without judging them: this is delicate, this is not delicate, this is good, this
  is bad. Without judging, without giving pluses and minuses. Can we just observe the
  thoughts as they arise and as they pass away?</p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Question: </b></font><font color="#7F0000">I am able to get
  more aware when doing standing meditation as well as the walking meditation rather than
  the sitting meditation and I want to know how we can actually apply what we have learned
  in the meditation practices in our daily life.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>I'll be giving a talk in the evening about
  this very very important theme. It is very very important to integrate meditation with
  daily life. So I'll be talking about this later on.</p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Question: </b></font><font color="#7F0000">I've been
  meditating for over a year and I have lots of problems like my body moving, left ankle
  hurts and after meditating for a while when I try to get up, I have difficulties but after
  I walked for a while, it is O.K. Now my left shoulder hurts. So I'm having all these
  problems. I want to know if I'm doing the meditation in the right way.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>I don't see them as problems. In the
  morning I tried to make it very clear that meditation is just knowing whatever is
  happening in our mind and body without being concerned: &#145;Am I doing it right? Am I
  doing it wrong? Is it very strange that this should happen?&#146; I repeated a few times:
  &#145;Just to know what is happening and can you say O.K to whatever is happening
  specially if it is unpleasant.&#146; Anyway I like to repeat that it is extremely
  important to learn to work with unpleasant sensations in whatever forms they arise in the
  body. Just by knowing them and learning to make friends with them, not to see them as
  problems, but that is the practice because while meditating if you learn to handle these
  unpleasant sensations that arise, then in everyday life when they arise, we know how to
  handle them. So it is very very helpful that these unpleasant sensations arise when you
  are meditating.</p>
  <p>So there is time for one last question.</p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Question: </b></font><font color="#7F0000">Whilst doing the
  standing meditation, my body had a kind of movement. I want to know what was happening.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>As I said a few minutes ago, just know that
  the body is moving.</p>
  <p>Now I like to meet another group. Thank you very much. Thank you for asking the
  questions. Thank you very much.</p>
  <p>Now as I said please continue to observe the thoughts. This group that I spoke to when
  they are walking, so please continue to have mindfulness of whatever is happening in our
  mind and body. </p>
  <p>So I like to know what actually happened when you were meditating in the morning.</p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Question: </b></font><font color="#7F0000">I was thinking
  about anxiety. I had anxiety for some time but when I try to call it and to look at it, it
  doesn't come or not in such a strong form as I used to suffer from. That is the first
  question. And the second question is that if one has anxiety over some problems and he
  cannot recall the anxiety when facing the problem, then when the problem crops up, there
  is no time to practise, to have enough experience to face the problem and examine the
  anxiety and to get rid of it and to face the problems squarely.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>So my answer to the first question: Is
  there can be a problem because you wanted anxiety to come and it didn't come? So what's
  the problem? Isn't it interesting when we have anxiety it's a problem and even when you
  don't have anxiety it's a problem?</p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Question: </b></font><font color="#7F0000">My question is when
  we have some problems, anxiety for example and it occurs from time to time, we want to get
  experience how to handle it. And when you want experience to practise on it, it doesn't
  occur as it occurred before so there's no preparation, experience to solve the problem.</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>I think you were present when I presented
  the tools on how to work with emotions. So I like you to go back home and I saw you making
  notes, so please go over the notes and then find out for yourself, experiment with the
  tools and see how you can work with anxiety. Anyway, just a brief comment on how to work
  with these emotions when they come, because I know some of you were not present when I
  presented these tools on how to work with emotions.</p>
  <p>So one thing that we learned today is, whether it is anxiety, whether it is fear,
  whether it is anger, whether it is physical pain, just learning to know that these things
  are there. And as I suggested in relation to physical pain, learning to say O.K to these
  anxiety or fear. Learning to feel friendly towards these unpleasant emotions can help us
  to work with them. So this is one of the tools that I presented and if those who are
  interested in the other tools I presented, maybe you can get a copy of the talk that I
  gave on emotions and how to work with them.</p>
  <p>I like to know from this group what happened when you were doing yoga.</p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Question: </b></font><font color="#7F0000">I want to talk
  about a personal experience of mine. Once I read some sutta, I went to meditate for about
  10 minutes. What happened was that there were lights flashing in my eyes. It was golden
  light. Whether I opened my eyes or closed my eyes, the light still flashed for more than
  half an hour. So I was a bit scared of this phenomenon that arose. I did not know whether
  this phenomenon was normal or abnormal and I would like to know how to handle this
  phenomenon.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Seeing vision, seeing such things are
  different phases in the practice. Sometimes these visions, these pictures you see are very
  pleasant, sometimes they are very unpleasant. So as I was saying very often today, whether
  it is pleasant or unpleasant, just know that you are seeing lights, you are having this
  experience without thinking: &#145;Is it abnormal? Is it normal?&#146; If you react in
  that way, you are getting involved with what is happening. So what you need to do is not
  to get involved but just to know and I was saying, just to say O.K and then after some
  time, the feeling of lights or whatever will stop.</p>
  <p>The question I raised for this group is yoga. Please I like to hear your experience
  about yoga.</p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Question</b></font>: <font color="#7F0000">I found some
  postures are difficult but that didn't really matter because I have done it before. But
  when I did yoga this morning, I found that there was not enough space for everybody, there
  were too many people in this hall and I realized anger arose in my mind. For example when
  the person next to me stretched his leg too far, I would say to myself, &#145;Why does he
  have to stretch so far?&#146;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>This is why this morning I said that today
  we have to be open to learn from whatever happened to you. Learning to see everything as
  part of the practice. So whether you get angry, whether you get annoyed, when you are
  reacting, just to observe that and see how you are creating suffering for yourself by what
  others are doing. So in that situation the anger is the object of meditation. So then you
  learn to make that the object of meditation and see how far you can let go of that anger.
  And as I was also saying earlier, these are unpleasant experiences we have physically,
  mentally and not only when we are doing yoga, in other situations as well. So just knowing
  them and making friends with them is a very important aspect of the practice. So if you
  can practise in this way, anything can be a learning experience, anything can be a
  meditation. So if you can have that openness, then without getting angry with your
  neighbour, you feel grateful for this person because he or she is giving you an
  opportunity to work with anger. The person who is annoying you, irritating you becomes
  your teacher at that time. It is a beautiful way to live. When I give my talk I will speak
  about this aspect.</p>
  <p>Anything else? Maybe one other comment about yoga. Another experience about yoga? The
  yoga Master is also here.</p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Question: </b></font><font color="#7F0000">Whether our
  practice is yoga or breathing, I would like to know when we focus our mind, do we focus on
  breathing from the lung or breathing from the abdomen.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>I said allow the body to breath naturally.
  So if you try to breath with some part of your body, that is not allowing the body to
  breath naturally. So it is very very important to learn to allow the body to breath
  naturally. Then when the body is breathing naturally, you're just being conscious of the
  breathing, that is all. It is like when we are doing walking meditation, we just allow the
  body to walk and we are just being aware of walking. We don't try to walk in a different
  way. So in meditation it is very very important to learn to be natural, not to interfere
  with the natural process of what is happening when we are meditating whether it is
  walking, breathing or whatever.</p>
  <p>Anything else, any other questions?</p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Question: </b></font><font color="#7F0000">About 7 or 8 years
  ago I had minor pains in one particular side of my lung. This pain has already gone but
  this week I came here to meditate and last night I realized that this pain returned and
  this morning I also realized that this pain was there. I would like to know why this pain
  arose, whether I used the wrong method or posture.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>I feel that when you are meditating,
  perhaps you are trying too hard and maybe you are trying to breath in a different way so
  that when one tries to breath in an unusual different way, it may be a strain on the lung.
  So it is very important when we are meditating, to learn to meditate in a very relaxed
  way, not to try too hard. If you try too hard it can be a strain on the body and also the
  mind. So in next meditation please try to sit in a very relaxed way and don't make it a
  strain to any part of the body. Anyway if the pain comes again, stop focusing on breathing
  and send thoughts of loving kindness, friendliness, gentleness to the lung.</p>
  <p>Anything else?</p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Question: </b></font><font color="#7F0000">While we are
  practising sitting meditation or walking meditation, we can train our consciousness and
  mindfulness but how can we do that in our daily life.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>This evening I'll be giving a talk about
  meditation in everyday life. I think the same question was asked a few minutes ago.</p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font color="#7F0000">I
  would like to relate to the experience of the lady who raised it earlier about the pain in
  the lung. I also experienced a similar kind of pain this week but according to my own
  experience, I tolerated the pain for a few days and today I do not have the pain anymore,
  so I think that this could be just an old wound and nothing to do with the meditation
  itself.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Thank you very much for sharing that with
  us. It brings up a very very important point, that when we have unpleasant experiences, to
  go through the unpleasant experiences, to be open to them and then they may drop away on
  their own. It's a very valuable experience you have shared, thank you very much.</p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Question: </b></font><font color="#7F0000">When I practise
  sitting meditation, my body moves to all four directions, front and back, left and right.
  I asked others what to do and they advised me not to pay attention to the movements so I
  just continued sitting with the movements. I do not know whether this is right or wrong.
  That is the first question. And the second question is when I sit, my back is not
  straight. When I try to make my spine erect, the movements intensify and I do not know
  what I should do in that situation.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>When the body starts moving, as I have been
  saying, just to know that the body is moving. And I like to suggest you can also try to
  control the movements, see whether you can stop that movement on your own. As I said
  earlier, these are passing stages in the practice. If you see this as problems, you get
  stuck with this. So to get into the next stage, as it was said earlier by that meditator,
  we should learn to say O.K to it, we should learn to feel friendly with those things
  rather than have the question: &quot;Is it right? Is it wrong? Is it normal? Is it
  abnormal?&quot; By doing that we are getting involved and we get stuck. So this is one of
  the suggestions I like to make.</p>
  <p>And about having your spine erect, it's nice to try to have your spine erect but it
  should be very relaxed, not artificial, it's not tense. So try to find a posture where you
  feel relaxed and natural with that posture rather than experience tension and discomfort
  with your posture. So you need to experiment, explore the sitting posture more and more.</p>
  <p>So thank you very much and can I meet the last group now please.</p>
  <p>I like to know from this group what happened when you were eating your lunch, silently
  and with awareness. What further discoveries did you make.</p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Question: </b></font><font color="#7F0000">While I was having
  lunch, being mindful and keeping silent, I found lunch tasted specially good and I was
  very grateful to the people who prepared the food because I did not know we have lunch
  provided here so I didn't need to go out and buy my lunch. So that is the first thing. And
  I want to share some of my own experience in meditation. I haven't been meditating for too
  long but from my experience, different parts of the body ached when I started meditating,
  and also we may be in different stages but we try not to hang onto whatever comes,
  otherwise we will get stuck. As for the movements in the body, my own experience is that,
  having practised meditation for a while if you want your body to move to the left, it
  moves to the left and likewise, if you want it to move to the right, it moves to the
  right. So if you want to stop the movement, you can just tell your body to stop the
  movement by practising.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Thank you very much for both points that
  you have made. The first point is very interesting that when we eat with mindfulness, we
  can taste the food. Eating becomes such a special experience. Otherwise we eat like
  machines, not even knowing what is happening when we are eating. So I am very happy that
  you mentioned that and it's also nice that you mentioned that you felt gratitude,
  grateful. This is a very important quality that we need to develop. In fact in traditional
  Buddhist countries, before we eat, we spend some time feeling grateful for those who have
  prepared the food and who have been responsible for the food. So I would like to suggest
  to everyone here to spend even a few minutes, few seconds before you start to eat feeling
  grateful for those who are responsible, feeling grateful that you are able to eat.</p>
  <p>About the second point is exactly what I meant when I said that we should also control
  this phenomenon of movements. So it's a very good connection to make with your body. To
  give it very friendly, gentle orders: Now please stop moving. Sometimes when you gave such
  orders the body might respond to it. So I would suggest sometimes we can allow the body to
  do that and just be aware of it, feel friendly with that and sometimes to tell the body:
  Now you've had enough, so please stop. The body might respond but for that to happen, you
  should have a very good connection, sensitivity with the body. Thank you very much for
  those two points.</p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Question: </b></font><font color="#7F0000">I want to thank you
  for the different practices and meditation during this week. In the past I have used
  similar techniques to deal with emotions and unpleasant experiences and when I did that I
  felt pleasant. But what I want to know is that you also mentioned in your talk that we
  should learn from our unpleasant emotions and making them a learning experience. I want to
  know how do we know what we learnt from the unpleasant experience is right or wrong.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Very simple answer. Without resisting if
  you can say O.K and make friends with it, that's it. Put it in other words, in Buddhist
  terms, when we have unpleasant emotions, the normal tendency is to suffer as a result of
  it but here, by making them as learning experiences, we learn not to suffer and see them
  as our teachers and feeling grateful for them because if they do not arise, how can we
  learn to work with them.</p>
  <p>Anything else?</p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Question: </b></font><font color="#7F0000">This is the first
  time I've done meditation and sometimes my feet become numb. When that happens should I
  terminate the meditation immediately or should I continue to meditate? When I meditate I
  use the traditional method of having my legs crossed but you mentioned that the posture
  should be natural. That is the first question. The second question is: how do I know how
  long should I meditate for? How long is enough?</font></p>
  <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Godwin: </b></font>About the first question, when you feel
  numb in the body, again as I said earlier many times, just to feel that it is numb and
  learning to say O.K to it. And if it becomes unbearable, you can just change the posture.
  In a way the problem is not with the numbness but how we relate to it, how we react to the
  numbness is the problem. So again we should be grateful for the numbness because we learn
  when the numbness is there, learning how not to react to the numbness even when the
  numbness is there. So this is why I mean that all these unpleasant experiences are really
  valuable teachers for us because if you do not feel numb you do not know how to handle it,
  how to work with it.</p>
  <p>About the second question, actually meditation has to be a way of life. This is what I
  will be trying to tell you in the talk, that there is no beginning meditation and stopping
  meditation. Meditation should not be confined to a particular posture, a particular time
  because from the time that we wake up to the time we go to sleep, our mind is moving, we
  are having thoughts, we are having states of mind. So ideally we should have this constant
  awareness, constant alertness, constant checking out what is happening in our mind
  throughout the day. Then as I said, meditation becomes a way of life. Life and meditation
  are not two things, they are just one.</p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Question: </b></font><font color="#7F0000">You mentioned that
  we should learn to call upon some of our unpleasant emotions and to make friends with them
  and learn from them. I tried that during the meditation and I focused on anger. So I
  thought of a person I hate very much and tried to get that angry feeling but I found that
  that anger did not come. Can we apply this in real life? If I keep on meditating, will I
  be able to apply this in life and in turn later on, I will hate this person less?</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Thank you very much for sharing that
  experience. This is one of the tools I presented when I spoke about emotions. It is
  extremely interesting that these unpleasant emotions that we don't like, when we invite
  them, they don't come and when we don't want them to come, they come. So this shows the
  importance of openness, and then with more and more openness and waiting for these
  emotions to come, they don't come. So I'm very very happy that you had this very important
  insight. You can use the same principle in relation to thoughts. When we don't want
  thoughts to come, they come and if you invite them, let any thought come, you'll
  experience that they don't come. And as you said, with this kind of practice, I'm sure
  that the anger you have towards that person will become less and less. And as I said in
  relation to meditation on loving kindness, I would like to suggest to think of that person
  and try to forgive that person, accepting his humanness, otherwise, you're still carrying
  a wound in relation to what he has done to you. We should learn this very important
  quality of forgiveness. Forgiveness to oneself and forgiveness to others because these
  things have happened in the past, you cannot change the past, why should we carry the past
  as a burden, unnecessary burden which is creating suffering for us.</p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Question: </b></font><font color="#7F0000">During the
  meditation this morning, I found my back perspired a lot. I got all wet. The second
  question is when I focus on breathing, my breathing becomes very quick. When I try to
  focus on something else, then my breathing returns to normal.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>The first question about the perspiration
  in the back, just know that there is perspiration in the back and let it be there. Make
  friends with that perspiration. About the second question that when you focus on
  breathing, the breathing becomes fast and when you focus on something else, the breathing
  becomes normal, so I would suggest in the beginning allow the body to breath naturally,
  forget about focusing on the breathing but just sit and then let the body breath the way
  it likes. So please spend some time just learning what is called &quot;<i>non doing</i>&quot;,
  allowing the body to do what it likes in relation to breathing. Don't see it as a
  meditation but just see it as some exercise that you are trying to develop, just non
  doing, allowing the body to breath the way it likes. There is a meditation Master in Sri
  Lanka who says that when we sit, when we think meditation is something special, then we
  have special problems. So here we are trying to give special attention to the breath and
  then the breath behaves in an unusual way and when you ignore the breath, it becomes
  normal. So don't see meditation and breathing as something special and just be with it.
  And even when you are outside, when you think you are not meditating, just continue to
  have a connection with the breath, to continue to be aware of the breath at other times
  also.</p>
  <p>Thank you very much for the three groups for asking very practical useful questions and
  also thank you very much for those who have shared some positive experiences with us. So
  it is very nice that we can sit here as a group of spiritual friends, just sharing each
  other's experience. This is something very very valuable. So now you can prepare for yoga
  and I hope during yoga you'll have challenges, difficulties as it was mentioned earlier, I
  hope you learn to make them the objects of meditation. And hopefully during yoga, your
  body may relax and then when we do sitting meditation, let us sit with that relaxed body
  and relaxed mind and see what happens. Thank you very much.</p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#800000">(Yoga)</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Sitting Meditation</b></font></p>
  <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Now please allow the mind to do what it
  likes. So let any thought arise, thoughts about the past, thoughts about the future. And
  let us learn to observe the thoughts without judging them, no plus, no minus, just
  thoughts arising and just thoughts passing away but please be alert, awake from moment to
  moment.</p>
  <p>Learning to make friends with our thoughts. Learning to create space for our thoughts. </p>
  <p>For those who have problems with thoughts, please learn that there is nothing wrong
  with thoughts if you can be aware, if you can know what thoughts are arising and passing
  away.</p>
  <p>In this meditation you don't try to stop thoughts, you don't try to control thoughts,
  you create space for any thought to arise. What you are learning now is to develop a non -
  reactive mind in relation to the thoughts.</p>
  <p>Now let us learn to make friends with the emotions that we don't like. So please allow
  these emotions that you don't like to arise and see, like the thoughts, whether you can
  make friends with them, create space around them, just to allow them.</p>
  <p>If anyone is feeling sleepy or drowsy, please open your eyes because it is very
  important to be alert, to be awake.</p>
  <p>It is very important for us to learn not to push away, not to control unpleasant
  emotions but to allow them to arise and to make friends with them and to create space for
  them. So let us learn this very important aspect.</p>
  <p>Let us now learn to do the same in relation to unpleasant sensation. So allow the
  unpleasant sensations in the body to arise. What you consider as strange feelings, unusual
  feelings, what you consider as abnormal sensations, so let them arise. It can be in any
  part of the body.</p>
  <p>Can we learn to relate to these sensations without giving a minus. Just to relate to
  them as just sensations.</p>
  <p>Thoughts, emotions, sensations, learning to see them just as they are. Learning to
  relate to them without a plus, without a minus.</p>
  <p>This is learning to have loving kindness to our thought, to our emotions, to our
  sensations. Then they don't become problems for us. Then they become our friends. This is
  what we are trying to do with this meditation.</p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#800000">(Bell)</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Talk: How to Integrate Meditation with Daily Life</b></font></p>
  <p>Now I'm going to give a talk on how to integrate meditation with daily life. So please
  listen carefully with your complete attention.</p>
  <p><font color="#000080"><b>Make a Commitment</b></font></p>
  <p>We have to be clear about our priorities in life. So we have to be clear where the
  practice of meditation figures in this list of priorities you have in life. If you are
  really prepared to make a commitment for the practice of meditation, that person will
  never say I don't have time to meditate. So please be clear on this point.</p>
  <p><font color="#000080"><b>Just Knowing What Is Happening</b></font></p>
  <p>The second point is, as we have been trying to do today, as I have been emphasizing
  very much today, is this very important aspect of just knowing what is happening in our
  mind and body, otherwise you are becoming more and more like machines. Machines also can
  function very efficiently but the machine does not know that it is functioning, no
  understanding, no knowledge. So knowing, understanding how our mind and body work, we can
  only do in everyday life. The things that we do habitually, mechanically, like brushing
  our teeth, combing our hair, dressing up, all these small acts, little acts, please make
  an effort to do consciously, to know that you are doing it, to have your complete and full
  attention when you do those things. So whether you are at home, whether you are travelling
  in a car, whether you are in the place of work, just to know, just to be aware of what is
  going through your mind and body from moment to moment as far as possible. It is the only
  way to integrate meditation with our daily life.</p>
  <p><font color="#000080"><b>Be Conscious of Thoughts</b></font></p>
  <p>Another aspect that I emphasized here is our thoughts. So during the day, just be
  aware, just to be conscious: &quot;What are the thoughts that I'm having? Are they about
  the past? Are they about the future? Are they about me? Are they about others?&quot; From
  the time we wake up to the time we go to sleep, we have these continuous thoughts going
  through our mind, they never stop. So we have to make an effort to learn about these
  things. By learning about the thoughts, you try to understand the type of person you are,
  self knowledge, self understanding. This is very very important for the meditation.</p>
  <p><font color="#000080"><b>Emotions</b></font></p>
  <p>Another problem in everyday life related to this is our emotions, unpleasant emotions
  that create suffering for us, create conflict for us. So unless we are meditators, we
  really don't know how these emotions are created. So what happens to these people is they
  suffer from these emotions and they don't know how they are suffering, why they are
  suffering and they continue to suffer in this world. So if you can understand the
  mechanism, the relationship, the conditions that create these emotions, how they are
  directly related to thoughts, then you can work with them, you make them the objects of
  meditation.</p>
  <p><font color="#000080"><b>Unpleasant Experiences</b></font></p>
  <p>Another aspect that I have been emphasizing and it is very very important in everyday
  life is to find out, to learn, to make the object of meditation what is unpleasant to you,
  what is disturbing you, what is bothering you. You might remember today when we were
  meditating, we heard some big noise outside. At that stage, I suggested to you, let us
  listen to that sound. I suggested we could hear that noise as if for the first time,
  otherwise we consider it as a noise, we consider it as a disturbance, we might get angry,
  we suffer as a result of that noise outside. So when we learn to make that the object of
  meditation, we can learn from any situation, any experience in life. The same thing
  applies to people we have problems with. This is one of the greatest challenges we have in
  everyday life: relationships. So you have to have relationship with people at home, you
  have to have relationship with people at the place of work. We cannot move away from
  relationships. So let us take the case of someone in everyday life making your life
  miserable, creating problems for you, creating suffering for you. An interesting way of
  relating to such a person is to relate to that person as your teacher, as your guru. So
  you learn to use that person to observe your own mind, to see your own reactions to that
  person. Then you realize that the problem is not with that other person but how you are
  relating to him, how you are reacting to that person. This is the beauty of the Buddha's
  teaching. If the suffering is outside, we can never free ourselves from suffering. So
  because we are creating our own suffering that we can free ourselves of the suffering.
  Sometimes I define meditation as finding the medicine for the sickness that we create
  ourselves. So as we create the sickness, we have to discover the medicine. So once we
  discover the medicine as meditation, we have to use it, we have to apply it in everyday
  life. And sometimes as you know medicine can be very unpleasant, it is not always sweet,
  always nice but if you want to cure yourself, even if it is not pleasant, you have to take
  the medicine. So these unpleasant experiences we have, physical pain, mental pain, it is
  unpleasant certainly but as I have been saying, we have to learn from them, they have to
  be our object of meditation.</p>
  <p><font color="#000080"><b>Materialism &amp; Consumerism</b></font></p>
  <p>Another challenge you have in everyday life, as I said on one occasion, is materialism,
  consumerism. So when you live in a rich country like this, you cannot separate, you don't
  know, it's not clear what you really need and what your greed is. The society you live in
  can create desires for you, needs for you which are really not necessary.</p>
  <p>A very important aspect of meditation in everyday life is learning to lead a very
  simple life. It is something very beautiful to be simple, learning to be simple in our way
  of living. So when there is an urge, when there is a need to buy things when you see
  things you should ask: &quot;Now is this really necessary for me? Why do I really need
  this? Is it because other people are wearing that or other people are using that or do you
  really need it?&quot; So one needs to really ask that question when you live in a consumer
  society. Then you'll realize your joy, your happiness, your lightness comes not from
  external things, not from goods, not from what you possess, not what you buy, but from
  something that comes from within yourself. This is the beauty of meditation. The need for
  external things drops away because you have become so independent on external things. They
  drop away. And as I said, joy and lightness come within yourself.</p>
  <p><font color="#000080"><b>Loving Kindness Meditation</b></font></p>
  <p>Another very important aspect of meditation, especially practised in everyday life, is
  meditation on loving kindness. So one aspect of loving kindness is learning to be your
  best friend. So if you can really make that connection, you'll never do things which are
  unskilful for you, unwholesome for you, which create your own suffering and suffering for
  others. And it is only when you are friendly to yourself that we can really be friendly to
  others. Firstly we have to open our hearts to ourselves, then we can open our hearts to
  others. There are many aspects of loving kindness, in fact I gave a talk on that and on
  that day, we distributed a booklet on loving kindness, so please read that. But I like to
  just mention two aspects of loving kindness, one is forgiveness and the other is feeling
  grateful. So in everyday life we need to forgive ourselves and to forgive others. If we
  cannot forgive ourselves and forgive others, then what happens is that you can be holding
  on to certain experience, certain wounds that have been created, and this can create lot
  of suffering for us in everyday life. So as we are human, we are bound to make mistakes.
  So when you make mistakes, there is no need to suffer and no need to feel guilty and beat
  yourself for having made mistakes, rather learn to forgive yourself and learn from these
  mistakes. And other human beings, as they are also human, as they are also imperfect, they
  are also bound to make mistakes. So if you cannot forgive other people what happens is
  that you are holding onto hatred and ill will, which is very very unwholesome for you. So
  when we develop more and more friendliness to others, more and more friendliness to
  ourselves, and more and more forgiveness to others and ourselves, then we learn to be kind
  to others, we learn to have loving kindness in our relationship with others. There are so
  many human beings who are suffering unnecessarily. So when you see human beings suffering,
  we should try to relate to them with gentleness, with kindness, sometimes smiling with
  them, sometimes doing a kind act can make such a difference to them and you. And if you
  can really open up to loving kindness, you'll see so many opportunities in life. In
  society where you can act in such a way and this can generate lots of happiness for you
  and happiness for others.</p>
  <p>Another very important quality I mentioned in relation to loving kindness is this
  quality of feeling grateful, gratitude, which we take for granted. Before coming here, I
  spent some time in India and then I was reflecting on what the Buddha did after he became
  enlightened while I was in that place. And there, according to the traditions, according
  to the account, after he became enlightened, he spent 7 days looking at the tree which
  gave him shelter. Just reflect on this: Buddha spending 7 days showing his gratitude for a
  tree. So it shows what a very important quality feeling grateful is. Do we feel grateful
  for things? Do we feel grateful for other people? Do you feel grateful that you have
  discovered the Dhamma, that you have a group of spiritual friends? Do we ever make an
  effort to develop this quality of feeling grateful? Do we ever feel grateful that we can
  see? There are people who cannot see.</p>
  <p>Do you feel grateful that you can hear? There are some people who cannot hear. Do you
  feel grateful that you are healthy and that you can practise meditation without a problem?
  So these are small things, little things, which we take for granted. You should visit very
  poor countries like India and Sri Lanka and then you might realize that you should feel
  grateful for some of the things you enjoy in this country. But do we ever realize about
  this? In those countries, there are people without food. So shouldn't you feel grateful
  when you have food to eat?</p>
  <p>And there is another aspect of feeling grateful. As I said earlier in the discussion,
  when we have unpleasant experiences, we should also feel grateful because you can learn
  from them, they become our teachers.</p>
  <p><font color="#000080"><b>To have Spiritual Friends</b></font></p>
  <p>Another aspect of meditation in every day life is to have spiritual friends around you.
  So I'm very happy that you have some groups here so that you can go to these groups and
  can spend some time with them, meditate with them and discuss with them, so feeling
  grateful that you have a group of spiritual friends helping each other.</p>
  <p><font color="#000080"><b>Buddha&#146;s Medicine</b></font></p>
  <p>When you practise in this way in everyday life, you can really see the result, you can
  really see that the medicine the Buddha has given us really heals, it really works. Then
  you have more and more faith, more and more confidence in the medicine. Then you have more
  and more confidence in yourself. Then you really feel grateful for the Buddha who
  discovered this medicine, and you feel happy that you have discovered it and that you are
  using it and you are feeling the result. And what is beautiful about the Buddha's medicine
  is that it can be applied in any situation in life. This can be applied when you are sick.
  It can be applied when you encounter death in any way. It can be applied when we are hurt,
  frustrated, disappointed. It can be applied when we have very serious problems, very
  serious conflicts. The only thing, as I said in the beginning, is one has to be very clear
  about the practice. Are you really making a commitment for your practice? Have you really
  made a commitment to take the medicine? I think it is also important that while you are
  taking the medicine, that you should also encourage others to take the medicine by just
  sharing with them. This is what I am doing. Please see for yourselves.</p>
  <p><font color="#000080"><b>Determination to Take the Medicine</b></font></p>
  <p>Some of the suggestions I have been making so far about integrating meditation with
  daily life, are they too difficult, are they unreasonable, are they not within your reach?
  Buddha never said anything which normal human beings cannot do. The only thing you have to
  be clear about the teaching is to have a clear understanding of the teachings and knowing
  how to apply in different situations in life. So this is the point that I am emphasizing.
  I don't think there is any need for me to speak anything more. So I like you to now just
  spend some time reflecting on some of the things that I have been mentioning. This kind of
  reflection is also very very important meditation. Just reflect on a particular theme
  which will help us and which will help others. It helps us to look at ourselves, to find
  out where we really stand in life. It helps us to find out whether we are really wasting
  our life. According to the Buddha's teaching, to get a human birth is something very
  precious. So are we really making use of the preciousness of human birth? In what way can
  we use this preciousness? So let us reflect on this very important theme for a few
  minutes. And in reflecting on that, we can make a determination: Now from today onwards,
  I'm making a real determination to take the medicine and then free myself from the
  suffering that I create myself. And also an aspiration: Let me also get opportunities so
  that I can share the medicine with others, so by doing that, I can make others happy. So
  let us close our eyes and really reflect on this.</p>
  <p>May you continue to use the medicine and free yourself from the sickness that you
  create yourself.</p>
  <p>As this is my last talk, I like to thank everyone. Firstly, I like to thank the
  organizers who have done a very excellent job. I am very impressed with the way they
  organize things so well, so nicely. We should really feel grateful for the fact that there
  are organizers who are able to organize things so well. We should also feel grateful for
  this nunnery for giving us permission to use this place, it's a nice place. Lastly, I like
  to thank every one of you who have been attending the talks and who have been
  participating in today's meditation day. It makes me really happy to see your interest,
  your commitment for the Dhamma, for the practice. So I hope, as I was saying, that you
  continue to have this commitment for the practice. Let us now do some chanting and end
  with loving kindness meditation.</p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#800000">(Chanting)</font></p>
  <p>We'll now end with meditation of loving kindness.</p>
  <p>Please feel the area of your heart. Please spend some time just feeling that area.</p>
  <p>Can you feel that your heart is opening up like a flower, feeling gentleness, softness
  and tenderness?</p>
  <p>Can you feel that you are your best friend, can you really feel it in the area of your
  heart and every part of your body?</p>
  <p>As your best friend, can you really forgive yourself for whatever mistakes you have
  made in the past. If you do not have to forgive yourself, just feel happy that you are not
  carrying any wound.</p>
  <p>As your best friend, can you forgive others for whatever mistakes they have done,
  letting go of any hatred or ill will you are carrying in relation to them?</p>
  <p>May you all be well. May you all be happy. May you all be peaceful. May all beings be
  well. May all beings be happy. May all beings be peaceful.</p>
  <p>I forgot to thank the interpreters, translators, who did a very difficult job. I had
  the feeling sometimes they improve what I said. I also would like to thank our yoga master
  for teaching yoga under difficult situation.</p>
