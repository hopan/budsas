    <p>I'm very happy to see some old faces, some old friends and
    I'm also very happy to see so many new faces. So what I
    propose to do now is to give a talk on why we should meditate
    and then we can have a discussion. After the discussion we
    can meditate for some time and then we will end the session
    with chanting. Pali chanting and Chinese chanting.</p>
    <p>So the question is why should we meditate? What is the
    importance of meditation? Why is it emphasized so much in the
    Buddha's teaching? So these are some of the questions that
    I'm going to explore in my talk.</p>
    <p>The word meditation comes from the Pali word Bhavana which
    means cultivating the mind, developing the mind, mental
    culture. So the whole emphasis is on the mind. When you read
    the Buddhist text, you are so amazed about the Buddha's
    profound and deep statement about the human mind. It is
    amazing that he should have made this statement 2,600 years
    ago. In fact, modern psychologists, psychotherapists are also
    deeply inspired by the Buddha's statement on the human mind.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Meditation: Knowing the Mind,
    Shaping the Mind, Freeing the Mind</b></font></p>
    <p>The idea of meditation has been expressed by a writer in
    these terms: knowing the mind, shaping the mind and freeing
    the mind. I like to repeat the words : Meditation is knowing
    the mind, shaping the mind and freeing the mind. So knowing
    the mind is understanding how the mind is working. If we do
    not know our mind, really we are like machines. So therefore
    it is extremely important to know, to understand, how our
    mind works and when we know our mind, then we can shape the
    mind. Shaping the mind is developing mastery over our mind
    and if we do not develop mastery over our mind, what happens
    is we become slaves to our own mind. So when we become slaves
    to our mind, then thoughts and emotions control us and that
    results in more and more suffering. Therefore it is very
    important to learn to shape the mind and when you learn to
    shape the mind, then you can achieve a mind that is free. So
    the importance of meditation is learning to achieve a mind
    that is free, a mind that is happy, a mind that is peaceful,
    a mind that has loving kindness.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Achieving a Completely Healthy
    Mind</b></font></p>
    <p>It is interesting the things we do to keep our body
    healthy. We feed our body, we keep the body clean, when the
    body becomes sick, we go to the doctor and get medicine to
    cure the illnesses. We do so many things to keep the body
    healthy. An interesting question is what do we do to keep our
    mind healthy? Have you given thoughts to this very important
    question? We have to be clear about what makes our mind sick,
    what makes our mind unhealthy. What are the symptoms of the
    human sicknesses of the mind? So meditation is learning from
    them and achieving a mind that is completely healthy. Some
    areas where the mind becomes sick, we can consider some
    emotions as contributing to the illnesses of the human mind.
    I like to mention some of these emotions and I'm sure
    everyone here can relate to them. Anxiety, stress, fear,
    insecurity, sadness. I can draw up a long list which I think,
    as I have said, we all can relate to. Sometimes we don't
    realize that they make our mind sick. If we do not know that
    they can create our sickness, we can continue to have that
    sickness without finding a solution to the sickness. In one
    of my talks, I will be speaking about emotions and I will
    present to you how meditation helps us to work with emotions.
    When I speak about emotions, I will be interested to hear
    from you what emotions really bother you in this country. So
    I will be presenting some practical ways of working with
    these unpleasant emotions and then finding a way to be free
    from these emotions.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Taste &amp; Experience Buddhism</b></font></p>
    <p>Another very important aspect of meditation is that
    meditation helps us to experience things that arise. There
    are some who know very well what the Buddha taught, so they
    are very knowledgeable about Buddhism but they have not
    experienced anything from Buddhism because they have not
    meditated. They are like some people who know about meals but
    they have hardly tasted the food from the meals. So
    meditation helps us to taste it and when you have tasted it,
    you achieve a kind of taste for the freedom of the mind. And
    when you taste it, you really see for yourself how we can
    free ourselves.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Become Completely Self-Reliant</b></font></p>
    <p>Related to this is another point, that meditation helps us
    to become completely self reliant. When you meditate you
    realize that we have to take responsibility for what is
    happening in our mind. Sometimes I define meditation with my
    own words as finding the medicine for the sickness we have
    created ourselves. So as we create the sickness ourselves, we
    have to find the medicine. When you are sick, if you want to
    heal yourself, you cannot tell the others to take the
    medicine. Buddha emphasized this point very much: to be self
    reliant, to rely on own efforts. The Buddha said: self effort
    is the best effort. And when we develop self effort, when we
    become self reliant, then what happens is we learn to become
    completely self confident about ourselves. When we have this
    self confidence and then when we see for ourselves that the
    medicine is helping, then that gives us more confidence in
    the medicine and it also helps us to develop faith,
    confidence in the person who discovered the medicine.</p>
    <p>So in my talk so far I have been telling you some
    benefits, some aspects of meditation. And I have been trying
    to tell you the importance of meditation. I have been trying
    to answer the question : why we should meditate. So now I
    like to pause and then if there are any questions about what
    I have been saying about meditation, we can discuss them. So
    please ask questions. When I try to teach meditation to
    children, I tell them sometimes that meditation is asking
    questions and finding the answers ourselves. Asking questions
    like: &quot;Why do we get angry? How is stress created?&quot;
    So to raise such questions and to find an answer, meditation
    can be seen as trial and error so therefore I would like that
    you ask some questions and then we might try to find the
    answers ourselves.</p>
    <hr align="left" width="25%">
    <p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Q&amp;A</b></font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">When we do the meditation and after that, I
    would sleep. When I fall asleep, I found some vibration in my
    head, just like someone hit my head but it doesn't hit. What
    happened? Why does it happen?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>When we
    meditate, many things happen in our mind and body, sometimes
    very very unusual and strange. So what is important, what we
    are learning in meditation is : whatever is happening in our
    mind and body, just to know it is happening. And also
    learning to accept them, learning not to react to them. There
    are different stages in meditation so you may be experiencing
    certain stages. Sometimes finding a reason may not
    necessarily be helpful but rather, as I often say, to learn
    to make friends with them and to see them as learning
    experiences and also not to see them as problems and
    difficulties. So what I like to suggest is, whatever happens
    when you are meditating, that can be an unpleasant experience
    sometimes but just to know it, it's just a sensation and just
    to say OK to it, make friends with it and then it will pass.
    So I like you to continue and maybe on Sunday we have a day's
    programme and we can see whether it will happen or not.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience</b></font>: <font
    color="#7F0000">I find your point on how children meditate
    very interesting. I want to learn something more about
    teaching children meditation. Firstly, I want to ask: how do
    children accept the concept of meditation and how do they
    practice meditation? And the second question is: you just
    mentioned the way to learn meditation is to learn to ask
    questions and to answer them, when we ask ourselves
    questions, what are we going to do then?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin</b></font>: So the first
    question is about teaching meditation to children. It is very
    interesting that trying to teach meditation to children, it
    has enabled me to learn from them because they have very
    simple uncomplicated minds. It is interesting for me to see
    the difference between trying to teach meditation to children
    and to adults. In a way meditation can be seen as developing
    a child-like mind and learning to see things as if for the
    first time, learning to be curious about things and being
    very honest and genuine about themselves. So I really enjoy
    being with children and trying to teach them meditation. So
    to answer your question, I never tell them that it is
    meditation. I ask them: now would you like to play with our
    breath? As you know, children love playing, so I suggest
    let's play with our breath. So I tell them now please see
    this as a good game. The game is: can you be aware of your
    breath from moment to moment? And sometimes I tell them to
    play hide and seek. Sometimes you are with the breath and
    sometimes you are not with the breath. So let us play the
    game for 10 to 15 minutes and see what happens. And it is so
    inspiring for me to see how completely still they sit during
    those 10 to 15 minutes, how they seem to be enjoying it, very
    happy smiling friendly faces. When I see adults meditating, I
    see different expressions on their faces. And what also
    inspires me most is when I ask them : do you have any
    questions, do you have any problems, do you have any
    difficulties, most of the time they say no. It's an
    interesting question to find out what we have done to our
    mind. It's a very serious question that we should explore. In
    fact it is really connected to meditation, related to
    meditation. So this was the first question and the second
    question was about, what is it?</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font color="#7F0000">[After we have asked
    ourselves questions, what do we do?]</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Good question. Take the case of Siddhattha who became the
    Buddha. Do you know the question that came to his mind? Very
    simple questions: Why do people die? Why do people get old?
    Why do people become sick? Why do people become monks and
    nuns? So by finding an answer to these simple questions that
    he asked, he ended by becoming the Buddha. I will give
    another example. Newton, the scientist. Do you know the
    simple question that enabled him to discover the very
    profound scientific theory? Why do apples fall? Simple
    question but it ended in making a very profound, very
    important scientific discovery. Someone have said that a
    genius is one who is continuing to have the curiosity of a
    child, and we all have this beautiful capacity as children,
    and as adults we have lost this questioning aspect in us. So
    relating to meditation, asking questions like: Why do I get
    angry? When you ask that question and when you try to find an
    answer, what is the answer you discover? I like to hear the
    answer from you.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience</b></font>: <font
    color="#7F0000">My friend makes me angry.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>It's always
    the other person. So the point is my friend is not behaving
    in the way I want the friend to behave. So you see from the
    simple question, you discover the problem is not with my
    friend but with me by having an expectation of how my friend
    should be. So as I said earlier about meditation, then you
    learn to take responsibility for your anger, and we stop
    blaming others and we start taking responsibility. And that's
    how a change, a transformation can take place in ourselves
    from the single question: why do I get angry? I'm happy you
    are asking questions, so I hope there will be more questions.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">I am calm right now but when my kids get poor
    marks in school, I get angry although I love my children.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>I like such
    practical questions. I think all parents can relate to that
    question. I know certainly that this happens in Sri Lanka
    also. So how does meditation help in such situation? One
    thing you said is that you are now feeling calm, so one point
    to remember is that we should not expect to be always calm.
    We can learn from a mind that is calm. We can also learn from
    a mind that is not calm. If you expect to be always calm, as
    it happened in your case, when you are not calm, you suffer
    as a result. You are angry about yourself. You are
    disappointed about yourself. You give yourself a minus. So I
    would suggest that in the situation that you described, when
    you get angry, just know that you are angry. And tomorrow I
    will be speaking about the importance of the practice of
    awareness or mindfulness -- a very important aspect of
    meditation. So the first suggestion I like to offer is just
    to be aware of the anger, because if you are aware of the
    anger and just to stay with the anger, you will not be able
    to perhaps express that anger in a violent way. So just being
    aware of the anger and not expressing the anger enables us to
    develop some sort of control, mastery over our anger, so this
    is the first point. The second suggestion is by being with
    that after some time, you may recover from the anger. And
    when you recover from that anger, you ask the question: why
    did I get angry with my son? I love him so much, and here I'm
    getting angry, perhaps I'm making him angry. So when you
    explore that question you realize in a way, the problem is
    that you have an expectation how your son should be in class.
    These are reasonable expectations for parents to have but
    it's another matter to find how far that expectation is
    realistic. How far is my son capable of meeting my
    expectations? Shouldn't I find out from my son why he is not
    doing well in class? This is something very very important
    because with more and more meditation, we learn to try to
    understand other persons' behaviour and try to see things
    from the perspective of the other person rather than project
    your own expectations on others. So if you can talk to your
    son in a very friendly, gentle, understanding way: my dear
    son, what are the difficulties you have in class? This is
    something very important which the Buddha emphasized, to have
    a spiritual friendship with everyone that you have to relate
    to. It is very important for parents to have this kind of
    friendly relationship with children so that the child is in a
    position to talk to the parents honestly, in a friendly way,
    on the difficulties the children are having. I feel this
    extremely important. I know in Sri Lanka, some children are
    completely alone, there's no one that they can look for
    because they are afraid to talk honestly to their parents,
    they are afraid to talk about their difficulties to teachers,
    so they are completely lost and it is really sad when
    children are unable to confide when they are in difficult
    situations. So I like to stress and emphasize that it is very
    important in such situation to make a connection with the
    child and then try to understand what the child is going
    through, and this would be something very helpful, meaningful
    rather than getting angry. I think there is time for one more
    question. </p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">We have thoughts, we have desires, and
    suffering. Is it true by meditating you can stop having these
    thoughts, desires and suffering.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>It's not so
    easy. It's interesting you mentioned about thoughts. I feel
    that it is the most important area in the human mind because
    from the time we wake up to the time that we go to sleep,
    what happens? There is continuous thoughts going through our
    mind. I think everyone here can relate to that. Here, when
    I'm talking you have your own thoughts going through your
    mind. I often raise this question: what are you thinking
    about from morning to night? Can anyone suggest an answer?
    What are we thinking about from morning to night, without
    ever stopping. So you see the importance of asking simple
    questions. What do we think about?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">Most of the time, we think of ourselves, the
    &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot;, all the time.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Absolutely
    right, even when we are thinking of others, they are always
    related to you. Isn't that interesting? And the next question
    is in relation to ourselves and others, what do we do with
    our thoughts? What we are doing is we make judgement. And the
    simple way I describe that is we give pluses and we give
    minuses. When you remember some good thing you have done, you
    feel happy, big plus. When we remember some wrong things we
    have done, some mistake that we have done, some bad things we
    have done, big minus. And we do the same in relation to the
    others. The bad things, the wrong things the others have
    done, we give them minuses. Good things others have done, we
    give them pluses. So isn't it interesting from morning to
    night, we become teachers giving pluses and minuses? I know
    some people who live in a hell they have created and in that
    hell, only minuses exist. They have thoughts only about their
    mistakes, about their shortcomings. And in relation to the
    others, we have similar thoughts, so by that we can create a
    hell and we can really feel sad and live in depression, so
    this is how we create our own suffering with our thoughts.
    And you will realize there is a connection with thoughts and
    emotions. An interesting question to find out is: what comes
    first, the thought or emotion? Have you discovered the
    answer? What comes first, the thought or the emotion? Do you
    see the importance of meditation? So anyway, I will be
    discussing these things as we go along. Going back to the
    question, what we can do is what I will be talking tomorrow
    -- the importance of awareness. With awareness, just to
    observe the thoughts that are going through our mind and just
    to realize how we are using thoughts destructively which
    create suffering for ourselves and suffering for others. And
    also we can use thoughts creatively which I will be talking
    about later on. And the question you asked about desires,
    there again you see a relationship, connection between
    thoughts and desires. As I said, this is the importance of
    meditation. This is why the Buddha made such important, very
    very profound statements about how the mind is working. and
    through that understanding by using awareness, you see how we
    create our own suffering, our own problems. Through that
    realization is to free ourselves from suffering and problems,
    this is what meditation is. So we will be discussing these
    very important issues as we go along in the next few days.</p>
    <p>Anyway I'm very happy that you asked some very good
    questions and now I would suggest you take a small break. So
    you can go out, and come back when we ring the bell, and then
    we can meditate. So I suggest, please make an effort to be
    silent and also please make an effort to be mindful. Just to
    walk slowly and just to know what is happening when you are
    walking. And as we have discussed about thoughts, just to
    know what thoughts you are having in your mind, just be
    alert, be attentive. So during the next 5 minutes, please
    also let us learn just to watch, just to discover what is
    happening in our mind and body from moment to moment and when
    you hear the gong, please come back slowly and in silence.
    Thank you very much.</p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#800000">[Break] - [Guided
    meditation] - [Chanting]</font></p>
    <p>Thank you very much for the beautiful chanting. So
    tomorrow's talk will be about the practice of mindfulness and
    after the talk, we will distribute a book on a text which is
    based on the practice of mindfulness. So I like to suggest
    that tomorrow, during the day, please make an effort just to
    know what is happening in your mind and body from moment to
    moment as far as possible. Just try to know the thoughts that
    you will be having during the day tomorrow. And please see
    how we give pluses and minuses to ourselves and others and
    please see the connection between thoughts and emotions. And
    I would also like to suggest to please make an effort to be
    friendly, to be gentle, to be kind towards our mind and body.
    If you practise these things, what I will be presenting
    tomorrow will make sense in your own experience. So once
    again, I like to thank you very much for asking questions and
    then responding to my suggestions. So I'm looking forward
    very much to meeting you tomorrow also. And may you all be
    well, may you all be happy, may you all be peaceful and may
    you learn to be free of suffering and when you go to sleep,
    may you sleep peacefully and wake up peacefully.</p>
