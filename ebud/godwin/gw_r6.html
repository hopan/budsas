    <p>We thought we can have a shorter sitting because we
    thought we can have a longer discussion as it is the last
    discussion we are having. So we will go over the techniques
    we have practised here. And with these techniques, if you
    have any difficulties, please present them. Though there are
    different techniques, the principles are the same. I present
    different techniques because people have different
    temperaments. So what I try to do is to relate to the
    meditators individually and find out what technique is more
    suitable for them.</p>
    <p>Before we speak about the techniques, we should be clear
    why we meditate. The purpose of meditation is to free
    ourselves of suffering. The Buddha often said I teach the
    fact of suffering and the way out of suffering. So it is to
    really achieve a mind that is free and a heart that is
    boundless. And the techniques are rather simple but we
    complicate them because of the complicated minds we have.
    Human beings are very clever at complicating simple things! I
    often ask the question: What has human beings not complicated
    in life? So one of the techniques we presented was focusing
    on the breathing. Any difficulty about this technique?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 1: </b>When I observe the
    breathing, I find that my mind was not calm and the breathing
    was fast.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>So I will say
    something about this technique. For whatever question you
    have, perhaps what I say might cover by it. The simple thing
    about this technique is that it is learning to be aware, so
    that we try not only to learn about awareness in relation to
    breathing but whatever is happening in our mind and body. So
    it is very simple. If you are having thoughts you just know
    that thoughts are there. If the breathing goes fast, you know
    now my breathing is fast. If you have unpleasant sensations
    in the body, you know there are unpleasant sensations in the
    body so as I have been emphasizing, the whole focus of the
    technique is <i>just knowing</i> what is happening from
    moment to moment. If our mind is calm, you know the mind is
    calm. If the mind is not calm, you know the mind is not calm.
    So if we are meditating to achieve a mind that is calm, then
    when calm comes, we will hold onto the calm. This is how
    suffering is created. And if there is calm, there is also
    suffering. So what this meditation does is something very
    simple, knowing what is happening and as I have been saying
    very often, just being friendly and saying O.K. to whatever
    is happening and if you can meditate in this way, at the time
    you are meditating, you are free from suffering.</p>
    <p>And what is also important is, to use the breath not only
    when we are sitting. This is why I have been saying, please
    make a connection with your breath. So in everyday life, at
    different moments, you can just come back to your breath. And
    as I said the friend, our breath, will help us to just
    experience the present moment, the <i>here</i> and the <i>now</i>.
    The idea is to sit and develop awareness and then to use that
    awareness at other times. I would consider that more
    important than what is happening when you are sitting because
    it is in everyday life that suffering is created, problems
    are created, you have to face challenges.</p>
    <p>Some meditators ask me: Am I doing it right? How do I know
    whether I am progressing in my practice? So I tell them the
    progress is not what is happening when you are sitting but
    how you relate to it in everyday life. In Sri Lanka, we have
    very very rich people sometimes being very unkind to their
    servants in their house. So when they are learning
    meditation, I tell them the way to know their progress is to
    see the way they are treating your servants at home. They are
    not very happy to hear such things. So please realize the
    progress is in how we are relating to it in everyday life. So
    it is a way of living. It is an art of living. It is a way of
    thinking. It is a way of having an attitude towards life,
    like the story I related about the wise old Chinese man. So
    please please see this clearly, please realize this. Perhaps
    after I go over the techniques, I might go over with you that
    aspect of everyday life. So again to repeat, please don't
    associate meditation with a particular posture, a particular
    time, a particular technique.</p>
    <p>Another technique I presented was, meditation on loving
    kindness, which I emphasize very much. And meditation on
    loving kindness is related to all the techniques because if
    you can learn to make friends with whatever is happening, in
    that moment, there is freedom. The simple fact is suffering
    comes when we resist something, whether in meditation or
    whether in everyday life. So loving kindness, friendliness,
    gentleness, openness, allow us not to resist, but just to
    flow, just to be open to what is happening.</p>
    <p>Anyway, any problems about meditation on loving kindness?
    It's a funny question: Any problems about loving kindness
    meditation.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 2: </b>Sometimes you treat
    other people with loving kindness but other people may not
    treat you with loving kindness.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Very good
    question. This is what happens in everyday life. This is one
    of the greatest challenges we have in everyday life. People
    who are unfriendly to you, people who are unkind to you,
    people who are unreasonable to you; they should be our gurus,
    they should be our masters, they should be our teachers. As
    one of my friends put it, they really show you the mirror. So
    when you meet such people, you should be really grateful for
    them because they are testing you. So the important thing is,
    not to be concerned about what they are doing, but to watch
    what is happening in our own mind. This is why we have been
    emphasizing so much the practice of awareness, just knowing
    what is happening. Then when you realize that the problem is
    what is happening here and not what is happening out there,
    people can behave in any way but there is no reaction to
    that. And as we have been emphasizing, this shows that human
    beings are human. According to the Buddha, until and unless
    we are enlightened, we are all crazy. So we are living in a
    crazy would. So the problem with us is we are taking these
    crazy people too seriously! So the sane way to live in a
    crazy society is to realize that, to understand this and to
    have compassion to the crazy people we have to be with. So
    this is how we can relate to such people, so they should be
    our teachers. So hope you meet more and more such masters,
    such teachers, such gurus, in your life and they are much
    better than the so-called teacher from Sri Lanka!!</p>
    <p>So any other questions about loving kindness?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 3: </b>Sometimes I feel
    that someone has done something wrong, for example, in the
    office, I see people wasting paper, so I get a bit angry with
    them although I understand that they may be ignorant about
    this but still the anger is there.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>It is
    interesting for me the example you gave. In Sri Lanka, people
    get angry when they waste their food because food is such a
    precious important thing. So it is interesting that when you
    see people wasting paper, so how does a meditator use such a
    situation?</p>
    <p>So one way of working with such a situation is to see your
    own reactions to such a situation. Are you angry? Are you
    annoyed? Are you irritated? In what way are you reacting to
    that. So sometimes it is interesting that you can experiment
    with it. One day you go and you see such people, you see now,
    how long will the anger last, half an hour? One hour? Because
    of some paper? So you should look for such people and see how
    you are reacting to such situations. So that becomes a
    learning experience to you.</p>
    <p>Now this doesn't mean that meditators are always passive,
    looking at oneself. There are two very important words:
    reaction, response. Reaction is an emotional reaction to such
    a situation. Response is doing something meaningful, doing
    something creative without reacting. So if you can have a
    kind of dialogue with such people in a very friendly open
    way, try to understand their behaviour. But it should be done
    in a very very skilful way rather than when you speak to
    them, speak in a very angry way, in a judgmental way as if
    you are thinking you are righteous and these people are wrong
    and naturally there is a reaction to that. We should never be
    self righteous in our life. When you see mistakes of other
    people, without being self righteous, sometimes you say: I
    may not have that mistake but I may be having worse mistakes,
    worse ones, wrong things in my mind. Then when you see wrong
    doings, you relate to human frailties in an entirely
    different way. So it is good to, if you like to, to have a
    dialogue with such people and just get them to reflect on
    what is happening to them. This may work, this may not work.
    So if it works, it's fine and if it doesn't work, you should
    be able to see such human frailties and just to understand
    that this is the way things are. So I like to again emphasize
    this importance of getting the person to see what he or she
    is doing, to get that person to reflect as far as possible by
    asking questions, rather than impose your opinion on other
    people. And I would also like to suggest in such situation,
    without being self righteous, to be humble in situations. To
    honestly tell such person: I'm sure I'm having shortcomings
    in me and I'm full of imperfections because I'm still not an
    enlightened person but I'm curious to know what makes you do
    this? That can touch people very deeply rather than the self
    righteous way.</p>
    <p>Anything else about loving kindness?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 1: </b>My question is
    related to the previous question that has just been raised,
    this thing about not being self righteous when you deal with
    a person whom you think is not acting correctly. The problem
    is between me and my wife. I have tried the method you have
    just explained to us to make her understand where her
    shortcomings are but the more friendly I am in dealing with
    the situation, the more self righteous she feels so I'm
    getting nowhere with this.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 2: </b>He said he got more
    and more humble and his wife got more and more self
    righteous, but don't believe him!</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>And I think I
    agree because I know his wife also!</p>
    <p>Anyway I think I'm forced to relate my usual story about
    the cobra. I think most of you have heard of this story.
    Anyway, anyone not heard of it?</p>
    <p>The story is that there was a cobra who was practising
    loving kindness meditation in a forest all by herself and an
    old woman came along and then the woman mistook the cobra for
    a rope. So as the cobra was practising loving kindness, she
    allowed the woman to use her as a rope for the fire wood she
    had collected. So the old woman went home and this cobra
    escaped with lots of difficulties, lots of pain, wounds and
    so on and went to the meditation teacher and told the
    meditation teacher, &#145;See what happened. I was practising
    loving kindness. I'm suffering as a result of the loving
    kindness.&#146; And the teacher said, &#145;You have been
    practising idiotic compassion, not loving kindness. We have
    to learn to hiss sometimes. So sometimes we need to hiss to
    assert ourselves, to be firm but again be clear that you are
    being firm and that your motive, what is inside, is really
    compassion.&#146; So the point I'm making is, loving kindness
    doesn't mean that you are always passive, allowing others to
    exploit you. So it's again with wisdom that you should know
    when to assert yourself and when to be gentle. And you should
    also allow your wife to be the cobra.</p>
    <p>Another technique that we practised which is very very
    important, I feel, is what is called <i>objectless
    meditation.</i> Once you are established in awareness and you
    are stable in your mind, then we are in a position to allow
    anything to arise, allow any thought to arise, allow any
    emotion to arise especially emotions we don't like, any
    sensations to arise, and we learn just to observe, just to be
    with whatever is happening in that spacious mind. This is a
    very very useful meditation in everyday life. In everyday
    life, in different situations, just to know what thoughts you
    are having, just to know what emotions you are having, just
    to know what sensations you are having, and seeing what they
    are and learning not to react to them, making them the
    objects of meditation, making them learning experiences. So
    in everyday life, you are having an emotion like anger, fear,
    stress, we learn to make that an object of meditation.
    Meditation has different levels but at least to a great
    extent, we should try to integrate this with everyday life.
    This is why we had two full days, one full day to work with
    emotions, another full day to work with thoughts, because
    these are the two aspects, the two areas which we have to
    deal with in everyday life. So any question about this
    practice?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 3: </b>Regarding the
    objectless meditation, practically, how can we create a
    spacious mind in order to do such meditation?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>So using a
    technique like breathing, we learn to develop awareness, we
    learn to develop non-reactive mind, we learn to be open as I
    said with this technique like focusing on breathing and once
    you know now you are fairly stable, then you can open up to
    whatever is happening. And what is beautiful in this
    technique is even when there are times when you don't have a
    spacious mind and when you react, as I said, when you have
    emotion, that becomes an object of meditation, you learn
    about it, you investigate it. So if you are unable to do it
    at that time, it will not be very easy, but at least later
    on, we can reflect on what happened and we can learn from
    them. So our mistakes, our failures, they're used as our
    teachers, they're used for our spiritual growth. It is a very
    very beautiful way to live. Usually when we make a mistake,
    we give ourselves a big minus, we feel guilty, we suffer from
    anger, all different reactions. But in this way, there is no
    need to have such reaction for them, you learn about what
    happened to you, so it develops self knowledge, you feel
    grateful for these emotions and reactions that you have had.
    I like to emphasize this very much because I know in this
    culture, there's lots of suffering as a result of our
    failures, our mistakes. So hereafter, please don't suffer as
    a result of them, make them the object of meditation, make an
    effort to learn from them, because again, we can use them as
    a mirror because they are showing us where we are. So please
    be very clear on this point. Then you come to a state whether
    these unpleasant emotions are there or whether there are
    pleasant emotions, it makes no difference. No big plus when
    pleasant experiences are there and no big minus when
    unpleasant experiences are there. As the Buddha said: <i>We
    learn to see things just as they are.</i> </p>
    <p>Any other questions about this technique?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 4: </b>You taught us not
    to fight with our thoughts in everyday life, particularly
    during meditation, we should not fight against all the
    sensations. During meditation, I find after sitting for about
    half an hour, my legs become so painful that I have to put
    all my attention on the pain and it's like putting up a fight
    with those sensations. And if I try to accept the sensations,
    then all my attention is on how to accept those sensations
    and therefore, I have no room to do any observation of the
    thoughts. So I would like to know when I should make a
    decision to change my posture because I do not want to change
    my posture too often because I might have to go through the
    pain in order to improve the sitting. It confused me because
    I have to make a decision sometime and I do not know what
    decision should I make.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>A few points,
    one is using pain is a very very useful experience for
    meditation. In everyday life, when we experience physical
    pain, what do we do? We try to do something about it
    immediately, change the posture or whatever and then get rid
    of the pain because it is unpleasant. So by doing this, we
    never learn about pain, which is the most important part of
    the human condition. We don't know what types of pain we
    might have to experience in the future, so this is why I have
    been repeating so much so often, meditation is learning to be
    open to unpleasant experiences. So please don't see them as a
    disturbance or a distraction. So this is one point. So
    nothing is more important than the pain itself, thoughts or
    whatever, because that is what you are experiencing, so feel
    grateful for the pain because you can learn about the pain in
    a meditative situation.</p>
    <p>We have to avoid two extremes. One extreme is always
    saying yes to the body. This is pampering the body. Is there
    lots of pampering of the body in this country? A good
    question to reflect. The body said, &#145;I want it.&#146;
    Immediately go for it because it is all available here. So it
    is very very important to learn to say no sometimes. So
    saying yes always is pampering. Always saying no is being too
    hard on ourselves. So it is very very important to have the
    balance, when to say yes, when to say no. So in relation to
    physical pain when you are meditating, immediately you change
    the posture, I would say that is pampering and going through
    the pain, not trying to change the posture, grinding your
    teeth, enduring the pain, I would say it is the other
    extreme. So the middle way is learning, experimenting,
    exploring the pain and then when it's unbearable, change the
    posture, stand up, very simple.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 4: </b>I think it is
    rather difficult to know what is the point that you have to
    be strict.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Just play with
    it, just experiment with it, it's not as critical as you
    think. Don't be so serious about the practice. Yesterday you
    were speaking of people being like stones. This is the result
    if you are too serious. So this is why I'm emphasizing
    lightness, joy, experimenting, playing with meditation. I
    think this brings up another aspect of meditation which I
    like to mention. I think again this is related to this
    culture, that people are goal oriented, you want to achieve
    results. So it is very very interesting, in everyday life you
    have goal to achieve, results to achieve and immediately we
    chase the goals when we are meditating. So naturally you go
    through the same stress, the same anxiety, the same tension,
    the same restlessness because you want to achieve some goals,
    some results. Buddha has something very very interesting in
    this connection, a simile. He said meditation is like being a
    gardener, so like a gardener you are enjoying planting the
    trees, vegetables, flowers and the gardener is not bothered
    when the flowers will come, when the fruits will come but is
    enjoying what he is doing. I have thought of a similar
    simile. The simile is trying to reach the top of a mountain
    when you're climbing. If you are concerned, you are
    pre-occupied by what you are going to see when you reach the
    top, you'll miss the fun when climbing. So when you are
    climbing, what is going to happen to you, the falls, the
    adventures, the problems, those become the practice and not
    be concerned about what is there when you reached the top. So
    what is happening now is the practice and not what is going
    to happen later on. So it doesn't matter whether it is
    pleasant experiences, unpleasant experiences, see them as
    practice, that's the practice, not getting rid of them.</p>
    <p>Any other question?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 5: </b>Your teaching is
    mainly divided into two areas, that is the technique of
    observing the breathing and the other is observing what is
    happening in our mind. Is there a suggestion that we should
    practise observing the breathing first and then observe what
    is happening in our mind or the other way round? Which one
    should we do first?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>I would say it
    depends but as I said earlier focusing on breathing helps you
    to develop awareness, non-reactive mind and so on and once
    you develop these skills, then you can practise objectless
    meditation. And I would like to make it clear that we should
    practise both of these techniques, continue to practise these
    two techniques independently because in a sense they
    compliment each other. I also like to make it clear now what
    I have been saying so far you might have the impression that
    meditation is only practising techniques but there is also a
    very important area which I presented on a few occasions
    here, learning to reflect, learning to contemplate. This is
    very very important especially to our behaviour. To reflect
    in a very very friendly, gentle way about the way we behave,
    words that we used. So we can learn a great deal from all
    this in relation to the way we are behaving. The judgments we
    make. So if we can develop this quality of reflection, one
    can see the Dhamma from any experience in life, any
    experience can be a meditation. It can be a sickness, it can
    be some disappointment, it can be some frustration, it can be
    some happiness, it can be anything but just learning to
    reflect, to contemplate, to understand, is very very
    important. So in this connection I like to suggest a
    technique which you can practise in everyday life. In the
    evening after work when you go back home, I know everyone who
    goes home is tired but please try to recover from that by
    maybe taking a shower, doing something just for a few minutes
    and take your mind backwards and then just reflect on how you
    spent the day. From the time you woke up to the time of that
    reflection, just to try to go over all the things. See now,
    how many times did I get angry during the day, what are the
    occasions when there was stress, when were the situations
    when I lost control of my emotions. You are not doing as if
    you were a teacher, trying to beat yourself but in a very
    friendly, gentle, understanding way, just going over what
    happened, and what is more important is also to reflect on
    the times when they are not there. Reflect on the good things
    you have done, the generous things we have done, the friendly
    things you have done, the nice words you have used. You
    should also include these. This is more important, equally
    important. And if you can be also more open to these positive
    things, you'll be surprised to know what a good person you
    are. So this type of reflection will enable us to know more
    about ourselves, to know about our behaviour in a very
    objective clear way and when you do this, a natural
    transformation will come in your behaviour without trying to
    do anything.</p>
    <p>I think another thing we learned is yoga. So please don't
    forget yoga in everyday life. You don't have to do one hour
    of yoga but in the morning when you wake up, then just spent
    five minutes, ten minutes, doing some of these physical
    exercises, movements. It will really awake you physically and
    mentally. In the evening when you go back home, take a shower
    and do a few exercises, immediately there will be a recovery.</p>
    <p>Any questions about yoga? The yoga master is here.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 4: </b>If our yoga teacher
    can give us some notes it would be good because I will forget
    when I get home.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Yes, give them
    notes.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Yoga teacher: </b>I have already
    prepared some. I will distribute them tomorrow. I don't want
    to give them in advance because I want them to concentrate on
    the practice.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Do you want
    him to demonstrate anything about yoga? You can ask him to
    show you. Stand on your head. Anyway, so please try to
    combine meditation with yoga because physically, it is one of
    the things I like to mention, that it is very very important
    to relax the body. I find that sometimes the way you
    meditate, I mean I can see on your face, I mean it is not
    relaxed. As I said, it is too serious, too tense, may be
    trying to achieve something. So when the body is relaxed, the
    mind becomes relaxed, then both the mind and body are relaxed
    and you can meditate in a very relaxed easy way. And talking
    to some of the meditators here I find that they are mostly in
    their heads and not in their body so much. So it is very very
    important to make a connection with the body, feel the body,
    learn to listen to our body, to come back to the body as
    often as possible.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 6: </b>The thing I
    observed when doing yoga is the question of ownership, this
    concept of the self, because I found the body acts very
    independently. It would not always do things the way you
    want. I want to bend over like Jack but I can't do it. It is
    not up to me, the body has its independence.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>It is a very
    good point to realize our limitations and then as you rightly
    said, we have no control and if we are the master, we can say
    do this, the body should behave like this, we can't say that.
    So this why we have to learn to surrender to what is
    happening. This is why on one occasion I said we have to be
    open to uncertainty because we have no control over what is
    happening in our mind and body and the environment and life.</p>
    <p>Anything else? We can spend more time today as it is the
    last night.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 7: </b>I don't quite agree
    because even with Jack when he first started, it can't be he
    could do all the postures he can do now so you have to
    gradually learn with your body.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>That's true
    but it doesn't mean that Jack can say: Now my body don't fall
    sick, my body don't die, please don't have any white hair
    like Godwin's hair. Even the Buddha could not control what
    happened to his body. The Buddha's body became sick, the
    Buddha's body became old, the Buddha's body died. The only
    difference was whatever happened in the body, it caused no
    suffering for him because he was not identifying himself with
    it.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 1: </b>You told us that we
    should hear and see things when we go outside. I would like
    you to tell us more about how we see things.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Normally when
    we see things, our complete attention is not there. So what
    we can do and this is what is sometimes very useful about
    nature, is that you can cultivate this way of looking at
    things by examining something very very clearly, very closely
    and at that time, your whole attention, you whole awareness,
    is on that object that you are seeing. So then if we can
    learn to do this in relation to seeing, our senses are really
    awaken. There's a freshness that arises, there is a lightness
    in your being. I think as children we had this quality, but
    maybe with our pre-occupation, with our anxiety, with our
    thoughts, they are there most of the time so we try to see
    them with such a mind, so we hardly notice things. So when
    you develop this quality, we can see small things, little
    things, much more clearly so that these ordinary things can
    become extraordinary. In the Buddhist texts, there are some
    very beautiful references to monks and nuns living in the
    forest and how they are describing very minutely what they
    hear, what they see. So another word for this is to develop a
    kind of sensitivity in a positive sense to seeing things,
    hearing things, smelling things, feeling things, so your
    whole living is alive, is afresh, is new, is innocent. In the
    Dhammapada, a very important book in the Dhamma, it is said
    that if you do not cultivate this awareness, this alertness,
    we are like dead people. So we become alive with this
    quality. I think maybe you might have experienced this,
    before chanting, when we hear the sounds, how we can really
    make the sounds the object of meditation. If we can really
    hear them sharply, clearly as if for the first time where
    space is created in your mind only for the sounds and the
    same quality of living is in whatever we do, when we are
    eating, we'll be really alive, we be really conscious, really
    present when we are eating. So this is what I'm trying to
    emphasize.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 8: </b>Sometimes when we
    are meditating, we have vibration, movement of the body, what
    should we do?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Sometimes just
    to allow the body to move. Sometimes you need to control it,
    to say: Now stop it. Sometimes to allow it, sometimes to
    control it, to stop it. Only thing is you should not react to
    it and say: This is a funny feeling, this is strange, am I
    doing it right? That is unnecessary. When we meditate, so
    many things happen in our mind and body but whatever happens,
    just learning to be aware, learning to say O.K.</p>
    <p>I like to hear something about chanting. What is your
    experience with chanting.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 4: </b>I am not answering
    your question yet, I want to put a question.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>But I like to
    hear the answer and then you can put the question. What about
    chanting?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 4: </b>I think Chinese
    chanting is fast and when I chant, I don't feel peaceful, not
    in here but elsewhere.</font></p>
    <p><b>Godwin: </b>But we are talking about chanting here.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 7: </b>I felt very
    comfortable when chanting in the temple next door this
    morning.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 5: </b>I'm not talking about
    chanting here but the traditional chanting. It makes me
    annoyed with the bell ringing all the time, bell ringing for
    this, bell ringing for that, as though I'm being controlled.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 4: </b>I want to talk
    about the chanting here.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Thank you.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 4: </b>I feel very
    irritated about the ding ding. It's very interesting
    sometimes when I concentrate on the chanting, it feels that
    the ding ding is very far away but sometimes, I don't know
    when, I am still not so aware of my mind, sometimes the ding
    ding really gets very irritating to my brain, like something
    hitting me. I don't like it.</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>So you are
    saying about when you hear chanting. What happens when you
    hear your own voice chanting.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 4: </b>The whole
    atmosphere.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>With your own
    voice?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 4: </b>Sometimes I can
    feel mine and also sometimes the whole. I just, the feeling
    is very interesting because sometimes it is irritating to my
    mind and sometimes it doesn't.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Many
    experience has plus, minus and this is why we have to say now
    plus, now pleasant, now unpleasant, O.K., this is life. So
    you see chanting shows what life is. It doesn't go one way,
    it's beautiful. You see one can learn from anything. This is
    what I say, this is a way of life, pleasant things come,
    unpleasant things come. Can we be open to them?</p>
    <p>I like to share my thoughts about chanting. I love Chinese
    chanting. I don't know, it's really makes me, how shall I put
    it, really enjoy, really being present. Sometimes without my
    knowledge, my body is moving, wonderful. And I like the bells
    because in Sri Lanka, we don't use bells so it is some magic
    for me.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 6: </b>Actually the bell
    is a device to develop our awareness too because the sound of
    the bell is very clear. Secondly it vibrates slowly and
    reduces its volume to the end so your awareness can follow
    the bell from the time it is hit right to the end of it when
    the sound finally vanishes.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Very good
    point. Any question?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 4: </b>I still have one
    question. Talking about awareness, I want to know, during
    awareness, I have many many imaginations. The imaginations
    keep coming out. Is this one of the nature of awareness?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Can you give
    an example of what you mean by imaginations which makes you
    happy?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 4: </b>For example, when I
    look at the grass and I look at small plants and when they
    move, I feel like dancing with them so it's a kind of
    imagination. I don't know whether it's thoughts or not.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>It doesn't
    matter but if you can just dance, just dance and enjoy it, it
    doesn't matter what it is.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 4: </b>And even when I
    look at the clouds I see many many things and so, I want to
    know if the imagination is a kind of thought.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Find out for
    yourself. I mean this is what I have been encouraging people
    to do. So when you imagine, you can find out: Now am I
    thinking? What is happening? So these are ..... I think the
    question was not translated. You can translate yourself.</p>
    <p>So tomorrow I like you to experiment with it and come and
    share with me the discovery you have made. This is what I
    have been trying to encourage. By the way, the last few days
    is for you to make your own discoveries. And if you learn to
    make your own discoveries, as I said on one occasion, when
    you leave this place, you will continue to make discoveries
    about life, about anything. One danger about imagination is
    that you may not be able to be clear what is imagined and
    what is reality. I know some people have breakdowns because
    they don't know how to distinguish what is imagined, what is
    real.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 4: </b>I told you about
    the grasshoppers last night. In my imagination, I don't know
    the grasshoppers are meditating or not but I imagined, and so
    this is very interesting.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>This is why I
    said the danger is, that you might come to a stage where you
    don't know whether you are imagining or whether what is real
    and that can cause serious problems for you. I mean this is
    what is beautiful about the meditation techniques. There is
    nothing to imagine, something real, something objective and
    then when there is unreality, imaginations, let go, come back
    to the reality. Sounds, it is something pleasant, everyone
    can hear sensations. When I meet people who have
    psychological problems, these are the techniques that I give
    them and for the first time, they can distinguish what is
    real, what is unreal.</p>
    <p>So tomorrow we will be having a different schedule as you
    know. There's lot of working meditation we have to do,
    clearing up. And of course I know you have not been
    practising silence but tomorrow you are free to really speak
    out openly, but I like to make this suggestion, it is very
    very important to everyday life. So when you speak, see how
    far you can be aware of your speech because in everyday life,
    this is area where there's lots of problems, difficulties,
    suffering, where we use our speech incorrectly. So silence is
    important, right speech is important. So please make an
    effort. It will be a very good training for everyday life.
    When you are speaking tomorrow, just to know that you are
    speaking, to observe the tone of your speech. When others are
    speaking, do you really listen attentively, clearly. Also
    tomorrow while we are working, as we have been trying to do,
    see how far you can see work as a meditation and not
    something different from meditation. So we will have a last
    session, I think what is called, conclusion, so we might have
    some more minutes to speak about everyday life, some aspects
    on meditation, if there is a need for it. </p>
    <p>I am very happy that you presented questions clarifying
    some problems, difficulties you have in meditation. So I hope
    you are very clear about the medicine now. So now the
    important thing is to make a commitment to use the medicine
    in everyday life. I like to tell you really make use of the
    medicine, the medicine really work and help you. You will see
    the medicine helps us to work with the sickness that we
    create ourselves. And I also like to suggest that while you
    use the medicine, please make an effort to share the medicine
    with others. There's lot of people suffering in this world.
    So it is very very important for us while we take the
    medicine, for us to share it with others.</p>
    <p>We will do some chanting.</p>
