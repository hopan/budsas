    <p>For the discussion, I think what we may try to do is to
    share each other's experience with what happened today.</p>
    <p>I feel it is very important to learn to share our
    experiences very honestly to a group of spiritual friends.
    Sharing both what we consider to be pleasant experiences and
    also unpleasant experiences. So it is opening up ourselves to
    our spiritual friends. Normally we are very nervous,
    self-conscious to speak about ourselves, thinking that others
    will judge us, whether we have done the right thing and so
    on. One should not fear about it because one is sharing one's
    experiences which is a fact.</p>
    <p>So let us begin with 4:45 a.m. So what was your experience
    when you woke up at 4:45 this morning?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 1: </b>I didn't get up.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Because you
    did not sleep.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 1: </b>Yes.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Very good,
    very good. Thank you for sharing that very honestly. Anything
    else? Any other experiences?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 2: </b>I felt sleepy and
    tired because I did not sleep last night and I wanted to stay
    in bed, but just for a short time.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>So you came
    for meditation? Anything else?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 3: </b>I also could not
    sleep well last night because I was woken up by chanting
    downstairs (she was sleeping in the other temple) but I woke
    up and came.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Maybe we
    should do chanting rather than ringing the bell. Anyone else
    wants to say something?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 4: </b>I think we should
    thank Mrs. Siu because I know she made a special effort to
    get up especially early so that she can wake us up.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>How did you
    feel when you woke up?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Mrs. Siu: </b>I was very happy to
    get up this morning. I saw many stars in the sky and I saw
    many things.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>This brings up
    the importance of loving kindness. Also brings up the
    importance of taking responsibility for others. </p>
    <p>What about waiting for the toilet? Was anyone angry,
    impatient, suffering? Yes or no?</p>
    <p>I would like to share my own experience. I think I also
    woke up early. I was also able to enjoy the stillness and the
    beauty at that time outside.</p>
    <p>So what is the experience with meditation? We started at 5
    o'clock. Any questions, any problems, any difficulties about
    the simple meditation that we practise, just knowing what is
    happening.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 1: </b>I was like half awake
    in this morning's meditation. I just went through it in a
    hazy way. But for reasons unknown, in the meditation just
    before, I discovered one thing, I felt it was different to
    how I felt this morning. Before, it was like wasting a lot of
    my energy. I felt exhausted in having to, as teacher told us,
    be aware of our body, movement and mental activity. It was
    like waiting for them to come out but they just never came
    out. In the session of sitting we just had, when I felt
    stillness, then I knew how to use what teacher told us, how
    to be aware how my body works and knowing it very clearly.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Thank you for
    sharing that experience. It is nice to hear the unpleasant
    experiences in the morning and what can be considered as a
    pleasant experience in the evening. So if we did not have the
    unpleasant experience, you won't have made this discovery
    about the pleasant experience in the evening. So it shows
    that we can learn from unpleasant experiences, we can learn
    from pleasant experiences. Therefore we should learn to be
    open to both unpleasant experiences and pleasant experiences.</p>
    <p>Anyone else like to share their experience of this
    morning's meditation?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 5: </b>When we meditate at
    home, is it better that we don't choose the time when we are
    too tired to do meditation. In this morning I was too sleepy.
    I was not strong enough to concentrate.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Whether you
    are at home or here, I would like to suggest that try to
    experiment when you are tired as well, otherwise it is very
    easy to say, &#145;I feel tired, so I know my meditation
    doesn't work, so let me sleep.&#146; That's how we pamper
    ourselves. Always saying <i>yes</i> to what the body is
    wanting.</p>
    <p>So we need to break that conditioning in a very friendly,
    gentle, kind way. So it means some days to say yes to the
    body and some days to say no to the body. So tomorrow morning
    also if you still feel tired, you must tell the body:
    &#145;Yesterday I gave in to you, I said <i>yes</i>, today,
    I'm going to say <i>no</i>.&#146; So it is very very
    important to learn to have this kind of dialogue with the
    body, with oneself. So learning to say no and then you come
    to the hall, you come to meditate and you're seeing what is
    happening.</p>
    <p>There is a very interesting dialogue in the Buddhist texts
    between the Buddha and a monk who was feeling lazy, drowsy,
    tired when meditating. So the Buddha offered some very
    interesting suggestions on how to work with that condition.</p>
    <p>So the first suggestion the Buddha offered was: change
    your posture so if you are sitting, do some standing
    meditation, do some walking meditation. And I like to suggest
    in that situation to do some very fast walking, or also to
    walk backwards because to walk backwards you have to be very
    alert and awake. Immediately you start walking backwards, you
    will be awake. By the way, this reminds me of a very strict
    meditation Master in Thailand. He gave this suggestion to
    meditators. So, in that centre, there was a well, a deep
    well. So he told his meditators to sit on the edge of the
    well. So if he was tired, he would be killed. Unfortunately,
    there are no wells here!</p>
    <p>Another suggestion the Buddha offered was if that did not
    work, rub your earlobes. I would see that as trying to
    stimulate the body. And the Buddha said if that does not
    work, go out and look at the stars. Maybe the discussion took
    place in the evening like this when there are stars. I would
    suggest that as trying to stimulate the mind by something
    external. If that does not work, try to think of something
    very inspiring from the Dhamma that will really develop a
    sense of urgency.</p>
    <p>If that does not work, please induce a bright light. Some
    meditators see bright light, so maybe this monk was seeing
    bright light so he said induce a bright light and again it
    can stimulate him. And if that doesn't work, go to sleep.</p>
    <p>Why did he say go to sleep? Why was the Buddha encouraging
    that monk to sleep?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 2: </b>Is it because the
    body when it gets tired needs to get a rest?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Yes, in a way.
    This technique, this experimentation will help him to find
    out whether it has a psychological reason or it has a
    physical reason. So it shows that sometimes and maybe most of
    the time feeling tired is not something physical but it is
    psychological. So with these different techniques, Buddha was
    encouraging this monk to find out whether it has a physical
    reason or a psychological reason. Then if the techniques
    fail, it shows it has a physical reason, then we should learn
    to feel kind to the body.</p>
    <p>And from the Buddha's instructions, it is also very
    interesting that he encouraged monks and meditators to
    experiment, to explore, find out for yourself. In a way, this
    is what I am encouraging you to do by observing, by learning,
    make your own discoveries about your own mind and body and
    how they work. Our mind and body are so close to us but in a
    way they are so far away from us because we have not learned,
    we have not discovered, we have not experimented. So this is
    why in meditation one should see the practice as not
    achieving certain states of mind but rather learning,
    discovering, exploring. It is a beautiful way to relate to
    meditation.</p>
    <p>So from the morning meditation, we had tea from 6:00 to
    6:30 and I suggested you go out and seeing things very
    sharply, seeing things very clearly. Anyone likes to share
    some experience in this regard?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 2: </b>I would like to share
    some of my viewpoint on what you taught today. I find the
    meditation technique that you taught today quite useful. You
    told us to watch the mind just like a mother watching her
    son. With this kind of mentality, I really felt great during
    the meditation. On my breathing, whatever thought arose, my
    feelings and senses, I can use the mentality of a mother
    watching her son and I can feel I can be detached from those
    thoughts and be calm.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>It is
    important to have that kind of attitude, that we are learning
    to be friendly, gentle and then just knowing what is
    happening. And whatever is happening, again learning to be
    friendly without resisting them, and as Jack said,
    immediately you can find some relief, some release if you
    have that friendly attitude. So it is resistance which is
    creating the suffering. It is the same thing what comes
    internally or even external events. It is when we resist
    external events that sometime suffering comes. So here is an
    attitude where without resisting, with friendliness, you just
    know what is happening. Feeling friendly doesn't mean giving
    in to what is happening but working with it with friendliness
    and gentleness, so we ought to see the difference. It is very
    important to realize that it is not giving in but rather a
    way of working with it.</p>
    <p>From 6:00 to 6:30, any one had any experiences?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 1: </b>When I have food, all
    my mindfulness disappeared. My whole mind was on food.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>I'm talking
    about drinking tea at 6:00 to 6:30, we did not have food. So
    we are still with the tea break.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 3: </b>At 6:30, he ate
    noodles!</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>O! He started
    eating! Did any one have any experiences with nature at that
    time? I suggested seeing things, hearing things very sharply,
    very clearly at that time.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 3: </b>At that time, I tried
    to put your direction into practice by looking at things
    sharply and clearly but no matter how I tried, everything
    looked the same to me as usual. No sharper, no clearer.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Very good. So
    we should try tomorrow also. So I'll say what I have in mind
    about seeing things very clearly.</p>
    <p>Suppose we are looking at a tree. So can we have our
    complete and full attention on seeing that tree at that time?
    And is it possible to see that tree as if for the first time?
    This is really a very interesting aspect.</p>
    <p>Is it possible to see things with less thought or no
    thought? Because when we see things with our pre-occupations,
    we don't really see anything very clearly. So it means really
    learning to awaken our senses. We have not made an effort to
    cultivate this awakening of our senses, the sense of hearing,
    the sense of seeing. So we have to make a conscious effort
    sometimes.</p>
    <p>I think another aspect we have neglected is the sense of
    smelling. So tomorrow let us all make an effort to awaken our
    senses, seeing very clearly, hearing things and also allow
    smelling to arise. There are some white flowers here and
    those white flowers give a very very beautiful scent. So
    slowly slowly let us make an effort, let us experiment with
    it, let us play with it and developing our senses in this
    way.</p>
    <p>You can also try with the Buddha image here, just looking
    at the Buddha image with our complete and full attention,
    with less thought or no thought.</p>
    <p>After that, there was yoga. I'm sure you experienced
    something when doing yoga.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 2: </b>There were many
    mosquitoes.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Very good, so
    there were many mosquitoes. Important discovery. So during
    yoga, you were only with the mosquitoes?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 5: </b>There were many
    ants.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>So mosquitoes,
    ants.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 5: </b>They were marching.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>And marching.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 6: </b>This is the first
    time I've done yoga with nature. It is also the first time
    that I tried to put my mind on my body when doing yoga and I
    found it was very peaceful and still.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Anyone else
    like to say what happened during yoga? Were the postures
    difficult? You can say yes or no.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 2: </b>Yes.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>So you were
    not only with the mosquitoes, you were also with some of the
    postures. That's good to hear.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 5: </b>I found that
    because I enjoy the atmosphere, I forgot that it was
    difficult. Actually, it seems to be difficult but I seem to
    enjoy it so I didn't think whether it was difficult or not.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Because you
    enjoyed it. An interesting point. So when you enjoy something
    you really do not see whether it is difficult or not. Did you
    experience physical pain? Yes or no?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 1: </b>Yes.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Very good.
    That shows yoga is working. It shows you have a body and that
    body can have pain. It also shows that you should continue
    with the yoga because you have not practised such exercises.
    Anyone else want to say something about yoga?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 4: </b>The postures changed
    too quickly so I felt that the exercises were interrupted and
    not smooth.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>So maybe Jack
    should take this into consideration. Anyone else experienced
    the same thing as him?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 7: </b>I have practised
    yoga for quite a while and when doing yoga, you have to do a
    series of postures, not to do a particular posture a few
    times. I would like to explain this because that is the
    purpose of yoga. It is a series of postures, so it had to be
    kept changing.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>How did you
    feel when doing yoga?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 8: </b>I didn't feel much
    pain because Jack said just do it according to your ability
    so I didn't push myself.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Very good. The
    person next to you, I like to ask what happened to you when
    you were doing yoga.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 9: </b>It's a bit
    difficult. It could be because I'm a bit fat.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Anyway, what
    is happening to our body is coming from our head, but what
    happened to your body when you were doing the yoga?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 9: </b>Although some of
    the postures were a bit difficult for me but I still enjoyed
    the yoga and I found the blood circulation smooth.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>So there you
    are, these are the benefits of yoga, the blood circulation.
    So that is the sense of yoga.</p>
    <p>What about you?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 10: </b>Very good. When
    you saw me last year, I was very fat. Am I thinner this year?
    Yoga makes a deep impression on me. Teacher has made a
    connection between Buddhism, yoga and meditation. I feel that
    it is more comfortable to meditate after doing yoga and the
    mindfulness gets stronger. Yoga is the prelude but meditation
    is the essence. Apart from benefits to the body and
    meditation, yoga also makes one healthy and the healthiness
    comes as a by-product.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>In a way, yoga
    can also be a meditation. The word yoga means union, so it's
    a union between the mind and body, integration of the mind
    and body, harmonizing the mind and body.</p>
    <p>Going back to the question you asked, what is the answer
    you like to receive?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 9: </b>You should know
    without saying.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>I think you
    have put on a little more weight, just a little bit more fat.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 11: </b>I think she is
    slimmer than last year.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>So two persons
    are giving two different answers, so you should not take what
    others think seriously. What is your own feeling? What do you
    think of yourself?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 10: </b>I feel I'm
    healthier. Before, I did not even have the strength to carry
    a water melon. Also my spine is straight when I sit and I get
    less tired.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Am I fatter or
    thinner than last time?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 10: </b>More handsome !</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Thank you. So
    this is the beauty of a discussion like this where a group of
    spiritual friends get together, can laugh, have lightness,
    and at the same time learn from our experiences.</p>
    <p>From yoga, we come to breakfast. Would it make a
    difference eating in silence, eating in awareness?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 12: </b>Nothing special.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Talking about
    silence, how are you relating to silence? Is it disturbing
    you, is it O.K.? Any thoughts about silence? Any experiences
    about silence?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 1: </b>Very difficult.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>But I don't
    see you practising silence!! Anyway the fact that it is
    difficult shows it is a very strong habit that we have. And
    you know it is very very difficult to stop a strong habit.
    Some meditators told me when they stop talking to others,
    they start talking to themselves. And some meditators told me
    when other people are silent, she felt the others were
    punishing her.</p>
    <p>So I think in a way because it is difficult, we should
    still experiment with such situations and then ideally, you
    realise how space is created by silence.</p>
    <p>I think another aspect of talking is perhaps to prevent
    certain things from arising. Things you have put away,
    repressed, controlled. In some very intense silent retreats,
    some meditators told me how with silence, they suddenly have
    unexpected memories arising from childhood which have been
    completely forgotten. And sometimes some of these unexpected
    memories that come up can be extremely helpful for one to
    understand one's behaviour. Just to give an example of an
    experience of a woman. I like to share that experience with
    you. There was a woman in a 10-day retreat, she was from
    England. Suddenly she had a memory that as a 7-year-old girl,
    she had tried to commit suicide by shooting herself in a dark
    room. She had completely forgotten this experience, maybe
    because it was very unpleasant for her. But it was a very
    helpful memory for her because she was afraid of the
    darkness. Another thing is that she was very self destructive
    to herself. She would take risks about her body and so on. So
    then I had a discussion with her and we realized the suicidal
    tendency in trying to destroy herself is manifesting itself
    in different ways.</p>
    <p>Another aspect of talking and silence is that when we
    talk, we feel as if we are somebody. So when we are silent,
    we feel as if we are nobody and we feel uncomfortable with
    this feeling of nobody.</p>
    <p>So another important aspect of silence is that it helps us
    to be alone with our mind and body all the time. So it has
    some very very important interesting aspect, so I certainly
    agree that it is difficult but certainly, it is worthwhile.</p>
    <p>There is an interesting story from the Tibetan tradition
    where in a place one has to practise complete silence for one
    year and after one year, the student can go and speak to the
    Master and mention only two words. So after one year, the
    student went to the Master and said: &quot;More food&quot;.
    So for probably for one year he was thinking only of food. </p>
    <p>Anyway, these are some thoughts about silence so I like to
    suggest that tomorrow there will be times when you have to
    speak, and when you have to speak we should learn to speak
    with awareness, what is called &#145;right speech&#146;. So
    silence is important, right speech is important.</p>
    <p>So there are so many things we can learn from our speech.
    When we speak to another person, do we really listen to that
    other person? Can you speak clearly? Can you speak very
    briefly what you have to say rather than continuing to speak
    and sometimes confusing yourself and confusing others? How
    far can we be aware and mindful when we speak? We can learn
    these skills here. In everyday life, this is one of the
    greatest problems we have, that we have problems because of
    our speech, especially in relationships, how we can hurt each
    other with wrong speech. So as I said, silence is important
    as it has many important aspects and also right speech is
    important because that also has many aspects. The Buddha
    encouraged us to speak gentle words, kind words, helpful
    words, words which can be healing to others. On the other
    hand, we can hurt another person, it can be more harmful, it
    can hurt another person more than something physical.</p>
    <p>So the time for discussion is over. So I like to say
    something about tomorrow. Today, in a way, there was a lot of
    time for you to rest and you realized that you might have
    been tired and you have not been able to sleep well so I hope
    today you had a good rest and you will try to sleep well
    tonight.</p>
