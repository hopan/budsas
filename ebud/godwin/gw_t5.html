    <hr width="25%">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin:</b></font></p>
    <p>I like to welcome you once again. As you know, the subject
    of the talk is meditation on loving kindness. The words
    &quot;<i>loving kindness</i>&quot; come from the Pali word
    &quot;Metta&quot;. It is sometimes translated as loving
    kindness, as compassion and it literally means friendliness.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Loving Kindness Begins with
    Ourselves</b></font></p>
    <p>It is psychologically very interesting that the meditation
    of loving kindness has to begin with oneself. So it is
    extremely important to learn to be friendly to oneself. The
    phrase I like to use is: learning to be your best friend in a
    most friendly way. To make this very important connection
    with ourself. Feel at ease with oneself. Feel at home with
    oneself. So to feel yourself as if you are coming home to
    yourself. So it is only when we make this connection with
    ourselves that we can really feel friendly to others. It is
    only then that we can really open our hearts to others. If we
    do not make this connection with ourselves, what happens is
    we start to hate ourselves, we start to dislike ourselves. It
    becomes a habit to give ourselves minuses. In this way, you
    learn to become your enemy in a way and this can create a lot
    of suffering for ourselves and also suffering for others. So
    this is one very important aspect of loving kindness,
    learning to be friendly to oneself, learning to open your
    heart to oneself and learning to open your heart to others.
    When I speak, with what I'm going to say, you can relate to
    yourself in your experience. Please make an effort to do
    that, then my talk will be a meditation by itself.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Forgiveness &amp; Wounds in Our
    Heart</b></font></p>
    <p>Another important aspect of loving kindness is using
    forgiveness. Human beings carry what I call &quot;<i>wounds</i>&quot;.
    Wounds created by what you have done to others and wounds
    created by what others have done to you. I think everyone
    here, including myself, can relate to this. What happens with
    some human beings is they carry these wounds within
    themselves. So if you carry these wounds without healing
    them, again as I said earlier, we can create suffering for
    oneself, suffering to others, without knowing that the
    suffering is in relation to the wounds you have created. It
    can also affect our body in two ways. We can be having
    certain tensions in different parts of our body. It is
    related to these wounds, it is related to the repressed
    emotions. These wounds also can create certain illnesses.
    Another way it can affect us is that they can affect our
    sleep. Do we have fearful dreams, do we get angry in our
    dreams or be crying in our sleep? So another way it can
    affect us is that suddenly we can be affected by these
    emotions and we don't know why we are affected by these
    emotions. Suddenly we feel like crying. Suddenly there is
    fear. Suddenly there is sadness. And one cannot find the
    reason for it.</p>
    <p>Another way it can affect us is that when we die the
    emotions, the wounds can come up. It is interesting to find
    out why at the time of death they should surface. While we
    are living, we may not look at them, we may repress them, we
    may push them away, but at the time that we die when our mind
    and body become weak, these wounds can surface. So it shows
    that we cannot live peacefully, we cannot sleep peacefully,
    we cannot die peacefully. Therefore it is extremely important
    to learn to heal these wounds. So meditation of loving
    kindness can help us to heal these wounds by learning to
    forgive ourselves and learning to forgive others. Forgive
    ourselves for realizing that we are only humans. Forgiving
    others by realizing that they are only humans. Also learning
    to let go of them by realizing that they happened in the
    past. We cannot change the past, so why should we carry the
    past as a burden to create more and more suffering for
    ourselves and others.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Make Friends with Unpleasant
    Situations</b></font></p>
    <p>Another very important aspect of loving kindness is
    learning to use loving kindness to relate to unpleasant
    situations, unpleasant emotions when they are there. When we
    have unpleasant emotions, when we have physical pain, mental
    pain, we don't like them, we hate them, we dislike them, we
    resist them. In a way by doing that we give them more power,
    more energy. In such situations, we can use meditation on
    loving kindness by learning to make friends with these
    unpleasant situations. One very simple way of making friends
    with them is by learning to say to yourself: it is OK not to
    be OK (i.e. say OK to unpleasant situation).</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>See Positive Elements in Us</b></font></p>
    <p>Another very important aspect of loving kindness is
    learning to see the positive elements in us, to see the
    goodness in us, to see the Buddha nature in us. One way of
    being our own enemy is seeing only our mistakes, seeing only
    the negative things, only giving minuses to ourselves. So it
    is extremely important to learn to see the positive elements
    in us, it is very important to learn to give pluses to
    ourselves, learning to see our goodness, learning to see our
    Buddha nature in us. And when we learn to do this, what
    happens is we see the positive elements in others, we learn
    to give more and more pluses to others, we see more and more
    the Buddha nature in others and then you come to a stage
    where you won't see a difference between yourself and others.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Be Kind to Others</b></font></p>
    <p>Another very important aspect of loving kindness is
    learning to do kind things, learning to do compassionate
    things for others. When you develop more and more loving
    kindness within yourselves, then naturally your actions, your
    speech, your words are related to the positive aspect of
    loving kindness. And when we learn to be friendly to others,
    when we learn to be kind to others, when you learn to feel
    for others, this can also give lots of joy and happiness
    because when you see others happy because of your own
    actions, this can bring lots of joy, lots of lightness in
    ourselves. </p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>But Not Allow Others to Exploit
    You</b></font></p>
    <p>Having loving kindness is not allowing others to exploit
    you, not allowing others to do what they like to do. It is
    very very important to learn that there are times when we
    have to assert ourselves, when we have to learn to be firm
    with others. In this connection, I like to relate a story
    that I like very much and relating on the story I will end my
    talk.</p>
    <p>The story is about a cobra who was practising loving
    kindness. So there was this cobra in a forest practising
    loving kindness saying: may all beings be well, may all
    beings be happy, may all beings be free of suffering. There
    was an old woman who could not see properly. She was
    collecting fire wood and she saw the cobra, she thought it
    was a rope. She used the &quot;rope&quot; to bundle the fire
    wood she had collected. As the cobra was practising loving
    kindness, the cobra allowed the old woman to do this. The old
    woman carried the bundle of fire wood home. Then the cobra
    escaped with some difficulties, with lots of pain, with lots
    of wounds in the body. And the cobra went to meet the cobra's
    master. So the cobra told the master, &#145;See what has
    happened. I adopt your loving kindness. See the wounds, see
    the pain that I'm experiencing in my body.&#146; So the
    master very calmly, gently told the cobra, &#145;You have not
    been practising loving kindness, you have been practising <i>foolish</i>
    loving kindness. You should have just shown, hissed, that you
    are a snake, you are a cobra.&#146; So it is very important
    that in everyday life we also have to learn what the cobra
    should learn.</p>
    <p>So now it is time for questions. Any questions relating to
    loving kindness, specially in everyday life, any
    difficulties, problems you have.</p>
    <hr align="left" width="25%">
    <p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Q&amp;A</b></font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">Master, if we practise in giving ourselves
    all the pluses, all the good sides in ourselves, where is the
    line to be drawn?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>When we have
    got used to giving minus, when we have got used to seeing the
    unpleasant elements in us, when we are relating to ourselves
    as an enemy, how do we work with this situation? So this is
    the important issue. So in such situation, just to realize:
    I'm only giving minuses to myself, aren't there good things
    that I've done? So we are learning to also see the good
    things factually, objectively, without of course being
    conceited about it but simply as a fact. So we learn to see
    the goodness, we learn to see the positive side so you see,
    learning to see things as they are as the Buddha said. This
    is the important thing. Then as I also said, we learn to see
    the goodness in others which also helps us to appreciate.
    Also when we see goodness in others, learning to be happy
    when you see goodness in others. So in this way, you learn
    very important spiritual qualities which are helping our
    practice.</p>
    <p>I like to ask a question and I ask this whenever I visit a
    country. Which is easier to do: to forgive oneself or to
    forgive others? So please reflect on yourself and give an
    answer from your heart.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">It's not easy to forgive oneself.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Does everyone
    agree?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font>No.</p>
    <p><font color="#800000">(By show of hands, audience
    indicated who considered it easier to forgive oneself and who
    considered it easier to forgive others).</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Thank you.
    What does it indicate? It indicates in a way those who find
    it difficult to forgive themselves, it means that they are
    very hard on themselves. So they are too stone-hearted on
    themselves to say: I don't deserve to be forgiven. And then
    others who find it difficult to forgive others, they can be
    very very hard on others. So you see the importance of
    developing softness, you realize the importance of being
    gentle, you feel the importance of feeling tender to oneself
    and to others. So when you develop these qualities,
    naturally, you can forgive yourself and you can forgive
    others. So as I said, what we have to learn and I think it is
    extremely important, is to learn to accept our humanness,
    learn to accept we are imperfect human beings, that we still
    have shortcomings. In the same say, we have to realize that
    we are living in a world where people are imperfect, where
    people are humans, so you're bound to see the shortcomings,
    human frailties arising from others and from yourself. So
    according to the Buddha's teaching, we have greed, we have
    hatred, we have delusion in us and in others. So because of
    greed, hatred and delusion, we shall have shortcomings and
    make mistakes. Only someone who are completely enlightened
    will not have these shortcomings but as long as we are not
    enlightened, we are human, we are imperfect. So I feel that
    it is extremely important to learn to realize this, to accept
    this and learn to forgive ourselves and to forgive others and
    then when you can see in these terms, as I said, you will be
    able to forgive yourself and forgive others.</p>
    <p>Any questions?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">Due to the impermanence in life, there are
    all kinds of suffering. What can we do about it?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Actually I
    would like to discuss only loving kindness because it is the
    subject that we are discussing. So I will give a very brief
    response to the question of impermanence. We suffer from
    impermanence because we don't accept impermanence, we don't
    accept change. We will take one example. We are healthy and
    then because of the law of impermanence or the law of change,
    we become sick. So we suffer because we have expectations: I
    should not fall sick. So in this way, when we have this
    resistance to change, to impermanence, there will be
    suffering so the way out is to be open to change, to be open
    to impermanence, to accept that as a fact of life. So this is
    where again the Buddha said: Learning to accept things just
    as they are, and not as they should or should not be.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">You said we should learn to love this friend,
    but when we see the bad thoughts or bad desires in us, how
    can we love this friend when this friend is so bad? Isn't
    that like covering ourselves in a way?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Very good
    question. We again take a couple of practical examples. Take
    the example of anger, when we get angry, what happens? We are
    angry about our anger. We start sometimes, hating ourselves
    because we are getting angry and then we suffer from guilt
    because we have got angry. So because of this anger and
    because you are relating to this in this way, you can suffer
    for days. So in using loving kindness you relate to the anger
    in an entirely different way. So rather than beat yourself,
    rather than giving yourself a minus, rather than suffering
    and feeling guilty, in a very friendly gentle way, as I have
    been saying so often, you'll find out: How did I get angry?
    So as I have been saying a few times, we can learn from that
    anger, we can use that anger for our spiritual growth. This
    is what I mean by being friendly. The way I'm suggesting
    helps us to work with the anger in an entirely different way,
    rather than giving in to them. It's not really pampering
    ourselves, but by learning to work with the anger in a
    different way, in a more effective way rather than suffering
    too much as a result of that anger. And another point is,
    when you are friendly to yourself and when you are open to
    yourself, you'll be also realizing when you're not angry,
    which is also very important. So then we come to a stage when
    we are livid, we know what to do with the anger and when we
    are not angry, we know we are not angry.</p>
    <p>Any other question?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">Learning to practise forgiveness is easier to
    say than to do specially when it comes to people who are
    close to you like parents, very very good friends, brothers
    and sisters. It is very difficult to forgive them. When it
    comes to friends who are not so close to you, not so
    friendly, then it's easier to forgive them. What can we do?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Very
    interesting question which I think all of us can relate to.
    It is interesting actually to reflect why with people to whom
    we are close that they can create wounds. The simple reason
    is because they are close to us, maybe friends, relations,
    then we have an image expecting how they should behave. A
    good simile to understand this is that we put them on a
    pedestal by saying he's my best friend, so therefore my best
    friend should behave this way. She's my mother so therefore
    she should behave this way. So you see the demands we are
    making from them because they are close to us and poor
    people, they fall from the pedestal that you have put them
    on, and when they fall from the pedestal we don't realize
    that we are the persons who put them on a pedestal and we get
    disappointed, we suffer. And someone can carry these wounds
    throughout one's life. So one should really see what it does
    to yourself because of your ideas about how others should
    behave. To put the same thing another way, we forget that
    they are also humans.</p>
    <p>There is time for one last question.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">Do you mean we should not have any
    expectations of others or should we not be attached to
    people?</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>I think it is
    natural that we have expectations but what we forget is how
    far our expectations are realistic. How far are you prepared
    to meet up with your expectations about yourself? How far
    others can meet up with your expectations? How realistic are
    your expectations? This is what one has to be clear about. I
    know some people who are very idealistic. Very idealistic
    about themselves, very idealistic about others and they live
    in a very idealistic world. This idealistic world that we
    have created is one thing and what we are realizing is
    another thing. So as one has to hold into this idealistic
    world, as long as we hold onto this perfect world, we are
    bound to create wounds in relation to your own behaviour and
    in relation to the behaviour of others. According to the
    Buddha, until and unless we are enlightened, we are all
    crazy. Crazy in the sense that we can't see things as they
    are. The problem with us is we take this crazy world
    seriously. And also a reminder of a very interesting saying
    in Tibetan Buddhism: Enlightened people behave like ordinary
    people. Ordinary people try to be like enlightened people.</p>
    <p>I'm very happy that you asked very good practical
    questions on loving kindness. So now we take a small break
    and after the break, we will be having a meditation on loving
    kindness. So during the break I would suggest to please use a
    few minutes just to learn to be friendly to: </p>
    <p>Learning to open your heart like opening a flower.</p>
    <p>And can you feel yourself as your best friend?</p>
    <p>Can you really feel it, feel it in every part of your
    body, your whole being?</p>
    <p>Feeling yourself as your best friend, can you really say
    these words with some feeling: May I be well?</p>
    <p>Really wishing yourself, that you will be well physically
    and mentally.</p>
    <p>May I be happy. Feel happy that you are learning to do
    meditation of loving kindness.</p>
    <p>May I be peaceful. Can you really feel the peace and the
    stillness in this room?</p>
    <p>Feel the peace in every part of the body. </p>
    <p>Let us now look at our wounds. Look to the wounds in
    relation to what you have done to others, we try to forgive
    us by feeling that you are your best friend, by accepting we
    are humans. And those who do not have such wounds, feel happy
    that you do not have such wounds.</p>
    <p>You can feel the area of your heart and say to yourself: I
    forgive myself. I forgive myself.</p>
    <p>Those who have wounds in relation to what others have done
    to them, let us think of them and forgive them. Those who
    don't have such wounds, feel happy that you don't have such
    wounds.</p>
    <p>I forgive you. Forgiving you, may you be well, may you be
    happy, may you be free of suffering.</p>
    <p>Can we really say these words from our heart?</p>
    <p>When we are leaving our wounds, may we experience more
    joy, more lightness, more friendliness.</p>
    <p>I understand this is a day for ancestors, let us think of
    the ancestors and especially our parents whether they are
    alive or whether they are dead.</p>
    <p>Can we live with thoughts of loving kindness to our
    parents?</p>
    <p>Can we feel grateful to our parents?</p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#800000">[End of meditation]</font></p>
    <p>Let us do some chanting. I'm happy that the chanting is
    improving every day, both the Pali chanting and the Chinese
    chanting.</p>
