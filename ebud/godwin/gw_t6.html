<blockquote>
    <p>I would like to once again welcome you.</p>
    <p>The subject of today's talk is about emotions. What can be
    described as unpleasant emotions which create our suffering.
    We can consider some such emotions: anger, fear, anxiety,
    sadness, loneliness, feeling of guilt, jealousy. I think
    everyone here can relate to these emotions. I think no one
    here has not really experienced them. And I think everywhere
    in the world these emotions that I mentioned, people go
    through them.</p>
    <p>So it is actually these emotions which create our
    suffering, which create conflict in us. So it is very
    important to find out how meditation helps us to work with
    these emotions. So I hope to present some tools to work with
    them. Some of these tools you might have heard me mentioning
    before.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Be Open to Unpleasant Emotions</b></font></p>
    <p>So what is the first tool? The first tool is very
    difficult in a way, as I have been saying a few times, is
    learning to be open to these unpleasant emotions. It is a
    very strong conditioning not to like them, in a way to hate
    them, to dislike them and so on, because they are unpleasant
    when we experience them. So as I said, it is very important
    to learn to be open to them, to learn to be friendly towards
    them. So we have to learn to do this gradually, gently,
    tenderly in our practice.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Learning About Emotions</b></font></p>
    <p>The next tool is learning to explore, investigate,
    discover, make an effort to learn about them. Because we
    don't like them, because we hate them, we never make an
    effort to learn about them, to discover about them. We can
    learn a great deal about these emotions. One thing that we
    can learn is to see the connection between thoughts and
    emotions. So we see how emotions are created, and when we
    understand and see how emotions are created, to a great
    extent, we can work with them, handle them. And when we are
    prepared to learn about them, discover about them, then we
    learn to be open to them as I said earlier.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Invite Unpleasant Emotions</b></font></p>
    <p>Another interesting tool related to this is that when we
    don't have these emotions, invite them and allow them to
    come. It is very very interesting that when we invite them,
    they don't come. Because when we fear them, when we don't
    like them, we give them more power and more energy. So when
    we are open, when we invite them, the power and energy we
    have given is taken away. Maybe today when we are meditating,
    we will invite the monsters that we don't like.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Knowing the Absence of Unpleasant
    Emotions</b></font></p>
    <p>Another very important tool is when these unpleasant
    emotions are not there, to know that they are not there. As I
    said, as we have given them power and as we don't like them,
    what happens is, we are afraid of them and by being afraid of
    them, when they are absent, we hardly know that they are
    absent. So by knowing when they are absent, we learn to be
    more and more positive. To give a practical example, when we
    have a toothache, we really suffer from the toothache but
    when we don't have a toothache, do we ever say &#145;Wow! I
    don't have a toothache&#146;? Even when we don't have a
    toothache, we think maybe it will come tomorrow. So it is too
    good to believe that they can be absent. So I would like to
    emphasize this tool very much, that when these unpleasant
    emotions are not there, just to know that they are not there.
    Maybe now you may not be having these unpleasant emotions, so
    please know that they are not there now.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Unpleasant Emotions Are Visitors
    Who Don&#146;t Belong to Us</b></font></p>
    <p>Another very deep tool is to realize they don't really
    belong to us. We have a sense of ownership even with these
    emotions. So when there is anger, you think it is <i>my</i>
    anger. When there is fear, you think it is <i>my</i> fear. So
    as you know, what we consider &quot;<i>mine&quot;</i> which
    we think we own, we don't like to let go. This point is
    presented in the Dhamma in a very interesting way which means
    learning to relate to these emotions as our visitors, as our
    guests. So we have to be a very friendly good host and we can
    really learn from the visitors who come. We should realize
    that these visitors come, and they stay and they go away. So
    when they come, we must say, &#145;Welcome, please come, it's
    nice to have you here, how long will you be staying? It would
    be interesting to see how long you are going to stay.&#146;
    And when they leave you say, &#145;Goodbye, welcome to come
    again.&#146; Isn't it a beautiful way of relating to our
    visitors? So there is a kind of playfulness, light
    heartiness, joy, if you can relate to these emotions in this
    way.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Experience Emotions without Words</b></font></p>
    <p>Maybe one more tool is when we experience these emotions,
    we have given them words. So sometimes we are conditioned by
    the words themselves. So a very interesting tool is when
    these emotions come, to relate to them, to experience them
    without the word. Take away the word and see what actually
    you are experiencing. So that by giving a word we relate to
    it from the past but when we take away the word, you are
    really experiencing it from moment to moment. We are really
    being present with the emotion.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Summary of Tools</b></font></p>
    <p>So let me go over the tools that I presented. So the first
    one is learning to be open to them. The next one is to make
    an effort to learn about them, to experiment about them.
    Another tool is when they are not there, to invite them.
    Another is when they are absent, just to know that they are
    absent. Another is to relate to them without a sense of
    ownership, just to see them as visitors who come and go.
    Another is to take away the word and really see what actually
    you are experiencing.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Develop Self-confidence</b></font></p>
    <p>Now what is important is when you have discovered these
    tools and when you know that they work, you develop lot of
    self- confidence about handling these emotions. The biggest
    problem is that we don't have self-confidence and when we
    don't have self-confidence, in a way we are already defeated,
    we have already become victims of them. So when you have
    self-confidence, then you become open to them, then you come
    to a stage whether these emotions are there or not there make
    no difference.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>See Emotions Just as They Are</b></font></p>
    <p>Now what happens is when we have pleasant states of mind,
    pleasant emotions, we like them, we give them a big plus. And
    when we try to hold onto them and when we cannot succeed,
    then again, suffering. And when there is unpleasant emotions,
    as I said, we don't like them, so we give them a minus. So
    can we relate to these states of mind without a plus, without
    a minus, just learning to see them just as they are.</p>
    <p>Now if you have any questions, please ask them, specially
    practical questions relating to the tools and maybe your own
    experience in working with them.</p>
    <hr align="left" width="25%">
    <p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Q&amp;A</b></font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">When there is emotion in general which
    appears in the mind, there is not much problem, we can deal
    with it with the tools that you told us before. However, if
    there are big wounds in our heart and when these wounds come
    out, great emotions develop, then naturally we react to them
    and we become nervous and sad. So are there any other tools
    we can make use of in order to deal with this sort of big
    emotion as opposed to general emotions.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Can you give
    an example of what you have in mind?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">It could be wounds which hurt many years ago
    or many lifetimes ago. It's just like a rat being pricked by
    needles.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Yeah. When I
    spoke about loving kindness yesterday I spent lot of time
    telling you how to heal these wounds. So I don't like to
    repeat them but just to remind you that when you have these
    wounds, if it is wounds in relation to what you have done to
    others, it is just learning to forgive yourself, accepting
    your humanness, accepting your imperfections. And if it is
    wounds in relation to what others have done to you, it is
    again forgiving them by realizing their humanness, their
    imperfections.</p>
    <p>Anything else please.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">Recently, something happened to me and I
    watched my own emotions and it was very funny. It was like
    some very good cold water running through my heart, and it
    was a very big disappointment at the time, but after
    observing that I survived quickly. And my question is whether
    it is true that emotions have more to do with the heart and
    thoughts have more to do with the brain.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>I think it
    doesn't matter, my dear friend, whether it's in the brain or
    the heart. These are theoretical questions. We have to be
    very simple. In using the tools, we have to have a very
    simple, practical, direct approach. This is the beauty of the
    Buddha's teaching. I would like to repeat these words, it is
    very simple, very practical, it is very direct.</p>
    <p>Anything else please.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">You said earlier that we should not give
    words to emotions. So how do we observe the emotions?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Very good
    practical question. I like such questions. Suppose you are
    experiencing boredom. So you take away the word boredom and
    find out what you are actually experiencing. Is it a
    sensation that you are calling boredom? Is it a particular
    thought that you are considering as boredom? Is it a
    particular feeling which you have categorized as boredom? So
    when we can find out like this, boredom can become very
    interesting.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">Master, my question is: all human beings have
    many bad habits like gambling, womanizing, drinking, smoking.
    How do we handle these bad habits?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Very
    interesting list. Actually, one of the aspects of meditation
    is working with habits. What has happened to us is that we
    have become dependent on these habits. So what happens is
    that we respond to these habits in a very very mechanical
    way. The word comes and then we just give in to them. So one
    suggestion I like to offer is, again this is very important
    in the practice of awareness, just to know when these habits
    arise, to be conscious of them, to be aware of them so at
    least we can work with the mechanical aspect of these habits.
    The second suggestion I like to offer is to see for yourself
    how it creates suffering for yourself, how it can create
    suffering for others and does it give you joy, lightness and
    positive spiritual qualities?</p>
    <p>The third suggestion is when you are not experiencing
    these things, when you have not given in to these habits,
    just to see the difference when they are absent in your mind.
    Then you see in your own experience when they are present
    what it does to you and when they are absent what it does to
    you. So then they will naturally drop away on their own. And
    as I said earlier, it is also very important to develop
    self-confidence: I know I have these habits but let me make a
    real effort to work with them. To make a real commitment,
    dedication, devotion. To work with these habits can be
    something very very useful.</p>
    <p>And maybe the last suggestion. It is helpful to associate
    with spiritual friends, noble friends. And it is helpful to
    share your experiences with them and they can be also very
    very supportive in the spiritual path you are following.</p>
    <p>One last suggestion is please don't feel guilty, don't
    feel bad, don't consider yourself as a sinner because you are
    doing these things. Don't see them as problems but see them
    as a challenge that you need to work with.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">We shouldn't put words to our emotions but if
    I have anger and I put it down and I'm suppose to observe it
    but when I do not have emotion how can I observe without
    emotion?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Supposing we
    are working with anger. I think anger is a common emotion
    that we can all relate to. So then when we don't have anger,
    just to know: Ah, I don't have anger now. You can take your
    mind backwards and say, the whole of this morning I did not
    get angry. At the end of the day you might say : Oh, today,
    the whole day I was free of anger. You'll be surprised what a
    good person you have been and then you'll feel more and more
    positive about this.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">With emotions, it's never too late to
    revenge. Sometimes you can put it down and forgive but it
    arises again, so what can you do about it?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Good question.
    Because again we can relate to such experience. So I like to
    offer some suggestions how to work with such situations. The
    first suggestion is: don't be surprised. This is the way with
    emotions, sometimes they don't come, and then sometimes they
    come. So when they come, please don't be surprised. When
    emotions go, we come to the conclusion &quot;now it is all
    over&quot;. So the problems is with our conclusion that they
    should not come. The second suggestion is, I mean I can go
    over the tools again so when they arise again, to be aware of
    them and to use different tools but without giving yourself a
    minus. This is what is important. But arising from that
    question I like to emphasize something very very important
    which is that we should not, as I said, come to the
    conclusion that I will not be having these emotions again,
    but rather when they come, if you can feel grateful for them,
    if you can see them as an opportunity, if you can learn from
    them, then as I said earlier, you come to a state: where
    whether they come or whether they don't come makes no
    difference. So that is what we should try to aim at rather
    than have this conclusion: Now they are over. According to
    the Buddhist teachings, these things completely stop only
    when we have become enlightened. So as I said yesterday, we
    are trying to be enlightened people even before we are
    enlightened. This brings up a point that I have been
    emphasizing very much in my lectures: Learning to accept our
    humanness, learning to accept our imperfections. It is very
    very important in our practice.</p>
    <p>No more questions? Are all your questions and problems
    solved?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">I want to know how to deal with sadness.
    Sometimes one just can't let go because you would even feel
    it in your dreams particularly when relatives pass away.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>I don't want
    to go over the tools again. I like to repeat that whether it
    is sadness, whether it is fear, whether it is anxiety,
    whether it is guilt, it is the same medicine. So about
    dreams, it shows that the sadness has become fairly deep that
    it even comes up in a dream. So please remember, please be
    open to the days when you don't dream about sadness. When the
    sadness is not there, just to be open that the sadness is not
    there.</p>
    <p>There might be two types of sadness. One type of sadness
    is in relation to a particular incident. There may be another
    type of sadness which is not related to an incident but then
    you just generally feel sadness. So if it is related to a
    particular incident, that incident should become an object of
    meditation. To see clearly that that incident has been
    created by your expectations of how things should have been.
    And if it is just sadness that comes without a reason, what
    you might try to do is one thing, is to feel the sensations
    in the body while you are experiencing the sadness because
    with sadness, sometimes our thoughts can make it worse. So if
    you can be with the sensations, this may be helpful.</p>
    <p>Another tool as I have been mentioning a few times is to
    come back to your breath because it is happening now. And it
    is interesting that all sadness is in relation to the past.
    Sadness is in relation to the past and anxiety is in relation
    to the future. So making a connection with your breath and
    learning to be in the present helps us to handle the past and
    the future. So by doing that, we learn to handle these
    emotions which are always related to the past and the future.
    And in conclusion I like to again mention in one of the tools
    that I referred to earlier, when sadness is not there, try to
    invite sadness and you might find that it may not come.</p>
    <p>Time for one last question.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Audience: </b></font><font
    color="#7F0000">Your advice is that we should not label
    emotions with words and you already told us that if there is
    no anger, just to know there is no anger but when we say
    there is no anger, we are putting words to describe a certain
    experience, so isn't that contradictory?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Very good
    question. I like that question. So if you consider the tools,
    you'll see sometimes we need to use words, sometimes we don't
    have to use words. So this is why there is a variety of
    tools, so if one works, if one doesn't work, you can
    experiment with the others. So what is important is you have
    to find out which tools are really helping you. So once you
    discover the tools that are helping you, you have to use
    them. It's interesting that these tools are related to each
    individual. We human beings have different conditions,
    different personalities. This is why I have been trying to
    present tools where it can cover all types of human beings.
    So the last point I want to make is that it is very very
    important in the spiritual path, in the meditation, for you
    to experiment, for you to find out for your own self. The
    Buddha emphasized this very much, to be self reliant, to be
    your own teacher, to be your light to yourself.</p>
    <p>So now let us take a small break and during this break I
    like to suggest that you reflect on some of the tools that I
    mentioned and then discover for yourself what emotions are
    bothering you. So it is very very important to learn to
    reflect on such themes. The reflection is thinking about a
    particular theme and when you think about it, if other
    thoughts come, you should learn to let go of that and come
    back to the theme that you are really reflecting on. So I
    like you to do this. It doesn't matter whether you are
    walking but whatever you are doing, just to learn to develop
    this important meditation of reflecting. And when you hear
    the bell, please come back.</p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#800000">[Break]</font></p>
    <p>So let us do meditation relating to what we have been
    discussing. Those who have problems with unpleasant emotions,
    please allow them to arise now. So if these emotions that you
    don't like arise, let us see how far we can make friends with
    them. Let us see how far we can just allow them, just let
    them be. Just to relate to them as a visitor who has come.
    And if you don't have any unpleasant emotions, just to know
    that you don't have any unpleasant emotions.</p>
    <p>Can we learn to relate to them without giving them a
    minus.</p>
    <p>Can you really say to yourself, it is O.K not to feel O.K.</p>
    <p>Can you feel grateful that this emotion is there so that
    you can learn to work with it.</p>
    <p>Can you now feel confidence, self-confidence that if they
    come again, you know how to work with them, you know how to
    handle them.</p>
    <p>Now please open your eyes.</p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#800000">[End of meditation]</font></p>
    <p>We can do some nice chanting now.</p>
    <p>Actually chanting is also a very powerful tool to work
    with emotions, especially if you can be completely in the
    present while you are chanting. Please see for yourself how
    chanting will help you. It will help you to create space in
    your mind.</p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#800000">[Chanting]</font></p>
