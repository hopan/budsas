    <p>It has been a learning experience for me listening to the
    problems regarding emotions. It is clear to me that emotions
    arise in the way you relate to yourself and the way you
    relate to others and the way you relate to the surroundings.
    So it shows relationship is a real challenge we have in life.
    Many persons presented problems relating to other people. So
    their problem was, they were concerned about what others were
    thinking of them. Especially fearing minuses. So the question
    arises: Why we have given such power to other people? Our
    happiness and unhappiness is dependent on other people. So I
    would like to raise this as a question: Why have we given so
    much power to other people?</p>

    be difficult to get on with each other.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Anything else?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 1: </b>If one has no self
    confidence, one does not know how to get hold of one's
    destiny.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>I think this
    seems to be an important reason. Because we lack self
    confidence, because we don't practise what is necessary for
    us, we depend on other people for that. Another question that
    arose in my mind today was, at least with the people I have
    been meeting in this regard, only women have been telling me
    how they are relating to other people creates this emotion of
    lack of self confidence, fearing the judgment of others,
    fearing to make mistakes where others will blame them. Now a
    question that arose in me is that, here, in this country, is
    it mostly common with women, or men also have this problem
    but they are shy to speak about it?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 2: </b>Men have more of this
    kind of problem. Men know how to find ways to let out their
    emotions, for example, they would go out to drink with
    friends and when they get a bit drunk, they will just say
    anything, then they just let out the emotions in this way or
    another.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>I meet many
    men and I meet many women and I think everywhere in this
    world, this is a real problem human beings have to face. I
    didn't know that with men, one of the solutions they have
    found is drinking, but then it becomes a vicious circle
    because of their drinking, they are also given minuses and
    because of the minuses, they drink, so one thing leads to the
    other. Let us see how meditation helps us to work with these
    problems, whether it is in men or women, it doesn't matter.</p>
    <p>I feel this is why meditation of loving kindness is so
    important, in the sense that you learn to be your best friend
    and if you can really make that connection with yourself,
    actually feel it, then I think our dependency on what others
    think of you becomes less because whatever we need from
    others, you get it from yourself. You will become self
    contained within oneself.</p>
    <p>Another way meditation helps us to work with this
    situation is understanding the nature of <i>pluses</i> and <i>minuses</i>.
    It is again very interesting that human beings have this very
    very strong conditioning to give pluses, to give minuses in
    all situation but we never pause to question whether these
    pluses or minuses are valid, on what basis are we doing this.
    It is funny we really become victims of this mechanism but we
    never inquire into the way these pluses and minuses operate,
    under what condition they arise, what is really creating
    them, what is contributing to them. So when we explore this
    question, we realise that these are really related to
    thoughts, concepts which have come due to different reasons
    from the society that you have been brought up into. Then you
    see them as part of your conditioning, you see them as a
    strong habit that we have got used to. It is funny this is
    how we use thoughts. Now as we all know from the time that we
    wake up in the morning up to the time that we go to sleep,
    there are continuous thoughts, thinking going through our
    mind which never stop. If you become aware, if you become
    mindful of the thoughts that go through your mind, then
    you'll realize that most of the time the way we use thoughts
    is this habit of giving pluses and minuses. So that when you
    see this clearly, then the power that we have given to them
    may become less. So then you realize sometimes it is just an
    innocent thought that comes: &#145;maybe the other person
    doesn't like me&#146;, &#145;maybe the other person is giving
    me minuses&#146;, &#145;maybe the other person thinks that
    I'm silly or ridiculous&#146;. So if you are mindful, you'll
    realize it is just a thought that I'm having, who knows
    whether that thought corresponds to any reality. There is a
    strong imaginary aspect in our thoughts. So this imaginary
    aspect and the reality are two different things. So with
    awareness, with mindfulness, exploring, investigating may
    become clear to us and this will help us to work with and
    handle the thoughts and their power will become less.</p>
    <p>Another very interesting aspect related to this is: With
    our thoughts, with our identifications, the images we have
    created of ourselves and others. We all have images of who we
    are, the type of persons you are. So in the same way, each
    person has a model, has an image of himself or herself. So I
    think what we are doing is that when other people accept your
    image, then you feel comfortable with them, you feel at ease
    with them. And then we make it a point to always, or most of
    the time, impose this particular image on other people. Then
    we also have images of other people. A Western psychologist
    has said that when two people meet, there are six people. Can
    you work out how two people become six people?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 1: </b>Two real people and
    four imaginary people.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Yes, exactly.
    It is a very interesting point for us to reflect. So
    sometimes when there are conflicts, actually it is the images
    that are in conflict but what they really are is another
    situation. So with meditation, with awareness, you understand
    this process that whenever there is a conflict, the conflict
    is the result of the image you have of the other person. Take
    the case of anger. So in relation to behaviour from another
    person: How do we get angry? Why do we get angry? We have an
    idea of how the other person should behave and when the other
    person's behaviour does not conform to the image we have, we
    get angry. Then we have an image of our usual behaviour and
    when our behaviour does not correspond to that image, then we
    feel guilty, we get angry, we get disappointed, we get hurt
    yourself because our behaviour does not correspond to that
    image we have formed of ourselves.</p>
    <p>A very interesting practice in everyday life is, whenever
    you suffer, whenever you are disappointed, whenever you are
    frustrated, at that moment, you can see for yourself that the
    image which you are having is now clashing from what is
    actually happening. This is why the Buddha emphasized:
    Learning to see things as they are. But what we are doing is,
    we want to see the way things as they should be, as they must
    be according to our way, my way. So in a way, what we are
    doing is we are demanding how we should behave, we are
    demanding how others should behave, we are demanding how life
    should be. So if these demands are met, life is wonderful,
    life is O.K., it is beautiful. If these demands are not met,
    suffering, frustration, disappointment, hurt, most of the
    emotions can arise as a result of that. So I would suggest
    that an enlightened human being goes about life without any
    images and because of that, he or she can never suffer.</p>
    <p>Another aspect related to this is if you can really
    understand the nature of life, then you realize it is not
    possible to have a conclusion about how life should be. In
    the Dhamma there is something very very deep which is: To be
    open to the uncertainty of life. But we have this idea of
    certainty because we assume things can be controlled but when
    we think deeply, we realize that in actual fact, we have no
    control. In cultures, in countries where things work
    perfectly, without any problems, one thing that arises is
    that it gives a kind of sense of security because everything
    is happening perfectly, no problems, everything under
    control. Living in countries like India, Sri Lanka, you have
    to be open to uncertainties. I will give a practical example
    which I experienced. When I was in Europe, I was in a train
    and they made an announcement in the language of that country
    and people were very very anxious, looking at their leaflets
    and lots of talk about it, lots of disappointment, so I asked
    them what the announcement is. They said the train was going
    seven minutes late. In Sri Lanka, if there is a train you'll
    be very fortunate. So this is very good training. Most of the
    time unexpected things happen. You go to the bus stand, then
    they say no bus now. You want to go by train, they say now
    there is no train, it is one hour late. I get the impression
    that these things don't happen here. Am I right? Everything
    under control and it gives a sense of security, then when
    something unexpected happens, disappointment, suffering. So
    that living in cultures like this naturally you tend to be
    conditioned to do things perfectly. You fear to make mistakes
    because no mistakes happen! So with this idea of perfection,
    this is why we like other people to accept that you are
    perfect, this is why you fear maybe they are giving you
    minuses so that your model of perfection is affected by that.
    So this is why I often emphasized this open to humanness,
    open to imperfection so that when we become more and more
    open to our humanness, our imperfection, then if you are
    getting minuses from other people, then you are not
    surprised. You realize: Well, that's part of the
    conditioning. I'm still human, so it's O.K.</p>
    <p>I like to pause now and if you have any questions, I'm
    sure you might have some questions, some clarifications about
    this, so I think we will try to have a useful discussion
    about our emotions and how to really work with our emotions
    in the context of the practice.</p>
    <p>So it is interesting when asking questions, you are
    afraid: &#145;Could this be a good question? Will people
    laugh at my question? Will they think I'm stupid?&#146; As
    Peter said, are we not silly? I mean this is where it is
    beautiful that we are in a group of spiritual friends so at
    least we should be open to anything, allow yourself to make
    mistakes and learn from these mistakes, at least this is the
    beauty of a retreat like this. So I would like to hear some
    silly questions. I don't want these profound perfect
    questions. For a change, to some silly questions I will be
    happy to give some silly answers.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 2: </b>In Hong Kong, we do
    have certain set of images to live by and we always do things
    in conformity with these images. For example, if we go to a
    cafe and order a certain type of Chinese tea but the waiter
    gives me another type and if we accept the wrong tea, the
    acceptance depends on whether we accept it without a grudge.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>That is
    certainly true. We can accept because it is one thing,
    because we want to conform with others, so you pretend it is
    good and you accept it but I think the real acceptance is:
    Can we really say O.K. to it or not even saying O.K. or doing
    something about it?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 2: </b>My statement is
    really if I accept, the acceptance would either be with a
    grudge or with understanding, not with conformity.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>So it is not a
    silly point but a profound point. It is so profound that we
    are still trying to understand what the question is! I'm only
    joking.</p>
    <p>Anything else? So please present difficulties, problems
    you have in everyday life in relation to working with
    emotions. As someone said today, living here, there are no
    emotions coming.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 2: </b>Because we have to be
    silent, that's why there's no emotion!</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 3: </b>He said no talk, no
    emotions. He got the point. Better than us.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>So please, in
    everyday life, what are the emotions that come up? So we can
    discuss ways and means of how meditation can help us to cope
    with emotions in such situation.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 4: </b>I would like to give
    one example, that is, in my office, I always try to work to
    conform with what my clients expect me to do. It's not
    because I care how they judge me. Actually I don't care as
    long as I've done my job right, then I'm happy. But the
    reality is that if I don't do things in conformity with their
    expectations, they will complain about me or to me which
    results in spending a lot of time explaining the situation.
    So that gives me a lot of pressure. I know that it is all
    created by my mind and I can handle the situation if there
    should be any unjustified complaints but the fact is that I
    try to avoid these troubles, so I try to do everything
    perfectly.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>A good
    question.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 2: </b>It's very common in
    Hong Kong.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Good question,
    A big plus to you. So what I would suggest is, what I'm
    saying doesn't mean that you should not act with
    responsibility. So one thing we have to learn is how to act
    with responsibility without the pressure. So that you are
    doing your best but doing that best is done in a relaxed way,
    not with tension, not with stress. This is one thing we need
    to learn and then when you do your best and then you have
    made a mistake, then you can be very very clear and honest in
    your own mind: When I did my best but my best was not the
    best of that other person, so what can I do? So it at least
    makes your mind very clear, it makes your conscience very
    clear, so that it also will not give rise to any conflict. So
    this is all we can try to do and then we tried, if it
    succeeds, it's good. If it fails, it is also good. And then
    in such a situation, if you have made a mistake and then some
    problem arises, what is also important for us to learn is
    when a wound has been created, to heal that wound as quickly
    as possible rather than just hold onto the wound and suffer
    for your whole life because you have made some mistakes.</p>
    <p>Anything else?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 2: </b>But in Hong Kong
    you may be fired by the boss. It is the source of the
    pressure.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 3: </b>Accept the fact that
    I'm fired. No suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>If you have
    done your best and if you're fired, I mean in your own mind
    you are very very clear about what has happened. So I feel,
    it is very very important in life to understand our
    limitations. This doesn't mean that we justify our
    limitations but that is a fact: I'm doing my very best but
    then my very best does not correspond to what others think as
    their best, so what can you do? Actually, these are real
    challenges we have in life: How to face them?</p>
    <p>Another aspect to such situation, I don't know if what I'm
    going to say makes sense, some of these set backs, some of
    these difficulties, some of these problems you have in such a
    situation can be, later on, a blessing. This is also very
    interesting. I'm reminded of a Chinese tale that I like to
    share with you, perhaps you already know the story. In a
    particular village, there was a very wise old man and he had
    some beautiful horses. So one day one of the beautiful horses
    was missing, gone away. So the whole village came to this man
    and said, &#145;Oh, how unfortunate! It is that your best
    horse that has ran away. It seems you are very unlucky.&#146;
    Maybe in Buddhist term, it is bad Kamma and so on. He said,
    &#145;No, it is merely that my horse has ran away. What you
    are saying is an opinion, a judgment on what has happened. My
    horse has ran away, that's all.&#146; So in my terms, you'd
    say no need to give a minus to this. Then after some days,
    this horse came with another beautiful horse. Then the same
    villagers came and said, &#145;Oh, you're very lucky, you're
    very fortunate, you lost one horse, now you have two
    horses.&#146; He said, &#145;Stop all this. I now have two
    horses, that is all.&#146; In my terms, no need to give a
    plus. This old man had a son and so with this new horse he
    was trying to train this new horse and in training the new
    horse, the son fell from the horse and broke his leg. So the
    friends came and said, &#145;Bad Kamma again.&#146; And then
    what happened was there was a war and so soldiers came to the
    village to take away all the young people in the village for
    the war, only his son was saved from this. This is a very
    very good story to learn to see things <i>just as they are</i>,
    hopefully without pluses and without minuses. I suppose the
    wise old man did not have any image of what should happen and
    what shouldn't happen. Has anyone heard of this story?
    Everybody.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 5: </b>Everybody know this
    story but nobody can practise like the old man.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 4: </b></font><font
    color="#800000">But the story was not presented in the way
    that you did. The way you presented the story is very
    striking because you emphasized the point that there should
    not be any concept. The fact is that he lost a horse. The
    fact is that he gained a horse and no other judgment. But the
    traditional way of telling this story is about good luck and
    bad luck. When fortunate things happen, you do not expect it
    is really fortunate. When unfortunate things happen, you do
    not expect it is really unfortunate, you have to wait and see
    it to the end. That is the traditional way of telling the
    story, so it is very materialistic because the traditional
    way of telling us is that at the end this old man gains.
    There's a fruit.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>I think
    another aspect of this story I like is that he did not have
    any expectations of what should happen or what shouldn't
    happen. So no images. He had no images of what should happen
    and what shouldn't happen. This is one point. The other point
    is there is a shift that takes place inside. When there is
    understanding and realization inside, anything can happen
    externally. This is the important thing. So we cannot control
    what is happening externally but when there is a change
    inside, then you will be able to handle whatever is happening
    externally. I think this is another aspect of the story.</p>
    <p>Any other questions?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 6: </b>In Hong Kong society
    even though you can achieve 99% almost perfection, with the
    1% you have committed as a mistake, people would grab hold of
    that 1% fault and go on and on against you. I fully
    understand the way you told us how to deal with these
    situations but I cannot say from the bottom of my heart
    whether I can do it.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>I think what
    you said does not apply only to Hong Kong society. For some
    reason everywhere in the world there seems to be too much
    emphasis, too much power given to the mistakes, to the
    negative things, that the good things are taken for granted.
    This happens very often in relationships. You do good things
    and with so many good things, you do one mistake and that one
    mistake becomes more important than all the good things that
    you have done. So people will be talking about that one
    mistake but not all the good things that has been done by
    that person. So it brings up the interesting question: Why do
    human beings give so much power to the mistakes, to the
    negative things and the positive things are taken for
    granted? I like to hear from you whether you have any
    thoughts about this.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 3: </b>People seldom have
    any heart for things. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Maybe so.
    Anything else?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 2: </b>I present a converse
    situation to what Male 6 said. Some people never do anything
    right but somehow everything is forgiven when he brings you a
    cup of tea.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 4: </b>He is not answering
    your question.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>So going back
    to my question.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 4: </b></font>I think
    sometimes people always think of the mistake and keep
    reminding you because of jealousy, so they want to heighten
    the mistake.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Anything else?
    Any other possible explanations.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 4: </b>In my experience, it
    all boils down to greed. It's because, for example, my
    clients expect me to win a legal battle because if I win the
    legal battle, he will get what he wants. When I do not win
    the legal battle for him, then he has many complaints because
    his mind is muddled by greed because he does not get what he
    wants. And the same applies to many other things that I have
    seen. When a person has greed in his mind and if he does not
    get what he wants and although I've done my best, he won't
    listen.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>So as we
    realize that this is something in ourselves and we should in
    our own way, try to practise this in a different way. So one
    suggestion I like to offer is that whenever you see someone
    doing something good, I think we should make it a point to
    just to mention it, to appreciate it. Parents who bring up
    children, I mean this is a very very common problem where
    parents tell the children only when they make a mistake. When
    they do something good, that is not mentioned. So a child is
    brought up with the idea: I'm always doing wrong things. When
    a similar discussion took place in a foreign country I was
    in, in that audience, there was a teacher who had been
    counselling parents. She told us she gave an exercise to the
    parents. They were told to draw up a list of all the naughty
    things, bad things the children would do. So without a
    problem, they drew up a long list. Then the parents were told
    now please draw a list of the good things your children are
    doing. It was very very difficult for them to do that! They
    had to think hard on what the good things that they were
    doing. Isn't that interesting?</p>
    <p>And this also happens in relationships. Sometimes I have
    to counsel in Sri Lanka, husbands and wives who have
    problems. It's a big joke amongst my friends. They say this
    man has no experience in married life and he is counselling
    married people. One complaint of wives is when cooking is not
    so good, the husband would be critical and make a big fuss
    about the food, but when the food is good, she tells me that
    he practises the noble silence!</p>
    <p>There is a very interesting discussion in the Buddhist
    texts about spiritual friends. So what a real spiritual
    friend does is when someone does wrong, you point out in a
    very friendly way that&#146;s wrong and when you do something
    good, when you do something right, you point out that you are
    doing something good, something right. This is what we need
    to learn, not only give power and energy to the minuses but
    also acknowledge the pluses. So I would suggest, we as
    meditators, we should try to cultivate this very important
    quality. And it is also very important to see the good things
    in us also. This tendency to see only the negative, only the
    minuses in ourselves is a very very strong factor which can
    create a lot of emotions and suffering for us. So when we
    learn to see the more and more positive in us, when we see
    more and more pluses in us, then we will be able to see more
    and more positive things and pluses in others.</p>
    <p>There are four qualities mentioned in the Dhamma. They are
    called sublime states or divine abodes. So they are Metta,
    the first one is loving kindness. The second one is Karuna
    which means when you see someone suffering you try to help
    that person. The third quality is very very interesting,
    Mudita, when other people are happy, you rejoice in their
    happiness, and I would say that you can also rejoice in your
    own happiness. So this quality of Mudita is something very
    very important we need to cultivate. A meditation Master has
    put this very very clearly, he said that we have a tendency
    to see what is wrong in us, we never look for what is right
    in us. The society might have harmful, destructive values but
    we should try to cultivate these virtues, these values which
    might be against what is happening in society. This is why
    the Buddha's teaching, meditation is compared to going up
    stream, that it is not easy, most people just flow with the
    stream. So living in a society where these things are
    prominent, where they are given power, it is not easy, it is
    difficult but this is where we have to make an effort. This
    is where the practice is important. This is why a group of
    spiritual friends is important, that at least we are as a
    group trying to practise these virtues, these qualities
    though in the country, in the society, something else is
    happening.</p>
    <p>Anyway, something about tomorrow. Tomorrow I like to
    suggest we might try to practise about your thoughts, to work
    on our thoughts. There is always a connection between
    thoughts and emotions. An interesting question to reflect is:
    Can there be suffering without a thought? Can there be
    emotion without a thought? So I feel that in our practice, we
    should really understand, penetrate, to work with our
    thoughts. So as I said, from the time that we wake up up to
    the time we go to sleep, there is this continuous thinking
    going through our mind. So tomorrow I like to suggest that we
    forget our friend, the breath, and then continuously observe
    our thoughts and see the connection between thoughts and
    emotions and then try to make discoveries about our thoughts,
    about our thinking, especially the area of pluses and minuses
    in relation to the thoughts that we have. So tomorrow if you
    catch yourself giving minuses, observe it, catch it as soon
    as possible. When we were coming here to this centre, I think
    there was a question mark in red and I think I asked someone
    what that question mark meant. I was told that question mark
    meant: Just find out what you are thinking. So it is a very
    interesting exercise that during the day, suddenly, to find
    out: Now what is the thought I am having. So whether you are
    here or whether you are outside, let us make an effort to
    just to know, just to understand, just to explore, just to
    learn, just to discover from our thought, about our thoughts,
    about our concepts. And then we can have a discussion about
    thoughts in the evening.</p>
    <p>So now we can do some chanting.</p>
