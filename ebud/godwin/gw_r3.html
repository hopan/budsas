    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin:</b></font></p>
    <p>What I propose to do now is to touch on some aspects of
    loving kindness. After that, if you have any questions or
    difficulties about loving kindness, we can discuss them.</p>
    <p>I delivered a talk on the same subject at the nunnery. I
    don't want to repeat the same things I said there. So what I
    like to talk about is in the text which is also translated
    and was given to you. There are some benefits that are
    mentioned, benefits of loving kindness. I'd like to discuss
    the implications of those benefits, the practical aspects of
    the benefits.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Sleep and Wake Up Peacefully</b></font></p>
    <p>So it is interesting the first benefit that is mentioned
    is that you can sleep peacefully. There is a difference
    between sleeping peacefully and sleeping well. This is
    related to the second benefit, which is, you wake up
    peacefully and that is related to the third benefit where it
    is said you don't have any nightmares, any unpleasant dreams.</p>
    <p>What are these unpleasant dreams we have, the nightmares?
    I would suggest that they are related to the emotions we are
    repressing, perhaps related to the wounds that we are holding
    on. So with loving kindness, you heal these wounds, then you
    don't have these nightmares, unpleasant dreams and then you
    can sleep peacefully and wake up peacefully.</p>
    <p>In Sri Lanka, sometimes I work with people who suffer from
    insomnia, and the way I try to help them is the pratice of
    the simple method of loving kindness before you go to sleep.
    It has been interesting for me that it works most of the
    time.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Other People Like You</b></font></p>
    <p>Now another benefit that is mentioned is that human beings
    like you. Why do human beings like you? Because you are
    friendly towards them, so naturally when you are friendly to
    others, they are friendly towards you. If you are not
    friendly to others, they will not be friendly to you. So it
    is a very very simple point that when you are friendly to
    others, others will respond the same way. I think this is
    very important because we have lot of problems, difficulties
    in relationships, the way we are relating to other people. So
    if we can be friendly to ourselves and friendly to others,
    this can generate lot of joy, lot of happiness.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Non-human Also Like You</b></font></p>
    <p>Another interesting benefit that is mentioned is that
    non-human also like you. What are these non-human? One can
    interpret them in different ways but perhaps we can include
    animals, perhaps we can include plants, trees. We can include
    non-human beings who may be there in this world which we
    cannot see. I think it is a fact that animals can really
    respond and feel your loving kindness and they can respond in
    the same way. I was telling the other day that we have monks
    in Sri Lanka who meditate in deep forests where there are
    wild animals, where there are animals who can harm you, but
    it is interesting how these monks get on with these animals.
    I know in one place, the chief monk talks to these wild
    animals and they seem to obey the request or order of the
    monks, the orders the monks make to the animals. So I think
    animals are disturbed when you have fear but when you have
    loving kindness, when you are friendly towards them, I think
    they can feel that.</p>
    <p>They have done some research, now even plants can feel
    your emotions. They can react to your emotions. So here
    again, I think loving kindness may be able to affect them in
    some ways, in different ways.</p>
    <p>In the modern world, we have a lot of problems about the
    environment, what is called the ecological crisis and so on.
    I see it as a manifestation of our own self-destructive
    aspect in us, which comes through in this way. When you have
    loving kindness, you learn to develop a sensitivity to
    yourselves, your surroundings, your environment, so these are
    very simple ways of protecting the environment, making a
    connection with the environment. See yourself as part of the
    environment and not something separate from it.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Face Becomes Serene</b></font></p>
    <p>Another benefit that is mentioned is that your face
    becomes serene. I don't know if the face becomes handsome.
    But serenity is, what is the Chinese world for it? It is a
    beautiful word. See some of the Buddha images, they have
    captured the serenity of that expression. So it shows our
    state of mind can affect our face. If it can affect our face,
    it can affect our body. So when you have a serene face, you
    don't have to use cosmetics. You can save all the money! And
    with loving kindness, the serenity that comes can never be
    captured through cosmetics. In a way when you have a serene
    face, I think it can affect other people. This is what is
    beautiful about loving kindness, that it becomes infectious.
    Hatred can become infectious and at the same time, loving
    kindness can be infectious.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Experience Calm Mind</b></font></p>
    <p>There is another very interesting benefit that is
    mentioned, which is related to meditation. It is said that
    with loving kindness, it is easy to experience Samadhi,
    one-pointedness. This is why I emphasize friendliness so much
    in the practice because when we are practising, if you are
    hating things, if you are resisting things, if you are
    fighting things, it is not easy to have a mind that is calm.
    This calmness comes naturally when there is friendliness,
    when there is gentleness, when there is openness. So this is
    a very important point to remember in our practice and we are
    learning to use friendliness, gentleness in whatever
    technique we are practising.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Give You a Sense of Protection</b></font></p>
    <p>Then another benefit mentioned is that it gives you a
    sense of protection. So it is interesting that loving
    kindness can be so powerful, it can in some ways protect you
    from situations. An aspect related to protection is that it
    also gives a sense of security, confidence. In one of the
    statements it is mentioned in the text that <i>those who have
    loving kindness they feel at home wherever they are.</i> So
    you don't feel threatened, you don't feel insecure because of
    loving kindness. So you feel at home with yourself, you feel
    at home with others.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Die Peacefully</b></font></p>
    <p>Another benefit that is mentioned is that when you die,
    you die unconfused, you die with a clear mind. So why is it
    considered an advantage to die consciously? Can anyone
    suggest a reason for it?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 1: </b>Is it because the
    last thought in our mind will affect where we go after we
    die?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Yes, in a way.
    Any other possible reasons?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 2: </b>Is it because we
    have fear when we die because we have not experienced death,
    and with loving kindness we can bring ourselves out from the
    fear and pain?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Interesting.
    Anything else?</p>
    <p>When we die, we have a last chance to become enlightened.
    Because at the moment of death, if you can really practise
    meditation, if you can really practise conscious dying, that
    will give us a great opportunity to free ourselves, to make
    that opportunity as part of the practice.</p>
    <p>There is a very interesting book from the Tibetan
    tradition, <i>the Tibetan Book of the Dead</i>. Is it
    translated into Chinese?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 1: </b>Yes.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Has anyone
    read it?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 1: </b>I read some.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>It's a very
    interesting book. It shows how your experience at that time
    is determined by the way you have lived. So in simple terms
    as I understand it, at that moment, our emotions, unpleasant
    emotions can surface and they can take many forms. So at that
    moment, we don't recognize that there are emotions but as
    they manifest themselves externally, we react to the external
    things that we see. So you see how it is related to
    meditation. How it is important to recognize how our mind
    works, it works with our emotions, to recognize, so on. And
    what is interesting is, it is also said that enlightenment
    also manifests itself and we have to recognize it, and if you
    don't recognize it, your last chance is lost. So in practical
    terms, in our meditation, we also should recognize our
    positive states of mind, so just to know that they are there.
    So when you know them, when you recognize them, then when
    they manifest themselves, in other words, it is just to know
    that it is the free mind, the enlightened mind that is
    manifesting in this way. So it shows directly when you have
    awareness, when you are conscious at the time of dying, you
    can know all these things, recognize these things and as I
    have said, we have a last chance to free ourselves from what
    is happening.</p>
    <p>And in a way, these also relate to the wounds we carry in
    our mind. Sometimes when I travel, I meet people who work
    with dying people because I am very interested in this theme
    of death and dying. I used to work with terminally ill cancer
    patients who are dying. So the biggest problem at that time
    is the wounds that we have not looked at, the wounds that we
    have pushed away, the wounds that we have repressed, can
    surface in a very strong intensive way. Why should they
    manifest in a strong way when we are dying?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 2: </b>Is it because our
    mind is weak at the time.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Yes. What
    happens is at the time of death, our mind and body may become
    weak. So that when we are living we can consciously push
    these things away and deny them, repress them, lead very very
    busy lives, but at the time of death, you cannot escape from
    what is happening. So this is why I emphasized that while we
    are living, while we are strong, to look at our wounds and
    try to heal them. It is interesting that these things are
    also mentioned in ancient Buddhist literature. Anyway, this
    is the 10th benefit that is mentioned, conscious dying, the
    importance of it, and it is interesting there is a connection
    between loving kindness and death.</p>
    <p>And the last one that is mentioned is that after death we
    will be born in the realm of the gods, a pleasant place. But
    what is important for us to remember and realize is that we
    can see the benefits in this life itself. Now this is some of
    the benefits that are mentioned in this text. Now let us see
    if we can include anything more, add to this list from our
    own experience. Do we have any suggestions?</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Benefits Suggested by Other
    Participants</b></font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 3: </b>Have no enemies, will
    not have anyone whom you cannot get on with and no hatred
    against another person.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Very good one.
    In a way it is related to saying that human beings like you
    and because human beings like you, to have enemies is when
    beings don't like you. Anyway as you put it, to have no
    enemies is something very special. So what will happen is you
    will only have friends and no enemies. What a wonderful way
    to live!</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 3: </b>Sometime it is not a
    friend nor an enemy. Not an enemy but also not a friend.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>A neutral,
    neither friend, not unfriendly. Anyway, you don't bother
    them, they don't bother you, no problems, that is the point.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 3: </b>Sometimes they bother
    me but I won't bother them back.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Yes, that can
    happen. But if you are not really friendly but neutral, they
    then will leave you alone. That is an interesting way of
    seeing the benefits, anything else?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 2: </b>It helps me to make
    clear decisions, that is when there is hatred in my mind,
    then I always make the wrong decision because I would make a
    decision from my own point of view and not consider what
    others think.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Very very
    good. So when there is hatred, when there is anger, please
    don't take a decision because that decision will be always
    coming from a confused mind, not a clear mind. Not only
    decisions but also words. So I would suggest that if we get
    angry with someone then at that angry moment, we can just
    keep our mouth shut, because whatever we speak, it doesn't
    come from a clear mind, so it can be so confusing and can
    make matters worse. So the state of the mind in such
    situation is very very important. In some occasions, someone
    does something wrong and then we get angry and then we try to
    correct that person with anger. I would suggest that to a
    great extent, that type of reaction in trying to correct
    persons with anger, with reaction, may not work. So these are
    very important practical aspects of loving kindness in every
    day life.</p>
    <p>Anything more to add?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 4: </b>Before I learned
    about loving kindness meditation, I got angry easily with
    others but after I have learnt loving kindness meditation, I
    found a good thing about it is that the duration of anger
    gets shorter and slowly it will disappear. Another benefit is
    that as you continue to train yourself, you will find hating
    another is really quite silly because it causes suffering for
    yourself. The more hatred you have, the more problems you
    create for yourself.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Very good. Two
    good points. The second point is very very important: How
    soon we recover from these emotions, hatred, whatever. I
    think we should not have as an ideal that you will not get
    angry but if you need an ideal, the ideal should be how soon
    I recover from them. There is a beautiful simile in one of
    the Buddhist texts, it gives three similes to three types of
    anger. The first type of anger is compared to letters written
    on stone, they never change, they never go away. The second
    type of anger is compared to letters written on sand. The
    third type of anger is compared to letters written on water.
    Isn't that beautiful? That quickness, it is there and also it
    is already over. And the first point is also very good, that
    it is silly, because it is really silly, it is really foolish
    for ourselves to hold on to this anger and then we are
    suffering. I think it is compared to someone who is spitting
    up because you spit up, it comes back to your face. Is this
    in that booklet?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 3: </b>No.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>But this is a
    very good one. Big plus to you.</p>
    <p>Anything else? It is very interesting we can think
    creatively and add to this list.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 1: </b>It makes me feel
    warm, happy and pleasant all the time.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>That is true.
    This feeling of warmth is very very important because now
    human being are, for different reasons, becoming more and
    more cold. As I said at the nunnery, with more and more
    mechanization, human beings are becoming more and more like
    machines and one aspect of becoming more and more like
    machines is they lack feelings. So having this warmth, having
    feelings for other people, for ourselves, is something very
    very important, very beautiful.</p>
    <p>Another one which I thought of which may be related to
    some of the people I have been meeting at the interviews is
    that this can develop a lot of self confidence. Can anyone
    see the connection between self-confidence and loving
    kindness?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 4: </b>When you don't have
    enemies around you, then it is already very powerful.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>That's true.
    Very powerful. Anything else about self confidence?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 3: </b>When you have loving
    kindness, you will quite easily do things that will help
    others, and you will think more for others and less for
    yourself. With this way of living, one can says one has no
    regrets at all in life and when one can say that, this is
    self confidence.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>I think
    another aspect of self confidence is that we lose self
    confidence when we consider ourselves as unsuccessful,
    worthless, useless, we may fail, so it is a very very
    negative self image we have of ourselves, more as failures.</p>
    <p>So with more and more loving kindness specially to
    oneself, we can see how it works and we can see our own
    potentialities and we can become more and more self reliant,
    and this can give us a lot of self confidence in the sense
    that we can handle whatever arises. So it is not that they
    will not arise, anger will arise, problems will arise,
    difficulties will arise but you have the confidence, if they
    arise: I know how to handle them, I know what to do.</p>
    <p>Anyway, so we can perhaps think of some more. So it shows
    anyway how important meditation on loving kindness is
    specially in everyday life, how the changes that one can
    bring about oneself, the transformation that one can bring
    about oneself and as I said, it is also bound to affect
    others around you.</p>
    <p>So now any questions, any difficulties you have? So if you
    have any difficulties, please present them because it is
    important to discuss them.</p>
    <hr align="left" width="25%">
    <p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Q&amp;A</b></font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 2: </b>The difficulty I have
    about practising loving kindness is at the moment of anger.
    As you said, when I have a hatred mind, it is better not to
    make a decision and not even to say a word. My problem is
    when I work in the office, when some of my staff did
    something wrong, I immediately got angry and said something
    to them. Afterwards, I knew that I shouldn't have said it
    because I just add more suffering to the sufferings of others
    and it would be a mistake. I should have told them how to
    handle the mistake rather than to raise my voice, but I tried
    very hard but it is always difficult to control myself at
    that moment of anger.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Not only you,
    we can all relate to that experience. So you have raised a
    very important practical question. Sometimes in a way people
    with whom you work, sometimes I think you need to speak
    firmly to them. Before I went to the meditation centre, I was
    a librarian. So I tried to practise loving kindness with
    those members of the staff, people who were working. It was
    not easy. People would come late. &quot;He is practising
    loving kindness. So we got up an hour late. He is practising
    loving kindness, so don't send application for leave, just
    stay at home.&quot; So I realized it didn't work because some
    people understood only a different language. The only thing,
    again you have to be very very clear, that now I am going to
    be firm, tell him very firmly and in doing that, there is no
    wound, there is nothing inside, there is just saying
    something that has to be said.</p>
    <p>Anyway, the second part of the question has a very
    practical aspect. It is that when we get angry unexpectedly,
    what do we do? The first suggestion is: Don't be surprised.
    Because you are still practising, you are not enlightened and
    don't be disappointed, don't feel guilty, don't get angry
    about yourself because you got angry. So this is very very
    important, otherwise what happens is, specially this can
    happen to meditators, when we take to meditation, we form an
    image:&#146;I am a meditator now. I am practising loving
    kindness. This is how I should behave.&#146; It is good to
    have an image but an image is one thing, reality is another.
    So at that moment when you have not been aware and you got
    angry, what you can do is just be with that without feeling
    bad, no need to give yourself a minus. Please realize that.
    It is very very important. But what has to be done is after
    you recover from that anger, may be after five minutes, may
    be after ten minutes, may be after thirty minutes, it doesn't
    matter even if on the following day, when you have recovered
    from that, then you reflect on that action. And that kind of
    reflection has to be done in a very friendly gentle way. Just
    to ask the question: What really happened to me? So you take
    your mind backwards and then try to see that incident
    objectively and also seeing the different aspects of that
    incident. So our anger becomes our object of meditation. So
    our shortcomings, our failures, become learning experience.
    So that what is also important when we practise this way, we
    don't have this fear to make mistakes, otherwise we become so
    concerned on doing things perfectly, correctly and this can
    generate such a lot of tension, such a lot of suffering.
    Please realise that this is not giving in to them but
    relating to our shortcomings in an entirely different way, a
    more meaningful way, a more creative way, in a way where it
    will reduce more suffering and we can also do what is
    necessary. So then you say: &#145;Now let me see, next time I
    face a situation, how I will behave.&#146; And just wait and
    see. So you are waiting for such opportunities to see how
    your behaviour is. To put it in another way, because you have
    got angry, there is no wound. So in a sense we come to a
    state where when we have got angry, there is less suffering
    as a result, and I think this is a very important state.
    Anything else?</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 5: </b>You said there might
    have been things done wrongly in the past where we did not
    forgive others and did not forgive ourselves and usually we
    will suppress these things in our heart. At this moment, how
    do I know whether I have suppressed these things in the past
    and bring them out to heal them. I would like to ask this.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Very good.
    Let's take a practical situation where a wound has been
    created in relation to what you have done to another person,
    you have acted incorrectly and then you suffer from guilt. So
    the first point is to realize how the wound was created in
    the first place. So when you enquire into that question, you
    realize the wound has been created by your idea: This is how
    I should have behaved. So you realize the problem has been
    with your model of how you should behave. So it is helpful to
    understand this because this can help us to heal this wound.
    This is the first point. The second point is to realize, as I
    said earlier, we are still human, we are still imperfect, so
    therefore as I have been saying very often, learn to forgive
    our humanness, to forgive our imperfections. </p>
    <p>The next suggestion is to realize that these things
    happened in the past. We cannot change the past so why I am
    holding onto something that has happened in the past.</p>
    <p>Maybe the last point, I hope I can communicate this, is we
    carry the wounds in our memory. And as they are related to
    memories, the more we try to forget it, the more it comes. We
    have no control over our memory. The control we have is not
    in relation to memory but how we respond to the memory. This
    is where meditation comes in. This is where we can work with
    it in practical terms. So when the memory comes in relation
    to what you have done, what you can observe is our reaction
    to the memory: guilt. Now this is where awareness is
    relevant, so with awareness, we learn that there is guilt,
    and as we have also been practising, we learn to say O.K. to
    that guilt, we learn to feel friendly with that guilt, just
    to allow that guilt. Then again after some time, you might
    remember that incident and then again guilt will come, so
    again we are creating space for that guilt to be there. I can
    be also interesting sometimes to deliberately and consciously
    bring it up and see how we are relating to that memory. When
    one day you have the experience, the memory comes but there
    is no guilt and when that happens, it shows that the wound is
    healed. Then the memory might come but the corresponding
    emotion will not be there. We might deliberately and
    consciously bring up the memory and the corresponding emotion
    will not be there.</p>
    <p>One last suggestion is to realize that holding onto such
    wounds is something very very self destructive. So these are
    ways and means of healing such wounds. So whether it is
    guilt, whether it is grief, whether it is hatred, the tools
    are the same.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Male 5: </b>Today, I deliberately
    brought things up to see if there are wounds or not but there
    was no reaction. Could it be a delusion? Would such a thing
    happen?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>This shows
    they have been healed. So don't worry. So no need to feel
    unhappy: &#145;I don't have wounds. Why don't I have
    wounds?&#146; In a way you can give yourselves a plus because
    most people have wounds. So just to say: &#145;I don't have
    wounds, it's good, nice.&#146;</p>
    <p>I think on one occasion I said those who do not have
    wounds, please send loving kindness to those who are trying
    to heal the wounds, because some people are really struggling
    with wounds. I know it is so strong in them, so deep in them
    that it takes a lot for them for healing. I know it by
    experience working with meditators.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 2: </b>Love and hate are
    the same thing.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>Can you give
    us some examples? I am a simple man. I like practical
    examples.</p>
    <p><font color="#7F0000"><b>Female 2: </b>You mentioned if
    our wound is hatred, we can deliberately bring it up and look
    at the hatred, and if we have no reaction to it, that means
    the wound is healed. But what about love, can we dig up
    situations where we have loved, where we have loved ones and
    then see if we have any emotion when we dig out this memory
    of love? For instance, not a parting of ways but for some
    reason you sacrifice yourself for his or her good, there can
    be deep emotions when they are dug out. Should it be treated
    in the same way as we deal with anger?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#7F007F"><b>Godwin: </b></font>No, certainly
    not. When you remember such acts or when such acts you
    deliberately and consciously bring up without any unpleasant
    emotions, what you will be having is pleasant emotions. So
    you can feel happy about what you have done to another
    person. I would suggest that it is important for us also to
    sometimes think of the good things we have also done. This
    can give us lots of joy, lots of happiness, lots of lightness
    and this will also be an incentive to do more and more such
    actions of love. In Sri Lanka, we have an old custom, now it
    is no longer there, to have, they call it, <i>a</i> <i>book
    of merits</i>. So you note the good things you have done, the
    skilful things you have done and at the time that person is
    dying, they read out the book. Because usually we give more
    power, more energy to our mistakes so I think it is very
    important, in fact this is mentioned in the Dhamma, to
    deliberately and consciously, to think when they come up,
    just to feel those emotions. </p>
    <p>So now something about tomorrow's practice. So one thing
    is that tomorrow we will try to make it a day of silence as
    far as possible. But this does not mean if you have to speak
    for something functional, something important that you should
    not speak, but as far as possible, let's make it a day of
    silence. This is one suggestion I like to offer. Today, it
    was a day of loving kindness, tomorrow we will make it a day
    of emotions. So tomorrow, we make an effort to allow emotions
    to arise, whether it is pleasant as in the case you mentioned
    or unpleasant, let them arise. So with pleasant emotions that
    arise, this might give more joy, more happiness, allow that
    to happen and with unpleasant emotions, we learn how to work
    with them, how to use them because I know some of the
    meditators here are still struggling with unpleasant emotions
    that are coming up. So tomorrow if you learn not to push them
    away because they are unpleasant, not to control them, not to
    deny them, but just to allow them to arise if there is a need
    to arise. When they arise, love it and can you make friends
    with it, can you love it? What can we learn from it? So let's
    use some of these tools tomorrow and see what happens. So in
    the evening, we can have a very practical experience for
    discussion on emotions and then discuss more about this
    aspect of emotions.</p>
    <p>There is a connection between silence and emotions. With
    more and more silence, I think it allows for emotions to
    arise, maybe both types of emotions. So let's see what
    happens tomorrow.</p>
    <p>Now let us do some chanting.</p>
