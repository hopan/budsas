      <P>Information about the Money Rules</P>
      </B>
      <P>This article was written for the many bhikkhus who have asked me 
      questions about the money rules found in the Vinaya. Since a newly 
      ordained bhikkhu has little chance of being able to read the commentaries 
      I have translated many sections from there. I hope that there is 
      sufficient information in this article to help bhikkhus to understand how 
      to keep these rules.</P>
      <FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#000080"><B>
      <P>Part 1. Information for Lay Supporters</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P>Do you know that the Buddha did not allow monks and novices to accept 
      money?</P>
      <P>You will certainly have noticed that the vast majority of monks do 
      accept and use money. This is one of the factors that will lead to the 
      disappearance of the Buddha´s Teaching. You can help to keep the Buddha´s 
      Teaching alive by learning how to offer allowable requisites.</P>
      <P>In this section we will list the main points that a layperson should 
      remember so that a monk (bhikkhu) may obtain requisites without breaking 
      the rules of Vinaya.</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>1. Never offer money to bhikkhus, but only offer allowable requisites 
        such as robes, medicine, books, or tickets for transport. If you are 
        unsure as to what a bhikkhu needs then you can ask him, or invite him to 
        ask you if he needs anything.</P>
        <P>2. A fund for requisites can be left with a kappiya (someone who 
        performs services for a bhikkhu) and he should be instructed to buy and 
        offer requisites for a bhikkhu, a group of bhikkhus, or the sangha of a 
        monastery. Do not ask the bhikkhu, `To whom should this be given to?´ If 
        you ask in this way then it is not allowable for a bhikkhu to point out 
        a kappiya. Simply say, `Venerable Sir, I want to offer requisites to 
        you. Who is your kappiya?´</P>
        <P>3. Having instructed the kappiya then inform the bhikkhu by saying, 
        `I have left a fund for requisites worth `x´ dollars with your kappiya. 
        When you need requisites ask him and he will offer them to you.´</P>
        <P>4. If you already know who the bhikkhu´s kappiya is then you can 
        simply leave the fund with the kappiya and inform the bhikkhu as above 
        in no 3.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Please read the above carefully and take note of what to say. The above 
      procedure was allowed by the Buddha in what is called the `Mendaka 
      allowance´. It is found in the <I><B>Bhesajja Khandhaka</B></I> of 
      Mahavagga in the Vinaya Pitaka and the translation of it reads:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Bhikkhus, there are people of faith and respect and if they should 
        entrust money in the hands of a kappiya and instruct him saying, `With 
        this money offer allowable requisites to this Venerable One,´ then 
        bhikkhus I allow you to accept whatever allowable requisites are 
        obtained with that money, but bhikkhus, in no way whatsoever do I allow 
        money to be accepted or searched for.´</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Also a rule called <I><B>Raja-sikkhapada,</B></I> the tenth rule of the 
      Kathina Vagga in the Nissaggiya Pacittiya section of the Patimokkha gives 
      relevant information. It is translated as follows:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>If a king, a king´s officer, a brahmin, or a layperson should send a 
        messenger with money in order to buy a robe for a bhikkhu saying, 
        `Having bought a robe with this money offer it to such and such a 
        bhikkhu,´ and if that messenger should approach that bhikkhu and say, 
        `Venerable Sir, this money for buying a robe has been brought here for 
        you. Venerable Sir, please accept this money for buying a robe.´ Then 
        that bhikkhu should say to that messenger, `We do not accept money for 
        buying a robe, we accept robes if they are offered at an appropriate 
        time and if they are allowable.´</P>
        <P>If then that messenger should ask, `Venerable Sir, is there anyone 
        who performs services for you?´ Then if that bhikkhu wants a robe he 
        should point out someone who performs services for him be he a monastery 
        attendant or a layperson saying, `Such and such performs services for 
        bhikkhus.´</P>
        <P>If that messenger having instructed that person who performs services 
        should then approach that bhikkhu and say, `That person who you pointed 
        out has been instructed by me. Venerable Sir, approach him at an 
        appropriate time and he will offer you a robe.´ Then a bhikkhu who wants 
        a robe having approached that person who performs services can ask or 
        remind him two or three times saying, `I need a robe.´</P>
        <P>If having asked or reminded two or three times he obtains that robe 
        then that is good. If he should not obtain it then he can stand silently 
        for four, five, or six times in order to obtain that robe. If having 
        stood silently for four, five, or six times he obtains that robe then 
        that is good. If he should make any more effort than this and he obtains 
        that robe then it is a nissaggiya pacittiya offense.</P>
        <P>If he does not obtain that robe then he should go himself or he 
        should send a messenger to that person who sent that money for buying a 
        robe and say, `That money for buying a robe for a bhikkhu that you sent 
        has produced nothing at all for that bhikkhu, try to get your money 
        returned to you lest your money be lost.´ This is what should be done.</P>

      <P>Part 2. The Fault in Accepting Money</P>
      </FONT></B>
      <P>Before he passed away the Buddha said that after his death the sangha, 
      if it wanted to, could revoke the lesser and minor rules of the Vinaya. 
      Some bhikkhus quote this as a reason to support their acceptance of money, 
      but the following quotes from the suttas show that the rules prohibiting 
      money are not lesser or minor rules. The money rules are shown by these 
      quotes to be fundamental and essential for the attainment of 
      enlightenment. Maniculaka Sutta (Samyutta Nikaya, Salayatana Samyutta, 
      Gamani Vagga, sutta no. 10): </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>At one time, the Blessed One was living in Rajagaha in the place 
        where squirrels and birds were fed called Veluvana. At that time in the 
        king´s palace, the king´s retinue were assembled and whilst assembled 
        this conversation arose amongst them:</P>
        <P>`Gold, silver, and money are allowable for those monks who are the 
        sons of the Sakyan prince (the Buddha). Those monks who are the sons of 
        the Sakyan prince consent to gold, silver, and money. Those monks who 
        are the sons of the Sakyan prince accept gold, silver, and money.´</P>
        <P>Then at that time Maniculaka the village headman was sitting present 
        in that assembly and he spoke to that assembly saying:</P>
        <P>`Good sirs, do not say that. Gold, silver, and money are not 
        allowable for those monks who are sons of the Sakyan prince. Those monks 
        who are the sons of the Sakyan prince do not consent to gold, silver, or 
        money. Those monks who are the sons of the Sakyan prince do not accept 
        gold, silver, and money. Those monks who are the sons of the Sakyan 
        prince have renounced gold and gems and are without money.´</P>
        <P>But Maniculaka the village headman was unable to convince that 
        assembly.</P>
        <P>Then Maniculaka the village headman went to the Blessed One, and 
        having approached the Blessed One bowed to him and sat down at one side. 
        While sitting at one side Maniculaka the village headman said to the 
        Blessed One:</P>
        <P>`Venerable Sir, in the king´s palace the king´s retinue were 
        assembled... (He repeated all that had been said above.)... But 
        Venerable Sir, I was not able to convince that assembly. </P>
        <P>`Venerable Sir, by thus explaining am I one who speaks what is said 
        by the Blessed One or have I falsely misrepresented the Blessed One? 
        Have I answered in accordance with this Teaching or would someone 
        speaking in accordance with this Teaching find reason to blame me?´</P>
        <P>(The Blessed One:) `Truly you, headman, by thus explaining are one 
        who speaks what is said by me and did not falsely misrepresent me. You 
        have answered in accordance with this Teaching and someone speaking in 
        accordance with this Teaching would not find reason to blame you.</P>
        <P>`For, headman, gold, silver, and money are not allowable for those 
        monks who are the sons of the Sakyan prince. Those monks who are the 
        sons of the Sakyan prince do not consent to gold, silver, or money. 
        Those monks who are the sons of the Sakyan prince do not accept gold, 
        silver, or money. Those monks who are the sons of the Sakyan prince have 
        renounced gold and gems and are without money.</P>
        <P>`Headman, for whoever gold, silver, or money are allowable then for 
        him the five types of sense pleasure are allowable. For whoever the five 
        types of sense pleasure are allowable you can be certain, &quot;He does not 
        possess the nature of a monk, he does not possess the nature of a son of 
        the Sakyan prince.&quot; </P>
        <P>`Headman, really I say this, &quot;By a monk who needs grass, grass can be 
        searched for. For a monk who needs timber, timber can be searched for. 
        For a monk who needs a cart, a cart can be searched for.&quot; But, headman, 
        I also say, &quot;In no way whatsoever can gold, silver, or money be accepted 
        or searched for.&quot;´</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The next quote from the end of Upakkilesa Sutta (Anguttara Nikaya, Book 
      of Fours, Rohitassa Vagga, sutta no. 10) demonstrates that accepting money 
      leads to continued rebirth.</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>`Stained by lust, anger, and blinded by ignorance<BR>
        some monks and brahmins take delight in sense pleasures.<BR>
        Those foolish monks and brahmins drink alcohol,<BR>
        engage in sexual intercourse,<BR>
        accept gold, silver, and money,<BR>
        and obtain their requisites by wrong livelihood.<BR>
        All of these are called corruptions by the Buddha who shines like the 
        sun.<BR>
        Those foolish monks and brahmins who are corrupted by these corruptions,<BR>
        impure, and defiled, do not blaze or shine.<BR>
        But instead bewildered, blinded, slaves to desire, and full of craving<BR>
        they increase the size of cemeteries by taking birth again and again.´</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>In these suttas the Buddha has equated the acceptance of money with the 
      indulgence in sense pleasures. In the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta the 
      Buddha clearly instructs:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>`These two extremes, bhikkhus, should not be practised by one who has 
        gone forth. Which two? Indulgence in sense pleasure which is low, the 
        way of villagers, the way of ordinary people, the way of the 
        unenlightened, and unprofitable; and self-mortification which is 
        painful, the way of the unenlightened, and unprofitable.´</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>It is taught that even a layperson who is an anagami (non-returner) 
      keeps the ten precepts naturally and does not accept or use money. For 
      example the anagami Ghatikara was without gems, gold, silver, or money, 
      and made his living by taking earth that had eroded from the river bank 
      and making it into pots. These pots he left at the side of the road and 
      anyone who wished could leave a suitable amount of rice or food and take 
      the pots. In this way Ghatikara supported himself and his blind parents. 
      (See Ghatikara Sutta of Majjhima Nikaya.)</P>
      <P>This demonstrates how money is an impediment to enlightenment and how 
      the truly enlightened do not use money. The above quotes all prove that 
      the acceptance of money by monks is not a small fault, and that it can 
      render a monk incapable of attaining Nibbana.</P>
      <B><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#000080">
      <P>Part 3. The Rules concerning Money</P>
      </FONT></B>
      <P>The meaning of `money´ in all these rules is: Anything that is used as 
      currency for buying and selling. It includes coins, banknotes, cheques, 
      gold, and silver.</P>
      <P>Why is a cheque unallowable? A cheque is unallowable because sometimes 
      it is negotiable and also because a cheque is a command to a bank to give 
      money to the bearer. It usually says something like, `Pay the sum of one 
      hundred dollars to the bearer, Dhamminda Bhikkhu.´ Therefore a cheque 
      written out to a monk is a command to give money to that monk and if he 
      accepts it then he is accepting that money in the bank. It is the same as 
      the third way of accepting money; `In such and such a place that money, 
      that is mine, that is for you.´ Therefore a cheque is a way of giving 
      money to a monk and must be refused.</P>
      <P>A monk who writes a cheque commits an offense for commanding money. If 
      he accepted the fund in the first place it would be a nissaggiya pacittiya 
      offense or if the fund was left with a kappiya in a correct way it is a 
      dukkata offense for wrong arrangement.</P>
      <P>A novice is required to keep ten precepts of which the tenth is to 
      abstain from accepting gold, silver, and money. In practise this means 
      that a samanera keeps all the rules connected with money in the same way 
      as a monk does.</P>
      <P>For monks (bhikkhus) there are four major rules concerning money found 
      in the Vinaya:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>1. Rupiya-sikkhapada (Nissaggiya Pacittiya, no. 18)<BR>
        2. Mendaka-sikkhapada (Vinaya Mahavagga, Bhesajja Khandhaka)<BR>
        3. Raja-sikkhapada (Nissaggiya Pacittiya, no.10)<BR>
        4. Rupiya-samvohara-sikkhapada (Nissaggiya Pacittiya, no. 19)</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The translations of 2 &amp; 3 have already been given above and the 
      translations of 1 &amp; 4 are as follows:</P>
      <B>
      <P>1. Rupiya-sikkhapada</B><BR>
      Whatever bhikkhu should himself accept money or cause another to accept it 
      for him, or consent to having it placed near him or kept for him, has 
      committed a nissaggiya pacittiya offense.</P>
      <B>
      <P>4. Rupiya-samvohara-sikkhapada</B><BR>
      Whatever bhikkhu should engage in the exchange of any of the various forms 
      of gold, silver, or money has committed a nissaggiya pacittiya offense.</P>
      <P>Rupiya-sikkhapada needs to be thoroughly understood because if this 
      rule is kept properly a monk will not misinterpret the other rules 
      concerning money. It prohibits a monk form doing three things:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>a. Accepting money himself.<BR>
        b. Causing another to accept money for him.<BR>
        c. Consenting to having money placed near him or kept for him.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The original Pali text defines these three as:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>a. sayam ganhati - He takes it himself.<BR>
        b. aññam gahapeti - He causes another to take it for him.<BR>
        c. idam ayassa hotu ti upanikkhittam sadiyati - They say, `This is for 
        you Venerable Sir,´ and he consents to their placing it near him.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Kankhavitarani commentary explains the above three ways of accepting in 
      this way:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>1. He takes money himself when it is offered for him, or he takes it 
        himself when he has found it in any place and it does not belong to 
        anyone.</P>
        <P>2. In these same instances (when it is offered for him or he has 
        found it) he causes another to take it (for him).</P>
        <P>3. If with the money in his presence they say, `This is for you,´ or 
        when the money is kept somewhere else they say, `In such and such a 
        place that money, that is mine, that is for you.´ Then if they 
        communicate that donation by simply speech or hand signals and that monk 
        does not refuse that by bodily sign or speech and accepts it mentally 
        then that is called `consenting.´ If he consents mentally and desires to 
        accept, but by body or speech he refuses saying, `This is not 
        allowable,´ or if he does not refuse by body or speech but with a pure 
        mind does not consent thinking, `This is not allowable for us,´ then 
        that is allowable (not called consenting).</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>With this rule, the Buddha has prohibited all the possible ways in 
      which money could be accepted. If someone tries to offer money to a monk 
      in any of these three ways he cannot say: `Such and such is my kappiya. 
      Give this money to my kappiya. Take this money for me. Put the money over 
      there.´ All he can do is refuse to accept that money by saying, `This is 
      not allowable.´ Refusal is the only action he needs to remember to do.</P>
      <P>The Samantapasadika commentary explains that it is not only unallowable 
      to accept money in one of these three ways for oneself, but also if the 
      money is for the sangha, a group, another person, a pagoda, a monastery, 
      or for anything else. If a monk accepts money in one of these three ways 
      for himself it is a nissaggiya pacittiya offense. If he accepts for the 
      others just mentioned it is a dukkata offense.</P>
      <P>There is a recently written book on Vinaya which presents a mistaken 
      viewpoint. It says: </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>One is allowed to `cause to be deposited´ money for a monastery, for 
        a fund for requisites, for a charitable appeal (orphanage fund say), but 
        not for any particular monk. For example a donor giving money to the 
        temple may be instructed to, `Put it in the donation box´, or `Put it in 
        this account number´, though such money may not be received into a 
        monk´s hands. The sangha, or its appointed officers may direct the use 
        of such a fund, even saying, `Buy this,´ or `Get that.´</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>It has been shown above that it is not allowable to cause to be 
      accepted or deposited, money for a temple or for anything else. This 
      viewpoint therefore is not in agreement with the Vinaya.</P>
      <P>The commentary illustrates the principles involved in these rules with 
      a fictitious story. It deals with a situation in which the donor ignores 
      the refusal of the monk and simply leaves the money in front of the monk 
      and departs. It shows that:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>1. If a monk says, `Keep it here,´ it would be a nissaggiya offense 
        for accepting.<BR>
        2. If the monk wishes to buy something and says, `Take this,´ it would 
        be arranging in an unallowable way. (If the fund were allowable).<BR>
        3. This rule is like walking a tightrope with only a slip of the tongue 
        being necessary to fall into committing an offense.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The story reads:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Suppose that a person should place a hundred or a thousand coins at a 
        bhikkhus feet and say, `This is for you,´ and the bhikkhu refuses it 
        saying, `This is not allowable,´ but the layperson replies, `I have 
        given this to you,´ and then departs.</P>
        <P>Then if another layperson comes and asks, `Venerable Sir, what is 
        this?´ Then he can be told what was said by the first person and by the 
        bhikkhu. If that layperson should say, `Venerable Sir, let me keep it 
        secure, show me a secure place.´ Then having ascended a seven storied 
        mansion he can explain, `This place is secure,´ but he should not say, 
        `Keep it here.´ By saying just this much it becomes allowable or 
        unallowable. (Vimativinodana sub-commentary states: If he says, `Keep it 
        here,´ that is accepting money and a nissaggiya pacittiya offense.) He 
        can then close the door and protect it.</P>
        <P>If later a salesman comes with merchandise such as a bowl or robes 
        and says, `Take this Venerable Sir,´ then the bhikkhu can say, 
        `Layperson I have need for this and the means to obtain it exists, but 
        there is no kappiya here now.´ And if the salesman says, `I will be your 
        kappiya, open the door and give it to me.´ Then having opened the door 
        he should say, `It is placed in this room.´ He should not say, `Take 
        this.´ Thus depending on what is said does it become allowable or 
        unallowable. Then if that salesman should take those coins and give 
        allowable requisites to the bhikkhu then that is allowable. If he takes 
        too many coins then that bhikkhu should say, `I will not take your 
        merchandise, go away!´</P>

      A translation of this was given above. There is no separate information to 
      this allowance in the commentaries. Everything that needs to be said about 
      it is explained in the commentary to Raja-sikkhapada. The last line of 
      this allowance is worth remembering as a summary of all the rules 
      concerning money: `Bhikkhus, in no way whatsoever do I allow money to be 
      accepted or searched for.´</P>
      <B>
      <P>3. Raja-sikkhapada</B><BR>
      A translation of this was given above. The commentary to this rule gives a 
      lot of information which helps a monk to know what to say and do in 
      different situations. Below are some translations of selected quotes from 
      the commentaries along with some further explanations by the author.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>Selections from Kankhavitarani Commentary</P>
      </B></I>
      <P>1. `Having bought a robe with this money, offer it to such and such a 
      bhikkhu´, is said (in the rule) to show the purity of intention with which 
      the money is sent. If the donor sends the messenger saying, `Give this 
      money to such and such a bhikkhu,´ then that is sent impurely because of 
      reference to money which is unallowable. In that case a bhikkhu should 
      never point out a person as a kappiya.</P>
      <P>If the donor himself comes and says, `I offer this money to you,´ then 
      a bhikkhu cannot point out a kappiya. If a bhikkhu just says, `Such and 
      such is my kappiya,´ at this point it would be causing money to be 
      accepted for him and a nissaggiya pacittiya offense. All a bhikkhu can do 
      in this case is refuse to accept the money.</P>
      <P>2. `We do not accept money for buying a robe, we accept robes if they 
      are offered at an appropriate time and if they are allowable,´ has been 
      said to show that the money must be refused because, even though the fund 
      for a robe was sent in a pure way, the speech of the messenger is 
      unallowable. (`Please accept this money for buying a robe.´)</P>
      <P>A fund of gold, silver, coins, or currency is a cause for a nissaggiya 
      pacittiya offense. Pearls, gems, rubies, precious stones, the seven types 
      of grains, female slaves, male slaves, paddy fields, cultivated fields, 
      orchards, or flower gardens are called things which are the cause for a 
      dukkata offense. It is not allowed to accept any of these for oneself, a 
      pagoda, the sangha, a group, or another person.</P>
      <P>Here and elsewhere throughout the commentaries `to accept´ means to 
      accept in any one of the three ways mentioned in Rupiya-sikkhapada.</P>
      <P>3. If the messenger asks in an allowable way saying, `Venerable Sir, is 
      there anyone who performs services for you?´ Then it is permitted to point 
      someone out. If however the messenger asks, `Who will take this?´ or `Who 
      should I give this to?´ then it is not allowable to point out anyone as a 
      kappiya.</P>
      <P>If the bhikkhu points out a kappiya when the layman asks in the wrong 
      way it will be a nissaggiya pacittiya offense for causing another to 
      accept the money for him.</P>
      <P>4. `Such and such performs services for bhikkhus´, is said to show the 
      allowable way of speech for a bhikkhu. He can only say it in this way and 
      should not say, `Give it to him. He will keep it. He will exchange it. He 
      will purchase it.´</P>
      <P>If the layperson asks in the allowable way the bhikkhu can point out a 
      kappiya only in the allowable way. If he points out in the wrong way it 
      will be a nissaggiya pacittiya offense.</P>
      <P>5. `That person who you pointed out has been instructed by me. 
      Venerable Sir, approach him at an appropriate time and he will offer you a 
      robe,´ means: that person has been commanded by me when the need for a 
      robe arises for you he will offer you a robe. If the messenger really says 
      this then, after being informed like this, it is allowable to ask for a 
      robe. It is not allowable to ask if he merely goes and gives the fund for 
      a robe into the hands of a kappiya.</P>
      <P>It would be wrong-livelihood to ask for a robe from someone who had not 
      given an invitation to ask.</P>
      <P>6. If a bhikkhu says, `This is a person who performs services for 
      bhikkhus,´ pointing out a person who is present at that time. Then if the 
      messenger in the presence of the bhikkhu gives the fund into the hands of 
      that person saying, `Having bought a robe for this Thera offer it to him,´ 
      and then he leaves. Then even without being told, `... has been instructed 
      by me...´ it is allowable for the bhikkhu to ask for a robe.</P>
      <P>If the messenger as he is about to leave should say to the bhikkhu, `I 
      will give this into his hands, you take a robe,´ and if then he leaves or 
      if he sends another person to inform the bhikkhu then in either of these 
      cases it is allowable to ask for a robe. Even though this rule only 
      mentions a `messenger´ if the donor himself were to bring the fund then 
      the procedure is the same and the distinctions are the same as just 
      mentioned above.</P>
      <P>7. `I need a robe,´ shows the correct way for asking for the robe. It 
      is allowable to say anything of the same meaning using any language 
      whatsoever. It is never allowable to say, `Give me a robe, Bring me a 
      robe, Purchase me a robe, Buy me a robe.´</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>Selections from Samantapasadika Commentary</P>
      </B></I>
      <P>1. Not only is it unallowable to accept money for oneself, but it is 
      also unallowable to accept money if it is brought by the donor and he 
      says, `This I offer to the sangha. Make a park, pagoda, eating hall or 
      anything whatsoever.´ Whoever accepts money for any other person has 
      committed a dukkata offense according to Mahapaccariya commentary. (An old 
      commentary no longer extant.)</P>
      <P>2. If a bhikkhu refuses to accept money saying, `It is not allowable 
      for bhikkhus to accept this.´ Then if the donor says, `I will place this 
      in the hands of a carpenter or workman. You simply watch them to see that 
      their work is done properly.´ Then if he gives the money into their hands 
      and leaves then that is allowable. If he says, `I will place this in the 
      hands of my man or I will keep it myself. Whatever you want to be given to 
      whomever send them to me to obtain it.´ This is also allowable.</P>
      <P>3. If without referring to the sangha, a group, or an individual they 
      simply say, `We give this gold, silver, or money for the pagoda, for the 
      monastery, for new work,´ then it is not allowed to refuse that. The 
      bhikkhu should inform his kappiya saying, `This is what they said.´ If 
      however they should say, `We offer this for the benefit of the pagoda, 
      monastery, new work, you take this and keep it.´ Then the bhikkhu must 
      refuse it saying, `It is not allowable for us to take this.´</P>
      <P>In the first case the bhikkhu does not have to refuse because he is not 
      being asked to accept the money. He cannot do anything except to tell his 
      kappiya what they said. He cannot accept that money.</P>
      <P>4. If a person should bring a large amount of gold, silver, or money 
      and say, `This I offer to the sangha, Venerable Sirs, use the four 
      requisites obtained from this.´ Then if that sangha should accept that 
      then that acceptance is an offense and using the requisites obtained with 
      it is also an offense.</P>
      <P>If at that time when it is offered to the sangha one bhikkhu refuses it 
      by saying, `This is not allowable,´ and that layperson goes away saying, 
      `If this is not allowable then I will keep it.´ Then those other bhikkhus 
      should not say to that bhikkhu, `You have obstructed the gains of the 
      sangha,´ or anything else to that effect. For whoever says such a thing to 
      him has committed an offense (dukkata) because by refusing that single 
      bhikkhu has saved many from committing an offense.</P>
      <P>If those bhikkhus refuse the money saying, `It is not allowable,´ and 
      the layperson then says, `I will give this into the hands of a kappiya or 
      to my man or keep it myself. You just accept and use the requisites 
      obtained with it.´ That is allowable.</P>
      <P>The commentary explains that the method shown in this rule does not 
      need to be practised with all kappiyas. It explains that there are ten 
      types and two classes of kappiyas. The details are as follows:</P>
      <P>5. If a certain person sends a messenger with a fund for buying a robe 
      for a bhikkhu and that messenger having approached that bhikkhu should 
      say, `Venerable Sir, such and such a person has sent this money to buy a 
      robe for you. Take this money.´ Then that bhikkhu must refuse saying, 
      `This is not allowable.´ If the messenger then asks, `Venerable Sir, do 
      you have anyone who performs services for you?´ Then if there is such a 
      person whether he has been instructed by a layperson saying, `You perform 
      services for these bhikkhus,´ or if he is just a friend or associate of 
      that bhikkhu and performs services for him. Then if at that moment that 
      person is sitting in the presence of that bhikkhu and he points him out 
      saying, `This is a person who performs services for bhikkhus.´ Then if the 
      messenger should give that fund into the hands of that person and say, 
      `Having bought a robe give it to this Thera,´ and then he leaves. Then 
      this is called pointed out by the bhikkhu in his presence. (1)</P>
      <P>However if that person is not sitting in the presence of that bhikkhu 
      at that time and the bhikkhu points him out saying, `In such and such a 
      village a person called such and such performs services for bhikkhus.´ 
      Then if that messenger having gone there should give the fund into that 
      person´s hands saying, `Having bought a robe give it to this Thera,´ and 
      then should return to the bhikkhu and inform him of this before leaving. 
      Then this is called pointed out by the bhikkhu not in his presence. (2)</P>
      <P>If however the messenger does not return himself to inform the bhikkhu, 
      but sends another person to inform him saying, `Venerable Sir, the fund 
      for a robe was given by us into the hands of that person. You take a 
      robe.´ Then this is called a second type pointed out by the bhikkhu not in 
      his presence. (3)</P>
      <P>If however the messenger does not send someone like this, but instead 
      before going says to the bhikkhu, `Venerable Sir, I will give the fund for 
      a robe to that person, you take a robe.´ Then this is a third type pointed 
      out by a bhikkhu not in his presence. (4)</P>
      <P>Thus there are four kappiyas pointed out by a bhikkhu, one pointed out 
      by a bhikkhu in his presence and three pointed out by a bhikkhu not in his 
      presence. In all of these four instances a bhikkhu should practise in 
      exactly the same way as stated in the rule of Raja-sikkhapada. .</P>
      <P>If the bhikkhu has been asked by the messenger in the same way as 
      previously stated above and if the bhikkhu because of either having no 
      kappiya or no desire to make such arrangements should say, `I do not have 
      a kappiya.´ Then if at that time a person arrives and the messenger gives 
      that fund into that person´s hands and leaves after having said, `Take a 
      robe from the hands of this person.´ Then this is called pointed out by 
      the messenger in the presence of the bhikkhu. (1)</P>
      <P>In another case the messenger enters into the village himself and 
      selects a person and gives the fund into the hands of that person. Then in 
      the same ways as was previously stated either returns and informs the 
      bhikkhu, sends another to inform him, or before going says, `I will give 
      this fund into the hands of a person named such and such, you take a 
      robe,´ and then leaves. These three cases are called pointed out by the 
      messenger not in the presence of the bhikkhu. (2, 3 &amp; 4)</P>
      <P>These four together are called kappiyas pointed out by the messenger. 
      In these four cases a bhikkhu should practise in exactly the same way as 
      is said in Mendaka allowance which says:</P>
      <P>Bhikkhus, there are people of faith and respect and if they should 
      entrust money in the hands of a kappiya and instruct him saying, `With 
      this money offer allowable requisites to this Venerable One,´ then 
      bhikkhus I allow you to accept whatever allowable requisites are obtained 
      with that money, but bhikkhus, in no way whatsoever do I allow money to be 
      accepted or searched for.´</P>
      <P>According to this allowance there is no limit to the number of times a 
      bhikkhu can ask. A bhikkhu, who has not consented to the acceptance of the 
      fund, even if he asked or stood for a thousand times is allowed to accept 
      the allowable requisites obtained. If they do not give anything, then 
      having appointed another person as his kappiya he should cause that person 
      to bring the requisites. <I>[A bhikkhu is not allowed to cause the money 
      to be transferred from one kappiya to another. He should say to the new 
      kappiya, `Someone has left a fund for robes with such and such and I need 
      a robe.´]</I> If he wishes to he can inform the original donor, but he 
      does not have to if he does not wish to.</P>
      <P>If the bhikkhu has been asked by the messenger in the same way as 
      stated above and the bhikkhu replies, `I do not have a kappiya.´ Then if a 
      certain person present at that time should hear that and say, `Friend 
      bring that here, I will buy a robe for the Venerable One and give it to 
      him.´ Then if that messenger should say, `Well then friend you give it,´ 
      and having given that fund into that persons hands and without informing 
      the bhikkhu should leave (without telling the bhikkhu that he should take 
      a robe from that person). This is called becoming a kappiya by ones own 
      mouth.</P>
      <P>In another case if the messenger should simply give the fund to any 
      person and tell him, `You give a robe to the Venerable One,´ and then 
      leave. Then this is called becoming a kappiya by the mouth of another.</P>
      <P>These last two types are called kappiyas which are not pointed out. In 
      these cases a bhikkhu should practise in the same way as if they were 
      people who are not relatives or who have not given an invitation to ask 
      for requisites. If they of their own accord bring a robe and offer it then 
      it can be accepted. If they don´t he should not say anything.</P>
      <P>Even though in the rule only a messenger brings the fund, if the donor 
      brings it himself or it is a fund for food or something else the procedure 
      is the same as above.</P>
      <P>4. <B>Rupiya-samvohara-sikkhapada</B><BR>
      Whatever bhikkhu should engage in the exchange of any of the various forms 
      of gold, silver, or money has committed a nissaggiya pacittiya offense.</P>
      <P>Rupiya-samvohara-sikkhapada prohibited the accepting of gold, silver, 
      or money. This rule prohibits the exchange of gold, silver, and money for 
      other things made of gold or silver (such as jewellery), or for allowable 
      goods (such as robes, bowls, or other requisites). This rule also 
      prohibits the exchange of allowable requisites, or things made of gold or 
      silver, for gold, silver, or money.</P>
      <P>The Samantapasadika commentary gives an explanation by way of an 
      example called `the four unallowable bowls.´ It reads:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>In order to show the great fault in breaking this rule the four 
        unallowable bowls should be explained: If a bhikkhu having accepted 
        money buys iron ore and has it smelted into iron and then made into an 
        alms-bowl. Then this bowl is called a `great unallowable bowl´ because 
        there is no way whatsoever by which it can be made allowable. If that 
        bowl is broken up and made into cups they would also be unallowable. If 
        it is made into a knife then tooth-woods made with that knife would be 
        unallowable. If it is made into fish hooks then even the fish caught on 
        them would be unallowable. If he were to heat the blade of a knife made 
        from it and dip it into water or milk and warm them then that water or 
        milk would be unallowable.</P>
        <P>If a bhikkhu having accepted money buys a ready-made bowl then that 
        bowl is unallowable. It is said in Mahapaccariya Commentary that, `That 
        bowl is unallowable to any bhikkhu, bhikkhuni, samanera, samaneri, or 
        sikkhamana.´ This bowl can be made allowable again. If he returns it to 
        where he bought it, takes back his money, and gives back the bowl, then 
        it becomes allowable. If then it is obtained in an allowable way it is 
        allowable to use it.</P>
        <P>If a bhikkhu having accepted money goes to a bowl shop with his 
        kappiya and having seen a bowl he says, `I like this one,´ and that 
        kappiya gives the money and arranges with the shopkeeper to buy the 
        bowl. Then even though that bowl was obtained by allowable speech it is 
        still unallowable because of the original acceptance of the money. It is 
        no different from the second example. Why are they unallowable for other 
        bhikkhus also? It is because the original money was not forfeited (in 
        accordance with Vinaya in the midst of the sangha).</P>
        <P>If a bhikkhu has not accepted the money and a kappiya is sent having 
        been instructed saying, `Having bought a bowl give it to the Thera.´ 
        Then if the kappiya and bhikkhu go together to the bowl shop and having 
        seen a bowl the bhikkhu says, `Take this money and give me this,´ and 
        thus having caused the money to be given he takes the bowl. Then that 
        bowl is unallowable only for that bhikkhu because he arranged the 
        purchase in the wrong way. It is allowable to other bhikkhus because the 
        original money was not accepted.</P>
        <P>Mahasuma Thera´s preceptor was called Anuruddha Thera and he having 
        such a bowl, filled it with ghee and gave it away to the sangha. 
        Tipitaka Culanaga Thera´s disciple also had such a bowl, and so the 
        Thera caused it to be filled with ghee and given away to the sangha. 
        These are the four unallowable bowls.</P>
        <P>If a bhikkhu has not accepted the money and a kappiya is sent having 
        been instructed saying, `Having bought a bowl give it to the Thera,´ 
        then if the kappiya and the bhikkhu go together to the bowl-shop and 
        having seen a bowl the bhikkhu says, `I like this one,´ or `I will take 
        this one,´ and the kappiya gives the money and arranges the purchase 
        with the shopkeeper then that bowl is completely allowable and even the 
        Buddha would use it.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#000080">
      <P>Part 4. Forfeiture And Confession</P>
      </FONT></B>
      <P>If a bhikkhu has accepted gold, silver, or money then, according to the 
      rules of Vinaya, he must forfeit those unallowable things in the midst of 
      a sangha of bhikkhus first, and then confess that offense. If he has 
      bought anything with that gold, silver, or money then those articles that 
      have been bought must also be forfeited and then the offense is confessed. 
      If at the time of forfeiture a layperson is present then it is allowable 
      to explain to him what has happened. If that layman takes that money and 
      asks, `What should I get with this?´ Then he can be told, `Such and such 
      is allowable (ghee, butter, etc.) He cannot be told, `Buy such and such.´ 
      Then if that layperson buys something and offers it to the sangha then all 
      the bhikkhus, except the one who accepted that money, can make use of it. 
      If there is no layperson present then the sangha can appoint a bhikkhu to 
      take the money and throw it away.</P>
      <P>The Buddha has shown no method by which a bhikkhu who has accepted 
      money or bought things with it can derive benefit. But if the money is 
      forfeited in accordance with Vinaya rules then the rest of the sangha may 
      derive benefit. If the articles and money are not forfeited then no 
      bhikkhu or samanera may use those things.</P>
      <P>If a bhikkhu does not forfeit or throw away the money or things bought 
      with it then no matter how many times he confesses he is said to still 
      have that offense. Then if he listens to the recitation of the Patimokkha 
      or declares his purity then he will also commit an offense of conscious 
      lying. The Patimokkha states:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>`Whatever bhikkhu who being questioned up to three times knowing that 
        he has committed an offense and yet does not reveal it is one who has 
        told a conscious lie. Venerable Sirs, consciously lying has been 
        declared to be an obstacle to attainment by the Blessed One.´</P>

      <P>Part 5. Modern Methods</P>
      </FONT></B>
      <P>There are many methods that monks use at present to accumulate and use 
      large funds of money. If you are a monk you will come across different 
      ways in different monasteries. Most of these methods do not follow the 
      procedures laid down in the texts. It is best to avoid these practices 
      which are questionable and doubtful and practise according to the 
      procedures given in the texts.</P>
      <P>For example the texts do not instruct a monk to teach a person at the 
      time they try to offer money how to offer allowable requisites. The texts 
      instruct that if the money is brought with the impure intention of giving 
      it to the monk then the monk cannot point out a kappiya. (See earlier 
      part.) There is no way to make the offering of money allowable. Money can 
      never belong to a monk. He can never say what to do with money in a fund 
      for requisites, but can only ask for requisites. These points are subtle 
      and most monks do not understand them either through lack of study, 
      tradition, or the subtle influence of desire for a fund.</P>
      <P>Then how can a monk who does not accept money obtain allowable 
      requisites? There are several ways allowed by the Buddha to obtain 
      requisites. The easiest way is to ask from someone who is a relative or 
      who has given an invitation to ask for requisites. Normally a bhikkhu 
      cannot ask for requisites from someone who has not given invitation and is 
      not a relative. To do so is wrong livelihood. However if a bhikkhu is ill 
      he can ask for medicine or food from anyone. Also if his robes or bowl 
      have been stolen, or destroyed he can ask from anyone (see Nissaggiya 
      Pacittiya 6 &amp; 21). A bhikkhu can also ask for labour, or borrow tools. He 
      can ask for someone to bring water from a public source such as a river or 
      dam, but he cannot ask for privately owned water to drink from a person´s 
      house. A monk can also take wood, stones, or building materials from 
      unclaimed wilderness where this is permitted by law.</P>
      <P>Before his ordination as a novice or monk, a man can arrange a fund of 
      money to supply requisites for when he becomes a monk or novice. Such a 
      fund can be left with a relative or friend and they should be instructed 
      to offer requisites to him after he has been ordained. The newly ordained 
      monk or novice can ask for requisites from the person holding the fund if 
      he is a blood relative, but the monk or novice needs to be given an 
      invitation first before he can ask from a friend. This should be explained 
      to the friend before ordination.</P>
      <P>When a man has been ordained, if he still has money in the bank from 
      the time when he was a layman, then he cannot undertake any arrangement of 
      that money for his own benefit. He can leave that money in the bank until 
      he disrobes and not use it while he is ordained. Alternatively, he can 
      give that money away to his parents, relatives, or friends to use, but it 
      cannot be given to any monk, novice, or monastery.</P>
      <P>The acceptance and use of a pension while one is ordained is also 
      unallowable. People who wish to retire into the Sangha should make 
      suitable arrangements concerning their pension before taking robes. </P>

      <P>Conclusion</P>
      </FONT>
      <P><I>The rules concerning money are complex to explain but not difficult 
      to practise; all a bhikkhu needs to do is to refuse to accept money. </I>
      </B>For those who do keep the rules sincerely they will gain a deeper 
      understanding of Dhamma. They will be able to realize the fruits of the 
      Vinaya which are not found within the letter of the rules, but within the 
      hearts of those who practise it.</P>
