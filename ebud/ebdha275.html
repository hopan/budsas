      years ago, when Ajaan Suwat was teaching a retreat at IMS, I was his 
      interpreter. After the second or third day of the retreat he turned to me 
      and said, &quot;I notice that when these people meditate they’re awfully grim.&quot; 
      You’d look out across the room and all the people were sitting there very 
      seriously, their faces tense, their eyes closed tight. It was almost as if 
      they had Nirvana or Bust written across their foreheads.</FONT><P>
      <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">He attributed their grimness to the fact that 
      most people here in the West come to Buddhist meditation without any 
      preparation in other Buddhist teachings. They haven’t had any experience 
      in being generous in line with the Buddha’s teachings on giving. They 
      haven’t had any experience in developing virtue in line with the Buddhist 
      precepts. They come to the Buddha’s teachings without having tested them 
      in daily life, so they don’t have the sense of confidence they need to get 
      them through the hard parts of the meditation. They feel they have to rely 
      on sheer determination instead.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If you look at the way meditation, virtue, 
      and generosity are taught here, it’s the exact opposite of the order in 
      which they’re taught in Asia. Here, people sign up for a retreat to learn 
      some meditation, and only when they show up at the retreat center do they 
      learn they’re going to have to observe some precepts during the retreat. 
      And then at the very end of the retreat they learn that before they’ll be 
      allowed to go home they’re going to have to be generous. It’s all 
      backwards.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Over in Thailand, children’s first 
      exposure to Buddhism, after they’ve learned the gesture of respect, is in 
      giving. You see parents taking their children by the hand as a monk comes 
      past on his alms round, lifting them up, and helping them put a spoonful 
      of rice into the monk’s bowl. Over time, as the children start doing it 
      themselves, the process becomes less and less mechanical, and after a 
      while they begin to take pleasure in giving.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">At first this pleasure may seem 
      counterintuitive. The idea that you gain happiness by giving things away 
      doesn’t come automatically to a young child’s mind. But with practice you 
      find that it’s true. After all, when you give, you put yourself in a 
      position of wealth. The gift is proof that you have more than enough. At 
      the same time it gives you a sense of your worth as a person. You’re able 
      to help other people. The act of giving also creates a sense of 
      spaciousness in the mind, because the world we live in is created by our 
      actions, and the act of giving creates a spacious world: a world where 
      generosity is an operating principle, a world where people have more than 
      enough, enough to share. And it creates a good feeling in the mind.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">From there, the children are exposed to 
      virtue: the practice of the precepts. And again, from a child’s point of 
      view it’s counterintuitive that you’re going to be happy by not doing 
      certain things you want to do—as when you want to take something, or when 
      you want to lie to cover up your embarrassment or to protect yourself from 
      criticism and punishment. But over time you begin to discover that, yes, 
      there is a sense of happiness, there is a sense of wellbeing that comes 
      from being principled, from not having to cover up for any lies, from 
      avoiding unskillful actions, from having a sense that unskillful actions 
      are beneath you.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So by the time you come to meditation 
      through the route of giving and being virtuous, you’ve already had 
      experience in learning that there are counterintuitive forms of happiness 
      in the world. When you’ve been trained through exposure to the Buddha’s 
      teachings, you’ve learned the deeper happiness that comes from giving, the 
      deeper happiness that comes from restraining yourself from unskillful 
      actions, no matter how much you might want to do them. By the time you 
      come to the meditation you’ve developed a certain sense of confidence that 
      so far the Buddha has been right, so you give him the benefit of the doubt 
      on meditation.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This confidence is what allows you to 
      overcome a lot of the initial difficulties: the distractions, the pain. At 
      the same time, the spaciousness that comes from generosity gives you the 
      right mindset for the concentration practice, gives you the right mindset 
      for insight practice—because when you sit down and focus on the breath, 
      what kind of mind do you have? The mind you’ve been creating through your 
      generous and virtuous actions. A spacious mind, not the narrow mind of a 
      person who doesn’t have enough. It’s the spacious mind of a person who has 
      more than enough to share, the mind of a person who has no regrets or 
      denial over past actions. In short, it’s the mind of a person who realizes 
      that true happiness doesn’t see a sharp dichotomy between your own 
      wellbeing and the wellbeing of others.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The whole idea that happiness has to 
      consist either in doing things only for your own selfish motives or for 
      other people to the sacrifice of yourself—the dichotomy between the two—is 
      something very Western, but it’s antithetical to the Buddha’s teachings. 
      According to the Buddha’s teachings, true happiness is something that, by 
      its nature, gets spread around. By working for your own true benefit, 
      you’re working for the benefit of others. And by working for the benefit 
      of others, you’re working for your own. In the act of giving to others you 
      gain rewards. In the act of holding fast to the precepts, holding fast to 
      your principles, protecting others from your unskillful behavior, you gain 
      as well. You gain in mindfulness; you gain in your own sense of worth as a 
      person, your own self-esteem. You protect yourself.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So you come to the meditation ready to 
      apply the same principles to training in tranquility and insight. You 
      realize that the meditation is not a selfish project. You’re sitting here 
      trying to understand your greed, anger, and delusion, trying to bring them 
      under control—which means that you’re not the only person who’s going to 
      benefit from the meditation. Other people will benefit—are benefiting—as 
      well. As you become more mindful, more alert, more skillful in 
      undercutting the hindrances in your mind, other people are less subject to 
      those hindrances as well. Less greed, anger, and delusion come out in your 
      actions, and so the people around you suffer less. Your meditating is a 
      gift to them.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The quality of generosity, what they call 
      caga in Pali, is included in many sets of Dhamma teachings. One is the set 
      of practices leading to a fortunate rebirth. This doesn’t apply only to 
      the rebirth that comes after death, but also to the states of being, the 
      states of mind you create for yourself moment to moment, that you move 
      into with each moment. You create the world in which you live through your 
      actions. By being generous—not only with material things but also with 
      your time, your energy, your forgiveness, your willingness to be fair and 
      just with other people—you create a good world in which to live. If your 
      habits tend more toward being stingy, they create a very confining world, 
      because there’s never enough. There’s always a lack of this, or a lack of 
      that, or a fear that something is going to slip away or get taken away 
      from you. So it’s a narrow, fearful world you create when you’re not 
      generous, as opposed to the confident and wide-open world you create 
      through acts of generosity.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Generosity also counts as one of the forms 
      of Noble Wealth, because what is wealth aside from a sense of having more 
      than enough? Many people who are materially poor are, in terms of their 
      attitude, very wealthy. And many people with a lot of material wealth are 
      extremely poor. The ones who never have enough: They’re the ones who 
      always need more security, always need more to stash away. Those are the 
      people who have to build walls around their houses, who have to live in 
      gated communities for fear that other people will take away what they’ve 
      got. That’s a very poor kind of life, a confined kind of life. But as you 
      practice generosity, you realize that you can get by on less, and that 
      there’s a pleasure that comes with giving to people. Right there is a 
      sense of wealth. You have more than enough.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">At the same time you break down barriers. 
      Monetary transactions create barriers. Somebody hands you something, you 
      have to hand them money back, so there’s a barrier right there. Otherwise, 
      if you didn’t pay, the object wouldn’t come to you over the barrier. But 
      if something is freely given, it breaks down a barrier. You become part of 
      that person’s extended family. In Thailand the terms of address that monks 
      use with their lay supporters are the same they use with relatives. The 
      gift of support creates a sense of relatedness. The monastery where I 
      stayed—and this includes the lay supporters as well as the monks—was like 
      a large extended family. This is true of many of the monasteries in 
      Thailand. There’s a sense of relatedness, a lack of boundary.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We hear so much talk on 
      &quot;interconnectedness.&quot; Many times it’s explained in terms of the teaching 
      on dependent co-arising, which is really an inappropriate use of the 
      teaching. Dependent co-arising teaches the connectedness of ignorance to 
      suffering, the connectedness of craving to suffering. That’s a 
      connectedness within the mind, and it’s a connectedness that we need to 
      cut, because it keeps suffering going on and on and on, over and over 
      again, in many, many cycles. But there’s another kind of connectedness, an 
      intentional connectedness, that comes through our actions. These are kamma 
      connections. Now, we in the West often have problems with the teachings on 
      kamma, which may be why we want the teachings on connectedness without the 
      kamma. So we go looking elsewhere in the Buddha’s teachings to find a 
      rationale or a basis for a teaching on connectedness, but the real basis 
      for a sense of connectedness comes through kamma. When you interact with 
      another person, a connection is made.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Now, it can be a positive or a negative 
      connection, depending on the intention. With generosity you create a 
      positive connection, a helpful connection, a connection where you’re glad 
      that the boundary is down, a connection where good things can flow back 
      and forth. If it’s unskillful kamma, you’re creating a connection, you’re 
      creating an opening that sooner or later you’re going to regret. There’s a 
      saying in the Dhammapada that a hand without a wound can hold poison and 
      not be harmed. In other words, if you don’t have any bad kamma, the 
      results of bad kamma won’t come to you. But if you have a wound on your 
      hand, then if you hold poison it will seep through the wound and kill you. 
      Unskillful kamma is just that, a wound. It’s an opening for poisonous 
      things to come in.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The opposite principle also works. If 
      there’s a connection of skillful behavior, a good connection is formed. 
      This sort of positive connection starts with generosity, and grows with 
      the gift of virtue. As the Buddha said, when you hold to your precepts no 
      matter what, with no exceptions, it’s a gift of security to all beings. 
      You give unlimited security to everyone, and so you have a share in that 
      unlimited security as well. With the gift of meditation, you protect other 
      people from the effects of your greed, anger, and delusion. And you get 
      protected as well.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So this is what generosity does: It makes 
      your mind more spacious and creates good connections with the people 
      around you. It dissolves the boundaries that otherwise would keep the 
      happiness from spreading around.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When you come to the meditation with that 
      state of mind, it totally changes the way you approach meditating. So many 
      people come to meditation with the question, &quot;What am I going to get out 
      of this time I spend meditating?&quot; Particularly in the modern world, time 
      is something we’re very poor in. So the question of getting, getting, 
      getting out of the mediation is always there in the background. We’re 
      advised to erase this idea of getting, yet you can’t erase it if you’ve 
      been cultivating it as a habitual part of your mind. But if you come to 
      the meditation with experience in being generous, the question becomes 
      &quot;What do I give to the meditation?&quot; You give it your full attention. You 
      give it the effort, you’re happy to put in the effort, because you’ve 
      learned from experience that good effort put into the practice of the 
      Dhamma brings good results. And so that internal poverty of &quot;What am I 
      getting out of this meditation?&quot; gets erased. You come to the meditation 
      with a sense of wealth: &quot;What can I give to this practice?&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">You find, of course, that you end up 
      getting a lot more if you start with the attitude of giving. The mind is 
      more up for challenges: &quot;How about if I give it more time? How about 
      meditating later into the night than I usually do? How about getting up 
      earlier in the morning? How about giving more constant attention to what 
      I’m doing? How about sitting longer through pain?&quot; The meditation then 
      becomes a process of giving, and of course you still get the results. When 
      you’re not so grudging of your efforts or time, you place fewer and fewer 
      limitations on the process of meditation. That way the results are sure to 
      be less grudging, more unlimited, as well. So it’s important that we 
      develop the Noble Wealth of generosity to bring to our meditation.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The texts mention that when you get 
      discouraged in your meditation, when the meditation gets dry, you should 
      look back on past generosity. This gives you a sense of self-esteem, a 
      sense of encouragement. Of course, what generosity are you going to look 
      back on if there is none? This is why it’s important that you approach the 
      meditation having practiced generosity very consciously.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Many times we ask, &quot;How do I take the 
      meditation back into the world?&quot; But it’s also important that you bring 
      good qualities of the world into your meditation, good qualities of your 
      day-to-day life, and that you develop them regularly. Thinking back on 
      past acts of generosity gets dry after a while if there’s only been one 
      act of generosity that happened a long time ago. You need fresh generosity 
      to give you encouragement.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So this is why, when the Buddha talked 
      about the forms of merit, he said, &quot;Don’t be afraid of merit, for merit is 
      another word for happiness.&quot; The first of the three main forms of merit is 
      dana, giving, which is the expression of generosity. The gift of being 
      virtuous builds on the simple act of giving, and the gift of meditation 
      builds on both.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Of course, a large part of the meditation 
      is letting go: letting go of distractions, letting go of unskillful 
      thoughts. If you’re used to letting go of material things, it comes a lot 
      easier to begin experimenting with letting go of unskillful mental 
      attitudes—things that you’ve held on to for so long that you think you 
      need them, but when you really look at them you find you don’t. In fact, 
      you see that they’re an unnecessary burden that causes suffering. When you 
      see the suffering, and the fact that it’s needless, you can let go. In 
      this way, the momentum of giving carries all the way through the practice, 
      and you realize that it’s not depriving you of anything. It’s more like a 
      trade. You give away a material object and you gain in generous qualities 
      of mind. You give away your defilements, and you gain freedom.</FONT></P>
