<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he traditional method of Buddhist
  dialogue is a hierarchical model. The Buddhist teacher, almost always male, provided the
  information. The students job, like a good plant, was to absorb nourishment and provide
  energy toward growth. Seldom did the teacher address questions from students or request
  the student's impression of a particular text or concept. Buddhism in the Information Age
  has transformed this model. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The concept of &quot;Buddhism&quot; itself was the first
  step in this transformation. The notion of a unified religious whole does not exist within
  the Buddhist tradition, but has instead been created by scholars for the purpose of
  dialogue and study. This semantic construct is partly responsible for the information
  decentralization of the buddhadharma. Authority has changed hands. No longer is the
  Buddhist teacher recognized as the only authority. Scholars, writers and lay practitioners
  are reshaping Buddhism into Western forms, either expanding it or degrading it, depending
  on your opinion of their work. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Knowledge is decentralized, and for better or worse,
  everyone has gotten into the role of information provider. The new conduit for this
  knowledge, the supplement or replacement for the endangered species known as print media,
  is the online realm. The biggest strength and weakness of print media is focus. One
  watches television, listens to the radio, or reads a magazine or book not simply for
  information, but for a perspective on information. We choose our newspapers, stations and
  authors based on what we want to hear, what filter we wish to employ to focus our
  information. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The new medium, the online realm, detests filters. Every
  user is their own filter, everyone decides what is important and what is not, and they
  spend countless hours letting you know of their decisions. 12,000 Usenet newsgroups exist
  on every imaginable topic. An unknown number of private discussion groups, or lists, now
  populate the net for those who want to focus their discussions even narrower. Even more
  startling is that these groups are growing at an astounding rate. The idea of reading
  everything that happens online is impossible. In fact, the bandwidth has increased to such
  an extent in the last year, that unless you have a special high-speed telephone line from
  the phone company, it is physically impossible to transfer all that information onto your
  computer within a twenty-four hour period. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The problem with this tremendous growth in bandwidth is
  signal degradation. Rather than surf through information, the current verb describing the
  act of reading Buddhist online forums is slog. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The difficulty is a marked decrease in quality, an
  increase in the signal to noise ratio (expressed as mindless chatter) and an ego driven
  pettiness and one-upmanship that demonstrates a genuine lack of compassion and
  understanding. Some say the solution to the bandwidth problem is intelligent agents, sent
  out to gather information on predetermined topics to be presented to you like a newspaper.
  However, this ignores the true interactive nature of online information. We are not just
  users anymore, but are in fact true participants. We not only read the news, we create the
  news. Instead of adding another filtering mechanism to our information, the answer to the
  bandwidth dilemma is to instead find new ways to increase signal strength. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Fortunately, over the last few years I have discovered
  five ways the average online user can improve discussion in Buddhist forums. By using
  these techniques, you can avoid conflict, act with genuine compassion and make your online
  experience rewarding. </font></p>
  <p><font COLOR="#800080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>1. Keep Discussions of Practice
  and Belief in the Abstract</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is something that every graduate student learns and a
  vital practice for Buddhist practitioners. Avoid talking about what you do or what you
  believe in public settings. It's generally considered inappropriate and can lead to
  personal attacks and criticisms. There is a world of difference between the statement:
  &quot;My understanding of Ch�d practice is that consciousness is ejected from the top of
  the head&quot; and &quot;When I do Ch�d practice, I visualize my consciousness leaving my
  body.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first example allows you to discuss the finer points
  of the practice (when appropriate), compare notes with other practitioners, and share your
  understanding with those who can help you or those you can help. The second example, the
  personal post, is problematic. First, you might be seen as bragging about your practice,
  which not only is against Buddhist teachings but it impedes conversation. Second, you may
  actually be bragging and not be aware of it -- see Chogyam Trungpa's book Cutting Through
  Spiritual Materialism for examples of unconscious egotism masquerading as spiritual
  practice. Third, if someone disagrees with your position or practice, you may take it
  personally and not get the full value of their criticism, or worse they may become
  reluctant to comment on your post for fear of insulting you. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Attempts at distancing yourself from your posts do not
  need to be cold and sterile. Look at examples on the net and see which model you feel more
  comfortable with. Do the personal posts put you at ease or make you reluctant to respond? </font></p>
  <p><font COLOR="#800080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>2. Evaluate the Message Before
  Posting</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Before posting a message, ask yourself a couple of
  important questions. First, does this post require a response? Second, what kind of
  response is the writer expecting from this post? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If everyone were to ask these two questions before posting
  a message, the quality of online discussion would increase, and some newsgroups, like
  alt.zen would cease to exist! </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many posts, when you think about it, don't require a
  response. Occasionally, you may be tempted to make a &quot;<em><strong>me too</strong></em>&quot;
  response to a post, what I call the America Online Syndrome. A message may look something
  like this: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>I think the Dalai Lama is one of the foremost living
    examples of embodied compassion. I only wish some of our Western Buddhist teachers would
    use him as an example.</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">RESPONSE: <b>-- Yeah, me too! </b></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Other messages are clearly an attempt to illicit a
  negative response. In the Usenet forums, this is known as <em><strong>&quot;drive-by
  flaming</strong></em>&quot;. An individual, intent on creating anarchy, may post a message
  denouncing abortion to a variety of newsgroups, including the pro-life, pro-choice, Rush
  Limbaugh and related groups in an attempt to create controversy. All responses to the
  message are then re-posted to every other conference. You can sometimes tell by the
  message header that the message was posted to a large number of groups. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Drive-by flaming also occurs in Buddhist discussion
  groups, in which individuals make absurd claims or ask insulting questions about Buddhist
  teachings and Buddhist culture. Some of these people are undergraduates with too much time
  on their hands and a warped sense of humor. Others may have more of an evil intent. See
  last issues article by Oliver Seeler entitled Do Chinese Spies Attack Buddhists on the
  Net? The solution to this problem, as you may have guessed, is not to publicly flame the
  poster. If you do, you not only play into their hands, but you create another layer of
  sludge in the forum that everyone else must traverse (karma). This kind of situation is
  where real Buddhist practice plays a role. Instead of attacking the offender, ignore the
  post. Ignoring the post is the exact opposite response desired by the poster. Eventually,
  these immature folks will get bored and find something more gratifying, like watching
  BayWatch on TV or play on the Penthouse Web site. </font></p>
  <p><font COLOR="#800080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>3. Act with Compassion</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once you've decided to post, attempt to evaluate the most
  compassionate response. It seems like a simple thing to do. We try to do it in real life,
  but there's something in the electronic medium that can dehumanize the situation.
  Remember, just because a message is posted in public, it doesn't mean that it needs a
  public response, or even an answer at all. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Try to use real world criteria for answering messages.
  Even if someone asks a terribly personal question about their practice in a public forum,
  there is no reason why you need to give a terribly personal response in the same fashion.
  Use private E-mail. By keeping your response private, you have a much better chance of
  keeping things civil and actually reaching the individual without a knee-jerk feeling of
  personal attack on their part or ego involvement on your part. You also avoid personal
  attacks against you from people who don't agree with your approach. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Don't feel like your response has to have a solution
  within the electronic medium. Don't hesitate to direct someone to counseling, a
  suicide-support line (or discussion group!), a Buddhist center if their solo spiritual
  practice is running into trouble, or the bookstore. As you may have noticed off-line, some
  people just want to vent their feelings, without actually looking for solutions. Also
  remember that forum moderators are just that, moderators. They are not spiritual teachers,
  counselors, confidantes, or your mother. </font></p>
  <p><font COLOR="#800080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>4. Avoid UsingTricky Acronyms,
  Emoticons and False Language</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The old-world Internet (what we had a few years ago) used
  its own lingo for communication. It included acronyms like IMNHO (In My Not So Humble
  Opinion), RTFM (Read the f***ing Manual), and ROFL (Rolling on the Floor Laughing). As a
  larger cross section of society moves online, these abstract conventions only serve to
  hinder communications. Avoid them. Use language in a creative manner that expresses how
  you really think and feel, rather than using trite phrases. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Also to be avoided are tricky emoticons, or keyboard
  symbols that vaguely appear as smiley faces :) winks ;) or unhappy black-eyed net users
  with their tongues sticking out. *(- </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Finally, the last problem is false language. You'll see a
  variety of Buddhists on the net ending their messages with Gassho, Tashi Delek, Namaste,
  or other formal greetings of peace and happiness. It seems natural to want to express as
  much good will as possible. However, the online medium resembles a conversation more than
  a letter. Avoid using these formal terms unless you could imagine yourself saying such a
  phrase in a face-to-face encounter. This not only preserves the value of the phrase but it
  adds sincerity to your post, regardless of whether you use them. </font></p>
  <p><font COLOR="#800080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>5. Follow Guidelines Within Your
  Spiritual Tradition</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dharma is like medicine, and just because you've been
  taught a few cures, it doesn't make you a doctor. Check with your spiritual teacher before
  you take it on yourself to teach or discuss issues of practice and doctrine. Most teachers
  make it very clear who can teach and exactly what that includes. If you are not careful,
  you could not only harm others with teachings they are not prepared for, but you may also
  harm yourself by not being equipped to deal with the results. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Emptiness is a prime example of good medicine becoming
  poison when an incorrect diagnosis is made. Many practitioners on the Internet, especially
  Zen students, talk incessantly about emptiness, or &quot;shunyata&quot;. This creates a
  constant crisis among new practitioners, uninitiated practitioners and non-practitioners
  alike, who have a difficult time grasping this Ph.D. level bit of Buddhadharma. It causes
  suffering; avoid this game. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Again, this is another one of those guidelines that you
  wouldn't think much about in a real-life encounter but for some reason seems to fall away
  in impersonal Internet meetings. Maybe this will change in the future, when we have
  personal avatars that look, feel and sound human, but until then, we have to make common
  sense a priority and remember that the machine is only the medium. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Methods are many; principles are few. It is true that
  general Buddhist principles apply towards any form of communication, but with these five
  guidelines you can reinforce your practice on the Electronic Frontier without becoming a
  hell-raising cybercowboy. </font></p>
