  <b><p><font color="#800080">Section One</font></b></p>
  <p>I heard these words of the Buddha one time when he was staying in the Jeta Grove in the
  town of Sravasti. The Lord addressed the assembly of monks:</p>
  <p>&quot;There is a way to practice which purifies the actions of living beings,
  eradicates all sorrow, anxiety, and the roots of afflictions, and leads to the highest
  understanding and the realization of Nirvana. It is a path which destroys the Five
  Obstacles. It is the path of the Four Ways of Stopping and Concentrating the Mind. Why is
  it called &quot;the one way in&quot;? Because it is the way to the oneness of mind. Why is
  it called a way? Because it is the Noble Eightfold Path, the way of right view, right
  contemplation, right action, right livelihood, right practice, right speech, right
  mindfulness, and right concentration. This explains the expression &quot;the one way
  in.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;What then are the Five Obstacles? They are attachment, aversion, agitation,
  torpor, and doubt. These are the obstacles which need to be removed.</p>
  <p>&quot;What are the Four Ways of Stopping and Concentrating the Mind? The practitioner
  meditates on the inside of the body in the inside of the body to end unwholesome thoughts
  and remove anxiety, and he meditates on the outside of the body in the outside of the body
  to end unwholesome thoughts and remove anxiety. The practitioner meditates on the feelings
  in the feelings from the inside and the feelings in the feelings from the outside in order
  to be at peace and have joy, and he meditates on the feelings in the feelings from both
  inside and outside in order to be at peace and have joy. The practitioner meditates on the
  mind in the mind from the inside, and he meditates on the mind in the mind from the
  outside in order to be at peace and have joy, and he meditates on the mind in the mind
  from both inside and outside in order to be at peace and have joy. The practitioner
  meditates on the objects of mind in the objects of mind from the inside, and he meditates
  on the objects of mind in the objects of mind from the outside in order to be at peace and
  have joy, and he meditates on the objects of mind in the objects of mind from both the
  inside and the outside in order to be at peace and have joy.</p>
  <b><p><font color="#800080">Section Two</font></b></p>
  <p>&quot;How does the practitioner meditate on the body from the inside so as to realize
  peace and joy in himself?</p>
  <p>&quot;In this case, the practitioner meditates on the body as a body and according to
  its functions. When he examines it from head to toes or from toes to head, he sees that it
  is composed of impure constituents, and he is unable to be attached to it. He observes
  that this body has hair of the head and hair of the body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh,
  sinews, bones, marrow, sweat, pus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, heart,
  liver, spleen, kidneys. He observes and recognizes urine, excrement, tears, saliva, blood
  vessels, grease, and observing and knowing them all, he is unattached and regrets nothing,
  This is the way the practitioner observes the body in order to realize peace and joy and
  be able to end unwholesome thoughts and remove anxiety and sorrow.</p>
  <p>&quot;Further the practitioner meditates on this body in order to see the Four Elements
  of earth, water, fire, and air, and he distinguishes these Four Elements. Just like a
  skillful butcher or his apprentice might lay out the different parts of a slaughtered cow
  and distinguish the leg, heart, torso, and head, the practitioner observing his own body
  distinguishes the Four Elements just as clearly, seeing that this is earth, this is water,
  this is fire, and this is air. Thus the practitioner meditates on the body in the body in
  order to end attachment.</p>
  <p>&quot;Further, bhikkhus, one should observe this body as having many openings from
  which many impure substances flow. Just as we look at bamboo or reeds and see the joints
  in the canes, so the practitioner observes the body with many openings from which impure
  substances flow.</p>
  <p>&quot;Further, bhikkhus, the practitioner meditates this corpse being spread out and
  peeked at by vultures, being discovered and gnawed at by all sorts of wild creatures like
  tigers, panthers, and wolves, and then comes back to observing his own body and sees that
  it is no different. 'This very body of mine will not be able to escape that condition.'
  This is how the practitioner meditates on the body to realize peace and joy.</p>
  <p>&quot;Further, bhikkhus, the practitioner visualizes a corpse, which has lain on the
  ground for a year. It is half-eaten, fetid, and impure. Then lie comes back to meditating
  on his own body and sees that his own body is no different. 'This very body of mine will
  not be able to escape that condition.' This is how the practitioner meditates on the body.</p>
  <p>&quot;Further, bhikkhus, the practitioner visualizes the corpse from which the skin and
  flesh has shrivelled away. All that is left are the bones stained with blood. Then he
  comes back to meditating on his own body and sees that his own body is no different. 'This
  very body of mine will not be able to escape that condition.' This is how the practitioner
  meditates on the body.</p>
  <p>&quot;Further, bhikkhus, the practitioner visualizes a skeleton, which is just bones
  held together by some ligaments. Then he comes back to meditating on his own body and sees
  that his own body is no different. 'This very body of mine will not be able to escape that
  condition.' This is how the practitioner meditates on the body.</p>
  <p>&quot;Further, bhikkhus, the practitioner visualizes a corpse which has become a
  collection of scattered bones, all in different places: the hand bone, leg bone, ribs,
  shoulder blades, spinal column, knee cap, and skull. Then he comes back to meditating on
  his own body and sees that his own body is no different. 'This very body of mine will not
  be able to escape that condition.' His body will also decay in that way. This is how the
  practitioner meditates on the body in order to realize peace and joy.</p>
  <p>&quot;Further, bhikkhus, the practitioner visualizes a corpse which has become a
  collection of bones bleached like shells. Then he comes back to meditating on his own body
  and sees that his own body is no different. 'This very body of'mine will not be able to
  escape that condition.' His body will also decay in that way. This is how the practitioner
  meditates on the body. </p>
  <p>&quot;Further, bhikkhus, the practitioner visualizes a corpse which has become a
  collection of yellowing bones, to which there is nothing worth being attached, or bones
  that have become the color of ash and are no longer distinguishable from the earth. Thus
  the practitioner meditates on his own body, abandoning unwholesome thoughts and removing
  sorrow and anxiety, observing, 'This body is impermanent, it is something which
  decomposes.' A practitioner who observes himself like this outside the body and inside the
  body and outside and inside the body together understands that there is nothing which is
  eternal.</p>
  <b><p><font color="#800080">Section Three</font></b></p>
  <p>&quot;How does the practitioner meditate on the feelings in the feelings?</p>
  <p>&quot;When the practitioner has a pleasant feeling, he knows that he has a pleasant
  feeling. When he has a painful feeling, he knows that he has a painful feeling. When his
  feelings are neutral, he knows that his feelings are neutral. When he has a pleasant,
  painful, or neutral feeling with a material basis, he knows that he has a pleasant,
  painful, or neutral feeling with a material basis. When he has a pleasant, painful, or
  neutral feeling with a non-material basis, he knows he has a pleasant, painful, or neutral
  feeling with a non-material basis. This is how the practitioner meditates on the feelings
  in the feelings by his own insight.</p>
  <p>&quot;Further, bhikkhus, when the practitioner has a pleasant feeling, then there is
  not a painful feeling, and the practitioner knows there is a pleasant feeling. When there
  is a painful feeling, then there is not a pleasant feeling, and the practitioner knows
  that there is a painful feeling. When there is a neutral feeling, then there is neither a
  pleasant feeling nor a painful feeling, and the practitioner is aware that the feeling is
  neither pleasant nor painful. The practitioner is aware of the arising of all dharmas and
  the disappearance of all dharmas in such a way that, by his own insight, he realizes peace
  and joy. As feelings arise, the practitioner recognizes and is aware of them and their
  roots, and he is not dependent on them and does not give rise to feelings of attachment to
  the world. At that time there is no fear, and having no fear, he liberates himself forever
  from illusion and realizes Nirvana. Birth and death are no longer. The holy life has been
  lived. What needs to be done has been done. There will be no more rebirth. He understands
  this directly. This is how the practitioner is aware of the feelings in the feelings to
  end dispersed thinking and remove sorrow and anxiety. Such is the meditation on the inside
  of the feelings and the outside of the feelings.</p>
  <b><p><font color="#800080">Section Four</font></b></p>
  <p>&quot;What is meant by meditating on the mind in the mind in order to realize peace and
  joy?</p>
  <p>&quot;When the practitioner has desire in his mind, he knows that he has desire in his
  mind. When he does not have desire, he knows that he does not have desire. When he has
  hatred in his mind, he knows that he has hatred in his mind. When he does not have hatred,
  he knows that he does not have hatred. When he has confusion in his mind, he knows that he
  has confusion in his mind. When he does not have confusion, he knows that he does not have
  confusion. When he has craving in his mind, he knows that he has craving in his mind. When
  he does not have craving, he knows that he does not have craving. When there is mastery of
  his mind, he knows that there is mastery of his mind. When there is no mastery, he knows
  there is no mastery. When there is dispersion, he knows that there is dispersion. When
  there is no dispersion, he knows that there is no dispersion. When there is inattention,
  he knows that there is inattention. When there is no inattention, he knows that there is
  no inattention. When there is universality, he knows that there is universality. When
  there is no universality, he knows that there is no universality. When there is
  extensiveness, he knows that there is extensiveness. VIhen there is not extensiveness, he
  knows that there is not extensiveness. When there is boundlessness, he knows that there is
  boundlessness. When there is not boundlessness, he knows that there is not boundlessness.
  When there is concentration, he knows that there is concentration. When there is no
  concentration, he knows that there is no concentration. When he has not yet realized
  liberation, he knows that he has not yet realized liberation. When he has realized
  liberation, he knows that he has realized liberation.</p>
  <p>&quot;This is how the practitioner is mindful of the mind in the mind, He observes the
  arising of dharrnas, observes the destruction of dharmas, or observes both the arising and
  destruction of dharmas; being mindful of dharmas in order to realize peace and joy. He is
  able to see, know, and observe what is not observable without becoming dependent on the
  object and without giving rise to worldly thoughts, Because there are no thoughts of
  attachment to the world, there is no fear. Because there is no fear, there is no residue
  of affliction. When there is no residue of affliction, Nirvana arises, and birth and death
  are no more, the holy life is realized, what needs to be done has been done, and there
  will be no more rebirth. All this the practitioner knows to be true. Thus in his own
  person the practitioner observes mind in mind, on the inside and on the outside, in order
  to remove uncontrolled thought and cut off all anxiety.</p>
  <b><p><font color="#800080">Section Five</font></b></p>
  <p>&quot;What is meant by 'meditating on the objects of mind in the objects of mind'?</p>
  <p>&quot;When the practitioner practices the first factor of awakening, mindfulness, it is
  in reliance on the initial application of thought, on no-craving, on destroying the
  unwholesome mind and abandoning the unwholesome dharmas. He practices the factors of
  awakening, investigation of dharmas, energy, joy, concentration, and letting go, in
  reliance on applied thought, in reliance on no-craving, in reliance on destroying the
  unwholesome dharmas. This is how he practices meditating on the objects of mind in the
  objects of mind.</p>
  <p>&quot;Further, bhikkhus, having been liberated from sensual attachment, having
  abandoned unwholesome dharmas, with initial application of thought and sustained thought,
  with joy, he delights to dwell in the first dhyana in order to have joy in his own person.
  This is how the practitioner meditates on the objects of mind in the objects of mind.</p>
  <p>&quot;Further, bhikkhus, with the passing of applied thought and sustained thought, a
  joy arises in his mind which leads to the oneness of mind. When there is no more initial
  application of thought and sustained thought, the practitioner, maintaining joy, enters
  the second dhyana which has peace as well as joy. This is how the practitioner meditates
  on the objects of mind in the objects of mind.</p>
  <p>&quot;Further, bhikkhus, with the passing of thought and the constant practice of
  letting go of applied thought, he enjoys for himself that state which the holy ones long
  for, where mindfulness in letting go is fully purified, and he enters the third dhyana,
  This is how the practitioner meditates on the objects of mind in the objects of mind.</p>
  <p>&quot;Further, bhikkhus, with the absence of joy, when anxiety about joy and elation as
  well as pleasure and pain are no longer, and his mindfulness in letting go is fully
  purified, he enters the fourth dhyana, and that is to meditate on the objects of mind in
  the objects of mind. He meditates on the arising of dharmas and the passing of dharmas in
  order to arrive at peace and joy. He realizes right mindfulness in the present moment. He
  is able to see, know, and abandon dispersion. He is no longer dependent on anything. He
  does not give rise to thoughts of the world. Because he does not have worldly thoughts, he
  is not afraid. When there is no fear, birth and death no longer exist, and the holy life
  has been accomplished, what needs to be done has been done, there is no more rebirth, and
  everything is known in its true nature.</p>
  <b><p><font color="#800080">Section Six</font></b></p>
  <p>&quot;Bhikkhus, relying on this one way of entering the path, living beings are
  purified, freed from sorrow and anxiety, their minds no longer subject to agitation, their
  understanding stable, and they are able to realize Nirvana. This one way in is the
  destruction of the Five Hindrances and practice of the Four Ways of Stopping and
  Concentrating the Mind. The bhikkhus who heard the Buddha teach thus, applied themselves
  joyfully at that time to the practice.</p>
