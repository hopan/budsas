        was requested to give a talk to explain to you the Buddhist Law of
        Kamma, Rebirth and the Buddha's Teaching of Suffering. All these
        teachings are interesting not only for Buddhists but for non-Buddhists
        as well. Now, I am a Theravada Buddhist monk and so when I talk about
        Theravada Buddhism, I prefer to use Pali words to Sanskrit words that
        are more popular with the Western people. It is because Pali is the
        language in which the original teachings of the Buddha were preserved
        and recorded. Therefore, it has become the sacred language of the
        Theravada Buddhists.</font>
        <p><b><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">Kamma</font></b></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">The word kamma --- k-a-m-m-a
        --- is a Pali word. It is the same word as k-a-r-m-a in Sanskrit. By the
        way, since it is a Sanskrit word, you have to pronounce the 'r' in this
        word distinctly as you do in Spanish, and not as you normally do in the
        U.S.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">Now, what is kamma? The
        literal meaning of the word kamma is &quot;something that is done&quot;
        or a &quot;deed&quot;. It also means a mental state that is instrumental
        in doing the deed, good or bad, wholesome or unwholesome. So,
        technically, kamma means the mental state which arises in the mind when
        people do some deed. Whenever there is a deed good or bad, there arises
        in the mind this mental state, and this mental state organizes the other
        associated mental states and also engages itself to the object. So, that
        mental state is like a chief pupil in a class who studies himself and
        also encourages other pupils to study. In the same way that mental state
        acts upon the object itself and also encourages or organizes the other
        mental states arising together with it to&nbsp; act on the object. That
        mental state is called &quot;cetana&quot; in Pali, and it is translated
        as &quot;volition&quot;. So what we call kamma is not actually the deed,
        good or bad, but that mental state that accompanies or that arises in
        the mind of a person who does the good or bad, or wholesome or
        unwholesome deed.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">And as a mental state, it
        arises and disappears immediately, because according to the teachings of
        the Buddha, whether it is a mental state or a material state, it arises
        and immediately it disappears. But unlike other mental states, when it
        disappears it leaves some potential to give results in the mental
        continuum of beings. Although we cannot say or we cannot know where this
        potential is stored, but when conditions are favorable for that kamma to
        give results, the results are produced. Let's take an example of a mango
        tree that bears fruits. Before the fruits are on the tree, we cannot say
        where the fruits are stored, whether in the rots, or in the trunk, or in
        the branches, or in the leaves. But when the conditions come together --
        like sunshine, moisture and water -- the fruits are produced. In the
        same way the kamma which has the potential to give results gives results
        when the conditions are favorable for it. That is what we call kamma.
        And this kamma as you know can be good or bad, or can be wholesome or
        unwholesome. Since it is a natural law that kamma gives results, it
        follows that when kamma is good, then it will produce good or happy
        results, and when the kamma is bad or unwholesome, it will produce bad
        or painful results. This is what we call the Law of Kamma; that there is
        what we call kamma (or volition) and this kamma gives results in the
        future. So we Buddhists all believe in this Law of Kamma.</font></p>
        <p><b><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">Discovery of the Law of
        Kamma</font></b></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">And this Law of Kamma was
        discovered by the Buddha himself without a teacher. On the night before
        He became the Buddha, the Bodhisatta sat down under the Bodhi tree and
        practiced meditation for the whole night. During the middle watch of the
        night -- in modern terms, between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. -- Buddha attained
        the supernormal knowledge by which He was able to see beings dying from
        existence and being born in the next existence. He also saw that a being
        died from one existence and was reborn in a miserable existence because
        he, the being, did bad kamma in the past, and another being dies from
        one existence and was reborn in a blissful state as a human being or a
        celestial being because he did wholesome kamma in the past.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">So during that time or during
        that watch of the night, Buddha discovered the Law of Kamma. Therefore
        Buddha's teaching of the Law of Kamma was not borrowed from any other
        teaching, but it came from His own intuitive knowledge or superwisdom.
        It is also said (in our books) that only the Buddha could understand
        everything about kamma; it is not in the province of even the best of
        His disciples to understand kamma in all its entirety. So if we do not
        know everything about kamma, we should not be disappointed because it is
        not in our own province to know everything about it.</font></p>
        <p><b><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">Different kinds of kamma</font></b></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">There are different kinds of
        kamma. There is kamma which gives results in this very life, there is
        another kind of kamma which gives results in the next future life, and
        there is yet another kamma which gives results from the third life
        indefinitely until one gets out of the rounds of rebirths. The three
        kinds of kamma become defunct when they do not get the opportunity to
        give results in their allotted periods of time. So kamma gives results
        not only in future lies, but it can give results in this very life also.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">There are some people who said
        that they got results of the kamma in this very life. There is a Myanmar
        lady in Florida whose daughter was married to an American, a
        neurosurgeon. On her one birthday, her son-in-law gave her a Mercedes as
        a birthday present. She was surprised because on her own she could never
        hope to own a Mercedes. She told me that she got that Mercedes as a
        present because she did something or she had been doing something good
        in her life. And that was that she was providing transportation to an
        elderly couple who could not drive. She took them once a week to grocery
        stores and helped them in their shopping, and then took them back to
        their home. She donated transportation to the couple for man years and
        she believed that as a result of the good kamma she did in this life,
        she got the result also in this life. And I hope you can think of the
        negative or bad kamma giving bad results in this life.</font></p>
        <p><b><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">Understanding of the Law of
        Kamma</font></b></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">This understanding of the Law
        of Kamma taught us self-reliance and self-responsibility, because we
        enjoy or suffer as a result of what kamma we did in the past. So
        whatever you enjoy in this life is actually the result of good kamma you
        did in the past. And whatever you suffer here is also the result of bad
        kamma you did in the past. So we are not to blame anybody else for our
        suffering or failure in this life. If you want to blame at all, we can
        blame our own kamma.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">So kamma is one that produces
        results, and since it is we who do the kamma, we are the ones who cause
        the results to be produced. Therefore, we are the masters of our own
        future. We can shape our future lives. In this respect, I think, we are
        free and do not have to rely on any other person for our good future,
        because we alone can create our future, either good or bad.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">When we understand that we
        alone are responsible for our own suffering or happiness, we know we can
        shape our future so that we get happiness only and not suffering. If we
        do not want bad or painful results, we just need to avoid which will
        give painful results. That means the knowledge of the Law of Kamma will
        teach us to abstain from doing what is bad, what is painful to oneself,
        and what is harmful to others. Thus we can improve our lives here and
        also we can shape our lives in the future because we know or understand
        the Law of Kamma.</font></p>
        <p><b><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">Rebirth</font></b></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">Now kamma gives results.
        Whenever there is kamma, there will be results. We cannot get away from
        the consequences of the kamma we did in the past unless we become
        Buddhas or Arahants. So when a person is reborn in another life, that
        rebirth is the result of kamma he did in the past -- in the immediate
        past life, or in the lives before the past.&nbsp; So when a person is
        said to be reborn, he is reborn as a result of the kamma he did in the
        past.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">According to the teachings of
        Theravada Buddhism, rebirth immediately follows death. There is no time
        gap between death in one life and rebirth in the next life. A person may
        be reborn in a place thousands of miles away, and there are reports of
        people who had died in England and were reborn in Australia. Although
        the distance may be great -- thousands and thousands of miles -- there
        is no time interval between death in one life and rebirth in the next
        life. So according to Abhidhamma, rebirth immediately follows death, but
        we must understand that rebirth in the next life is not the result of
        the death in the previous life. Rebirth in the next life is the result
        of kamma in the past. Quite often people misunderstand this fact. They
        think that rebirth is produced by death. We can say that rebirth is
        conditioned by death also when we mean that death consciousness
        disappears so that rebirth consciousness can arise. (This is called
        Proximity Condition in Patthana, the seventh book of Abdhidhamma.)</font></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">Death is just one moment in
        life, the last moment. Before that last moment the dying man's mind is
        occupied with some kinds of objects presented to his mind by kamma, and
        the quality of these objects play an important, or rather decisive, role
        in conditioning the rebirth. Therefore, kamma in the past life --
        immediate past life or the lives before the past -- conditions or
        produces rebirth in the next immediate life.</font></p>
        <p><b><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">Moments</font></b></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">Actually, disappearing of one
        moment and arising of another moment go on even when we are living.
        According to the teachings of the Buddha, we are being reborn and dying
        at every moment of our lives. When I talk I say words and you hear the
        words. And words disappear very quickly and your listening to the words
        also comes and goes very quickly. So at every moment there is a new pair
        of mind and matter arising and then disappearing immediately. In the
        next moment there is a new pair of mind and matter arising and then
        disappearing. It goes on and on like that even when we are living. So if
        you can understand that even in our lives one moment of mind and matter
        follows another moment of mind and matter without any interruption or
        any time-gap between the two, we can understand this life and the next
        life.</font></p>
        <p><b><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">This and next life</font></b></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">Actually, this life and the
        next life are different only by one moment. At the moment of death, we
        call this life. At the next moment which comes immediately, we call it
        the new life or next life. That is, because we use the terms
        conventionally. So actually the death in one life and rebirth in another
        are just the same as one moment following another moment during
        life-time. Now, one second after twelve midnight of the 31st of
        December, we call it a new day, a new month, a new year. But in fact
        there is just one second's difference between the old year and the new
        year. And actually we cannot say that the previous moment is the old
        year and the next moment is the new year. But we agree to call it the
        old year, and the next one, the new year, and then we say we are in the
        new year, but actually we are only one second away from midnight.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">In the same way, when beings
        are reborn after death in one life, they are just one moment after
        death. So the arising and disappearing of mind and matter go on and on
        until one becomes an Arahant or a Buddha and one dies. Until that
        moment, this arising and disappearing of mind and matter will go on and
        on incessantly. And here also, the rebirth is produced by kamma, and so,
        we can do something about kamma in this life so that we are reborn in a
        better existence.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">Now when we talk about
        rebirth, people want to know what it is that is reborn there. This, we
        answer, with the maxim: &quot;Neither he nor another.&quot; The person
        who is said to be reborn in the next life, is neither the same person
        that died in the previous life, nor is he a totally new person, totally
        independent of the being who died in the previous life. So this is the
        maxim we use &quot;Neither he nor another.&quot; At the moment of
        rebirth what happens is: Kamma produces a state of mind and some
        material properties and that we call rebirth. So, mind and matter that
        are produced or that arise at the moment of rebirth are not something
        that is carried over form the previous life.</font></p>
        <p><b><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">Beads example</font></b></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">According to our teachings
        nothing moves from this life to the next life. But as a result of
        something that beings did in the previous life, there are produced the
        results in the future. So they are connected as or related as cause and
        effect. We may think of a rosary or a necklace. There are beads on them
        and these beads are different from one another and they are distinct
        too. But there is a string going through those beads and so we think
        that it is a series of beads, but actually only the individual beads are
        real.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">In the same way, mind or
        matter at every moment is new, arising at every moment. But there is
        something like a string going through the succession of arising of mind
        and matter. That is relationship as cause and effect. So when an effect
        is produced by a certain cause, then it must have some features of the
        cause in it. In that way there are no chaotic arising and disappearing,
        or there is no such thing as &quot;my kamma will give results to you or
        your kamma will give results to me,&quot; because there is this line of
        relationship of cause and effect going through arising and disappearing
        of mind and matter at every moment.</font></p>
        <p><b><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">Rebirth is Suffering</font></b></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">Now when mind and matter
        produced, or mind and matter arise at the moment of rebirth, Buddha
        called rebirth &quot;suffering&quot;. This is the word that most people
        don't like, and we are always told, &quot;You Buddhists talk about
        suffering all the time.&quot; According to the teaching of the Buddha,
        that rebirth is also suffering. To be born as a human being to be born
        as a celestial being, to be born as an animal is also suffering.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">So according to the Buddha's
        teachings, everything in the world is suffering. Here, first you must
        understand the word 'suffering.' Let's go back to the Pali word dukkha.
        Because sometimes the translations are not adequate, they do not or
        cannot cover the range of meanings that was covered by the original
        words. Now whenever we hear the word dukkha in Pali or 'suffering' in
        English, our minds go to 'just pain.'</font></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">When we say there is
        suffering, we think that only pain is suffering. There is pain --
        physical pain or mental pain. That is suffering. That is very easy to
        see. But what the Buddha meant by suffering is much deeper than that. So
        according to the Buddha, everything in this world is suffering. Even
        when you are enjoying yourself, enjoying good relationship, enjoying
        sensual pleasures, these pleasures are themselves termed suffering by
        the Buddha.</font></p>
        <p><b><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">Whatever is impermanent is
        suffering</font></b></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">Why? We must understand that
        the criterion taught by the Buddha for something being suffering or
        dukkha. Now Buddha said, &quot;Whatever is impermanent is
        suffering.&quot; We must follow that.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Whatever is impermanent
        is suffering.&quot; Can we find anything that is permanent in this
        world? Can we find anything that just arises and does not disappear?
        There is nothing that lasts forever. Everything must come to an end.,
        simply because it has a beginning. So whenever there is a beginning,
        there is an end. This is law of nature. We cannot escape that. We are
        born as human beings, we started as human beings, we will not live
        forever. One day, we will die because that is the end of our lives. So
        whenever there is a beginning, there is an end, and something that has a
        beginning and an end cannot be said to be permanent. It is impermanent.
        Buddha said, &quot;Whatever is impermanent is suffering (dukkha).&quot;
        That means, it is oppressed by arising and disappearing, or bombarded by
        arising and disappearing,&nbsp; or tormented by arising and
        disappearing.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">Being constantly oppressed by
        arising and disappearing is what Buddha meant as dukkha or suffering.
        Not just pain, not just sorrow and not just depression and others in the
        mind of suffering, but whether it is pleasure or it is sorrow,
        everything that has a beginning and an end is according to that
        criterion dukkha, because there is a sense of being of oppressed by
        arising and disappearing. It will become more pronounced when you
        practice meditation. When you practice meditation, you try to be mindful
        of whatever object is at the present moment. So whatever object you keep
        our mind on it, arises and disappears. It will not stay for a long time.
        For example, take my voice now. I am saying words and you are hearing
        these words one after another; they just come and go, come and go. So
        when you are aware of every object that you observe come and go, come
        and go, you can get that sense of being oppressed by arising and
        disappearing.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">Even when you are listening to
        me now, you are being bombarded by arising and disappearing. You are not
        the same person now as you were five minutes ago or ten minutes ago. So
        there is this arising and disappearing going on all the time; there is
        no respite, no gap between these. So we are constantly and continuously
        oppressed by this arising and disappearing. That is what Buddha meant by
        'suffering.'</font></p>
        <p><b><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">All five aggregates are
        suffering</font></b></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">If we understand this, we can
        understand that all five aggregates are suffering. Five aggregates mean
        everything in the world. So everything in the world has a beginning and
        an end, and so everything is suffering. When we try to understand the
        Teachings of Buddha -- especially the First Noble Truth -- we must
        understand the suffering on this level, not just on the popular level.
        Now when explaining the First Noble Truth, Buddha said, &quot;Birth is
        suffering, old age is suffering, disease is suffering, death is
        suffering.&quot; And so on. But they are not difficult to understand.
        Without meditation, we can understand that they are all suffering. But
        at last Buddha said, &quot;In brief, all five aggregates of clinging are
        suffering.&quot; That means everything in the world is suffering. That
        is what many people cannot accept. Many people do not understand what
        Buddha really meant.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">When Buddha said everything in
        the world is suffering or all five aggregates of cling are suffering, he
        had in mind that definition of suffering or dukkha, that is &quot;being
        constantly oppressed by arising and disappearing.&quot; There is not a
        single physical or mental phenomenon that can escape this bombardment by
        arising and disappearing. That is why everything in the world is said to
        be suffering. So when we try to understand the teaching of suffering we
        try to understand in this way. If we do not understand on this level, we
        may just not understand the Buddha's teachings, or we may accuse Him of
        being a pessimist.</font></p>
        <p><b><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">Realist</font></b></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">But Buddha was not a pessimist
        nor was He an optimist. He was a realist. He taught us what was real. He
        did not cover something up just to console us. When he found out that
        the world was suffering, he just said that the world was suffering. But
        the good thing is that He did not stop there. He said that there was a
        cause for this suffering. And best of all, He said that there was a way,
        which can lead to the cessation of suffering or to get out of this
        suffering.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">Just as a clever physician
        would point out that you have a disease, and there is a cause for this
        disease, and that this disease could be cured and this is the medicine
        to take, so Buddha said, &quot;You all beings are suffering, there is a
        cause for suffering which is craving, and there is the cessation of this
        suffering and that cessation of suffering can be achieved through the
        practice of the Middle Way or the Noble Eightfold Path.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">Buddha did not teach us just
        suffering, but he taught us how to get rid of suffering also. If we
        follow the practice of the Noble Eightfold Path, we will also be able to
        end this suffering. So it is up to us whether we want to get out of this
        suffering or not, and if we really want to get out of suffering, we need
        to follow the Fourth Noble Truth which is the way that leads to the
        cessation of the suffering.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font size="+0">Conclusion</font></b><br>
        <font size="+0">Therefore, when we study the Buddha's teaching or try to
        understand the Buddha's teachings, we do not try just to understand
        them, we need to practice them also. His teachings are like medicine.
        The medicine will be effective only if you take it. You may have bottles
        of medicine at home, but if you do not take them, you will not get cured
        of that disease you want to cure. So the effectiveness of medicine lies
        in being taken. If you do not take them, you will not get the results of
        that medicine. In the same way, Buddha's teachings are good to
        understand, but that is not enough. We have to put these teachings into
        practice or we have to follow the teachings so that we are able to get
        rid of suffering or get rid of all mental defilements. That is why in
        our teachings, practice is very important. Only through practice can we
        achieve what was achieved by the Buddhas and the Arahants.</font></font></p>
        <p><font size="+0" face="Times New Roman">Now we have tried to
        understand what kamma is, and also rebirth that is the result of kamma,
        and also we have tried to understand that the result of kamma, however
        good it may be, is actually, suffering.</font></p>
