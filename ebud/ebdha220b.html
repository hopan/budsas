    <P>What is a bhikkhuni? </P>
    </B>
    <P>A bhikkhuni is a fully ordained Buddhist nun. (Bhikkhun<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ī 
    is a Pali word, used by the Theravada tradition in South Asia. Other 
    traditions use the Sanskrit equival</FONT>ent bhiksunī, pronounced 
    ‘bhik-shoo-nee’)</P>
    <B>
    <P>Where did the bhikkhuni order come from? </P>
    </B>
    <P>The bhikkhuni order (‘Sangha’) was started by the Buddha himself. When 
    women came to him seeking to live the renunciate life, the Buddha allowed 
    them to go forth in his religion. At that time, the order of bhikkhus 
    (Buddhist monks) already existed, so the Buddha adopted the&nbsp; code of 
    discipline and way of community life from the bhikkhus and changed it as 
    necessary. </P>
    <B>
    <P>What do we know about bhikkhunis in ancient times? </P>
    </B>
    <P>Most Buddhist texts are told from the bhikkhus’ point of view, so there 
    is not a lot of information about bhikkhunis. But there are several works 
    composed by or about the bhikkhunis in the time of the Buddha. The bhikkhuni 
    Sangha is mentioned throughout the Buddhist disciplinary texts (Vinayas) of 
    all schools. In later years, the inscriptions on Buddhist monuments mention 
    bhikkhunis nearly as often as bhikkhus. They often played important roles, 
    such as donors, scholars, and teachers. </P>
    <B>
    <P>What do bhikkhunis do? </P>
    </B>
    <P>The same things as the bhikkhus. That is, they meditate, study and teach 
    the Dhamma, run monasteries, act as counsellors, participate in ritual and 
    community activities, engage in social service, and so on.&nbsp; </P>
    <B>
    <P>How do bhikkhunis live? </P>
    </B>
    <P>The ancient texts show that the bhikkhunis’ life was oriented towards 
    seclusion and meditation, but also had a strong community involvement. Each 
    new bhikkhuni must study for several years under a qualified teacher until 
    they are ready to be independent. Like the bhikkhus, the bhikkhunis live 
    entirely on alms offerings, and may not use personal funds. They are 
    supported by donors who supply food, medicines, dwelling, robes, and other 
    needs. </P>
    <B>
    <P>Are there bhikkhunis in all traditions of Buddhism? </P>
    </B>
    <P>There is no simple answer to this question. In ancient times, the 
    Buddhist community was unified, and the bhikkhunis simply formed one part of 
    this earliest Buddhism. Later, as Buddhism diverged into different schools 
    (which happened about 200-400 years after the Buddha), each school had its 
    own bhikkhuni community.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The bhikkhuni Sangha was 
    introduced to Sri Lanka by Venerable Sanghamitta, the daughter of King 
    Ashoka, about 250 BCE. It flourished in Sri Lanka until around 1100 CE, a 
    time of war and famine, and then disappeared. No-one knows exactly why this 
    happened. </P>
    <P>But the bhikkhuni lineage was taken from Sri Lanka to China in 443 CE. 
    From there it spread through the East Asian area. Today bhikkhunis are found 
    in China, Taiwan, Korea, Vietnam, and Japan. </P>
    <P>The bhikkhuni lineage was never introduced into Tibet, but in modern 
    times some women practising within the Tibetan tradition have taken 
    bhikkhuni ordination from the East Asian Sangha. These bhikkhunis, such as 
    Ven. Tenzin Palmo, Ven. Thubten Chodren, Ven. Lekshe Tsomo, and others, have 
    gone on to become respected practitioners and teachers in world Buddhism.</P>
    <P>In the Theravadin regions of South-east Asia there are occasional 
    references to bhikkhunis through history, but no living bhikkhuni community 
    has survived until today. Like those practising within the Tibetan 
    tradition, women who wish to practice within the Theravada tradition have 
    taken bhikkhuni ordination from the East Asian bhikkhuni Sangha, sometimes 
    together with Theravada bhikkhus. Today there are many hundreds of 
    bhikkhunis living in Sri Lanka. In Thailand there are a few bhikkhunis, who 
    are generally well accepted by the community, but are denied official 
    support from the Sangha administration. In Cambodia, one of the Sangharajas 
    (Leaders of the Sangha) is personally supporting a bhikkhuni community. Two 
    years ago a Myanmar bhikkhuni was thrown in jail due to the objections of 
    the monks. Suffering from post-traumatic stress, she subsequently disrobed. 
    Hence there are no bhikkhunis in Myanmar.</P>
    <B>
    <P>Why do we need bhikkhuni ordination? </P>
    </B>
    <P>There are three essential reasons why bhikkhuni ordination is so 
    important.</P>
    <P>1. The bhikkhuni ordination was designed by the Buddha himself to provide 
    the ideal platform for women to seek full liberation. As bhikkhus, we are 
    reminded every day of the Buddha’s consummate skill in understanding the 
    needs of monastics, and establishing a way of training that is finely tuned 
    to support the holy life. We feel nurtured and supported by the knowledge 
    that we have fully entered into the Sangha, and are practising within the 
    same community as the arahants of old.</P>
    <P>2. From the time of his Enlightenment to the time of his Parinibbana, the 
    Buddha consistently stated that for his religion to be complete and 
    successful, it must consist of the four-fold assembly: bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, 
    laymen, and laywomen. Any other arrangement is imbalanced and incomplete. 
    Without the bhikkhuni Sangha, Buddhism is deprived of a tremendously 
    powerful spiritual component. In virtually all meditation retreats, the 
    women far outnumber the men. Imagine the loss of spiritual leadership the 
    Buddhist community has suffered by denying these sincere practitioners a 
    role in leading the Buddhist community.</P>
    <P>3. If Buddhist institutions remain male-only, they will become 
    increasingly marginalized in a world that accepts the equality of women. 
    Rather than falling behind the rest of the world in our spiritual values, we 
    should recognize that the principle of equality for all is based on the same 
    ethical values that inform the heart of true Buddhism: universal 
    loving-kindness and compassion.</P>
    <B>
    <P>Is it really true that women have bad kamma and can’t get enlightened?</P>
    </B>
    <P>Of course not. The Buddha emphatically stated that if when go forth they 
    have exactly the same potential as men, and are fully capable of even the 
    highest level of arahantship. The original Buddhist texts contain verses by 
    enlightened bhikkhunis such as Venerable Uppalava<FONT FACE="Tahoma">ṇṇ</FONT>ā, 
    Venerable Khemā, and many others. In fact, this literature forms one of the 
    oldest records of women’s spiritual accomplishments found anywhere in the 
    world.</P>
    <B>
    <P>But can’t the women just be happy to have 10-precept ordination (as a 
    samaneri)? </P>
    </B>
    <P>The samaneri ordination, as it is presented in the Vinaya, is for girls 
    who were too immature to take on the full training. It was never meant for 
    mature women. The Buddha established only one framework for mature 
    renunciate women, and that is the bhikkhuni Sangha. Attempts to invent new 
    ordination platforms will never gain the acceptance of the Buddhist 
    community at large. The end result is a proliferation of incompatible 
    models, which further weakens the already fragmented nuns’ community. In 
    Buddhist nations, it is only within those countries that support bhikkhuni 
    ordination that women have a leading and recognized role. </P>
    <B>
    <P>I’ve heard that Theravada monks will never accept bhikkhunis. Is this 
    true? </P>
    </B>
    <P>No. Some monks support, some oppose. In a conservative body like the 
    Sangha, which is, after all, made up of human beings, there are many who 
    would prefer to cling to what they know and are comfortable with. Sometimes 
    it seems that Buddhist monks will tell you that everything is impermanent; 
    yet they never want anything to change! </P>
    <P>Part of the problem is that bhikkhus do not know very much about the 
    position of bhikkhunis within original Buddhism. Sangha education is still 
    largely based on traditional materials, and this tends to create a culture 
    which values preservation rather than reformation. </P>
    <P>But we can understand the process better when we reflect that similar 
    situations are found in all the major world religions. In every religion, a 
    vital message of freedom has become the basis for wealthy and powerful 
    religious institutions. These are owned and run exclusively by men who 
    believe they have a sacred right to inherit both the material property and 
    the spiritual authority of those institutions. Whenever this is challenged, 
    those who benefit from the old arrangement will resist change. Invariably, 
    they produce a religious text which they claim provides an ancient, 
    irrevocable mandate for their monopoly. Such arguments, however, are usually 
    only persuasive to those who benefit from them, for a number of very good 
    reasons:</P>
    <P>1. Any ancient text is subject to a number of different interpretations, 
    and rarely is there an unambiguous case to support the male monopoly.<BR>
    2. The ancient texts were composed long ago in a limited historical and 
    cultural context, and the authors could not have envisaged our present day 
    social conditions.<BR>
    3. Refusing to support the religious aspirations of women because of 
    legalistic details contradicts the luminous spiritual values of compassion 
    and wisdom. </P>
    <P>This explains the fact, which I have repeatedly heard from nuns living in 
    Thailand, that they have not experienced opposition from the individual 
    monks so much, but mainly with the Sangha administration. Opposition to 
    bhikkhunis does not arise spontaneously from the ground up, as some sort of 
    genetic predisposition. It must be strenuously maintained from the top down, 
    as an ideological imposition.</P>
    <B>
    <P>But the Buddha tried to prevent the ordination of women!</P>
    </B>
    <P>This refers to the legend of the request by Mahapajapati, the Buddha’s 
    foster-mother, to gain ordination as the first nun. Modern scholars have 
    shown that this story abounds in textual problems, and cannot possibly be a 
    factual account. It is not sure exactly why it took shape in this form. But 
    perhaps it originally stemmed from personal difficulties concerning 
    Mahapajapati, which were later taken to apply to the bhikkhunis as a whole.</P>
    <B>
    <P>So isn’t it the case that the Buddha said that if bhikkhunis were 
    ordained, Buddhism would die out after 500 years?</P>
    </B>
    <P>This prophecy is part of the same legend, and the text depicts the Buddha 
    making this prophecy after accepting Mahapajapati as a bhikkhuni. Obviously, 
    it’s been a lot more than 500 years since then, and Buddhism has not yet 
    died out! Either this statement was not spoken by the Buddha, or else he 
    made a serious mistake. But given that nowhere else does the Buddha claim to 
    be able to predict the future in this way, it seems certain that this is not 
    an authentic saying. Anyone who is familiar with ancient mythic texts would 
    know that, invariably, prophecies are a disguised way of referring to their 
    own time, and only on the surface do they refer to the future.</P>
    <P>Sometimes you might hear that the Buddha predicted that the Bhikkhuni 
    Sangha would die out after 500 years, and it is argued from this that the 
    Buddha intended the bhikkhunis to disappear. This is incorrect. The supposed 
    prophecy refers to Buddhism as a whole, not to the bhikkhunis, as anyone who 
    takes the time to read the text would know. In fact, it is now 2500 years, 
    and neither the Bhikkhuni Sangha nor Buddhism look like vanishing any time 
    soon. </P>
    <B>
    <P>Didn’t the Buddha make all sorts of extra, difficult rules for the nuns?
    </P>
    </B>
    <P>It is true that the list of rules for nuns is longer that that for monks. 
    But this is for many reasons. In some cases, the monks actually have the 
    same rules, but they are just not included in the main list. In other cases, 
    the number of rules is simply multiplied due to repetition. In such cases 
    the practical effect of the rule is not changed. In other cases the rules 
    address specific feminine issues, such as ensuring menstrual hygiene, or 
    guaranteeing the safety of the nuns. But where there are genuine differences 
    between the sets of rules, there is no hard and fast principle: in some 
    cases the monks’ rules are stricter, and in some cases the nuns’ rules are 
    stricter. </P>
    <B>
    <P>But the rules do subordinate the nuns to the monks, don’t they? </P>
    </B>
    <P>No. The Vinaya does not allow for any power-based relationship between 
    the monks and nuns. In other words, no monk, not even the entire community 
    of monks, has the right to order a bhikkhuni to do anything. In fact, there 
    are many rules that protect the nuns, for example, by forbidding the monks 
    to use nuns as domestic servants by having them wash or sew their robes for 
    them. </P>
    <P>The Buddha set up the relationships between the male and female Sangha 
    based on mutual respect under the Vinaya. Bhikkhunis are included within the 
    original ‘Dual Sangha’ as set up by the Buddha, and managed according to the 
    ‘Dual Vinaya’ accepted among all schools. So, in the relationships between 
    the male and female Sanghas, Vinaya is the guide. Each monk or nun must take 
    the Dhamma &amp; Vinaya as the final authority, not the statements of any 
    individual monks.</P>
    <P>There is a rule, however, that requires that the bhikkhunis bow to the 
    monks. This is a matter of etiquette, not power. Many bhikkhunis sincerely 
    respect this rule, as it honours the Bhikkhu Sangha, which was originally 
    the senior community. However, the authenticity of this rule is doubted by 
    modern scholars. In any case, the Buddha stated that this rule was laid down 
    in accord with the customs of the time, so many people believe this should 
    not apply today. </P>
    <B>
    <P>Anyway, the bhikkhunis are forbidden from teaching the bhikkhus, aren’t 
    they?</P>
    </B>
    <P>No. This is a misunderstanding based on a mistranslation of one of the 
    special rules for bhikkhunis. In fact, the rule forbids bhikkhunis from 
    criticizing bhikkhus, which probably refers to making accusations about 
    Vinaya matters. As far as teaching is concerned, there is no prohibition in 
    Vinaya. How could there be? The Buddha always encouraged us to learn Dhamma 
    whenever we can.</P>
    <B>
    <P>The bhikkhunis from the East Asian countries are Mahayana, so how can 
    they give ordination to Theravada bhikkhunis? After all, a chicken can’t lay 
    a duck egg!</P>
    </B>
    <P>This is an ideological position based on a series of misunderstandings. 
    Ideas such as ‘Theravada’ and ‘Mahayana’ are not found in the Vinaya, they 
    were invented by later generations. The actual historical situation is as 
    follows.</P>
    <P>Originally the Sangha lived as one, following a unified code of conduct 
    (Vinaya) as prescribed by the Buddha. A few centuries after the Buddha’s 
    Parinibbana, the unified community broke up, forming the ‘18 schools’ of 
    Early Buddhism, one of which was the Theravada of Sri Lanka. (At this time, 
    Mahayana had not yet appeared.) Each school inherited the original Vinaya 
    and adapted it in minor details. But all Vinaya scholars who have studied 
    the matter, whether lay or monastic, agree that the essential aspects of the 
    Vinayas are compatible . </P>
    <P>All bhikkhus and bhikkhunis are ordained under the ordination lineage and 
    procedures of the Vinayas of these early schools. The East Asian traditions 
    owe their lineage to the Dharmaguptaka school, while the Central Asian 
    traditions stem from the Mulasarvastivada. Hence from the Vinaya point of 
    view, there is no such thing as a ‘Mahayana’ bhikkhu or bhikkhuni. 
    ‘Mahayana’ is a set of texts, doctrines, beliefs, and practices, but it has 
    never been an ordination lineage. </P>
    <P>As we have seen, the ordination lineage of the bhikkhunis stems from Sri 
    Lanka, so it is a part of the same broad community as the Theravada. When 
    this lineage was introduced into China, the Vinaya masters of China and Sri 
    Lanka obviously decided that the ordination procedures of the schools were 
    compatible. Hence the first Chinese bhikkhuni ordinations were conducted 
    with Sri Lankan bhikkhunis using Dharmaguptaka rites. </P>
    <P>Bhikkhuni ordinations in modern times simply reverse this ancient 
    precedent: bhikkhunis from the East Asian tradition, together with Theravada 
    bhikkhus, perform the ordination for women wishing to practice within the 
    Theravada tradition.</P>
    <B>
    <P>Bhikkhuni ordination is just a Western feminist imposition on Buddhist 
    culture!</P>
    </B>
    <P>As we have seen, bhikkhuni ordination is an intrinsic part of all 
    Buddhism since the beginning. This lapsed during medieval times, as Buddhism 
    slowly drifted away from its roots. In modern times, due to advances in 
    communication and learning, those roots are being rediscovered and the value 
    of the original teachings is increasingly recognized. </P>
    <P>Of course, Western education and ideas have played a positive role in 
    this process. But by far the strongest bhikkhuni movements are in Taiwan, 
    Korea, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka. The Western Sangha, in Theravada at least, 
    lags far behind Asia in accepting bhikkhunis. </P>
    <P>And we must be careful how we use the word ‘feminist’. If we understand 
    feminism to mean a compassionate understanding of the special kinds of 
    suffering endured by women, and a positive effort to redress such suffering, 
    then the Buddha was the first feminist!</P>
    <B>
    <P>If the case for bhikkhunis is as compelling as you say, why do even great 
    meditation masters oppose bhikkhuni ordination?</P>
    </B>
    <P>This is a difficult question, one that I have struggled with for years. I 
    find a key to understanding in some texts where the arahants are criticized 
    by the Buddha. We read of the Buddha admonishing, say, Venerable Sariputta, 
    or Venerable Moggallana, or other the great disciples, for their lack of 
    understanding in matters relating to the organization and management of the 
    Sangha, or its relations with the lay community. It seems that, while they 
    have full understanding as to their own minds, even awakened beings can lack 
    full insight into matters of social dynamics.</P>
    <P>The Buddhist Sangha forms its own culture, with its own language, 
    ideology, history, and forms. All those who enter this culture are immersed 
    in these values. Such views, inherited in the early years of monastic life, 
    will tend to remain and no amount of meditation will change them, until 
    there is an active process of dialogue and questioning within the community. 
    The very fact that meditation prowess is revered so highly makes it very 
    difficult to challenge the opinions of the masters, even when those opinions 
    relate to matters other than meditation, such as the history of ordination 
    lineages.</P>
    <P>This is not to say that meditation is useless in this context. It is only 
    that meditation by itself cannot change our views. What it can do, however, 
    is to enable us to be more open and reflective around our views. We will 
    understand the conditioned and provisional nature of our opinions, and be 
    much more accepting of other perspectives. </P>
    <B>
    <P>But you have to admit that if there are bhikkhunis in a monastery, there 
    is a big danger that the passions will be aroused?</P>
    </B>
    <P>This is usually not a problem, for we have the Vinaya as our protection. 
    This ensures that monks and nuns can never enter into a situation of 
    intimacy. Monks and nuns live in separate monasteries, or else in the same 
    monastery, but in separate quarters.</P>
    <P>Of course, no protection is total, and it is inevitable that from time to 
    time monks and nuns will fall in love and disrobe. But this happens all the 
    time anyway. Monks fall in love with laywomen, nuns with laymen, monks with 
    laymen, nuns with laywomen, and all the other lurid combinations best left 
    unimagined. Experience shows that, in a committed monastic environment, the 
    proportion of monks who disrobe to get together with a nun is minimal. In 
    the very rare cases when it happens, we should simply wish them the best, 
    and hope they can continue to thrive in the Dhamma.</P>
    <P>To my mind, a far bigger problem is that, when entirely separated from 
    nuns, monks may not learn to respect women as equal partners in the 
    spiritual life. Monks are able to relate to women as a mother: the wonderful 
    donors who bring food every day. We see women who are like a daughter: the 
    enthusiastic girls and young women who come to learn and meditate. We treat 
    women like a lover: the temptress, the danger to be feared and guarded 
    against. But never can we relate to women as a sister: a friend as we grow 
    together through life. I think this is very sad, and is our great loss.</P>
    <B>
    <P>Actually I was convinced about how wonderful the idea of bhikkhunis was 
    as soon as I heard of their existence. I only asked those questions to stir 
    you up!</P>
    </B>
    <P>Well, that’s good, I enjoy a good stirring. But make sure you also stir 
    up any monks who don’t support bhikkhunis!&nbsp; <B><A HREF="#top">[^] </A>

      <P>&quot;Although history would indicate that in the past there have been both 
      bhikkhunis and samaneris in [the lands now known as] Thailand, from the 
      time of the Ashokan missions of Arahantas Sona and Uttara to Suvannabhumi, 
      up until the Ayutthaya Period, and even into the twentieth century [in the 
      northern regions], there is little or no public knowledge nor a sense of 
      connectedness to this distant and more recent past.&quot; </P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>This sentence within &quot;Mining for Gold&quot; has elicited significant surprise, 
    interest and curiosity amongst both friends and eminent fellow monastic 
    Sangha members who have read it, particularly those who have lived in 
    Thailand for many years, but &quot;never had a clue.&quot; The information that I&#39;ve 
    come upon in the past years has largely been brought forth by the simple 
    merit of the interest stimulated by the rare appearance of a female form 
    clothed in the patchwork saffron robe, both during my time in Thailand and 
    elsewhere amongst the Thai people, scholars and Sangha members. For those 
    mentioned above who have requested sharing knowledge of the details, they 
    are laid forth here for reflection and consideration. As the information is 
    substantial and deviates from the main theme and flow of &quot;Mining for Gold&quot; 
    it is set forth separately in this appendix. Recognizing that the work shown 
    here with this important subject is barely a beginning and highly 
    inadequate, it is my hope that, as a beginning, it might at least encourage 
    an opening of ideas and views, as well as further research and publication.</P>
    <I><B>
    <P>A Weaving of Threads</P>
    </B></I>
    <P>Like weaving threads together, the lines of a sketch or beginning to lay 
    out pieces of a puzzle, I will lay out what I have come across for 
    consideration. The clues span a vast period of time, from roughly the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> 
    century BCE through to the 20<SUP>th</SUP> century, a period of perhaps 
    2,300 years, nearly as long as Buddhist history itself. I will divide it 
    roughly into three sections as mentioned in the &quot;Mining for Gold&quot; text: (1) 
    the Ancient period or time of the Ashokan missions of Sona and Uttara to 
    Suvannabhumi, (2) the middle period of various &quot;Thai&quot; kingdoms up until the 
    founding of the Kingdom of Ayutthaya, and (3) the period of more recent 
    history reaching into the twentieth century and modern times.</P>
    <I><B>
    <P>Ancient Period</P>
    </B></I>
    <P>The first references to bhikkhunis in the lands now known as Thailand 
    come from the records of the Ashokan missions of the Arahanta Theras Sona 
    and Uttara to Suvannabhumi, the ancient and famed &quot;Land of Gold.&quot; Although 
    the exact boundaries of the ancient Land of Gold are unknown, the Thai 
    people have strong emotional ties to the history of this land that may be 
    seen in many facets of their culture, in the ancient name of one of their 
    provinces, Suphanbhuri, and the modern, new Suvarnabhumi International 
    Airport. Historians say the Land of Gold roughly covered the territories now 
    known as Burma, Thailand and Laos, as well as parts of Southern China, 
    Cambodia and Northern Malaysia. </P>
    <P>The journey of Sona and Uttara Thera to Suvannabhumi is recorded in the 
    important Pali text the <I>Samantapasadika,</I> in the ancient Sri Lankan 
    chronicles the <I>Dipavamsa</I> and <I>Mahavamsa</I> as well as in the 
    Vinaya commentary <I>Sudassanavinayavibhasa</I>. [1] According to the <I>
    Samantapasadika</I>, the Theras &quot;ordained 3,500 men and 1,500 women, 
    establishing the Buddhadhamma.&quot; In Thai Buddhist historical texts, this 
    record appears in the Thai <I>Ruan Song Pra Thera Bye Prakat Pra Sasana Ni 
    Thang Prathet</I> – <I>About Theras Going to Teach Buddhism Abroad</I> where 
    we find that: </P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>&quot;Youths in the group of royal males of the number of 3,500 ordained. 
      The royal female youths in the number of 1,500 ordained. Thus, the Theras 
      firmly established Buddhism in the area of Suvannabhumi. Thereafter, the 
      young people of the royal heritage received the Dhamma lineage of Sona and 
      Uttara.&quot; [2] </P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>The exact location of the ordinations is disputed. I have no intent to 
    propose which site might have actually been the real and true location of 
    the Suvannabhumi bhikkhus&#39; and bhikkhunis&#39; ordination or whether the Ashokan 
    Missions really happened as recorded, but rather to show that <I>the Thai 
    people themselves</I> lay both historical and emotional claim to the site 
    that their own Buddhist textual records indicate was the place where 1,500 
    women were ordained <I>as bhikkhunis</I> from the very beginning of the 
    recorded establishment of Buddhism <I>in their land</I>. </P>
    <P>The Thai people regularly speak of the location of this great happening, 
    the foundation of the Buddhism in their land, as having occurred at the 
    &quot;First Chedi&quot; Nakhon Pathom, thousands of people coming to pay their 
    reverence to the site daily for this reason. The Burmese people locate the 
    site in Burma at Thaton where there is also a shrine devoted to this most 
    famous and venerable of occurrences. However, according to research done by 
    Ven. Ratanavali Bhikkhuni, contemporary Thai Buddhist historians locate the 
    site of the first ordinations at the ancient Thai city of Nakonsi Thammarat 
    (<I>Nagara Sri Dharmarajasima</I>). According to interviews conducted with 
    local Nakonsi Thammarat historians, it is well known that Buddhism first 
    entered Suvannabhumi in what is now known as Nakonsi Thammarat, not Nakhon 
    Pathom. The Thai Tipitaka reference above is anthropologically linked to the 
    Nakonsi Thammarat Yak Chedi (<I>Yaksa Chaitya</I>) through the accompanying 
    Tipitaka story of the Theras displaying their power over the supernatural 
    forces the people had feared and worshipped by subduing the Yaksas (ogres, 
    cannibals, flesh-eating giants) before teaching the Dhamma and giving 
    ordination. The main Nakonsi Thammarat Chedi, built in Sri Lankan style, is 
    also linked by local history directly to the Tipitaka history and the 
    arrival of the Theras Sona and Uttara. It is recorded to have been built in 
    conjuct with the Sri Lankans to commemorate the site where Indian Prince 
    Kumar and Indian Princess Hemachala (whose statuary images remain there) 
    came with a tooth relic of the Buddha, now enshrined there in memory of it 
    being the site of the establishment of the Buddha Sasana. This is confirmed 
    by Phra Raj Suwan Maytee in <I>Pan Din Ton: Nakon Pathom dan gert 
    Prabuddhasasana</I>. </P>
    <P>Neither the <I>Samantapasadika</I> Pali nor the Thai account say what the 
    noblemen and women were &quot;ordained&quot; (Thai: <I>buat</I>) as. However, by the 
    famed statement that &quot;Buddhism has only been established in a land when both 
    sons and daughters of that land have been ordained [as bhikkhus and 
    bhikkhunis,]&quot;<U>[</U>3] it may be inferred that it was upon such ordination 
    that the pronouncement &quot;the Buddhadhamma has been established&quot; was made in 
    the end of the <I>Samantapasadika</I> account. This is confirmed by the less 
    well-known <I>Sudassanavinayavibhasa </I>which does specify that the men and 
    women were in fact ordained as bhikkhus and bhikkhunis.</P>
    <P>Another point of interest is that according to the Thai Vinaya Pitaka 
    version of the <I>Samantapasadika</I>, as related by former Thai Senator 
    Rabiaprat Pongpanit in her 2002 report to the Thai Senate, both men and 
    women appear to have been ordained by the Bhikkhu Sangha alone, as there is 
    no mention of bhikkhunis among the &quot;five bhikkhus, samaneras, upasakas, 
    brahmans, high ranking government officials and members of royalty totaling 
    thirty-eight persons&quot; [4] who comprised the Ashokan mission. In fact, all of 
    the Ashokan mission records in which both men and women are recorded as 
    ordained in various countries surrounding India by the Arahanta missionaries 
    following their teaching, other than the Sri Lankan record, follow this same 
    pattern. This does not mean that the calling upon of bhikkhunis to perform 
    the dual ordination did not happen, as this part of the historical records 
    could certainly have been lost in many cases. However, the history in its 
    current form could also be seen as giving precedent, in the behavior of 
    numerous Arahanta Dhamma teachers of great renown, to the ordination of both 
    women and men as bhikkhus and bhikkhunis by the Bhikkhu Sangha in the 
    absence of a Bhikkhuni Sangha.</P>
    <I><B>
    <P>The Middle Period: the Kingdoms of Pattani, Sukhothai, Lanna-thai and 
    Ayutthaya</P>
    </B></I>
    <P>According to the general Buddhist history of this area in the middle 
    period, there were bhikkhus and bhikkhunis of various Buddhist schools and 
    traditions – Theravada (Sthaviravada or Hinayana), Mahayana and Vajrayana – 
    throughout the lands of South and Southeast Asia. Middle period references 
    specifically to bhikkhunis in the area that is now named Thailand come from 
    the Pattani, Lanna-thai and Sukhothai periods as well as the Ayutthaya 
    period. </P>
    <I><B>
    <P>Pattani (3<SUP>rd</SUP> – 17th Century CE)</P>
    </B></I>
    <P>Moving through time, we come to the Kingdom of Pan Pan, not far removed 
    from modern Nakonsi Thammarat. Pan Pan was later know by the Thais as 
    Pattani and is considered by them to be one of their ancient historic 
    kingdoms. Earlier historical records of Pan Pan span the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> 
    through the 7<SUP>th</SUP> centuries of the Common Era; later records of 
    Pattani extend through the 17<SUP>th</SUP> century, up until the absorption 
    of the kingdom in the modern Bangkok period. </P>
    <P>In his work <I>Nuns of Southeast Asia </I>(3.6), Peter Skilling relates 
    this finding: </P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>&quot;[In] Ma Tuan-lin&#39;s description of the Kingdom of P&#39;an P&#39;an in his <I>
      Wen-hsien Tung-k&#39;ao</I>: &#39;There are ten monasteries where Buddhist monks 
      and nuns study their canon. They eat all types of meat, but restrain from 
      wine.&#39; Wheatley and others have concluded that P&#39;an-p&#39;an was located in 
      the vicinity of the Bay of Bandon in peninsular Siam.&quot; </P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>The record is estimated to be related to the 7<SUP>th</SUP> century CE. 
    The word &quot;nun&quot; in the record is the Chinese character <I>ni</I> commonly 
    used as an abbreviation of the three Chinese characters <I>bi-ku-ni</I>. 
    Although the record is Chinese, the description of the food consumed by the 
    monks and nuns does not bear the marks of the discipline of the Chinese 
    Mahayana schools, thus it seems that these female Buddhist monastics would 
    have belonged to one of the Sthaviravadan or Theravadan schools.</P>
    <I><B>
    <P>Sukhothai (13<SUP>th</SUP> – 15<SUP>th</SUP> Century CE)</P>
    </B></I>
    <P>According to Thai records as related by the Research Department of 
    Rajavidyalaya Mahachulalongkornrajavidyalaya Royal Thai University 
    (hereafter abbreviated as &quot;Mahachula&quot;) there are Sukhothai records of 
    bhikkhunis ordained by the Bhikkhu Sangha alone. The question has been 
    raised by scholars whether the (perhaps) original practice of ordaining 
    bhikkhunis by the Bhikkhu Sangha alone may have continued in Thailand from 
    the Ashokan period, rather than being replaced shortly after the original 
    ordinations by the dual-ordination practice. Since these bhikkhunis did not 
    have dual ordination, modern monastic and lay Thai Buddhist scholars have 
    affirmed they may not be considered to have constituted a legitimate 
    historical Bhikkhuni Sangha, having not met the full criteria for ordination 
    as bhikkhunis. However, it may be noted that according to Vinaya, in the 
    time of the Buddha, neither early bhikkhunis ordained by the Bhikkhu Sangha 
    alone nor even those ordained by the &quot;bhikkhu rite,&quot; rather than the 
    &quot;bhikkhuni rite,&quot; were to be considered <I>not </I>ordained. </P>
    <I><B>
    <P>Lanna-thai (13<SUP>th</SUP> – 16<SUP>th</SUP> Century CE)</P>
    </B></I>
    <P>In <I>Nuns of Southeast Asia</I> at 3.6, Skilling further relates that:
    </P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>&quot;in Lanna Thai literature (Catalogue of Palm Leaf Texts on Microfilm at 
      the Social Research Institute, Chiang Mai) there are two texts entitled <I>
      Tamnan Bhikkhuni Dona</I> and <I>Tamnan Sindu Bhikkhuni</I>, which from 
      their titles are the biographies of bhikkhunis. These bhikkhunis do not 
      seem to be listed in the Tipitaka – at least they are not listed in 
      Malasekara&#39;s DPPN, thus there is the speculation that they might be later 
      bhikkhunis&#39; histories.&quot; [5] </P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>As these bhikkhunis&#39; names appear to not be among those dating from the 
    earliest days of the Indian Sangha, there is the expectation that rare and 
    precious records of later bhikkhunis, whether from Thailand or from other 
    locales may have been discovered. It was also in the Lanna-thai period that 
    Sanghanusati chants including the recollection of the virtues of the 
    Thirteen Foremost Bhikkhuni Disciples were composed and their recitation 
    called for by the royalty for the blessings of the populace and nation. 
    Considering the formal veneration payed to the Arahant bhikkhunis by even 
    the great kings of the Buddha&#39;s time, it might be seen as ironic that in 
    2007 CE, bhikkhuni Arahanta statuary images from the Lanna-thai period were 
    removed to Wat Songdhammakalyani (a bhikkhuni temple) from the Lanna-thai 
    monastery where they were long enshrined, as modern local monks felt it 
    inappropriate for men to show veneration to their female forms. </P>
    <I><B>
    <P>Ayutthaya Period (14<SUP>th</SUP> – 18<SUP>th</SUP> Century CE)</P>
    </B></I>
    <P>Further bhikkhuni records were spoken of at Mahachula, recovered 
    incidentally while conducting research related to the exchange of the 
    upasampada ordination between Thailand and Sri Lanka, in particular the 
    ordinations which facilitated the (re)establishment of the Thai Sangha upon 
    the founding of the Kingdom of Ayutthaya. These records indicate the 
    existence of pre-Lankavamsa Bhikkhu and Bhikkhuni Sanghas in Thailand, up to 
    the entry into the Ayutthaya period, at which time these Sanghas were ended 
    and a new Bhikkhu-only Sangha established with royal patronage and support 
    from the Bhikkhu Sangha lineage of Sri Lanka. </P>
    <P>By way of explanation, it is recorded that the Kingdom of Ayutthaya was 
    named after the Indian Kingdom of Ayodhya, famed birthplace of the Hindu God 
    Rama and the &quot;first man&quot; Manu. In its ruling secular and religious 
    leadership structure, the Kingdom of Ayutthaya showed a great harmonizing of 
    the religious teachings and practices of its time: Brahmanistic or Hindu, 
    and both Mahayana and Theravadan Buddhist. The king was thus availed of both 
    the divine right to rule via the Brahman priests as well as the Buddhist 
    messianic right as a &quot;wheel turning monarch&quot; and an incarnation of the 
    Bodhisattva Phra Ariya Maitreya – the future Buddha. These hardly seem to 
    have been unique ideas; in the centuries both preceding and following, 
    history records many Asian rulers, both Thai and non-Thai, adopting similar 
    means in various combinations of these same prevailing teachings.</P>
    <P>The records relate the causal reasoning behind the ending of the 
    Bhikkhuni Sangha as &quot;inappropriate relationship&quot; with men and the Bhikkhu 
    Sangha. This is interpreted by some scholars to mean that there were 
    allegations of sexual misconduct. Indeed, this seems to have been a topic of 
    literally mortal concern during the Ayutthaya period, as Skilling has found 
    records of Buddhist monks being regularly punished to death by public 
    roasting over fire for allegations made of sexual misconduct. For this 
    reason, foreign documenters observed and noted that only women past their 
    childbearing years were allowed to respectably don even white robes in the 
    Kingdom of Ayutthaya. [6] Other scholars understand this statement regarding 
    &quot;inappropriateness of the bhikkhunis&quot; to mean that it was considered 
    inappropriate for women to have the status of <I>Brahman</I> priests [7] 
    within the social/religious/ideological framework of the Ayodhyan 
    Brahmanical tenants of the <I>Manudharmashastra</I>, a system of philosophy 
    and social order which had spread at that time from India to Thailand. This 
    system by law subordinates women first to their fathers, then husbands and 
    finally sons, and does not allow for the possibility of women&#39;s salvation 
    other than through the &quot;sacrifices&quot; or the merit offered by their sons. 
    Finally, there has been the further speculation that the cessation of the 
    previous Sangha was simply, if nothing else, an oft-repeated political move 
    to ensure the loyalty of the clergy to the sovereign, and thus the 
    solidarity of the kingdom. </P>
    <P>As apparent in the <I>Kingdom of Siam</I> exhibit shown in 2004 CE in the 
    United States at the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco, the writings and 
    meticulous drawings of at least one foreign Jesuit missionary in Ayutthaya 
    nonetheless still record the presence of undoubtedly feminine, [8] 
    saffron-robed, shaven-headed monastics sitting on raised-platform seats in 
    distinctly Thai-temple environs during that period. [9] Skilling finds 
    records of robed Buddhist renunciate women in those times still addressed as
    <I>bhagini</I> – &quot;sisters,&quot; the Pali/Sanskrit form of respectful address 
    used by both the Buddha and Theras, as well as called <I>nang-chee</I> – 
    &quot;lady renunciates,&quot; a melding of Thai and Brahmanical terms and the 
    precursor of the modern, white-robed <I>mae-chee</I>.</P>
    <P>According to scholars, it may be reasonably assumed that some numbers of 
    both bhikkhus and bhikkhunis of lineages and traditions from the 
    pre-Ayutthaya period would have continued to survive in areas of what is now 
    known as Thailand outside of the Kingdom of Ayutthaya. This may be confirmed 
    by later records of Bhikkhuni Sangha in the regions that are now known as 
    the surrounding countries of Burma, China and Cambodia. </P>
    <I><B>
    <P>Pre-modern and Modern Period</P>
    </B></I>
    <P>Looking for evidence of the continuation of <I>kasaya</I>-robed Buddhist 
    monastic women beyond the Kingdom of Ayutthaya, such evidence may be found 
    in nearly all directions.</P>
    <P>In the northwest of what is now Thailand, Mon records include bhikkhunis 
    into the 14<SUP>th</SUP> century CE. In the northeast, records from Lao 
    territories show yellow-robed female monastics into the 20<SUP>th</SUP> 
    century. In the north, Thai-Yuan records of the Yuan Special Autonomous 
    District in Southern China show bhikkhunis contemporarily. The Thai peoples 
    of at least one locale in India also preserve the last remnants of a 
    yellow-robed women&#39;s monastic tradition.</P>
    <P>To the west in neighboring Myanmar, the <I>Burmese Chronicles of the 
    King&#39;s Proclamations</I>, as translated by Dr. Tan Tun in <I>Ideas and Views</I>, 
    shows royal permission granted as late as 1788 CE to women over age nineteen 
    to ordain as bhikkhunis. Additional laws prevented the king&#39;s slaves from 
    becoming bhikkhunis and, as late as 1810 CE, required both the bhikkhus&#39; and 
    bhikkhunis&#39; discipline to be royally monitored. It may be noted here that, 
    rather than the &quot;thousand year gap&quot; regularly spoken of, these records leave 
    a gap of <I>less than 200 years</I> [10] in the tradition of full ordination 
    for women in Southeast Asia. </P>
    <P>To the east there are more recent Thai-Lao records as well. Most 
    well-known is the travel diary of Hermann Norden, as published by Kamala 
    Tiyavanich in the chapter &quot;Sisterhood of the Yellow Robe&quot; in her book <I>
    Buddha in the Jungle</I>. Norden writes in his 1920s travel diary for the 
    Royal Geographical Society of Great Britian of his visit to the isolated 
    Muang You people: </P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>&quot;At the <I>bonzerie</I> (monastery or nunnery), I was astonished to see 
      young women in yellow robes and with shaven heads; a Buddhist Sisterhood. 
      They were busily sweeping an already tidy yard; an older woman 
      superintending the work.&quot; </P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>To the north, the records are not only recent, but contemporary. Dr. Hua 
    Che Min, a Chinese scholar of Sinhalese language affiliated with the 
    language department at the University of Kelaniya, Sri Lanka, has authored a 
    book in Sinhalese about the Thai-lue people&#39;s religious lives and practices 
    in the Sip Song Panna Special Autonomous Region in Yunnan Province, Southern 
    China. This book, <I>Theravada Buddhism in China</I> (in Singhalese), 
    records, as of the year 1991 CE, the number of temples and bhikkhus and 
    bhikkhunis of both Mahayana and Theravada traditions, reporting that they 
    have been largely untouched by the Chinese government. Phra Vutthichai 
    Bhikkhu, in his 2006 visit to the area to support the renovation of the Thai 
    people&#39;s Theravadan temples, confirmed the reports of the book and reported 
    that the temples look remarkably Thai. </P>
    <P>Not only in China and in the regions surrounding modern Thailand, but in 
    the homeland of Buddhism as well, the ethnic Thai peoples seem to have been 
    among the last to devotedly preserve the remnants of their yellow-robed 
    monastic traditions for women. In <I>Yasodhara Magazine</I>, Venerable 
    Dhammananda Bhikkhuni reports her recent discovery of the presence of a 
    tradition of saffron-robed female monastics in at least one ethnic Thai 
    people&#39;s community in India. [11] </P>
    <P>Once again returning to within the heart of the Thai Kingdom, images of 
    saffron-robed women in Buddhist monastic life do not entirely disappear in 
    the Ratanakosin Era, but may be found in the arts and histories related to 
    the Royal Family.</P>
    <P>Many Thais might be surprised to learn that the heritage of the early 
    Arahanta bhikkhunis and the later bhikkhunis&#39; missions were both affirmed 
    and royally honored in Thailand. In 1836 CE, King Nang Klao – Rama III, 
    established Wat Thepthidarom (Pali: <I>Devadhita-arama</I>) in Bangkok, the 
    Monastery of the Heavenly Daughter, named for his beloved eldest daughter 
    who served efficiently as his personal secretary, Crown Princess 
    Apsonsudathep. The monastery&#39;s bhikkhuni Vihara houses statuary images of 
    the Founding Mother of the Bhikkhuni Sangha Mahapajapati Gotami and 
    fifty-two bhikkhuni Arahantas, the images dedicated to his daughter (whose 
    health was ailing) and his fifty-two children. The princess also contributed 
    from her personal fortune to the construction. King Rama III also undertook 
    the 16 year 7 month restoration of the Ayutthayan period monastery Wat 
    Bodharam (commonly known as Wat Pho), initially begun by King Rama I when he 
    established it as a first grade royal monastery in 1788 CE. King Rama III&#39;s 
    son Prince Laddawan led in the restoration of the Western Vihara, the famed 
    Temple of the Reclining Buddha, on whose walls may still be found the <I>
    Mahavamsa</I> mural paintings of the arrival of Ashokan daughter Sanghamitta 
    with the Bodhi tree to Sri Lanka, her meeting with King Devanampiyatissa and 
    her ordination of Queen Anula with her company of 500 women, establishing 
    the Buddhasasana. Other walls in the sanctuary of the Reclining Buddha are 
    covered by extensive and elaborate mural paintings of the thirteen foremost 
    bhikkhuni disciples of the Buddha and their stories, as well as paintings of 
    the ten foremost laymen and laywomen disciples. This great restoration was 
    undertaken by the king to maintain Wat Pho as &quot;a center of both arts and 
    knowledge for the Thai people, where descendants could look indefinitely.&quot;
    </P>
    <P>In the years that followed however, few have even known to look. The 
    doors of the Bhikkhuni Vihara in the Monastery of the Heavenly Daughter 
    generally remain locked. As robed, shaven-headed images of bhikkhus and 
    bhikkhunis may look similar without close examination, even well-educated 
    monks living for years at Wat Pho may never know of the content and meaning 
    of its full-wall mural paintings, not to mention the throngs of tourists 
    that pass through its halls each day. The majority of modern records that 
    are often seen related to ordained women in the saffron robes and the Thai 
    royalty might be considered tragic. </P>
    <P>Perhaps the most famous is the diary of Anna Leonowens and the Western 
    movies <I>The King and I</I> and <I>Anna and the King</I> based upon it. 
    Anna Owens was the British governess to the Royal court of Siam from 
    1862-1865 CE, during the reign of King Mongkut – Rama IV, who was a 
    highly-disciplined Buddhist monk himself for many years and founder of the 
    Dhammayuta Nikaya (a reformed monastic order) before ascending to the 
    throne. In her book <I>Romance of the Harem</I>, she relates the pitiful 
    story of the favorite consort-wife of the king, Lady Tuptim, who was engaged 
    to be married when she was chosen for the royal harem. Her fiancé, Pilat, 
    ordained as a Buddhist monk after her leaving, and when Lady Tuptim felt 
    trapped by the confines of her palace life she escaped and secretly ordained 
    as a novice at Phra Pilat&#39;s temple. Upon her discovery there, although 
    affirming purity, the two were tried and sentenced to death by fire. We can 
    only guess the impact that such an event may have had upon the thoughts and 
    views of the royal princes and their heirs, amongst them, Prince 
    Chulalongkorn, the son of King Mongkut who was later to become Rama V, the 
    king to follow, and Prince Wachirayan, the son who was to become Sangharaja.</P>
    <P>Under the reign of the beloved and revered King Chulalongkorn – Rama V 
    (the son of King Mongkut tutored by Anna Leonowens while a prince) – Siam 
    lost border territories to colonial powers, to France for Laos and Cambodia, 
    to Britain for Burma. However the King was able to maintain independence, 
    declaring Siam an independent kingdom in 1886. A son of King 
    Chulalongkorn&#39;s, Rama VI – King Vajiravudh – reigned from 1910 to 1925, 
    during which time he increased the westernization begun by his father and 
    grandfather, including mandatory primary school education and a system of 
    standardized basic education for the Buddhist monastic Sangha. Prince 
    Wachirayan (Vajirananavarovasa) was appointed and empowered by King 
    Vajiravudh as <I>Sangharaja</I> – &quot;Sangha King&quot; or &quot;Supreme Patriarch&quot; of 
    Siam.</P>
    <P>Texts authored by Prince Patriarch Vajirananavarorasa for the progress 
    and knowledge of Buddhism and education of the Sangha in the monastic 
    discipline of the Vinaya included the <I>Vinaya Mukha</I> and its 
    English-language translation <I>Entrance to the Vinaya.</I> As these texts 
    are often studied in place of the Vinaya itself, they have led (and still 
    continue to lead) the vast majority of Thai-educated Buddhist monks to hold 
    beliefs expressed therein, such as: a &quot;person who wishes for <I>upasampada</I> 
    (full bhikkhu or bhikkhuni ordination) must be male&quot; and &quot;if one has 
    committed serious offences or one is a woman, then such persons cannot 
    receive the upasampada and their ordination would be known as <I>
    vatthu-vipatti</I>, literally, defect[ive].&quot; [12] Later, in Volume III of 
    the <I>Vinaya Mukha</I> we find two personal speculative theories propounded 
    by its author: the first, that the Bhikkhuni Sangha &quot;existed temporarily, 
    for no great length of time… [and] probably disappeared in Lord Buddha&#39;s own 
    days;&quot; [13] and the second, that from the time of Sanghamitta Theri, 
    daughter of Emperor Ashoka, &quot;it is agreed that the bhikkhunis disappeared.&quot; 
    [14] In this case, the &quot;agreement&quot; would seem to have become the 
    self-fulfilling prophecy for a nation. With a concerted effort made to 
    spread and establish a statewide system of secular and monastic education, 
    lay children, samaneras, and bhikkhus, from the early 1900s until the 
    present, all came to be educated that the Bhikkhuni Sasana had died out in 
    India not long after the Buddha&#39;s time, the last bhikkhuni being Sanghamitta 
    Theri.</P>
    <P>Additionally, according to both Buddhist monastic scholars and Buddhist 
    historians such as Tiyavanich, in the twentieth century, diverse, local, 
    ethnic traditions of Buddhism in Thailand were legally replaced by State 
    Buddhism for the sake of a Unified Thai Nation and Sangha. Empowered by the 
    Sangha Acts of 1903 and 1928, both secular and religious laws were made 
    forbidding the ordination of women due to a perceived political threat. [15] 
    For the sake of a centralized Thai State and uniformity of Sangha standards, 
    although a divergence from the Vinaya, from that time it became illegal for 
    local Elder Buddhist monks to give ordination within their local Sangha 
    traditions and lineages <I>to even men</I>, unless they were approved, 
    trained and certified as Upajjhayas (preceptors) by State Authority. </P>
    <P>As a final note, scholar Peter Koret is currently working on the 
    histories of several Thai women ordained as bhikkhunis and disrobed by law 
    during the early 1900s in the Sangha Acts period above. These include the 
    two daughters of outspoken political critic Narin Klung (one of the 
    political threats mentioned above) who were ordained as bhikkhuni and 
    samaneri along with a number of other women. Due to their father&#39;s political 
    conflicts, the daughters, Sara and Jongdi, were arrested and most of their 
    Sangha disrobed, while the two sisters were taken to prison where the elder 
    sister was disrobed by force. When released from prison the daughters 
    maintained their monastic life but changed the color of their robes. Their 
    Sangha ended one day when the elder sister, Phra Bhikkhuni Sara, was 
    kidnapped by a rider on horseback while she was walking on almsround. Due to 
    the negative reaction to that event within the Sangha, the then Sangharaja 
    of Thailand passed a law forbidding any and all Thai bhikkhus from acting as 
    preceptors in ordaining women as either samaneris, sikkhamanas, or 
    bhikkhunis.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, twenty-eight years later, in 1956 CE, Thai lady Voramai 
    Kabilsingh received ordination as a samaneri from Phra Prommuni of Wat 
    Bawanniwet, the King&#39;s own ordination master. Although she wore light yellow 
    robes of a different color than Thai bhikkhus, in the 1960s she was charged 
    with the illegal act of impersonating a bhikkhu. After learning of the 
    continuation of Sanghamitta Theri&#39;s line in the Chinese Dharmagupta 
    bhikkhuni lineage of Taiwan, in 1971 she traveled for the full bhikkhuni 
    ordination there, receiving the ordained name of Shih Ta-Tao Fa-Shr – 
    Venerable Mahabodhi Dhammacarya. In the year 2001, thirty years after her 
    full ordination, Venerable Mother Mahabodhi&#39;s daughter Dr. Chatsumarn 
    Kabilsingh, herself a respected Buddhist scholar and teacher, traveled to 
    Sri Lanka to receive samaneri ordination and two years later the bhikkhuni 
    ordination upon the revival of the tradition of the bhikkhuni upasampada 
    there. Given the ordained name Bhikkhuni Dhammananda, her ordination 
    together with the beneficent works of others, has paved the way for a 
    gradually but steadily increasing number of Thai women, both Theravadan and 
    Mahayana, to be ordained as samaneris and bhikkhunis both in Sri Lanka, in 
    Taiwan, and once again in Thailand. As their stories are many, they will not 
    be told here. [16] Fortunately, it is the very spirit of further research 
    into the Buddhist texts coupled with dedication to the higher purpose of the 
    Buddhasasana and the welfare of the Monastic Sangha, so championed by Kings 
    Mongkut and his sons King Chulalongkorn and Prince Patriarch 
    Vajirananavarorasa, which has brought this about. In the year 2003 CE, after 
    extensive research and review by the Thai Senate, the secular law banning 
    women&#39;s ordination in Thailand was found unconstitutional and revoked as 
    contrary to freedom of religion. </P>

    <P>In Conclusion: A Different Definition</P>
    </B></I>
    <P>Thus, as I have been told by knowledgeable Thai researchers and Buddhist 
    academics, the common statement &quot;<I>Thailand has never had a Bhikkhuni 
    Sangha</I>&quot; or &quot;<I>Thailand has never had bhikkhunis</I>,&quot; to current 
    knowledge, might be more accurately and correctly stated as: </P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Within the domains of the current Chakri dynasty of Rama kings, since 
      its foundation; that is, in the Ratanakosin Era from the Ayutthaya Period 
      through the Bangkok period (1782 CE –present), Thailand has not yet had a
      <I>royally- or State-sanctioned and supported</I> Bhikkhuni Sangha <I>with 
      dual ordination.</P>
      </I>
      <P>This is not to say that there have never been bhikkhunis amongst the 
      ethnic Thai peoples, nor that the lands, now known as Thailand, have never 
      been host to the Bhikkhuni Sangha.</P>

    <P>[1] A text of Sri Lankan origin taken to China and translated by 
    Sanghabhadra about the time of Buddhagosa. The Chinese translation of the 
    title of this Singhalese Vinaya commentary has been retranslated into Pali 
    as the <I>Sudassanavinayavibhasa</I>.</P>

    <P>[3] Although this statement has been attributed to Ashokan son Mahinda 
    Thera in his words to Sri Lankan King Devanampiyatissa regarding his reason 
    for calling for his bhikkhuni sister Sanghamitta Theri and her peers to 
    establish the Bhikkhuni Sangha, it is based upon various quotations from the 
    Tipitaka. As amalgamated and paraphrased briefly from Analayo&#39;s <I>Women&#39;s 
    Renunciation in Early Buddhism</I>: </P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Numerous early canonical passages concur with the clear statement given 
      in the <I>Mahaparinibbana Sutta</I> that the Bhikkhuni Sangha is an 
      integral part of Buddhist community, particularly the <I>Lakkhana Sutta</I> 
      and the<I> Pasadika Sutta</I> of the <I>Digha Nikaya</I>. Even those 
      outside the Buddhist order apparently perceived the existence of 
      proficient female Buddhist monastics [bhikkhunis] as indispensable for the 
      completeness of the Buddha&#39;s Sasana, as in the <I>Mahavaccagotta Sutta</I> 
      of the <I>Majjhima Nikaya</I>, were we find the wanderer Vaccagotta, soon 
      to enter the Buddhist Sangha and become an Arahanta, proclaiming that: 
      &quot;If, in this teaching, only the Reverend Gotama and the bhikkhus were 
      accomplished, but there would not be accomplished bhikkhunis, then this 
      Holy Life, would be deficient in that respect&quot; – (<I>sace ... imam dhammam 
      bhavañc&#39; eva Gotamo aradhako abhavissa bhikkhu ca ... no ca kho 
      bhikkhuniyo aradhika abhavimsu, evam idam brahmacariyam aparipuram 
      abhavissa ten&#39; angena</I>.) The degree to which the existence of the 
      bhikkhunis is integral to the welfare of the Buddha Sasana is highlighted 
      in <I>Samyutta Nikaya</I> <I>16.13</I>: <I>&quot;bhikkhu bhikkhuniyo upasaka 
      upasikayo satthari ... dhamme ... sanghe ... sikkhaya ...samadhismim 
      sagarava viharanti sappatissa. Ime kho ... pañca dhamma saddhammassa 
      hitiya asammosaya anantaradhanaya samvattanti.&quot; </I>The conditions that 
      lead to the duration of the Dhamma after the Buddha has passed away are 
      treated in the <I>Anguttara Nikaya</I> which states these requisite 
      conditions to be that &quot;<U>the four assemblies</U> be respectful towards 
      the Teacher, the Teaching, the Community, the training <U>and towards each 
      other</U><I>&quot; – (bhikkhu bhikkhuniyo upasaka upasikayo satthari ... dhamme 
      ... sanghe ... sikkhaya... aññamaññam sagarava viharanti sappa issa. Ayam 
      kho ... paccayo yena Tathagate parinibbute saddhammo cira hitiko hoti.)</I> 
      According to the <I>Dakkhinavibhanga Sutta</I>, from the perspective of 
      merit, a gift given to the Ubhoto Sangha comprised of both bhikkhus and 
      bhikkhus is superior to that given to the Bhikkhu Sangha alone, thus the 
      absence of the Bhikkhuni Sangha would result in a deficiency of the Order 
      as a recipient of gifts. Finally, in <I>Samyutta Nikaya 42.7</I> we find 
      that, in addition to being treated as superior recipients of offerings, 
      the bhikkhus and bhikkhunis are reckoned together when it comes to 
      receiving teachings, as they constitute the superior field for the 
      Buddha&#39;s instructions – (&quot;<I>seyyathapi ... khettam aggam evam eva mayham 
      bhikkhu-bhikkhuniyo</I>.&quot;)</P>

    <P>Yes, the <I>bhiksuni </I>ordination could be performed in one of two

      <P>a. The advantage of this procedure is that it is simple and does not

      women. After that, the Elder Upali asked the Buddha, and the Buddha said, 
      &quot;Mahaprajapati accepted the eight <I>gurudharma</I>s as her going forth 
      and as her full <I>bhiksuni</I> ordination. What about other women? How 
      shall they go about it?&quot; And the Buddha said, &quot;After this, the women 
      should follow the sequence, according to the Dharma, to go forth and 
      receive ordination&quot;. But the women did not understand what was meant by 
      &quot;go in sequence,&quot; so they asked the Buddha. And the Buddha said, 
      &quot;Mahaprajapati, as the head and together with the 500 Sakya women, 
      accepted the eight <I>gurudharma</I>s and, in that way, went forth and 
      became fully ordained as <I>bhiksuni</I>s. After that, the other women who 
      seek to go forth should do likewise and follow the sequence. If a woman 
      wants to go forth, she should go to a <I>bhiksuni</I>, pay respect to her, 
      and that <I>bhiksuni</I> should ask her whether there are any hindrances. 
      If there are no hindrances, she should accept her, give her three refuges 
      and the five precepts. [There follows an explanation of the three refuges, 
      five precepts] Eventually, she gives her full <I>bhiksuni</I> 
      ordination&quot;.(13)</P>

    <P>The dual ordination procedure is prescribed for <I>bhiksuni</I>s.(21). In 
    this case, ten Tibetan Mulasarvastivada <I>bhiksu</I>s could conduct an 
    ordination together with twelve Dharmagupta <I>bhiksuni</I>s. The <I>
    bhiksuni</I> ordination rite could be recited in Tibetan, either using the
    <I>bhiksuni</I> dual ordination manual that has been translated from Chinese 
    to Tibetan, or an ordination procedure compiled by Tibetan <I>bhiksu</I>s 
    based on Tibetan sources. In the Tibetan Mulasarvastivada Vinaya, the <I>
    bhiksuni</I>s are ordained by twelve <I>bhiksuni</I>s first, i.e. the 
    Bhiksuni Sangha transmits to the candidate the <I>brahmacaryopasthana </I>
    vow.(22) Then ten <I>bhiksu</I>s join the twelve <I>bhiksuni</I>s together 
    to conduct the final <I>bhiksuni</I> ordination rite. Because the eight <I>
    parajika</I>s and the three reliances, etc., are recited only by the <I>
    bhiksu</I>s, and are the same in the Dharmagupta and Mulasarvastivada, the 
    candidates can be said to receive the Mulasarvastivada precepts.</P>
    <FONT COLOR="#7f0000"><B>
    <P>B. Question: To transmit the precepts, one must have those precepts 
    oneself or have precepts that are higher than those. Is the Bhiksu Sangha 
    alone, then, allowed to transmit the <I>bhiksuni</I> precepts?</P>
    </B></FONT>
    <P>Yes, because the <I>bhiksu</I> precepts are either considered to be 
    higher than the <I>bhiksuni</I> precepts or to be of one nature (<I>ngo bo 
    gcig; ekabhava</I>) with the <I>bhiksuni</I> precepts. This is so because:</P>
    <B>
    <P>1.</B> It is said that if a <I>bhiksu</I> transforms into a female, then 
    that <I>bhiksu</I> automatically has the <I>bhiksuni</I> precepts and does 
    not need to receive ordination again. Similarly, if a <I>bhiksuni</I> 
    transforms into a male, he automatically has the <I>bhiksu</I> precepts and 
    does not need to receive them anew. (See addendum on gender transformation, 
    with a translation from the Pali canon, Vin. III 35, 1224.) This is a 
    similar passage in the Dharmagupta Vinaya: .At that time, a <I>bhiksu</I> 
    transformed into a female. The <I>bhiksu</I>s asked the Buddha, &quot;Should he 
    be expelled [from the Sangha]?&quot; The Buddha said, &quot;No, he should not be 
    expelled. He is allowed to be sent to the Bhiksuni Sangha, and keeps his <I>
    upadhyaya, his acarya</I> and his previous ordination seniority&quot;. (23)</P>
    <B>
    <P>2.</B> In the Pali Vinaya, it is said that the Bhikkhu Sangha alone 
    ordained the 500 women accompanying Mahapajapati and other women, too. These 
    ordinations were conducted on the advice of the Buddha himself. To transmit 
    these precepts, they did not need to be <I>bhikkhuni</I>s. Later, after some 
    women felt embarrassed answering intimate questions in front of <I>bhikkhu</I>s, 
    the Buddha is said to have instituted the procedure of having <I>bhikkhuni
    </I>masters ask these questions, etc. This is clear from the Pali Vinaya, 
    considered by historians to be the earliest version of the Vinaya to be 
    written down.</P>
    <B>
    <P>3.</B> At the First Council after the Buddha’s <I>parinirvana</I>, Bhiksu 
    Upali is said to have recited the whole Vinaya Pitaka. In this case, he must 
    have recited the <I>Bhiksuni Pratimoksa Sutra</I>, too. Upali was not 
    leading the <I>posadha</I>, but he recited the <I>Bhiksuni Pratimoksa Sutra</I> 
    as part of the compilation of the Buddha.s teachings. He was allowed to do 
    so, although he did not have the <I>bhiksuni</I> precepts. Similarly, the 
    Tibetan <I>geshe</I> studies include the study of the Bhiksuni Vinaya.</P>

    <P>C. Question: Is it possible for Tibetan nuns to receive full <I>bhiksuni</I> 
    ordination in accordance with the Dharmagupta Vinaya tradition that 
    flourished in China, Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, etc.?</P>
    </B></FONT>
    <P>Yes. The ordination could be performed by ten <I>bhiksu</I>s and ten <I>
    bhiksuni</I>s of the Dharmagupta Vinaya tradition, whether from Taiwan, 
    Korea, Vietnam, or other countries, in accordance with the <I>bhiksuni 
    upasanpada</I> rite. In the Dharmagupta Vinaya, the <I>bhiksuni</I>s are 
    first ordained by ten <I>bhiksuni</I>s. Then these . basic Dharma. <I>
    bhiksuni</I>s (<I>penfani</I>) and the <I>bhiksuni</I> precept master go 
    before an assembly of ten <I>bhiksu</I>s on the same day. Such an ordination 
    would be very easy to arrange.</P>

    <P>The <I>bhiksuni</I> ordination could be performed by <I>bhiksu</I>s and
    <I>bhiksuni</I>s of the Dharmagupta tradition in accordance with the <I>
    bhiksuni upasanpada</I> rite. In the Dharmagupta Vinaya, the <I>bhiksuni</I>s 
    are ordained by ten <I>bhiksuni</I>s and then go before an assembly of ten
    <I>bhiksu</I>s on the same day.</P>
    <P>In this case, nuns of the Tibetan tradition could be ordained by <I>
    bhiksu</I>s and <I>bhiksuni</I>s of the Dharmagupta Vinaya tradition. This 
    is the procedure that has been used to reestablish the Bhiksuni Sangha in 
    Sri Lanka. The first three groups of Sri Lankan <I>bhiksuni</I>s were 
    ordained by <I>bhiksu</I>s and <I>bhiksuni</I>s of the Chinese or Korean 
    traditions.</P>
    <P>Since 1998, ordinations have been conducted by Sri Lankan Theravada <I>
    bhikkhu</I>s together with Sri Lankan <I>bhikkhuni</I>s, in accordance with 
    the Theravada <I>bhikkhuni</I> ordination rite. The Sri Lankan monks made 
    allowances for the newly ordained <I>bhikkhuni</I>s to act as ordination 
    masters due to the special circumstances and because many of these <I>
    bhikkhuni</I>s had been ordained as ten precept nuns for 20 or more years. 
    The Sri Lankan <I>bhikkhuni</I>s are now observing the 311 <I>bhikkhuni</I> 
    precepts of the Theravada tradition and are accepted in Sri Lankan society 
    as Theravada <I>bhikkhuni</I>s. In the same way, nuns of the Tibetan 
    tradition could receive the <I>bhiksuni </I>ordination in the Dharmagupta 
    tradition and practice according to the Mulasarvastivada Vinaya. After 
    twelve years, they could perform the <I>bhiksuni</I> ordination together 
    with <I>bhiksu</I>s of the Tibetan Mulasarvastivada tradition.</P>

    <P>D. Question: Are there clear records indicating that the <I>bhiksu</I> 
    and <I>bhiksuni</I> lineages exist unbroken in East Asia?</P>
    </B></FONT>
    <P>Yes. Attached are texts documenting that: (1) the Chinese <I>bhiksu</I> 
    lineage that flourished in East Asia can be traced to Buddha Sakyamuni 
    himself;(24) and (2) the <I>bhiksuni</I> lineage can be traced to the first 
    Chinese <I>bhiksuni</I> Ching Chien (Jingjian) in 357 C.E. Texts documenting 
    both of these lineages are enclosed herewith.(25)</P>
    <P>The Chinese master Daohai (Taohai) asserts that . In a word, the lineage 
    of <I>bhiksuni</I> ordination in China has clearly been broken (to receive 
    base rules from a sangha consisting of <I>bhiksuni</I>s only, not to mention 
    receiving 1group ordination from <I>bhiksu</I>s) during Sung Dynasty (around 
    A.D. 972).. (26) This assertion is refuted by clear documentation. During 
    the Northern Sung dynasty, Emperor T.aitsu (Taizu) began a persecution of 
    Buddhism and prohibited <I>bhiksuni</I>s from traveling to <I>bhiksu</I> 
    monasteries to receive ordination. However, this prohibition was not in 
    effect for long. After Emperor T.aitsu (Taizu) died in 976, his son 
    T.aitsung (Taizong) came to power and was well disposed toward Buddhism.(27) 
    This can be proven from historical records documenting that T.aitsung 
    (Taizong) established an ordination platform in the year 978. Additional 
    ordination platforms were erected in 980, 1001, 1009, and 1010.(28) The year 
    1010 was especially important, because 72 ordination platforms were erected 
    throughout the country. (See attached documents).</P>

    <P>E. Question: How should the <I>Siksamana </I>ordination be performed?</P>
    </FONT>
    <P>1. </B>The <I>Siksamana</I> precepts could be given by Dharmagupta <I>
    bhiksuni</I>s according to the Mulasarvastivada tradition, using the <I>
    siksamana</I> precepts from the Mulasarvastivada tradition. This is possible 
    because <I>bhiksunis</I> ordained according to the Dharmagupta Vinaya have 
    all the <I>Siksamana</I> precepts as explained in the Mulasarvastivada 
    Vinaya. The <I>siksamana</I> precepts could be explained by the <I>bhiksuni</I>s 
    in Tibetan, by using the Tibetan Mulasarvastivada text.</P>
    <B>
    <P>2. </B>The training of nuns in the <I>bhiksuni</I> precepts could be 
    explained to the candidates during these two years of <I>Siksamana</I> 
    training, because <I>Siksamana</I>s are permitted to study the <I>bhiksuni
    </I>precepts. The training of nuns in the <I>Siksamana</I> precepts for two 
    years could be done in one of three ways:</P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>a. Training in India or Nepal: <I>Bhiksuni</I>s from Taiwan, Korea, and 
      other countries can assist with the training of candidates in India and 
      Nepal.</P>
      <P>b. Training in Taiwan, Korea, or Vietnam: The advantage of this option 
      is that the candidates would get excellent training in monastic discipline 
      and get the experience of living with senior <I>bhiksuni</I>s. The 
      disadvantage is that many of the candidates for <I>bhiksuni</I> ordination 
      in the Tibetan tradition are in the midst of an intensive education 
      program. It would be an interruption to have these candidates go to Taiwan 
      or elsewhere to train in the precepts. Furthermore, the training is 
      conducted in an unfamiliar language and culture.</P>
      <P>c. Tibetan <I>bhiksu</I>s could also teach the <I>Siksamana</I> 
      precepts, based on the Mulasarvastivada Vinaya.</P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>3. It is clear in the texts of all Vinaya traditions that the <I>. 
    ramanerika</I> and <I>Siksamana</I> precepts are to be given by <I>bhiksuni</I>s. 
    The training of nuns in the <I>bhiksuni</I> precepts could be explained to 
    the candidates during these two years of <I>Siksamana</I> training, because
    <I>siksamana</I>s are permitted to study the <I>bhiksuni</I> precepts. 
    According to the Dharmagupta Vinaya, a <I>Siksamana</I> has to study the <I>
    bhiksuni</I> precepts for two years.(29).</P>
    <P>This training could be conducted in two ways:</P>
    <DIR>
      <DIR>
        <P>a. Tibetan <I>bhiksu</I>s could teach the Bhiksuni Pratimoksa 
        according to the Mulasarvastivada tradition.</P>
        <P>b. <I>Bhiksuni</I>s of the Chinese, Korean, or other countries could 
        be invited to explain the <I>bhiksuni</I> precepts, using both the 
        Dharmagupta and Mulasarvastivada texts.</P>
      </DIR>
    </DIR>
    <P>4. Exceptions with regard to <I>Siksamana</I> ordination are possible 
    under certain circumstances. In Kunkhyen Tsonaba Sherab Zangpo.s Dulwa 
    Tsotik,(30) in the context of the twoyear training of a <I>siksamana</I>, it 
    says that a <I>Siksamana</I> needs to take the precepts . from an <I>
    upadhyayika</I> and <I>karmakarika</I>, together with a <I>sangha</I> of <I>
    bhiksuni</I>s. The female <I>sangha</I> must be comprised of twelve <I>
    bhiksuni</I>s in a . central land.. In a . border land,. where twelve <I>
    bhiksuni</I>s are not available, six <I>bhiksuni</I>s need to be present. If 
    this number of <I>bhiksuni</I>s is not complete and the precepts are given 
    by a community of four <I>bhiksuni</I>s, the precepts are said to arise, 
    although those who conduct the ordination commit a fault (<I>nyes byas</I>;
    <I>duskrta</I>). The same text says, . If one cannot find the required <I>
    bhiksuni</I>s, it is even permissible for the Bhiksu Sangha to give the <I>
    Siksamana </I>precepts (<I>dge slong ma de dag ma rnyed na/ dge slong pha&#39;i 
    dge &#39;dun gyis kyang dge slob ma&#39;i bslab pa sbyin du rung ste</I>).. (31)</P>
    <FONT COLOR="#7f0000"><B>
    <P>F. Question: Is there one <I>bhiksuni</I> lineage in China or two?</P>
    </B></FONT>
    <P>There is one <I>bhiksuni</I> lineage in the Dharmagupta tradition, not 
    two. In 357 CE, Ching Chien (Jingjian) was ordained as a <I>bhiksuni</I> by
    <I>bhiksu</I>s alone, because there were no <I>bhiksuni</I>s in China at 
    that time. Chinese Buddhists traditionally regard this as the beginning of 
    the <I>bhiksuni</I> ordination in China. After the arrival of Bhiksuni 
    Devasara and other <I>bhiksuni</I>s from Sri Lanka, Huikuo (Huiguo) and 
    other Chinese <I>bhiksuni</I>s were reordained by both <I>bhiksu</I>s and <I>
    bhiksuni</I>s, in a ceremony led by the <I>bhiksu</I> master Sanghavarman 
    and the <I>bhiksuni</I> master Devasara (Pali. Tessara, Chin. Tiehsolo) in 
    434 C.E. Although the ordination of <I>bhiksuni</I>s by <I>bhiksu</I>s only 
    is a flawed procedure, it is considered valid. Even the senior Vinaya master 
    Dao Hai (Taohai), who is concerned about the state of Vinaya practice in 
    general these days, agrees that a <I>bhiksuni</I> ordination by <I>bhiksu</I>s 
    alone is valid, even though the <I>bhiksu</I>s who conduct such an 
    ordination commit a minor transgression. The Dharmagupta Vinaya Pitaka 
    source for the ordination of <I>bhiksuni</I>s by <I>bhiksu</I>s alone is the 
    fourth <I>gurudharma</I>, as explained above. This is equivalent to the 
    first <I>gurudharma</I> of the Mulasarvastivada Vinaya. As mentioned by 
    Bhiksu Dao Hai (Taohai), the fourthcentury Vinaya master Gunavarman and the 
    seventhcentury Dharmagupta master TaoHsuan (Taoxuan) agreed that a <I>
    bhiksuni</I> ordination by <I>bhiksu</I>s alone is valid.(32) </P>
    <P>The lineage that began with Ching Chien (Jingjian) was strengthened 
    through the reordination of the <I>bhiksuni</I>s by a dual ordination 
    ceremony conducted in 434 C.E by <I>bhiksuni</I>s from Sri Lanka, together 
    with Chinese <I>bhiksu</I>s, headed by Sanghavarman. This was done to remove 
    the doubts of the nuns who had earlier been ordained by <I>bhiksu</I>s alone 
    and who questioned whether the ordination they had received from <I>bhiksus</I> 
    only was sufficient. The history of how the <I>bhiksuni</I> lineage, 
    starting with Mahaprajapati, was transmitted from India to Sri Lanka by King 
    Asoka.s daughter Sanghamitta, and was then transmitted by Devasara and 
    eleven other <I>bhiksuni</I>s from Sri Lanka to China, is well documented 
    and can be requested from the Board of Sri Lanka Bhikkhuni Order. At 
    present, in East Asia, when a <I>bhiksuni</I> is invited to serve as a <I>
    bhiksuni</I> ordination master, she is not asked whether she was ordained in 
    a single or a dual ordination ceremony. Both types of ordination are 
    considered valid. Thus, there is only one lineage of <I>bhiksuni</I> 
    ordination, not two.</P>

    <P>G. Question: Are Documents Available that Record of the Lineage of the 
    Dharmagupta Bhiksuni Vinaya?</P>
    </B></FONT>
    <P>The <I>bhiksu</I> lineage in China can be documented all the way back to 
    the Buddha. The <I>bhiksuni </I>lineage in China can be documented from the 
    time of Ching Chien (Jingjian), the first Chinese <I>bhiksuni</I>, in 357 
    C.E. The text that documents the <I>bhiksu</I> lineage back to the time of 
    Buddha Sakyamuni is enclosed herewith. The text that documents the <I>
    bhiksuni</I> lineage in China from the time of the first Chinese <I>bhiksuni</I>s 
    up to the present day is also enclosed herewith. Vinaya sources documenting 
    the validity of the Dharmagupta <I>bhiksuni</I> ordination are provided 
    above, including (1) <I>bhiksuni </I>ordination by <I>bhiksu</I>s alone, and 
    (2) <I>bhiksuni</I> ordination by a dual Sangha of <I>bhiksuni</I>s and <I>
    bhiksu</I>s (see pp. 13 of this paper).</P>
    <FONT COLOR="#7f0000"><B>
    <P>H. Question: Are bhikshuni ordination ceremonies as conducted in East 
    Asia done in compliance with instructions set out in the Dharmaguptaka 
    Vinaya?</P>
    </B></FONT>
    <P>1. In the <I>bhiksuni</I> ordination ceremonies that are held in Taiwan, 
    nuns are ordained in groups of three, not in groups of one or two hundred. 
    There are numerous candidates, who are divided into groups of three, just as 
    in the Tibetan tradition, which is why the ordination ceremony takes a long 
    time. The procedure is conducted in accordance with the full <I>bhiksuni</I> 
    ordination rite as given in the Vinaya texts. The newly ordained <I>bhiksuni</I>s 
    are individually informed three by three of the exact time of their 
    ordination, to determine their seniority. To know who is senior to oneself 
    is considered very important in daily life in the Chinese, Korean, 
    Taiwanese, and Vietnamese traditions. <I>Bhiksu</I>s and <I>bhiksuni</I>s 
    are keenly aware of monastic seniority, and stand, walk, and sit according 
    to seniority, as determined by the time of their ordination.</P>
    <P>2. The Sanskrit term <I>pathati</I> (Tib. .<I>don pa</I>, Chin. <I>nien</I>/<I>nian</I>) 
    actually has two meanings: &quot;to read (aloud)&quot; and &quot;to recite (aloud)&quot;. The 
    word may be interpreted in both ways, to recite by heart or to read aloud 
    from a text. In Chinese, . to recite <I>sutra</I>s. is usually . <I>nien 
    ching</I> (<I>nianjing</I>). and, like the Sanskrit, may refer to both . 
    reading aloud (from a text). or . reciting aloud (by heart).. In Tibetan, . 
    to recite the <I>Pratimoksa Sutra</I> is . <I>so sor thar paSi mdo .don pa</I>; 
    in Chinese, <I>sou polo timuchai</I> or <I>sung polotimuchai</I> (both <I>
    sou</I> and <I>sung</I> mean to read aloud). The discrepancy between the 
    practice in early times and today is easy to explain. It is true that, at 
    the time of the Buddha and when the Vinaya texts were compiled, writing was 
    not common in society. Therefore, the texts were transmitted orally, by 
    memory, at that time. In modern Taiwan, it is considered appropriate for the 
    precept master to read certain parts of the ritual aloud during the 
    ordination procedure, although the candidates must learn the rituals by 
    heart and are not allowed to rely on any texts during the rite. They either 
    recite the appropriate sections of the text by heart or repeat them after 
    the master. Learning portions of the texts by heart is an integral part of 
    the preparation of candidates during the thirty or fortyfive days of the 
    Triple Platform Ordination Ceremony. Western candidates for <I>bhiksuni</I> 
    ordination are also asked to learn certain parts of the rite (for example, 
    the questions about the hindrances) by heart.</P>
    <FONT COLOR="#7f0000"><B>
    <P>Conclusion</P>
    </B></FONT>
    <P>It is clear that a living lineage of <I>bhiksuni</I>s exists today, with 
    over 58,000 <I>bhiksuni</I>s in China, Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, and 
    elsewhere. This lineage dates back to Buddha Sakyamuni and the first nun, 
    Mahaprajapati. The lineage was transmitted from India to Sri Lanka by 
    Sanghamitta, and then from Sri Lanka to China by Devasara, where it merged 
    with the already existing lineage of <I>bhiksuni</I>s who had been ordained 
    by <I>bhiksu</I>s only. The lineage then flourished in China and was 
    transmitted from there to Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, and other countries. 
    Although it is true that not every <I>bhiksuni</I> ordination has been 
    performed in a dual ordination procedure, it is an indisputable fact that 
    the Chinese <I>bhiksuni</I> lineage has continued unbroken and flourished 
    until the present day. Therefore, there exists no obstacle to conducting a
    <I>bhiksuni</I> ordination for nuns in the Tibetan tradition.&nbsp; <B>

    <P>Thailand yesterday hosted its first ever ordination ceremony for women, 
    marking a new chapter in Thai Buddhism.</P>
    <P>Mae Chee Varangghana Vanavichayen, 56, became Dhammarakhita Samaneri when 
    she was ordained by her Sri Lankan preceptor Ven Bhikkhuni Saddha Sumana at 
    Wat Songdhamkalayanee, in Nakhon Pathom.</P>
    <P>The ceremony, which was conducted in the Sri Lankan tradition, was 
    presided over by eight Bhikkhuni from Sri Lanka, Taiwan and Indonesia. Two 
    monks from Tibet and six from Thailand also attended the historic event.</P>
    <P>&quot;I used to think that female clergy was a thing of the past,&#39;&#39; said 
    Dhammarakhita, who spent her last nine years as a white-robed nun.</P>
    <P>&quot;But when I learned of the revival of the Bhikkhuni order, I decided to 
    get ordained because I believe it is the right thing to serve Buddhism.&#39;&#39;</P>
    <P>She likened Buddhism to a house. &quot;It must have four supporting pillars to 
    become stable and strong. But now we only have three, namely monks, male and 
    female supporters. Having female monastics will give us the missing 
    pillar,&#39;&#39; said Dhammarakhita, whose name means &quot;one who is protected by 
    dhamma&#39;&#39;.</P>
    <P>Sri Lanka revived female ordinations in the Theravada Buddhism tradition 
    in 1998. Two Thai women have previously sought novice ordination from the 
    Sri Lankan female clergy but both were ordained in Sri Lanka.</P>
    <P>Dhammarakhita&#39;s was the first ever held in Thailand.</P>
    <P>Preceptor Bhikkhuni Saddha Sumana said the ceremony marked the long 
    religious exchange between Thailand and Sri Lanka.</P>
    <P>When Sri Lanka&#39;s clergy disappeared in the 11th century, the Thai clergy 
    sent a delegation of monks to re-establish Theravada Buddhism there. Now 
    that Thailand wants to set up the female clergy, it is Sri Lanka&#39;s turn to 
    help.</P>
    <P>She said the Sri Lankan Bhikkhuni also faced resistance when the order 
    was revived a few years ago, but very little now. &quot;I certainly hope Thailand 
    will support more female ordinations.&#39;&#39; </P>
    <P>At present, white-robed nuns in Thailand are not considered monastics. 
    They also suffer discrimination and lack of support.</P>
    <P>The Thai clergy always insists that it is impossible to set up the female 
    clergy in Thailand because the Bhikkhuni lineage in the Theravada tradition 
    was long extinct.</P>
    <P>They also prohibited Thai monks from ordaining samaneri and bhikkhuni.</P>
    <P>Samaneri Dhammananda, however, said the present female order in the 
    Mahayana tradition is historically dated back to the Theravada Bhikkhuni 
    order in Sri Lanka.</P>
    <P>It was then legitimate for the Mahayana bhikkhuni to help the Sri Lankan 
    sisters revive its female order.</P>
    <P>&quot;In terms of vinaya or discipline, it is the same lineage,&#39;&#39; she said.</P>
    <P>Like her predecessors, Dhammarakhita Samaneri must complete her two-year 
    novicehood before seeking Bhikkhuni ordination in Sri Lanka.</P>
    <P>&quot;I know that there might be resistance,&#39;&#39; she said. &quot;But I am prepared, 
    knowing that I am doing the right thing.&#39;&#39;</P>
    <P>Before her nine years in nunhood, Dhammarakhita worked as a secretary and 
    translator.</P>
    <P>She graduated with a diploma in business from Australia.</P>
    <P>&quot;I quit the worldly life because I want to break the chain of lifetimes 
    by practicing dhamma,&#39;&#39; she said.</P>
    <P>Her two children, she said, were supportive of her decision to live a 
    religious life.</P>
    <P>She also sought a divorce from her husband in order to be eligible for 
    the novice ordination and to join the female clergy.&nbsp; <B>

    <P>When Buddhist scholar Chatsumarn Kabilsingh became a female novice monk, 
    or samaneri, in preparation for full ordination as a bhikkhuni, or female 
    monk, she said she received two main reactions. One was admiration, the 
    other the awkward silence of disapproval.</P>
    <P>Now she must learn to deal with what most pioneers of change cannot 
    avoid-persecution.</P>
    <P>Her TV interviews were banned. Religious affairs officials issued threats 
    that her temple would be in hot water if it was not properly registered or 
    if the temple&#39;s financial accounts were cloudy.</P>
    <P>Ms Chatsumarn, who has now adopted the Buddhist name of Dhammananda, 
    remains calm. And humble. &quot;My mind is firm and clear as to why I want to 
    live a religious life as well as to why women should get ordained,&quot; she 
    said.</P>
    <P>Given the clergy&#39;s patriarchal system, Dhammananda Samaneri knew 
    beforehand that her ordination might make the establishment edgy.</P>
    <P>But should things get rough, she said, her clear conscience, the 
    determination to continue the Lord Buddha&#39;s legacy for women&#39;s 
    spirituality-and the understanding that it is natural for any establishment 
    to be angry with perceived threat-will eventually save her from losing her 
    inner calm.</P>
    <P>Dhammananda Samaneri&#39;s first spiritual test has begun.</P>
    <P>Looked on from the bright side, the TV ban and the threats are nothing 
    compared to what happened in the 1920s. Social critic Narin Klueng had his 
    daughters Sara and Chongdee ordained as novices, but they were immediately 
    arrested, defrocked and temporarily jailed.</P>
    <P>Backed by a sensational media, the incensed clergy then declared female 
    ordination illegal. That&#39;s why Thai women who want to live a religious life 
    have no choice but to become the head-shaven, white-robed mae chi despite 
    the low social status, the lack of legal recognition for nunhood and zero 
    support.</P>
    <P>Next, the clergy has begun using the Vinaya to back its opposition to 
    bhikkhuni ordination.</P>
    <P>The Vinaya demands dual ordination for bhikkhunis. Since the bhikkhuni 
    lineage in the Theravada tradition disappeared long ago, they argue that it 
    is simply impossible to ordain women as female monks, ever again.</P>
    <P>The clergy also often dish out the patronising consolation to women that, 
    ordination or not, women still can pursue spiritual development. It does not 
    occur to them that if ordination is indeed unnecessary, why do men need to 
    become monks?The clergy&#39;s other strategy is to make women feel bad about 
    their religious rights. By portraying women who want to become bhikkhunis as 
    greedy for status and recognition-a sign of spiritual unreadiness-many nuns 
    remain silent about their wishes.</P>
    <P>Unlike Ms Sara and Ms Chongdee, who were defrocked, Dhammananda Samaneri 
    has many things going for her. The media is largely positive. Although the 
    army-run TV Channel 5 has banned her, Channel 11 and UBC 8 have invited her 
    for TV interviews.</P>
    <P>Also, female ordination is no longer a taboo subject, thanks to the 
    strong women&#39;s movement worldwide. And the clergy has lost much of its 
    credibility due to laxity and endless scandals. This is probably why many 
    monks have dared to voice their public support for female ordination, 
    something unimaginable just a decade ago.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Thai clergy&#39;s demand for bhikkhunis&#39; dual ordination is 
    wearing thin; the Buddha permitted the removal of minor monastic rules 
    should they prove cumbersome for the bhikkhu and bhikkhuni Sanghas.</P>
    <P>So if the clergy&#39;s insistence on the rule of dual ordination for 
    bhikkhunis has robbed women of their spiritual path as well as their 
    opportunity to help one another practise dhamma better in a female Sangha, 
    the solution is simple: These rules must go.&nbsp; <B><A HREF="#top">[^] </A>

    <P>&#39;Have all the Buddhas come into being for men&#39;s benefit alone? Definitely 
    not. They also are for the benefit of women. The path of liberation is open 
    to both men and women.&quot;So said the Lord Buddha over 2,500 years ago when he 
    set up the Bhikkhuni order to allow women equal opportunity for spiritual 
    practices.</P>
    <P>The Buddha also cautioned that the health of Buddhism depended on the 
    existence and strength of four pillars: bhikkhu (monks), bhikkhuni (female 
    monks), upasaka (male lay devotees), and upasika (female lay devotees).</P>
    <P>No wonder the Thai Sangha is in deep crisis. Apart from the monks&#39; laxity 
    and devotees&#39; negligence, one of the causes of the Sangha decline is its 
    discrimination against women.</P>
    <P>Although temples depend primarily on Thai women for alms and donations, 
    the clergy&#39;s patriarchal system has been hostile to women&#39;s quest for 
    spiritual lives. Forget about the Bhikkhuni order; the clergy is determined 
    not to let it see the light of day. Meanwhile, most white-robed, head-shaven 
    &quot;mae chi&quot;, or nuns, are kept down as temple servants with no legal status as 
    religious persons. They also suffer low social status and stereotyping as 
    broken-hearted women or as fleeing something.</P>
    <P>For women who need serious religious practice, they have very few temples 
    to which they can turn. Most go to nunneries which, like the nuns 
    themselves, must struggle to pursue a religious life without any state or 
    cleric support.</P>
    <P>This is the clergy&#39;s standard argument against Bhikkhuni ordination: 
    Female monks must be ordained by both the Bhikkhu and Bhikhuni orders 
    according to the Vinaya, or Buddhist discipline. Since the Theravada 
    Bhikkhuni lineage became extinct more than 1,000 years ago, it&#39;s just not 
    possible to ordain female monks. End of story.</P>
    <P>Last month, a prominent Thai Buddhist scholar, Chartsumarn Kabilsingh, 
    did what more women will soon do; when she could not get any sympathy from 
    the Thai Sangha, she turned elsewhere. She was ordained by the Sri Lankan 
    clergy as a novice and adopted a new religious name, Dhammananda. When the 
    two preparatory years as a novice are completed, she will be ordained as a 
    Theravada bhikkhuni.</P>
    <P>Although Thai law allows only two sects in Theravada Buddhism, it&#39;s 
    unlikely that the clergy will dare outlaw female monks ordained in Sri 
    Lankan Theravada Buddhism given their close historical ties.</P>
    <P>In the 18th century, when Buddhism in Sri Lanka was in decay and there 
    were not even monks to perform ordinations, Siam sent a delegation of monks 
    to ordain and continue the Theravada lineage there. Hence its name, 
    Siyamnikaya.</P>
    <P>Now that Sri Lanka has restored the Bhikkhuni order, it is Thailand&#39;s 
    turn to seek help.</P>
    <P>Reformist monks and scholars in Sri Lanka argue that the Theravada 
    Bhikkhuni lineage has not been broken. Although the Bhikkhuni order now 
    remains only in the Mahayana tradition in East Asian countries, it actually 
    originated from Theravada Buddhism when female monks from Sri Lanka 
    travelled to China to establish the Bhikkhuni order there in the 5th 
    century. Given the same origins, Mahayana bhikkhunis then can help ordain 
    and revive the Bhikkhuni order in the Theravada tradition, they said.</P>
    <P>The Vinaya requires the presence of at least five bhikkhunis and five 
    bhikkhus to ordain female monks. We now need only four women to follow in 
    Dhammananda Bhikkhuni&#39;s footsteps-and five Thai monks who have the courage 
    to go against the elders-to see the birth of the Bhikkhuni order in 
    Thailand.</P>
    <P>If the feudal Thai clergy refuses to wake up to women&#39;s rightful position 
    in the religious realm, it soon will become irrelevant&nbsp; <B>
