      are so many other things we could be doing rather than listening to a talk 
      about Buddhism and God, so many important things in our lives which are 
      crucial to our material well-being. However, anyone who has taken the 
      trouble to come here this evening will appreciate that there is something 
      more important than our material well-being - and that is the spiritual 
      aspect of life.</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We have to devote a 
      great deal of time and energy, both physical and mental, to obtaining 
      comfortable living conditions and creating a safe and pleasant environment 
      for ourselves and our families. But is that all there is to life? There is 
      something else which is at least equally as important as the material 
      aspect of life, which is the spiritual side.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Unfortunately, Australian society is 
      traditionally not very interested in religion. In one sense this is 
      unfortunate. In another sense, it is fortunate that our culture is rather 
      disinterested in religion, because this means there are not such strong 
      fanatical tendencies. In fact Australian society is probably one of the 
      most free, open and fair societies as far as the practice, study and 
      choice of religious paths in concerned. It would be very difficult to find 
      another society that offers such a degree of freedom and fairness.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">People quite often ask me whether, being a 
      Buddhist monk, I have encountered any discrimination in coming to 
      Australia. The answer is no, none at all, it's a very fair society. I only 
      wish that other societies, other cultures, other countries, and other 
      religions in this world were as free and as fair as here in Australia. 
      That is the good side of a society that has not made religion into an 
      obsession.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But, of course, the unavoidable 
      consequence is that Australian society is very wishy-washy when it comes 
      to religion. Religion is not a major concern in people's lives. 
      Nevertheless, these days there are growing numbers of people who are 
      beginning to realise the need for something other than material comforts, 
      a spiritual need. You could say it is a religious need, or a need of the 
      heart. It is something other than just striving to get enough to eat, a 
      place to live, money, a car and success. There is a need for something 
      more than that, and that is a religious or spiritual need.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Talking about the spiritual or religious 
      side of life, we encounter a tremendous variety of beliefs, and every 
      belief system has its own vocabulary. A large proportion of our population 
      has been brought up and conditioned by the terminology, attitudes, values, 
      assumptions and beliefs that are prevalent in this particular culture. 
      This doesn't necessarily mean that people will believe them or follow them 
      completely, but they cannot escape the fact that it is part of their 
      make-up or their conditioning. It considerably affects the assumptions 
      they make about life, the world, existence, the future, birth and death.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So much that is part of our culture comes 
      from religious beliefs. For those who have been brought up in a culture 
      that is not Christian, such as Muslim, Hindu or Buddhist, the conditioning 
      is very different. The terminology, assumptions, beliefs and attitudes 
      towards life, death, the future and our existence are very different. This 
      is why a lot of confusion arises when different belief systems or 
      religions come into contact.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">People from a theistic background coming 
      into contact with Buddhism inevitably ask if Buddhists believe in God. 
      This arises because for them religion is always equated with God. For 
      them, God is religion, you cannot separate the two. If you are going to 
      talk about religion then you must talk about God. To find out whether a 
      Buddhist is a religious person, the first thing asked is, &quot;Do you believe 
      in God?&quot; If you say yes, you are obviously all right, you are a religious 
      person. If you say no, then you aren't a religious person.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But for those who have received their 
      conditioning from a Buddhist culture, that question is a strange one. It 
      really has nothing to do with religion. It is an irrelevant question which 
      leads to a lot of misunderstandings. A lot of assumptions are made without 
      careful consideration or understanding of what we are talking about.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">Where does God fit in?</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I chose this topic because I think it is 
      of interest in our situation, where Buddhist people are living amongst a 
      predominantly theistic culture, mainly Christian, and as such often 
      encounter such questions regarding God. People new to Buddhism and taking 
      up many of its practices are often perplexed or unresolved as to where God 
      fits into the picture - not that they necessarily //want// God to fit in, 
      but due to their past conditioning they can't help wondering about God's 
      relation to all this.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I shall endeavour to talk around this 
      topic, sharing some ideas, reflections and personal appreciation, rather 
      than giving a lecture. It may be helpful to you; you don't have to believe 
      it, you don't have to take it as the word of authority, or as Buddhist 
      dogma. You should consider wisely, reflect on it and use your capacity to 
      contemplate and reason clearly; not only to contemplate and question what 
      I say, but to question your own thoughts, assumptions and beliefs on the 
      subject.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is not good to believe others too 
      easily, but neither is it good to believe yourself too easily. You are no 
      more trustworthy than others, in the sense that much of our thinking is 
      conditioned, biased and contained within fixed limitations. If we stay 
      within that limited view, in that limited belief system and its 
      assumptions, we are going to remain trapped and we will be unable to grow.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There is a fine line between being 
      gullible and being hidebound. That fine line is the point of sincerity, 
      the desire to understand, the humility to admit that one may not be right, 
      that one may not know. It is the sincerity and openness to contemplate and 
      see things from different angles, to try to understand and trust in the 
      human ability to consider things carefully. Dare to question, be open, be 
      willing to listen; question and consider.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The first thing to question is the very 
      word &quot;God&quot; - it's a strange word, because as soon as you say the word 
      'God' something comes into your mind. What it is depends on what kind of 
      conditioning you have received through a lifetime of association with a 
      culture and a belief system. The word 'God' has an immediate emotive 
      effect, certain assumptions arise in the mind. That is the first problem 
      with the word, because your mind is already closed.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is important for us to contemplate this 
      word 'God'. What is God? What do we mean by this word 'God', by 'belief in 
      God'? If you are going to believe something you first have to know what it 
      is. If you ask me whether I believe in God, my response is to ask, &quot;What 
      do you mean by God?&quot; Tell me what you mean by the word, and then I can 
      tell you whether I believe it or not.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is where it becomes so interesting, 
      because as soon as we say that everybody gives a different answer - and I 
      mean everybody. They may agree on some generalizations if they are from 
      the same cultural heritage, but when you look closely there will be many 
      disagreements on the details. If we went around the world asking five 
      billion people, &quot;What do you mean by God?&quot; we would get a billion 
      different answers.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Now what does that indicate? I suggest 
      that it indicates a very fundamental, recurring situation. The God that we 
      are talking about is created by the individual who talks about it. That is 
      why each individual talks about it in a slightly different way. What they 
      are describing is actually the God they are creating in their own minds. 
      That is all that they can describe. You may think that if you talk about 
      God to Christians they will all have the same idea of God, but there will 
      be many discrepancies in their descriptions of God.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">Man creates God</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I heard a story which I can't really 
      believe is true, although I guess by repeating it I'm giving it some 
      validity. The story comes from a Buddhist monk who was very outspoken 
      about Christianity, because he had once been a very staunch Catholic, but 
      had renounced Catholicism. You tend to get very 'anti' when you renounce 
      something, like getting divorced. This monk went to a meeting where there 
      were Christians from different parts of the world, all talking about God. 
      There was a European who said, &quot;God is a white man;&quot; there was an Asian 
      who said, &quot;God is an Asian;&quot; there was a black man who said, &quot;God is a 
      black man;&quot; and there was a woman who said, &quot;God is a woman.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Even if this story isn't true, it's not 
      very different from the way people talk about God. Note how much of 
      theology today is based on God being a man, and European of course, 
      because most of that theology was developed within the Roman Empire and 
      was therefore European based. Of course today that is being challenged. 
      Perhaps 'God the Mother' is the right terminology.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Ridiculous though this story may be, it 
      serves to illustrate the idea that people create God in their own image. 
      Different people describe God in different ways. They tend to create God 
      in their own minds - in other words they conceive God in their minds. And 
      they can only create God in their own minds, in their own image, because 
      all that they can create is the thoughts and images that they conceive. 
      That is why we can recognise every description of God that we encounter. 
      Have you ever noticed that? If I can recognise it, it means that it is 
      something familiar to me, something very similar to me. I can relate to 
      every aspect that is described, because it is something that has been 
      created by the human mind.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Now contemplate this in terms of the 
      history of human religion, going back to its most primitive forms. What 
      sort of gods were created and worshipped? They were rough, coarse, 
      primitive - war gods, power gods, nature gods. The more fierce and warlike 
      the tribe and culture, the more fierce and warlike the gods. As culture 
      and society became more civilised, more emphasis began to be placed on 
      other attributes, such as compassion, kindness and love. Consequently the 
      form and description of the gods changed. Such is the progression of the 
      descriptions of God that have been worshipped by people through the ages.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is evident even in a single religion, 
      such as Christianity. If we look at the Bible carefully we can see an 
      evolution in the form God takes, from a very fierce, warlike God to a more 
      loving, compassionate God. I'm not saying that God changes, but the 
      attributes that are described and attributed to him as represented in 
      these books do change. What that means is that the people, the culture and 
      the society are changing. They are changing in their psychology, toward an 
      appreciation of more humane, more refined qualities. As they learn to 
      appreciate these qualities and respect them, they then attribute them to 
      God.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">You can recognise these attributes in 
      yourself. Whether it is love, hatred, jealousy, fire and brimstone or 
      universal compassion, you can always recognise them. That's the sort of 
      thing that goes on in the human mind to one degree or another.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Most of the primitive or older societies 
      talked about God singular, one God as we have in the Christian, Muslim and 
      Jewish faiths. But when the descriptions in these different religions are 
      compared there is some disagreement.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Generally the concept of God is as the 
      creator who rewards and punishes, and it is a personal God. It is very 
      hard for people to stop thinking about God as an entity with which they 
      have some form of personal relationship, as a God who rewards and 
      punishes.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">The Buddhist view</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Buddhism, however, has very different 
      ideas on this matter. Buddhism grew out of a culture which certainly 
      believed in gods, many levels of gods, called //devas//. There was also 
      the highest level of gods, the //Brahma// gods, and Maha Brahma, the 
      highest God. That was the Brahman belief system. There were many gods, and 
      Maha Brahma was the great God, the creator, the destroyer and the 
      punisher. Buddha made it very clear that he rejected this.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Although you should not jump to any 
      conclusion here, clearly a Buddhist can say at this point that Buddhism 
      does not believe in a creator God, an all-powerful being that punishes and 
      rewards. Buddhism simply does not teach this. The Buddha did not believe 
      this, he did not teach it. It's an interesting statement because it seems 
      so final. People will say that Buddhism is not a religion, it's just a 
      philosophy, a way of life. Many people like to present it that way. 
      Buddhist philosophy as a good way of life.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But that is a very inaccurate and 
      incomplete description of Buddhism. Why? The Buddha once made a very 
      interesting statement concerning the motivation that led him to leave his 
      home at the age of twenty-nine, in the midst of wealth, prosperity and 
      good health. He said:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Why, being myself subject to birth, 
      aging, sickness, death, sorrow and defilement, do I seek after that which 
      is also subject to these things? Suppose, being myself subject to these 
      things, seeing the danger in them, I were to seek after the unborn, 
      unaging, unailing, deathless, sorrowless, undefiled, supreme freedom from 
      bondage, Nibbana?&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">That is a very interesting statement from 
      someone who says he doesn't believe in God. He didn't mention God, he 
      didn't say, &quot;I want to unite with Great Brahma eternally.&quot; But there is 
      something very important in his statement that is obviously not concerned 
      with material well-being, with comfort, with a nice philosophy about how 
      to live with family and offspring or how to govern a country or make a 
      decent living. He didn't say anything about that, but simply asked why he, 
      being mortal, being subject to old age, sickness and death, should use his 
      life to seek wealth, health, knowledge, position, power and family? Why 
      should he use this life for these things? Instead, he decided to strive to 
      realise the unconditioned, the unoriginated, the deathless, that which is 
      free from mortality.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This was the Buddha's motivation for 
      leaving home and striving for something other than just a material goal in 
      life or a philosophical idea or a different way of life. He had a definite 
      goal. It was a spiritual goal, a religious goal, because, by definition, 
      religion means that which binds to the highest, that which takes you to 
      the highest. This was a tremendous spiritual quest. His realisation was a 
      spiritual realisation because his Enlightenment was the very attainment of 
      the unborn, the uncreated, the unoriginated, the complete freedom from 
      mortality and bondage.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What, then, do we make of this teaching? 
      What do we make of this teacher who is obviously after something 
      spiritual, who claimed to have attained and realised something spiritual, 
      but who has nothing to do with God, and does not accept the idea of a 
      creator God who rewards and punishes? He mentions gods, many kinds of 
      them. In much the same way as the Hindu tradition, and to some extent as 
      in the Islamic tradition which says there are many levels of heaven: 
      depending on your level of merit, the closer you get to God. This is very 
      similar to the Buddhist cosmology, where, according to accumulated merit, 
      people are reborn into various heavenly realms. These realms increase in 
      refinement up to the Brahma realm - not just one, but many.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha did talk about gods, heavens, 
      hells and beings in all three realms in his teaching, but with one 
      important distinction: all these gods are mortal, all these realms are 
      mortal. Mortal means that which is born and dies. Every being, in whatever 
      shape or form, is subject to the process of birth and death. Every being 
      in every realm, be it god, //deva//, hell-being, animal or human being, is 
      born and dies, all are mortal.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">However that doesn't seem to fit the 
      description of what people mean when they use the word 'God'. If you 
      inform a Christian or a Muslim that God is born and dies they will not be 
      very happy about that. That's not what Christians are referring to when 
      they talk about God, not gods, //devas//, or spirits. They're referring to 
      something different, something that isn't born and doesn't die.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In Buddhism, all gods, //devas// and 
      spirits are mortal. Some of the Brahma gods can become quite conceited and 
      arrogant. There are many stories in the Buddhist texts where the Buddha 
      used his psychic powers to confront these Brahma gods. In the scriptures, 
      the Brahma god is portrayed as very arrogant and conceited, calling 
      himself the All-Powerful, All-Knowing Creator. It's very easy to be 
      arrogant when you are powerful, because power corrupts, but it always has 
      its limits. These Brahma gods, too, eventually find their limits. They, 
      too, pass away and are reborn in other realms. This is rather abstract and 
      is obviously not what we mean in the English vocabulary by the word 'God', 
      certainly not what is meant from the Christian or Muslim point of view.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">And it's not what the Buddha aimed at when 
      he left home. He didn't aim at the Brahma realm and becoming the 
      all-knowing, the all-powerful, the creator, the destroyer or even at going 
      to live in the Brahma realm. He strove for the unborn, the unoriginated, 
      the uncreated, the deathless.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What is it that he strove for and 
      attained, this ultimate goal? Was it God or the Buddhist equivalent of 
      God? I would never say that, in view of the statement I made at the 
      beginning of this talk, because as soon as you say 'God', people start 
      getting ideas in their heads, and that is already far from the unborn, the 
      unconditioned, the uncreated, the unoriginated, the deathless.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">All these words - the unborn, the 
      unconditioned, the uncreated, the unoriginated, the deathless - tell you 
      nothing. What comes into your mind? Nothing? Very good, you are getting a 
      bit closer to it. This is very important, because until people understand 
      this there will never be any understanding between religions.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">False Idols</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There will never be any true 
      inter-religious dialogues until people appreciate that the false idols are 
      not statues. No one would worship a statue as God or Buddha. Those statues 
      represent something. They are symbols, just like a photograph of your 
      mother: you don't stand on it, you put it up on the wall. You may even put 
      some flowers in front of it. That's what a statue is. Not many people are 
      inclined to attach to, or worship, idols of that nature.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But the tendency of human beings, even 
      intelligent human beings, to worship and believe in the idols they create 
      in their own minds is very common. They cannot see that they are idols, 
      false idols, that these beliefs are not the truth, or anything near the 
      truth. It is their own creations of God which they worship, and that is 
      why they will never reach the truth. What we think is what blocks us off 
      from the truth. Thoughts, images, concepts - these are all barriers, 
      obstacles to realising the unborn, the uncreated, the unconditioned. This 
      is because by its very nature the unborn is beyond thought. Thought cannot 
      reach it because thought is always creation. Thought is in creation, it is 
      limited and dualistic.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">To that which Buddhism calls the highest, 
      I would not put the label 'God', because the word 'God' is misinterpreted. 
      One Christian monk defined God in a way which I find acceptable. He said, 
      &quot;God is the nothing that supports everything&quot; - that's a very good 
      definition and quite useable. But how many people would be prepared to 
      accept that? You can't make head or tail of it anyway. Just like the 
      unborn, the uncreated, the unoriginated - you can't make anything of that 
      either. That's why it is so good; you're not supposed to be able to make 
      something of it. If you make something of it you are creating something 
      which is not real, you are creating God.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We should stop creating God and realise 
      the truth - that which is beyond creation. The Buddha made this wonderful 
      statement:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;There is, monks, an unborn, uncreated, an 
      unconditioned. Here, monks, I say there is no coming, no going, no 
      standing, no ceasing, no beginning. Not fixed, not movable, it has no 
      support. Just this is the end of suffering.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It's a very powerful statement, a very 
      wonderful statement, a penetrating view of reality. Note that it is 
      negative: negating all creation, negating all that is individual, negating 
      all the characteristics that isolate, such as concepts of an individual, 
      concepts that are dualistic, limited, mortal. It is pure negation, 
      sweeping away everything. That is what the unconditioned is - when you 
      sweep away all conditions.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What sort of debate would it be, to ask is 
      God a man or a woman? In the lower realms there are said to be both male 
      and female gods, but even in the Brahma realms there are no longer male 
      and female, because those beings are without bodies; they are radiant 
      beings of pure consciousness. So how can the Ultimate be male or female? 
      People can't give up the idea of a personal relationship with God the 
      father: &quot;Ask, and He will give; He will look after you and He will punish 
      you.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is incompatible with the unborn, the 
      unoriginated, the unconditioned, the deathless. There is no personal 
      relationship with this. It has nothing to do with rewarding and punishing, 
      having a chosen people, punishing non-chosen people. This is the unborn, 
      uncreated, unconditioned - that's all. Just realising it is freedom from 
      all bondage, from all rounds of mortality, from all limitations.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So what about all this punishment and 
      reward? Is Buddhism somehow lacking? No, because the Buddha pointed to 
      very fundamental truths. Everything that comes into existence, which is 
      the whole round of mortality, exists according to laws. These fundamental 
      laws have nothing to do with reward and punishment. There's no one there 
      to reward, no one there to punish.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">These laws of nature can be expressed very 
      simply in a broader sense, as the Law of Dependent Origination 
      (//Paticcasamuppada//), like this:</FONT></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When this is, that is;|<BR>
        When this arises, that arises;<BR>
        When this is not, that is not;<BR>
        When this ceases, that ceases.</FONT></I></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is a very simple little formula, 
      meaning that everything that comes into being does so dependent on 
      conditions. When the conditions are there, the result is there. That 
      result in turn becomes a condition for other results. It is a pure 
      relationship of cause and effect, not linear, but multi-faceted. It is a 
      fundamental and all-inclusive law, a self-contained system.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This leads to the next question: &quot;Who made 
      that law?&quot; This is where Buddhism is radically different. What is the 
      beginning? Who created things? These questions are based on certain 
      assumptions. As soon as you say, &quot;Who created?&quot; something outside is 
      implied, but in Buddhism we say mortality is a self-contained system. No 
      beginning can be seen. Of course, that's not very satisfactory. If you 
      say, 'This part is the beginning&quot;, you have to say what is before that 
      point. It is like asking, &quot;What is the smallest number?&quot; It depends on 
      which school you went to. A child in Grade One might say number one; a PhD 
      might say something else. Whatever you say it can be cut back further, 
      unless you say zero, and that's not a number. Where is the smallest 
      number? Nowhere. Where is the beginning? Nowhere. The system doesn't have 
      a beginning. It's the wrong way of looking at it. Buddhism says there is 
      no beginning, no creator, because as soon as you say there is a beginning, 
      the question arises, who created it? Who created the creator? You just go 
      round in circles.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is a self-contained system. 
      Everything in this system follows the law of nature, all results depend on 
      conditions. Why does it rain today? &quot;God made it rain.&quot; This is very 
      simplistic. It rained because the conditions were right for it to rain. 
      Not many people today say &quot;God made it rain.&quot; It depends on certain 
      conditions. Is it a reward or a punishment? It depends on how you view it. 
      This is a law that operates at all levels, physical, mental, emotional and 
      spiritual.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In is a more personal and spiritual sense, 
      Buddhism talks about the Law of //Kamma//, which is a more specific 
      application of this wider, all-inclusive Law of Dependent Origination. The 
      Law of //Kamma// states that through the doing of certain volitional 
      actions, certain results will come about. Good actions bring good results, 
      bad actions bring bad results. This is not punishment, just natural 
      results. The idea of God the rewarder or punisher is replaced by the law 
      of nature. It is impersonal, it has no bias and makes deals with no one. 
      There are no favorites, the Law is very neutral and very fair. All people 
      who develop goodness, regardless of their religion, go to heaven through 
      the power of that goodness. When that power of goodness fades away they 
      die and are reborn somewhere else. Goodness and evil have their own 
      rewards according to the laws of nature. These laws are fundamental, they 
      are the basis of nature.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is the Buddhist explanation of that 
      which is normally attributed to God. The role of punishing, rewarding, 
      creating and destroying is all taken over by the laws of nature. The idea 
      of God as something ultimate, which is the idea behind all religion, is 
      now presented in this very enlightenment, absolutely free from any 
      limitation or blemish of mortality, as the unborn, the unoriginated, the 
      uncreated, the deathless.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It's a wonderful way of putting it if you 
      can open your mind to it. Then you see how it frees you from so many 
      illogical, unsustainable conflicts that arise from the usual way of 
      thinking about God.</FONT></P>
