    <hr width="25%">
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"></font>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What is Buddhism, is it a
    philosophy a religion or an ethical system? Strictly speaking
    it is not a philosophy, for it does not contain an elaborate
    system of theories and facts exclusively for cognition,
    although it must be admitted that the Buddha has anticipated
    much modern speculation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What is known as Buddhism consists
    of three aspects, the Doctrinal (pariyatti), the Practical
    (pattipatti), and the Realisable (pativedha) which are
    interdependent and interrelated. This doctrine is preserved
    in the Tripitaka. This Tripitaka, which contains the word of
    the Buddha, is estimated to be about eleven times the size of
    the Christian Bible. As the word itself implies, the
    Tripitaka consists of three baskets, namely: the Basket of
    Discipline (Vinaya Pitaka), the Basket of Discourses (Sutta
    Pitaka) and the Basket of Ultimate Things (Abhidamma Pitaka).
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Vinaya Pitaka, which is
    sub-divided into five books. deals with the rules and
    regulations of the Order of monks and nuns and gives a
    detailed account of the life and ministry of the Buddha. The
    Sutta Pitaka consists of discourses preached by the Buddha,
    and also in some instances, by his foremost disciples such as
    the Venerable Sariputta, Moggallana and Ananda. Divided into
    twenty-six books it is rather like a collection of
    prescriptions, for the discourses were propounded to suit the
    occasion and the temperament of different individuals. The
    Abhidhamma Pitaka, however, is the most important and the
    most interesting because it elaborates the four ultimate
    things i.e., consciousness (citta), mental properties mental
    concomitants, (cetasika), matter or material qualities (rupa)
    and Nibbana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So we see that Buddhism is
    concerned with truth and facts, and has nothing to do with
    theories and philosophies which may be accepted as gospel
    truth today and be thrown overboard tomorrow. The Buddha
    presented us with no new astounding philosophical theories,
    nor did he venture to create any new material science, rather
    he explain what is within and without so far as it concerns
    our emancipation, and ultimately he laid out a path of
    deliverance that is unique. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Is it then a religion? Neither is
    it a religion in the sense in which the word is commonly
    understood, for it is not a system of faith or worship.
    Buddhism does not demand blind faith from its adherents; mere
    belief is dethroned and replaced by confidence, Saddha, as it
    is known in Pali, based on knowledge of truth. The confidence
    placed by a follower in the Buddha is like a sick man towards
    the physician, or that of a student towards his teacher. A
    Buddhist seeks refuge in the Buddha because it is he who
    discovered the path of deliverance. A sick man should use the
    remedy the pupil should study what his teacher says in order
    to become learned. In just the same way, a Buddhist who
    possesses saddha follows the Buddha's instructions in order
    to gain deliverance. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Is Buddhism then, an ethical
    system? It no doubt contains an excellent code of morals that
    is adaptable to all climes and ages, but it is much more than
    ordinary morality. The Singala Sutta (Sigalovada Sutta),
    Mangala Sutta, Metta Sutta, Vasala Sutta, Dhammika Sutta
    etc., should be read carefully to understand the high
    standard of morality; but morality, or sila, is only the
    A.B.C. of Buddhism. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism, therefore is neither a
    philosophy nor a religion, nor an ordinary ethical code, it
    is the doctrine of actuality, a means of deliverance; or, as
    it is called in Pali, the Dhamma. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The right-minded person concerns
    him or herself with the act, and not with the consequences;
    he considers not what is pleasant or unpleasant, but what is
    good and right according to the rules of morality. When he
    does right, and does not seek any result, he is relived of
    all the burden of doubt, fear and perplexity, he never
    becomes involved in the inextricable tangle of difficulty.
    His mind is at peace, his conscience is serene; these are the
    requisites for health, happiness and long life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are two kinds of emotions.
    negative or destructive, and positive and constructive. Take
    as an illustration two persons who meet financial disaster.
    One reacts emotionally and falls into a stormy sea of
    bitterness, loses all hope and sinks in health, vigour and
    resolution, or he kills himself to end it all. The otther
    man, who has learnt to think over the problems of life, to
    meditate, to rationalise applies every available method to
    overcome the problem and finds a satisfactory solution, for
    he has exercised his mind just as the athlete exercises his
    muscles. He is the master, while the other is a slave. Many
    disappointments and breakdowns would not exist if people were
    to live according to the Dhamma. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So you see, Buddhism is a
    philosophy of hope and certainty of achievement. It is the
    gospel of attainment of deliverance from unhappiness and
    suffering. The Buddha explained that in every mortal, however
    humble or lowly he may be, there is a grain of worth, a
    little of goodness, a spark of wisdom that can be kindled
    into a flame, which can be developed by conscious human
    effort. The Buddha encouraged everyone to strive for
    spiritual development, declaring that every right effort is
    sure of a reward here and now, in this life, or in a future
    one. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha also proclaimed that
    every low desire, every longing for ignoble things, every
    unworthy feeling that we conquer and every difficulty that we
    meet heroically and victoriously, which righteously according
    to the rules of morality, becomes another rung on the ladder
    by which we can climb to a nobler, higher life. This is the
    law of progressive development, the Buddhist doctrine of
    evolution, of attainment, of accomplishment </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha drew for us the picture
    of progressive existence, a growth from small to great, from
    less to more, from ignorance to knowledge, of development
    depending on inward strength, diligence put forth from life
    to life. This is the doctrine of human perfection won through
    altruism, discipline and wisdom. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The name of the founder of Buddhism
    was Gotama, this being the name of the clan or family to
    which he belonged. The word Buddha means 'awakened' or
    'enlightened' one, and is not a name but a title of honour
    bestowed upon the sage Gotama. Gotama was born the son of an
    Indian king on what is now the boarder of modern Nepal six
    hundred and twenty- three years before Christ. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dhamma, this law of righteousness,
    exists not only in a man's heart and mind, but it exist in
    the universe also; all the universe is an embodiment or
    revelation of Dhamma. The laws of nature and the mind of man.
    If a man lives by Dhamma, he will escape and come into
    Nibbana, the final release from suffering. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to Buddhism the universe
    evolved, but it did not evolve out of nothingness, it evolved
    out of the dispersed matter of a previous universe; and when
    this universe is dissolved. its dispersed matter, or its
    residual energy which is continually renewing itself, will in
    time give rise to another universe in the same way. The
    process is therefore cyclic and continuous, and the universe
    itself is composed of millions of world systems, each with
    its various planes of existence. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">That which we call 'man' is
    composed of mind and matter. According to Buddhism, apart
    from <strong>mind</strong> and <strong>matter</strong> (nama
    and rupa) which constitutes the so called man, there is no
    such thing as an immortal soul, (atta) which lies behind
    them. Matter (rupa) is the invisible qualities and forces,
    and there are altogether twenty-eighty types of material
    qualities which constitute the physical body of an animate
    being. Mind (nama) is the most important part of a being, and
    consists of the four mental aggregates, namely: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">- Feeling, of whatever kind
        (Vedana); <br>
        - Perception, of sense objects, or reaction to the senses
        (Sanna); <br>
        - Mental Properties -fifty types of mental formations
        including good and evil tendencies and faculties
        (Sankhara); <br>
        - Consciousness, which is the fundamental factor of all
        the other three (Vinnana). </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism teaches that with the
    practice of meditation and mind culture one can acquire the
    Insight Kowledges and thus attain Nibbana in this life
    itself. Through this enlightenment and wisdom, one can reach
    the end of this chains of rebirths. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nibbana is not annihilation,
    neither is it kind of nothingness, it is state free from any
    possibility of the re-arising of the conditioned existence,
    the ultimate peace and happiness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All the teachings of the Buddha can
    be summed up in one verse: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><i>To refrain from all
        evil <br>
        To do what is good <br>
        To cultivate the mind <br>
        This is the teaching of the Buddha.</i></strong><strong> </strong></font></p>
