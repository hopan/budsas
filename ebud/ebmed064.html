  <p align="center"><em><font face="Times New Roman">A Dhamma talk given by Mr&nbsp; S.N.
  Goenka in Singapore</font></em></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">M</font><font face="Times New Roman">ost
  Venerable Bhante Dhamma-Ratanaji, devotees and admirers of Lord Buddha, </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You are all assembled here this evening to understand the
  universality of the teaching of the Buddha. A Buddha always teaches Dhamma, nothing else
  but Dhamma. And Dhamma means truth, nature, the law of nature, which is universal. Dhamma
  can never be sectarian; it is the universal law of nature. There were many at the time of
  the Buddha, contemporaries of the Buddha, and there were many before Gotama Buddha who
  tried to teach the same thing, but they were not successful. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I come from a family, from a tradition, of very staunch
  conservative Hindus, and because I come from that tradition, I know the background of
  Indian spirituality, I know the teachings. When I went to my teacher for the first time to
  take a Vipassana course, nothing seemed new to me. Buddha taught sila (morality), and the
  conservative Hindus, and also the Jain tradition of India, give importance to sila. Buddha
  taught samadhi, mastery over the mind, and I found that this was there also. Every
  tradition teaches how to control the mind, how to develop mastery over the mind. Buddha
  teaches panna, wisdom; and it seemed that that also was not new to me. In the tradition
  from which I come, one has to work to purify the mind - to come out of raga, i.e. craving;
  to come out of dosa, i.e. aversion; to come out of moha, i.e. ignorance. Nothing was new,
  and yet everything was new. Every step that I took was wonderful. And why? Let me explain
  why. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Like many teachers of different religions Buddha also
  taught about sila, the five precepts, the panca sila, and like others he explains to
  people, in different ways, why they should observe sila. You should not kill. Why should
  you not kill? If somebody comes and kills you, you certainly don't like it. Therefore when
  you try to kill somebody, that person won't like it. What you don't like, others don't
  like. So refrain from actions which, if performed by others towards you, you won't like.
  You should not do something which will hurt or harm others. Therefore don't kill.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If somebody steals something belonging to you which is
  very dear to you, you won't like it. Certainly you don't like it. Therefore don't take
  something belonging to somebody else, which is dear to that person. You don't steal it
  because you don't like that to be done to you. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If someone commits rape or adultery with a member of your
  family, you don't like it. So you should not do something like that. Somebody speaks lies
  and deceives you. You don't like it. Therefore you should not do a thing like this which
  others won't like. You may agree to these four precepts-&quot;Yes, I understand I should
  not kill. I should not steal. I should not commit sexual misconduct. I should not speak
  lies and yet when you get intoxicated you might commit all these four. You are helpless.
  You are a slave of the intoxicant. You are not the master of yourself. Therefore don't
  take any intoxicant. Wonderful! </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another way of explaining: if you don't break any one of
  the sila, after death you will get this heaven or that heaven. Again wonderful! </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another approach: you are a human being and every human
  being has to live in society. A householder has to live with the members of his own
  family, members of the society. Even if someone renounces the householder's life, yet one
  remains in contact with the society. As a member of the society you should not do anything
  which will disturb the peace and harmony of the society. You cannot enjoy peace and
  harmony if all around you there is no peace and harmony at all. If you want to live a life
  of peace and harmony, that means you must encourage peace and harmony around you. If you
  are surrounded by burning fire, don't think that you won't suffer from that fire. The heat
  of the fire will make you miserable. If you want peace, then don't do anything at the
  physical level or at the vocal level which will disturb the peace and harmony of others,
  which will harm and hurt others. Wonderful! Wonderful! </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">People keep listening to such discourses, but they listen
  with this ear, and it goes out the other ear. This happens with everyone's teaching. We
  are not here to condemn the teaching of other religions but to understand the difference.
  A drunkard knows very well that drinking is not good for him. He wants to come out of it.
  A gambler understands that gambling is not good for him. He would like to come out of it;
  and yet when the time comes, he or she can't control himself or herself. He or she commits
  the same thing. One understands that one should not do it, and yet one is a slave of one's
  own mind, because one does not have mastery over the mind. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So the next step is to develop samadhi, mastery over the
  mind. Again, the teaching of samadhi was not just the monopoly of the Buddha. The
  contemporary teachers at the time of the Buddha were teaching samadhi. Before the Buddha
  became Buddha, he himself went to two teachers, Alara Kiama and Uddaka Ramaputta from whom
  he learned the technique of deep samadhi up to the seventh jhana (absorbed concentration)
  and the eighth jhana. So samadhi was being taught. Different types of practices of samadhi
  were there, and yet the teaching of the Buddha is wonderfully different. There can be no
  comparison between the samadhi that was practiced in those days, the lokiya-jhana (mundane
  absorption), and what he developed and taught others, the lokuttara-jhana (supramundane
  absorption). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is the same with the teaching of panna, wisdom. This
  mind, this body, which includes the entire sensorium, is impermanent, anicca, anicca. This
  cannot be a source of happiness for us. This is only a source of misery, dukkha, dukkha.
  This phenomenon is not &quot;I,&quot; is not &quot;mine,&quot; is not &quot;my soul.&quot;
  Anatta. To many people it seems that this was the contribution of the Buddha. But this is
  not so. Even at the time of the Buddha we find instances when people who were not his
  disciples came to him and he questioned them, &quot;Kim mannasi? What do you believe about
  this mind-matter sensorium? Is it nicca or anicca, permanent or impermanent?&quot; And the
  listener answered, &quot;Anicca.&quot; &quot;Is this sukha or dukkha?&quot; and he said,
  &quot;Dukkha&quot;. &quot;Is this I, me, mine, myself, or no I, no me, no myself?&quot;
  &quot;It is no I, no me, no myself - anatta&quot;. He was Bahiya (an outsider), not a
  follower of Buddha, and yet he gave these answers. Then what was the wonderful
  contribution of Buddha? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">First he questioned this person, &quot;Kim mannasi? What
  do you believe? Is it anicca? Is it dukkha? Is it anatta?&quot; And this person replied,
  &quot;Yes, this is anicca. It is dukkha. It is anatta.&quot; And then the Buddha said,
  &quot;Evam passa (by observing it so, one becomes liberated from misery). Mere believing
  won't help you. Passa: you observe the reality; and with your own observation, jana:
  direct experience, then you understand this is anicca, this is dukkha, this is
  anatta.&quot; Herein lies the beauty of the Buddha's teaching.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is very easy to give sermons and easier still to listen
  to sermons. &quot;Let's talk about Dhamma and listen to words of Dhamma. Oh wonderful!
  Buddha's teaching is wonderful.&quot; With this approach, one becomes an admirer of the
  Buddha, one becomes a good devotee of the Buddha, but one does not become a follower of
  Buddha. To follow the Buddha, passa-yana: by Vipassana you experience for yourself the
  truth, the law of nature. And then you understand. Then it is your wisdom. Otherwise it is
  the wisdom of the Buddha, a borrowed wisdom, not your wisdom. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Each individual has to develop his or her own wisdom. Each
  individual has to develop his or her own enlightenment. The wisdom developed by Siddhatta
  Gotama could only help one person, and that person was Siddhatta Gotama, none else. This
  person became fully enlightened because he developed the wisdom himself. Others can get
  inspiration; others can get guidance: &quot;Oh, this is how the Buddha practised, and this
  is how he became Buddha.&quot; But each individual has to take every step on the path to
  reach the final goal. If I don't take any step on the path and just keep on praying,
  &quot;Buddha-Oh wonderful Buddha,&quot; I keep on admiring Buddha-&quot;Oh wonderful
  Buddha-and wonderful Dhamma&quot;. It doesn't help. For my whole life I may keep on
  praying to the Buddha. For my whole life I may keep on admiring the Buddha and Dhamma. But
  if I don't practise Dhamma, I don't get the fruits of Dhamma. This was the basic
  difference between the Buddha's teaching and the teaching of all other teachers. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because I come from a particular tradition, everything
  that I learned from my teacher at the theoretical level was nothing new to me. But at the
  practical level my tradition had nothing new to offer. Later on I found that no tradition
  had anything to offer. It was all just talking, talking, talking. There was no way out.
  One should practice Vipassanas the Buddha wanted you to practise. &quot;Passa-yana: you
  observe the reality within yourself. And then you will understand why I am teaching like
  this, why I want you to observe sila.&quot; All the other reasons that are given are so
  superficial or so gross.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The teaching of the Buddha takes you from the gross,
  olarika, to sukhuma, the subtle: subtle mind and matter. A constant interaction of mind
  and matter is going on throughout one's life. From the time one takes birth to the time
  when one passes away, there is a constant interaction. The mind, the matter are
  influencing each other - are getting influenced by each other. Mind arises because of
  matter, the matter arises because of mind-currents, cross currents, under-currents, and
  all of this is happening within the framework of the body.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As you practise Vipassana you will find that there are
  sensations throughout your body; but don't take them merely as physical sensations. The
  body alone cannot feel; the mind is involved - mind is feeling. A particular sensation has
  come - mind feels it and a part of the mind reacts to it. If it is pleasant, it reacts
  with craving. If it is unpleasant, it reacts with aversion. When the mind is reacting with
  aversion, the unpleasant sensation becomes more unpleasant. This interaction is going on,
  every moment and one does not know what is happening.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As you start experiencing these sensations, you will
  notice that as and when you kill you generate a tremendous amount of anger or hatred or
  ill will or animosity. This dosa must arise in your mind - only then will you kill
  someone. If you are a good Vipassana meditator, you will find that as soon as you generate
  any negativity in your mind - anger, hatred, ill will, animosity-you are getting agitated,
  you are becoming miserable. You can't enjoy peace when you generate anger. As soon as you
  generate anger you are the first victim of your anger. This is Dhamma, the law of nature.
  When anyone arouses anger it makes no difference if he or she is a Hindu, a Muslim, a
  Christian or a Jain; a Singaporean, an Indian, an American or Russian, a black, a white or
  a brown. Anyone who generates anger, or any negativity, gets punishment here and now. You
  have broken the law of nature. When you break the law of the state, the state punishes
  you. You might escape that punishment, but when you break the law of nature, you can't
  escape it. If you break the law of the state, the punishment may come after a few years,
  after going to this court or that court, but with the law of nature there is no wait.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This was the enlightenment of the Buddha. As soon as you
  perform any action at the physical level or at the vocal level, you defile your mind, you
  generate negativity in your mind. As soon as you generate negativity in your mind, misery
  starts. At the surface of the mind you do not know because you have not gone deep inside.
  But deep inside you have started suffering.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is the same with stealing. You can't steal unless you
  generate greed in your mind. You can't commit sexual misconduct unless you generate
  passion in your mind. You can't lie and deceive others unless you generate ego or craving
  or some impurity or the other in your mind. The law of nature is such that as soon as you
  generate any negativity in your mind, you start suffering. And it is not that the result
  of this action will come after death. It will come after death also but nature doesn't
  wait for that - it starts punishing you here and now and it keeps punishing you. </font></p>
  <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Idha tappati, pecca tappati, papakari ubhayattha
  tappati.</font></strong></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">He suffers now, he suffers after death, in both cases the
  wrongdoer suffers.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you perform any action, sinful action, unwholesome
  action, at the physical or vocal level - you start suffering, suffering, suffering. This
  was the Buddha's teaching which is universal. Anybody who performs any action, physical or
  vocal, which harms, hurts or disturbs the peace and harmony of others, starts suffering
  immediately.</font></p>
  <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Manasa ce padutthena bhasati va karoti va.</font></strong></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you perform any action, physical or vocal, with a
  defiled mind, then what happens?</font></p>
  <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Tato nam dukkhamanveti cakkam'va vahato padam.</font></strong></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then misery will keep following you - following you, like
  the wheel of the cart follows the bullock, that is yoked to the cart. Wherever it runs,
  because it is yoked to the cart, the wheel is there, the wheel is there. Because you
  perform an action, physical or vocal, with the base of a defiled mind, you have multiplied
  your habit pattern of reacting with the defiled mind. And this habit pattern keeps
  multiplying, keeps generating misery for you. One understands this by practicing
  Vipassana. Every moment that I react with aversion, I become miserable. The sensation that
  I experience while generating aversion is a very unpleasant sensation. It makes me feel so
  unhappy, and I realize, &quot;Look nature is punishing me, nature is punishing me now,
  here and now and will continue to punish me unless I come out this habit pattern.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the law of nature. The Buddha did not create it.
  Buddha is not the creator of Dhamma. Dhamma is there. The Buddha discovered it. He went to
  such a depth that he discovered the law of nature at the experiential level, which made
  him an enlightened person.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Everyone can practise the technique that he discovered and
  they will get the same result. Everyone can explore the truth within the framework of the
  body and can understand the interaction: &quot;Look what is happening. As soon as I defile
  my mind the punishment is there.&quot; When you become more and more established in this
  truth at the experiential level your sila becomes perfect. If I place my hand on the fire
  - knowingly or unknowingly - it burns. The next time I will be very careful: &quot;Oh, I
  should not place my hand on the fire - it burns - look, it burns and I don't like this
  burning. I want to keep my hand away.&quot; As the fire outside burns you as soon as you
  touch it, so also, your impurities burn you as you start generating them, and you start
  experiencing this burning. You won't want to generate more misery for yourself when you
  start experiencing the truth inside.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is what the Buddha called <strong>passa-yana</strong>:
  &quot;With Vipassana you observe directly; experience this truth and understand the
  reality. Then you understand my teaching properly.&quot; Otherwise, for your whole life
  you may say &quot;Everything is anicca, everything is dukkha, everything is anatta-. We
  are the believers in anicca, we are the believers in dukkha, we are the believers in
  anatta.&quot; What do you gain? Tell me,what do you gain? It is a big delusion. I didn't
  gain anything until I practised. Buddha is not in favor of any devotional or emotional
  entertainment. Buddha is teaching the actual practice of Dhamma. He taught sila and people
  reached the stage, whereby, experiencing the truth inside, they naturally abstained from
  breaking sila.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">He taught samadhi, which before him was just the eight
  jhanas. As you go deeper in the technique, you will understand the difference between the
  eight jhanas of those days, which are lokiya jhanas, and how Buddha gave a twist, a tum
  towards liberation making them lokuttara. Sampajanna in its true sense: constant thorough
  understanding of impermanence, was not included in the eight jhanas of those days. Buddha
  started the practice with sati-sampayana. By the time one attains the third jhana, the
  third jhana samapatti (attainment), the sampajanna is perfect. Sampajanna is perfect only
  if you are aware of these sensations - arising, passing; arising, passing; continuously
  aware day and night.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One who practises Vipassana properly will start
  understanding the importance of the words of the Buddha when he says sampajannam
  narincati, sampajannam na rincati: You can't afford to miss even one moment of sampajanna.
  Every moment-sampajanna, sampajanna, arising; passing, arising; passing, then it is not
  just a theory, then it is not just a philosophy, it is a practice. When you are with this
  arising, passing; arising, passing; anicca, anicca, anicca, you can't generate a new
  impurity. And when you are with this anicca the old impurities keep coming on the surface.
  They come on the surface and get eradicated, layers after layers of impurities, come and
  pass away. Then you become the master of your mind, and the samadhi is not mere samadhi,
  panna is included with it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">With sampajanna included, Buddha's practice takes one to
  the first phala samapatti; as one becomes sotapanna one experiences the first jhana.
  Proceeding on the path one gets the second phala samapatti:sakadagami, which may come with
  the first jhana or higher jhanas. As one attains the third phala samapatti: anagami, and
  the fourth: Arahant, the third and fourth jhanas are useful. It is not absolutely
  necessary to practise the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth jhanas to attain the phalas,
  though one can easily do so after these stages if one wants. But in these first four
  jhanas, he included sampajanna, sati-sampajana, which at the time was not available
  anywhere.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of course, there had been other Buddhas, but since the
  passing of the teaching of the previous Buddha nobody prior to the Gotama the Buddha or at
  the time of Gotama the Buddha or other teachers that came after Gotama the Buddha could
  understand the proper meaning of sampajanna. This word had percolated down from the time
  of previous Buddhas but the real meaning was lost. In the teaching of the lokiya jhanas it
  had the meaning of, &quot;knowing intentionally, or deeper, precise awareness.&quot; But
  the wisdom of anicca was absent so the actual teaching and practice of sati-sampajana was
  far away. This wisdom was the contribution of the Buddha, the wonderful contribution of
  the Buddha.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And then, with this experiential understanding inside, it
  becomes so clear that there is no sectarian teaching at all. This is just the law of
  nature. It is not necessary that I must call myself a Buddhist to practise the teaching of
  Buddha. I may keep calling myself by any name, because it doesn't make any difference.
  Even if I call myself a Buddhist, if I generate raga/lobha, I generate dosa, and I
  generate moha - is there any Buddha above the clouds who will come and save me? I will
  have to suffer; calling myself a Buddhist won't help. If I really want to come out of
  suffering I must come out of lobha, I must come out of dosa, I must come out of moha.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The beauty of Buddha's teaching is that he discovered this
  law in depth, made use of it for his own enlightenment and then distributed it to others.
  &quot;Look; I got enlightenment by this, I got liberated by this. You can also get
  liberated, everyone of you. You just try - you just work with the practice.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And it is the beauty of Buddha's teaching that he says,
  &quot;I am not teaching to have you as my pupils.&quot; In the Udumbara Sutta he says,
  &quot;I am not interested to make you my pupil, I am not interested in breaking you from
  your old teacher - I am not interested. I am not interested even to change your goal,
  because everyone wants to come out of suffering. Just give me seven days of your
  life.&quot; Buddha says, &quot;Just give me seven days of your life and try it. Try
  something that I have discovered and then judge for yourselves whether it is good or not
  good for you. If it is good for you, then accept it. Otherwise, don't accept it.&quot;
  This is Buddha's way of teaching. He is not interested in snaring pupils. Nor is he
  interested in establishing a sect, a particular sect. How will the world benefit if
  everyone in the world calls himself or herself a Buddhist but no one practises Dhamma?
  Rather these people will be helped and the world will be helped when people practise sila,
  samadhi, and panna. This starts to benefit oneself and others. The whole atmosphere
  becomes purified. It becomes charged with Dhamma - with the vibration of purity with the
  vibration of metta, because one starts practising. The Buddha wants us to practise, not to
  play intellectual games. These games will not help; they are a big delusion. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Take as an example the taste of a piece of cake. The cake
  is very sweet. You accept that it is sweet because the Buddha said so. And you have great
  devotion in Buddha, so you accept it. This is mere acceptance. &quot;Kim mannasi - what do
  you believe? I believe Buddha's teaching is wonderful.&quot; This is merely your belief.
  Or suppose you take one step further and you try to intellectualize: &quot;Oh, Buddha says
  this is so. Others say something different. Buddha's words are so rational, so scientific
  - ah, wonderful! Buddha's teaching is so wonderful. &quot;Again, what do you gain? The
  cake is very sweet because it contains sugar. So naturally it is sweet. It must be sweet. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But is the cake really sweet or not? Only when you put it
  on your own tongue and you taste it can you say, &quot;Yes, it is sweet.&quot; It is sweet
  on your tongue . If you do not practise Buddha' s teaching - you just keep admiring his
  teaching - then you are a wonderful admirer of Buddha. You are also a wonderful devotee of
  Buddha but you are not a follower of Buddha. And one does not get anything unless one
  follows what Buddha taught.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Devotion is wonderful. Saddha- (devotion) is the first
  step on the path of Dhamma. I say saddha is like preparing a field for cultivation. You
  plough the field, you remove all the pebbles and stones, you cultivate it well-and then
  you sit near this field and keep praying. &quot;Now I have prepared the field. Oh field,
  give me a wonderful crop; please give me a fruitful crop.&quot; Similarly, &quot;Oh
  Buddha, please do something to give me a wonderful crop.&quot; But nothing comes up. You
  have to plant the seeds in the field; you have to irrigate it; you have to fertilize
  properly. Only then will you find that healthy crops have grown. Devotion is like
  preparing the ground but don't stop there. It is a very important step, no doubt. But
  then, you have to take the next steps and those you have to take yourself, nobody else can
  do that for you. A Buddha cannot do that for you. Your guru cannot do that for you. Your
  teacher cannot do that for you. You have to work yourself.</font></p>
  <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Tumhe hi kiccam atappam, akkhataro Tathagata.</font></strong></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You yourself must earnestly practise, the enlightened ones
  only proclaim the path.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A Tathagata, will only show the path; he won't carry you
  on his shoulders to the final goal. Nobody can carry you on his shoulders to the final
  goal. Tumhe hi kiccam atappam: you have to work out your own salvation - you have to work
  out your own emancipation. Someone can guide you because he has walked over the path, step
  by step. As the Buddha explained, &quot;I walked over this path. I benefitted. If you want
  to come along, then you also walk. Start taking steps.&quot; As many steps as you take,
  you will get that much benefit. If you take all the steps on the path, then you will reach
  the final goal.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The path is universal. One comes to a course of ten days
  or longer to practise what the Buddha taught. And the first requisite is: when you come
  you have to observe five precepts during your stay. It doesn't matter whether you have
  been observing them in the past or not. While you are in a retreat, when you are trying to
  practise what he wanted you to practise, at least for these ten days, you must observe
  these five precepts very scrupulously. Hindu or Muslim, Christian,Buddhist or Jain, all
  will take five precepts. They don't disagree; they accept this discipline-because the
  precepts are universal. Which religion will say, &quot;Yes, you can kill; it doesn't
  matter. Go ahead, you can steal; it doesn't matter. You can commit adultery; doesn't
  matter. You can speak lies.&quot; No religion will teach that, because moral conduct is
  the greatest common denominator of all the religions.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So the first step is to practise moral physical and vocal
  actions. Next you are asked to sit down comfortably. You are not required to sit in a
  lotus or half-lotus posture. You choose whichever way you can sit comfortably, keeping
  your back straight. You close your eyes, close your mouth and your guide will say,
  &quot;Observe your breath.&quot; This is what Buddha taught: &quot;Observe your breath,
  natural breath - as it comes in - as it goes out.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Suppose along with the awareness of the breath, one is
  instructed to mentally recite a word. This is what happens in various kinds of meditation.
  I passed through such practices, so I know what happens. You are asked to breathe in while
  mentally reciting one word; breathing out, you mentally repeat another word. For example,
  if I am a Hindu, I breathe in: &quot;Rama, Rama&quot;; if I am Sikh: &quot;Sata-nama,
  Sata-nama.&quot;Like this, some word is used, whatever it might be. One who calls himself
  a Buddhist will say, &quot;Buddha, Buddha, Buddha.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is not Buddha's teaching. It is sectarian, because
  whenever one is given any word to recite, that word is almost always a sectarian word. How
  can a non-Buddhist say &quot;Buddha, Buddha, Buddha&quot;? Certainly, mentally repeating
  &quot;Buddha, Buddha,&quot; the mind will get concentrated. In the same way if you recite,
  &quot;Rama, Rama, Rama,&quot;your mind will get concentrated. You can say, &quot;Christ,
  Christ, Christ,&quot; your mind will get concentrated. If you say, &quot;Allah,
  Allah,&quot; it will get concentrated. But these are sectarian words and Buddha's path
  must remain universal. Even if you use an ordinary word, like, &quot;clock, clock,clock,
  clock,&quot; the mind will get concentrated. If you repeat any word continuously, your
  mind will get concentrated. This is a law of nature. But the Buddha never gave his
  followers any word to concentrate on.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddha's instruction is to observe the breath just breath,
  natural breath. The breath cannot be Hindu, breath cannot be Muslim, cannot be Christian.
  You can't give it a title. This fellow who is breathing: can we say his breath is a Muslim
  breath, is it a Hindu breath? No. Breath is breath, natural breath. Buddha's object of
  meditation is so universal.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In my teaching, everywhere around the world, I find people
  coming from different sects, different communities, different beliefs. I ask them to
  observe breath. It doesn't go against their religion and they accept it, &quot;Yes,
  observing breath is not against my religion.&quot; If, along with the breath, I were to
  instruct them, &quot;You must say, 'Namo tassa bhagvato...',&quot; many would react,
  &quot;Oh no, no, no, I can't say this.&quot; But if I tell them, &quot;Observe only
  breath,&quot; then yes, they accept it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another way of concentration was very common at the time
  of Buddha, and it still continues today. Along with the breath a meditator imagines some
  image - a shape, a form of this god or that god, of this saintly person or that saintly
  person, founder of this religion or that religion. Again, as soon as one imagines this
  shape or form, it becomes sectarian, because one shape or form belongs to this particular
  sect, another shape or form belongs to that particular sect. Nothing doing! Buddha says no
  shape, no form, no verbalization, no visualization, no imagination. Yathabhuta nana
  dassanam (realization of the truth as it is). This is Buddha's teaching. Yathabhuta: as it
  happens, as it is happening at this moment. The breath has come in. That's all. The breath
  has gone out. That's all. If it is deep you are just aware that it is deep. If it is
  shallow, you are just aware that it is shallow. You don't interfere with the natural flow
  of the nature. If it passes through the left nostril, you are just aware: it is passing
  through the left nostril. If it passes through the right nostril, you are just aware that
  it is passing through the right nostril. If it is passing through both the nostrils, you
  are just aware. Your job is to develop the faculty of awareness.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You are asked to keep the attention at the entrance of the
  nostrils. For three days you keep working continuously because nothing else is allowed in
  a Vipassana course. From 4:00-4:30 in the morning until 9:00-9:30 at night, you are
  permitted no reading, no discussions, no arguments, no newspapers, no TV, no radio;
  nothing else. You are just observing yourself. What will reading the newspaper do? It will
  make you more extroverted. If you are extroverted you can't observe yourself as Buddha
  wants you to observe yourself. So no distractions are permitted, no disturbances from
  outside. You simply observe your breath. You observe your breath and you are asked to be
  aware of this area - the entrance of the nostrils where the breath comes in, where it goes
  out.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day, two days, three days pass, then you begin to
  notice that besides this breath going in and coming out, something else is happening. What
  is happening? Some biochemical reaction or the other. Every moment there is some
  biochemical reaction throughout your body, but at the conscious level you are unaware of
  this. At a deeper level your mind keeps feeling these biochemical flows and keeps reacting
  to them. There is some sensation happening everywhere in the body. It may be heat or
  perspiration; it may be throbbing, pulsing,itching, tickling something or the other keeps
  happening. But you are instructed to keep your attention on the area of the nostrils.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the third day you start feeling something happening
  here. Again, your teacher will say, &quot;Just observe. Do nothing. If it is itching, just
  observe. Don't scratch it. Don't rub it. Just observe the itching. See how long it
  lasts.&quot; You observe, observe, observe. . . and it passes away. No itching is eternal;
  it doesn't stay forever. It increases and decreases, and sooner or later it goes.
  &quot;Oh, anicca. Oh, anicca. After all,it passes away; sooner or later it passes
  away.&quot; You understand anicca. Like this, everything that arises, arises to pass away;
  it arises to pass away.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Initially you are concentrating on the area at the
  entrance of the nostrils. By the time you reach the fourth or fifth day, you will explore
  the entire physical structure and you will find that everywhere there is some sensation or
  the other. There is no particle, not the tiniest particle in the body, where there is no
  sensation. Wherever there is life, there is sensation. Again, you just observe:
  yathabhuta. You are observing objectively: yathabhuta nana dassanam. You are not
  identifying yourself with this sensation. It is not necessary that you start naming this
  sensation. Instead of naming the sensation, you understand its nature. Whatever sensation
  has come up, you are trained to observe: &quot;Let me see how long it lasts. Let me see
  how long it lasts.&quot; And you find that sooner or later, it passes away: anicca,
  anicca. Buddha wanted you to understand this anicca at the experiential level. If you
  simply understand at the intellectual level - &quot;Well, everything in this world is
  anicca. Look, see how people take birth and die. Buildings get erected and later they get
  demolished. Oh, everything is anicca&quot; - this is merely intellectual understanding; it
  is not the passa-jana that Buddha wants you to have. With Vipassana you must understand,
  &quot;Look how very impermanent, how very ephemeral! Arising, passing; arising, passing;
  constantly arising, passing; arising, passing.Everywhere throughout the physical structure
  arising, passing; arising, passing; arising, passing.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Again this is universal. This is not something Buddha
  created for you, me or for anybody else. This is true for everybody but people don't have
  the eye of wisdom. They don't have this technique of Vipassana, to feel this process of
  mind and matter interaction - arising, passing; arising, passing; arising, passing. And
  this is the specialty of Buddha's teaching. As I say, in the tradition from which I came,
  that teaching was there: &quot;You must be free from craving-ra-ga&quot;; in that teaching
  vita raga is the highest goal. &quot;You must come out of aversion&quot;; vita dosa is the
  highest goal. &quot;You must come out of ignorance&quot;; vita moha is the highest goal. I
  used to recite all that in the Gita. I used to recite these in different Upanishads of
  Vedanta. But how to come out of raga? How to come out of dosa? How to come out of moha?
  These are nothing but sermons: &quot;Oh, you people of the world,you must come out of
  greed; this is very dangerous for you. Oh, you people of the world, you must come out of
  aversion; this is very dangerous for you. People of the world, you must come out
  ignorance; it is very dangerous for you.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If Buddha had also said only this, then there would have
  been no difference between Buddha and other teachers. Buddha tells us how to come out of
  our suffering: &quot;Look, here is a technique. Where the greed starts, you go to the
  depth where it is generated. Where the aversion starts, you go to the depth and you see
  how it starts.&quot; By practising Vipassana you will start to understand. Initially you
  will experience very unpleasant sensations, gross, solidified sensations like heaviness or
  pressure or heat. But as you keep observing, observing, observing, you will find that they
  get disintegrated, they get dissolved. And then you come to very subtle vibrations
  throughout the body. There is nothing but a flow of subtle vibrations which is very
  pleasant. One feels like having more and more. Students come to me in the middle of the
  course and they say, &quot;Oh, wonderful! Oh, Goenkaji, today's meditation was so
  wonderful. I had a free flow, so much piti (joyful delight). So wonderful! So
  wonderful!&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At this point we must remember Buddha's words: - adinava
  (dangerous), bhaya (fearful). This is dangerous for you. When you start experiencing
  pleasant sensation, if there is assada (relishing), a very big danger has come. You will
  start to generate craving for it. You will start generating attachment to it; and then, as
  soon as you miss this pleasant flow of sensation, you will come running to me. &quot;Oh,
  my meditation has gone very bad. Please do something, Goenkaji. I'm not getting that
  wonderful flow. &quot;Oh, this is dangerous. So when you get a very pleasant
  sensation-flow throughout the body the teacher will remind you, &quot;Anicca. Look, this
  is also anicca.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Samudaya dhammanupassi va kayasmim viharati. vaya
  dhammanupassi va kayasmim viharati. samudaya-vaya dhammanupassi va kayasmim viharati.</font></strong></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The meditator dwells observing the phenomenon of arising
  in the body. He dwells observing the phenomenon of passing away in the body. He dwells
  observing the phenomenon of simultaneous arising and passing away in the body.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you experienced gross sensation, there was arising -
  samudaya dhammanupassi viharati. After some time, vaya dhammanupassi viharati - look, it
  has arisen, and after some time, it has passed away. But it comes to a stage when it turns
  into very subtle vibration. Then the change occurs with such high velocity - samudayavaya
  dhammanupassi viharati. There is no gap between samudaya and vaya, arising and passing
  away. But it is all anicca. Whether it passes away after some time or it passes away
  instantly, it does pass away. It is not permanent. Experiencing this one starts changing
  the habit pattern of the mind.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Unless you go to the depth of the mind, you can't change
  its habit pattern at the deepest level. This is what the Buddha found by practising all
  eight jhanas - the anusaya kilesa (sleeping impurities) remain. These impurities are the
  behavior pattern of the mind from so many lives and they will continue in future lives
  unless you strike at the root, unless you cut that root. Otherwise there is no possibility
  of getting liberated. Practising these lokiya jhanas, you may enjoy wonderful ecstasy
  which does bring purity of mind at the surface level. With this layer of mental purity,
  after death you may attain this loka (plane of existence) or that loka; but still you are
  rolling. You are rotating in the loka. You cannot go beyond that. Only when you cut the
  root - the root of all the anusaya kilesa, where the impurities arise - only then will you
  get liberated.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Understand that there is a big barrier, a very big barrier
  between the so-called &quot;conscious mind&quot; and what is called the half-conscious or
  unconscious mind by Western psychologists. Buddha never used these words because no part
  of the mind is unconscious. What is called &quot;conscious mind&quot; he called paritta
  citta, a very tiny part of the mind.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But still, if you understand the Western psychological
  terminology, then call them conscious, half-conscious, unconscious. Day and night the so-
  called unconscious mind is aware of these sensations in the body-day and night, every
  moment. And it is not only aware of them; it is reacting to them - every moment, it is
  reacting. That means it is multiplying the behavior pattern of craving, of aversion; of
  craving, of aversion. Either the sensations are pleasant or unpleasant, and this part of
  the mind keeps reacting, over and over. The conscious mind doesn't know what is happening
  at all. This tiny mind at the surface doesn't know at all.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">An example - it is night time and you have gone to bed.
  You are in deep sleep. Who is in deep sleep? The conscious mind is in deep sleep. But the
  so-called unconscious mind never sleeps. It is constantly in contact with these body
  sensations. You are in deep sleep. A mosquito has come and bitten you. The unconscious
  mind immediately feels - there is an unpleasant sensation - and it reacts. It will drive
  the mosquito away or kill the mosquito. Still, this unpleasant sensation is going on. Now
  it will scratch and the conscious mind doesn't know at all. In the morning if somebody
  asks you, &quot;During the night, how many mosquitoes bit you?&quot; You don't know. You
  will know nothing about it, and yet the whole night you were reacting to these mosquito
  bites.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And it does not happen only at night. This barrier remains
  all the time, twenty-four hours a day. For example now, at this moment, I am sitting. If I
  am not a good Vipassana meditator, what happens? While I am talking, my conscious mind is
  working: &quot;Look, I have said so much. Now I must conclude in this way. Time is getting
  short. I must finish the talk now. And whatever I am saying - are people listening to it?
  Are they understanding or are they getting bored? They have started yawning. They are
  looking at their watches. I must stop talking.&quot; My conscious mind is doing this job.
  The unconscious mind has nothing at all to do with it. The unconscious mind is busy
  feeling sensations. Sitting for one hour in one position with this heavy weight, a
  pressure starts somewhere in my body. When a pressure starts this unconscious mind says,
  &quot;I don't like it. You better move.&quot; So I move a little. After some time another
  pressure appears. Again I move a little. Some itching might start up and automatically I
  scratch it. My conscious mind doesn't know what I am doing. Try observing someone. Keep
  watching him or her for 15 minutes. Do nothing: just observe the person. You will notice
  how frequently he or she is shifting like this and fidgeting here and there. What is he
  doing? Even the person himself or herself does not know what he or she is doing. This is
  because there is such a big barrier between the conscious and the unconscious part of the
  mind. The conscious mind is occupied with so many things. The unconscious mind is busy
  only feeling sensations and reacting, feeling sensations and reacting.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This barrier needs to be broken. You may have the
  intellectual understanding: &quot;Oh everything is anicca, everything is anicca, there
  should be no lobha, no dosa.&quot; And yet there is lobha, there is dosa. This mind, this
  unconscious mind does not understand that this is anicca. When there is pain, it doesn't
  like it: &quot;Oh, this is unpleasant. I don't like it.&quot; It keeps on reacting. Now,
  with Vipassana, you go to the depth where the mind feels the body sensations. It is at the
  level of the bodily sensations that the unconscious mind is reacting; and it is at this
  level that you can stop this unconscious mind from reacting. Whatever may have been
  understood at the intellectual level, now this mad mind, the blind mind, also starts
  understanding: &quot;Look-anicca, Look, these sensations are anicca.&quot; Then the
  behavior pattern at the depth of the mind starts changing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This was Buddha's enlightenment: this paticca samuppada
  (dependent origination). He said whether there is a Buddha present or not, the law of
  paticca samuppada is always there. Other teachers will say, &quot;Oh, you must not react
  with craving to anything pleasant that you see, or to anything pleasant that you hear, or
  to any pleasant thing you smell, taste, touch or think. You must not react with craving.
  Or, whatever unpleasant experience there may be, something that you see, you hear, you
  smell, you taste, you touch, or you think - do not have aversion.&quot; This teaching was
  there. Even today many are giving this teaching. Buddha found out that there is a gap
  between the outside object coming in contact with the six sense doors and the reaction of
  craving or aversion. He discovered a missing link, and that missing link is vedana, the
  sensation on the body.</font></p>
  <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Salyatana paccaya phasso; phassa paccaya vedana;
  vedana paccaya tanha.</font></strong></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">With the base of the six senses, contact arises; with the
  base of contact, sensation arises; with the base of sensation, craving and aversion arise.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I may think that I am free from craving or aversion when I
  hear something pleasant or unpleasant, but deep inside where the sensations have started,
  my mind keeps reacting. At the depth it keeps reacting. If I do not work with this link
  which is deeper than my superficial, intellectual understanding, I cannot come out of my
  misery because I cannot change the habit pattern of my mind. This is what the Buddha found
  out: salayatana paccaya phasso - at the six sense doors, there is contact. Phassa paccaya
  vedana: at every contact, there is sensation. When there is a contact at the ear sense
  door, or eye sense door, or nose sense door, or tongue sense door, or body sense door, or
  mind sense door - there is bound to be sensation on the body: vedana. Then vedana paccaya
  tanha: only after vedana will this craving and aversion arise. If you miss vedana, how
  will you know where the tanha has started? You won't even know that tanha has started. You
  may try to keep the impurities away at the surface level of the mind, but at the depth,
  long before the reaction becomes strong enough to emerge at the conscious level, it has
  already tied so many knots, so many knots! The behavior pattern becomes stronger and
  stronger. You can't come out of it by working only at the intellectual level.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The beauty of Buddha's teaching is that he gave this
  wonderful technique, which is universal. Anybody who goes to the depth and takes out all
  the impurity becomes a liberated person, and can keep calling himself by any name. It
  makes no difference. But someone who cannot penetrate to this depth keeps on rotating in
  misery. This law is universal, applicable to one and all. Buddha rediscovered this law,
  made use of it for himself, became liberated and then started distributing it to others
  with so much love, so much compassion. As people started practising it, they benefitted
  from it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">People of this wonderful island, I am glad you have so
  much devotion to Buddha. You admire Buddha. You admire Buddha's teaching. Therefore the
  base is wonderful. You all have the seed of Dhamma in you. Otherwise you would not have
  come to a talk like this. By now, perhaps, you would have been in some theatre or some
  cinema or some dance hall or somewhere else. You are here. That shows that you have got
  the seed of Dhamma in you. But if for the whole life the seed remains only a seed, you
  won't get anything. The seed must grow and give wonderful fruits. And certainly the seed
  can give wonderful fruits. I invite all of you. As Buddha says, &quot;Give me seven days
  of your life. Just give a trial.&quot; I am not a Buddha. I say, &quot;Give me ten days of
  your life and try. Just try.&quot; Accept it only after you have passed through these ten
  days. You will find that Buddha's way is really beneficial - that it gives results,
  akaliko, here and now. You won't have to wait until after death. You will benefit here and
  now, and keep on benefitting.</font></p>
  <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Idha nandati pecca nandati katapunno ubhayattha
  nandat.</font></strong></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here and now he rejoices, after death he rejoices, in both
  cases the well doer rejoices.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The moment you start practising Dhamma, you will see that
  you are benefiting. In the beginning, it is beneficial; in the middle, it is beneficial;
  at the end, it is beneficial. But it is beneficial only when you practice.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I hope all of you, sooner or later, will find the time to
  begin the practice of Buddha's teaching. You have done a lot of intellectual entertainment
  already. Today also you have listened for one hour, which was only intellectual
  entertainment. But now take this hour and turn it into the strong determination that
  whenever you find time, you will pass through a practice of ten days.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><strong><em><font face="Times New Roman">May all of you pass through a
  practice of ten days.<br>
  May all of you get the best benefit of Buddha's teaching,the best fruits of Buddha's
  teaching.<br>
  May all of you enjoy real peace, real harmony, real happiness. </font></em></strong></p>
  <p align="right"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><strong><em>S.N. Goenka</em></strong></font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-oOo-</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800080"><strong>The Ten-day Course</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To learn Vipassana it is necessary to take a residential
  ten-day course under the guidance of a qualified teacher. For the entire ten days students
  live within the course site and meditate, with breaks for eating, washing sleeping, etc.
  Each day's progress is explained during an hour-long discourse in the evening.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">During the course, all must abstain from any action,
  physical or vocal, which disturbs the peace and harmony of others. Therefore, a code of
  moral conduct, sila, is an essential first step of the practice. One undertakes not to
  kill, not to steal, not to commit sexual misconduct, not to speak lies, and not to use
  intoxicants. By abstaining from such actions, one allows the mind to quiet down. Students
  maintain noble silence for the first nine days of the course. This means abstaining from
  any communication amongst themselves, vocally or by gestures or writing. This noble
  silence is simply to give everyone the best opportunity to meditate, and thereby gain the
  maximum benefit from their course. If one has a question pertaining to the technique, one
  is free to ask the teacher whenever any need for clarification arises.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The course is a practical one in every respect. The work
  of controlling and purifying the mind is given top priority and the results speak for
  themselves. The costs for board and lodging are completely financed by donations from
  those who have taken a course, experienced benefits themselves, and wish others also to
  have the opportunity to benefit. Neither the Teacher,the assistant teachers, nor those
  serving at the centres profit in any material way from the courses.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800080"><strong>The Teacher</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Shri S.N. Goenka learned this technique in 1955 from the
  late Sayagyi U Ba Khin of Burma, a reknowned teacher of Vipassana. For nearly fourteen
  years Goenkaji received training under his teacher. Sayagyi wished that the technique of
  Vipassana should return to India, the place of its origin and from there spread throughout
  the world to help liberate mankind from its suffering.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Goenkaji has taken this as his life's work; he has been
  teaching Vipassana in India since 1969 and in other countries since 1979. In that time he
  has conducted over 350 ten-day courses attended by tens of thousands of students from many
  countries and from all walks of life. Since 1982 he has trained and appointed over 100
  assistant teachers who conduct courses of Vipassana using Goenkaji's taped instructions
  and discourses. The main centre for the training and practice of Vipassana is the
  Vipassana International Academy at Igatpuri, India, about 135 kilometers from Bombay. In
  addition, students have founded several other centres in India, Australasia, Europe. North
  America, and Asia.</font></p>
