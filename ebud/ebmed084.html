      </I><FONT SIZE="6">
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">T</FONT>he retreat we have just experienced is over. This 
      evening you will all be going home: back to your monasteries, to other 
      places, to other talks, or to another retreat. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">What actually are we doing? How do we make use of all the 
      momentum we’ve built up on this retreat? The first thing to mention is 
      that you need to be very careful when you leave this retreat, drive home 
      and go out into the world. Sometimes you just don’t realize how cool and 
      quiet you have become on a retreat such as this. Everybody here is 
      travelling in the same direction, so we haven’t much to compare ourselves 
      with. Sometimes you think that you haven’t really got anywhere on the 
      retreat. But I guarantee you that because of your cool, calm, peaceful 
      perspective, when you go outside these doors and out into the traffic, the 
      noise and the restlessness will seem to be absolute madness. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">I encourage people before they drive home, to get into 
      their cars, and drive up and down the small back streets for a few 
      minutes, to accustom themselves to the world again. It’s sometimes very 
      hard to respond when someone tries to cut in front of you, or when the 
      traffic lights suddenly change to red, and you have to put your foot on 
      the brake very quickly. Instead of putting your foot on the brake you 
      might just say, &quot;Let go, let go, let go, no control&quot;. So please, look 
      after yourselves when you leave; allow yourselves time to actually get 
      yourself back into the world again. </P>
      <FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#000080"><B>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Don’t be Heedless </P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">I remember the first time I went on a retreat. It was 
      actually many, many years ago, at a quasi-Tibetan monastery in the North 
      of Scotland. I was just meditating and doing my thing. Everyone else in 
      that place was doing the same, so I didn’t really notice anything until I 
      left the retreat, and went back to London. It was really shocking how 
      noisy people were, how frantic they were, how loudly they spoke, and how 
      agitatedly they moved. I hadn’t realized that I had slowed down so much. 
      So, one of the first things you recognise when you go out into the world 
      is that now you have something to compare yourself with. I guarantee 
      you’ll find that you have changed enormously, much more than you would 
      have expected. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Be gentle with yourself when you get back home. It’s so 
      easy to throw away all the peace, all the tranquillity, and all the wisdom 
      that you have gained on a retreat such as this. It’s such a shame that 
      sometimes we take those qualities for granted. We think that once we 
      develop these wonderful qualities of: stillness, silence, peace, inner 
      contentment, and freedom, they are always going to be there. And because 
      of that we don’t actually keep hold of them, we don’t guard them. The Four 
      Right Efforts need to be brought to mind. The Fourth Effort [*] is perhaps 
      the most important, as if the Buddha left the best to the last. That 
      Fourth Right Effort is that the meditator strives, puts forth energy, and 
      applies the mind to keep, develop, maintain and help to grow, any 
      wholesome, skilful, thoughts which arise in the mind. You look after them 
      and maintain them, so that they can grow stronger. Sometimes, you do all 
      of the work to keep out the bad stuff, you do all the work to cultivate, 
      and bring up the good stuff, but as soon as it’s there, you get heedless 
      and allow it to disappear. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Because of the laws of impermanence, suffering and 
      non-self, and because of defilements in the world, goodness is a very 
      fragile. It needs to be nurtured and kept safe. Otherwise it can too 
      easily be overcome and lost, just from the destructive forces in the 
      world. We know that with things like peace and kindness, love and freedom, 
      it is so easy for them to get lost in the world because we are heedless. 
      That is why the Buddha said, to not be heedless, to be careful and guard 
      the good states, the kind states, the lovely states, which you have 
      developed. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">When you leave this retreat, see if you can guard this 
      very precious jewel that someone has given you. It is very precious. No 
      matter how far you have gone in your meditation, at least you’ve got 
      somewhere. I guarantee that. I know that. You’ve gotten a state of peace, 
      a state of freedom. If it’s just a taste of freedom – even though that 
      taste of freedom might seem to be only the light at the end of a long 
      tunnel – you’ve got closer to it than you normally would have. You’ve seen 
      it for yourself. Yes, there is such a thing as freedom, peace, and 
      contentment, and that’s where happiness truly lies. If you cultivate it, 
      if you keep and maintain it as long as possible, then that peace, that 
      freedom, that wisdom inside the heart, will look after you in the lay 
      life. </P>
      <FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#000080"><B>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Our Real Home </P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">In the lay life it’s as if you go out there and work very 
      hard, you do all your chores and duties, but you’ve always got a place to 
      go home to. However, Ajahn Chah said &quot;Our real home is inner peace&quot;. Your 
      home is not the house that you live in, or the Kuti, which you stay in if 
      you are a monk or anag<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā</FONT>rika. Your true 
      home is inside of yourself. You can see that in your meditation. Sometimes 
      you sit here and go inside your mind, and you’re as happy as can be. You 
      don’t want anything. You can really rest and relax, and feel comfortable. 
      A home is supposed to be, a place of comfort, a place where you can relax. 
      At home you can let go, you don’t have to struggle with the world. There 
      is nothing asked of you or demanded of you; you can just really relax and 
      be at peace. That’s what we build our homes for. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Unfortunately many homes are places of strife and 
      struggle, and even worse, of turmoil. They’re not real homes. What we mean 
      by the ideal home, the real home, is the refuge of the Buddha, Dhamma and 
      Sangha, which we take deep inside of ourselves. A refuge means: a place of 
      peace, a place of freedom from danger, a place of security, a place where 
      there is no measuring anymore. Home is a place where you can just be 
      yourself, be at peace, be at ease, be nothing, just empty and free. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The purpose of meditation is to get you in touch with your 
      real home, the place of stillness inside of you. You realize that your 
      true home is carried around with you all the time. But how do we get in 
      there? The door of your heart is open to you no matter what you do. 
      Freedom, love, compassion, just being still, not controlling, letting go, 
      is the door into that home inside of you. You don’t go there by measuring 
      and by judging. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">You go there by quietness and not thinking. So you come 
      through the door of your inner home where you can reside at will, at any 
      time. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">If you know that home, that place, it means when you do 
      come out of there into the world, where you work hard, strive and struggle 
      for the sake of other beings; at least you’ve got a place to come back to, 
      a refuge, a home. When we don’t have that refuge, that home, we don’t know 
      how to escape from the turmoil of life. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">In the suttas, the Buddha said you should know the 
      gratification, the danger and the escape from these worldly things. You 
      can understand the gratification; you can understand the danger of the 
      worldly ways, but please know how to escape as well. I have taught you the 
      escape; it is going to the inner home. So once you know that inner home 
      and are familiar with it, you can always go back there anytime. It’s a 
      place of rest, and the real refuge of the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha. One 
      who sees the Dhamma sees the Buddha, it’s not Gotama the Buddha who passed 
      away in Nibb<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā</FONT>na thousands of years 
      ago. One sees the Dhamma inside one’s heart, that state of freedom, that 
      knowing, that awakening, that liberation, which is the real refuge. That’s 
      what connects you and all the others to the Ariyas in the world; it is the 
      ‘Ariya Sangha inside the heart’. That’s why it’s a refuge, because it’s 
      deep within. You know it’s a refuge because whatever you are doing outside 
      in the world, you can always come home and put your feet up as it were. We 
      can come home to have a cup of tea and to really relax in the refuge of 
      our real home. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">When you go out of your home every morning – I don’t mean 
      your house I mean your inner home – you go out to do your duties and your 
      work. But you know you’ve always got a place to come back to, a place of 
      rest and peace. This is what we do in the world. I go to Sydney this 
      afternoon. I go to work over there but I take my inner home with me. At 
      any time if you feel tired or stressed, you can go back into your inner 
      home. It’s a marvellous resource. Sometimes, as a senior monk, you do a 
      great deal, and you get very tired physically. What you need to do then is 
      just go into your inner home and rest there for awhile. When you come out 
      you can be so bright, so peaceful and so clear. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">That’s where the Dhamma comes from, from the inner home. I 
      remember once, many years ago, I went to Canberra to give some talks. 
      Canberra is a very cold and damp place. Not having been there before, of 
      course, I didn’t take all the proper cold weather gear. After only a 
      couple of days I got a terrible cold. The people in Canberra insisted on 
      taking me up to visit a monastery in Bundanoon, just for the day. The 
      people in this monastery insisted on keeping me there until really late, 
      and when they said good bye, they made a whole ceremony of saying good 
      bye. By the time I got back to Canberra where I was supposed to give a 
      talk, I hadn’t washed, hadn’t shaved, and I only had about a quarter of an 
      hour to drink a cup of tea. I had to give a public talk and I felt 
      absolutely terrible. My eyes were streaming; my nose was running; I was 
      sneezing; I was coughing. I had a very bad cold. But I had to give a talk. 
      I remember starting that talk, and I was absolutely hopeless. I just 
      couldn’t keep a train of thought going before I’d sneeze and my eyes would 
      be watering. People felt sorry for me, so I said, &quot;Okay, let’s stop the 
      talk and meditate for half an hour&quot;. We meditated for half an hour and I 
      went into my inner home. When I came out afterwards I was told that I gave 
      a really brilliant talk. My nose stopped running. I stopped sneezing. My 
      eyes stopped watering, and I was as happy as could be. That’s the resource 
      that you have available no matter what’s happening. Sometimes I have to 
      deal with bodily stress, and even worldly stress; but my resource is my 
      inner home. When you go out into the world you have a place, a resource, a 
      refuge. You can use that refuge skilfully. </P>
      <FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#000080"><B>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">A Sacred Place </P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">I keep encouraging all Buddhists to have a place in their 
      houses, if not a room, at least a corner of their house, which is their 
      shrine room, their religious room. I sometimes see how big people’s 
      bathrooms are. Sometimes they’re made of marble, and they have very fancy 
      taps and faucets. What are they used for? People use that place to clean 
      up their bodies! </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">People also have these amazing kitchens, and lounge rooms, 
      and games rooms, and playrooms, and TV rooms, and dining rooms, and huge, 
      huge bedrooms, with on-suites. But very few houses have got a spiritual 
      room. A room set aside just for the cultivation of Dhamma or religious 
      practice. They don’t have a spiritual haven in their house, a place where 
      they’re not cleaning their bodies, but they are cleaning their minds. They 
      don’t have a place where they’re not feeding their stomach, but they are 
      feeding their heart. I think that it is so necessary in today’s world, to 
      have a meditation room, a shrine room – just a place of peace and silence.
      </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">If you really haven’t got a room in your house to do that, 
      ask yourself, &quot;Do I need all these other rooms&quot;? Are they really all that 
      important, an office and all that other stuff? Put the office in a corner 
      of your bedroom, and put your meditation room in your office. What is more 
      important to you? But if you haven’t got the room, at least use a corner 
      of some quiet room, a quiet space, where you can put your Buddha statue or 
      your pictures, and your Dhamma books. Have that as a sacred space in your 
      house, a place where you can go at any time. After a while by sitting 
      there regularly; chanting there, even reading Dhamma books there, it 
      builds up power. and becomes a power spot in your house. A place where you 
      can just sit, because the only thing you ever do there is: to meditate, to 
      chant, to read Dhamma books, to quieten down. It becomes psychologically 
      empowered as a place of peace. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">I’ve been teaching in this way for many years now, 
      encouraging people to build these places in their houses, or in the 
      corners of their rooms. People have told me amazing stories of what 
      happens when they have these quiet places. Whenever they get uptight, or 
      tense, or have an argument with their wife, or husband, they just retreat 
      into their quiet corner and sit down to meditate for awhile. It saves many 
      marriages, and so much pain. One family told me once, that their young son 
      and daughter were having an argument, a fight. The son hit the daughter, 
      or something, smacked her one, and instead of smacking him back she ran up 
      into her mother’s bedroom, and sat in the sacred spot and meditated for a 
      few minutes. The parents where so impressed, because they had never taught 
      her to do this. She just felt that when she was so disappointed, when she 
      was so afraid, when she was so uptight, that that was the place to go. 
      It’s marvellous for your family if you can have a place like that, so that 
      people in your family; if not yourself, your partner or children, will 
      have a place, a refuge, which reminds them of their inner home. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">When you have a place in your house that is a sacred 
      place, make sure you don’t use it for anything else. Please, respect the 
      sacredness of that area. Don’t use it to listen to the radio or CD’s or to 
      write books or anything else. <I>It’s a sacred place</I>, a place for 
      doing nothing, a place of relaxation. Every where else in the world you 
      have to strive, you have to exert control, you have to do your duties, and 
      do the work that is expected of you. You have to endure silly people 
      telling you to do stupid things. But the fact is that when you go to your 
      little corner, you can be at peace there and let go. It’s your little 
      monastery, your little refuge, the ‘Vultures Peak’ in your house, and that 
      helps enormously. This is a bit of skilful advice for you. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Sometimes we can find a suitable place even when we are 
      not in our own house, even when we are at our place of work. I read 
      recently of one person who did a very skilful thing to be able to meditate 
      at work. This particular person couldn’t find a place to meditate. He 
      couldn’t sit and meditate in his office, because you know what it’s like 
      in the world. You are sitting in your office doing nothing, and someone 
      will come up to you and ask for your help. They will not leave you alone, 
      because everyone is busy and they think you are not doing anything, so you 
      must be free. Not free at peace, but free to help them. &quot;You’re not doing 
      anything at the moment; can you give us a hand?&quot; They don’t realize that 
      doing nothing by meditating is so important and valuable. People don’t 
      respect peace in our society; they think it’s copping out. That’s why busy 
      people tend to make other people busy because they don’t respect 
      peacefulness. So this man decided that every hour on the hour he would 
      close his eyes and meditate for one minute. It couldn’t be <I>exactly </I>
      on the hour, because if there were a telephone conversation, or a meeting 
      with a client, or something, he would just postpone it for a while. But in 
      every hour he would always meditate for one minute. He would close his 
      eyes and sit there at his desk, just being still and enjoying present 
      moment awareness, silence and the breath. That’s beautiful. He just had 
      one minute of silence and stillness. It worked so well that people walking 
      past seeing him with his eyes closed thought he was thinking about 
      something, or making a decision. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">People didn’t know what he was doing. Because it was not 
      for that long, they didn’t bother him. He had one minute of peace every 
      hour at work. In his office, nobody knew what he was up to, and he got 
      away with it. Just imagine if you went into the office and sat 
      cross-legged in the corner, your boss would come up and say, &quot;We are not 
      paying you to do that, get back on the computer and work.&quot; But that didn’t 
      happen. He just took one minute of silence in every hour at his desk; so 
      he was continually resting. After fifty-nine minutes of hard work he took 
      a one-minute break to collect himself, and to be still. This man found 
      that he had a lot more mindfulness for the fifty-nine minutes that 
      followed, and so he got much more done. He was more alert; he perceived 
      the problems quicker, he was actually a much better worker after that one 
      minute of silence. </P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Good Management </P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Many years ago when I was in Thailand, I was on a domestic 
      flight, from Ubon to Bangkok. I had been given a copy of the Bangkok Post 
      to read, and in the features section there was an article on the Oriental 
      Hotel in Bangkok. This is a very famous hotel. That year they had won a 
      prize, for the best hotel in the world! The people in Thailand were very, 
      very impressed, and pleased by this great award to one of their hotels. So 
      because of that, all sorts of feature articles were being written about 
      the Oriental Hotel. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The writer of this particular feature article interviewed 
      the manager, and asked him, &quot;Why did your hotel win this great prize this 
      year? What is your secret? Tell us some of the things that you did to make 
      your hotel good enough to win an international prize&quot;. One of the things 
      the manager said he did was that every year he sends each one of his staff 
      – from the porters, and cleaners, to the concierge, the cooks, and the 
      managers – to a monastery for one week to meditate. It’s not time taken 
      off their holidays; it’s at the company’s expense. He was then asked why 
      he did that. The interviewer wanted to know whether he was a 
      fundamentalist Buddhist, wanting to convert all of his staff. &quot;No&quot; he 
      said, and went on to explain that it’s just basic good management. The 
      one-week spent in the monastery meditating means that the staff doesn’t 
      take sick leave so often, and they don’t get so upset with each other. 
      There is no conflict in the workforce, and they are also much more 
      sensitive to the needs of the guests who are staying in the hotel. They 
      are just better people; they are happier people. Managing a hotel, you 
      don’t want the people who are working there to be grumpy all the time; you 
      want the guests to be met with a smile. You want to see the people happy; 
      they work harder as a result. It is basic good management to send your 
      workers to a meditation retreat once every year. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">It’s a shame I didn’t keep a copy of that article. You 
      could have photocopied it and given it to your boss. Then next year, you 
      could come to this retreat on company time. You could say to your boss, 
      &quot;Can you pay the two hundred and thirty dollars please? It’s in your 
      interest!&quot; The point of the story was that the hotel manager valued the 
      results of meditation in daily life. He could actually see it in the prize 
      his hotel won that year. He could see it in the greater efficiency, care 
      and sensitivity of his staff. Whatever line of work you’re in, when you 
      have that attitude; it gets done more quickly and with more happiness. 
      Whether its: abbot work, anag<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā</FONT>rika 
      work, mother work, husband work, manager work, or washing up dishes work; 
      whatever you do, you find you are a more efficient person. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">When you understand things in this way you can see the 
      connections between the meditation life and the work life. Sometimes, 
      there isn’t such a big cut off from one to the other. It is as if in your 
      schizophrenic life, now you’re a meditator, now you’re a frantic worker. 
      You find that you can work more efficiently with a clear peaceful mind, so 
      that makes meditation valuable. You realize its value, not just for 
      Enlightenment, but in actually getting through life. It means that you do 
      more of it. </P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The Happiness of Meditation </P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">One of the things that I’ve always stressed about 
      meditation is the happiness of meditation. It’s meant to be fun. It <I>
      should </I>be fun. Last night one of the monks told me a story about Ajahn 
      Mun, which I hadn’t heard before. Ajahn Mun was a great Thai Meditation 
      Master. A monk who had spent a long time with him, and knew him very well, 
      said that the Ajahn had a great sense of humour, and laughed a lot, it was 
      a great big laugh, an infectious laugh. I never knew that about Ajahn Mun. 
      But it makes a lot of sense, because that’s what <I>Arahants </I>do, they 
      laugh a lot and they smile a lot. I know this is a bit cheeky but 
      sometimes they are called <I>‘Ha Ha harahants’</I>. I’m going to get into 
      trouble for that, but I don’t care. It was lovely to hear that story. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Happiness is an important thing in meditation. If you get 
      happiness in meditation early on in your practise, you will always want to 
      meditate. It’s not a case of getting up in the morning and saying, &quot;Oh, 
      I’ve got to do my meditation now. I must get this out of the way so that I 
      can go to breakfast.&quot; You know how it is? You do your half an hour every 
      day just like taking medicine. It’s not like that at all. If you really 
      understand what meditation is, you love doing meditation. You just want to 
      do it. Sometimes you have to get your breakfast out of the way to get to 
      your meditation, or you have to get your work out of the way to get to 
      your meditation. It’s just you doing it. You sit on your chair, or your 
      stool, or your cushion, and your mind just leaps towards silence. The 
      Buddha said that when the mind leaps, or jumps, to quietness, to 
      stillness, to non-doing, that’s a great stage on the path of wisdom, on 
      the path to Enlightenment. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Hopefully I’ve conditioned many of you strongly enough for 
      you to realize how beautiful that silence is. So that in moments during 
      your day, when you have nothing to do, your mind leaps towards the 
      opportunity for stillness, instead of trying to fill those gaps up with 
      stupid things, pointless things, which are just mindless distractions. It 
      jumps at the chance; it goes into stillness, steadiness, peace and 
      freedom. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">This is the sign of a practitioner, someone who is on the 
      path. This is the sign of someone who has sufficient wisdom so that their 
      mind recognizes what’s in its own interest. So that in the mornings, or 
      the evenings, the mind just leaps towards your meditation cushion. Your 
      meditation is not medicinal, not some sort of punishment, not some sort of 
      penance, it’s something you just want to do. The reason some people don’t 
      go to church if they are Christians, is because it’s boring, they don’t 
      like to go there. They don’t leap up because it’s Sunday and say, &quot;Let’s 
      go to church, let’s go there and listen to a good sermon&quot;. It has become 
      boring and cold. That’s why people have dropped away from the churches in 
      the West. People will also drop away from meditation quickly, and stop 
      meditating unless they get fun out of it. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">So developing fun in your meditation at home and here, 
      wherever you are, is the way of continuing that practice. Little by 
      little, as you continue the practice in the world, keep it up for the sake 
      of fun, for the sake of peace, for the sake of a place of freedom. You’ve 
      no other choice, you just have to. Some people say, and I understand this 
      very well, because it was the same when I was a lay person, that if you 
      don’t meditate for one day, it’s like not eating. Your heart feels sick, 
      it’s got no strength, and you find yourself getting grumpy, getting angry, 
      because you are not getting that feed of happiness. It doesn’t matter if 
      people tell you that you are addicted to meditation. Great! Be addicted to 
      peace, to happiness. Be addicted to freedom, it’s a nice thing to be 
      addicted to. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Some people say you should not attach to these things, and 
      they quote the simile of the raft. The Buddha said that the raft was just 
      for crossing the river from one shore to the other, but that you should 
      not cling onto that raft. (MN 22.13) You have to let go of the raft once 
      you’ve crossed over to the other shore. But of course you should not throw 
      the raft away in the middle of the river! That’s what a lot of people do. 
      So attach to this raft, attach to your meditation, attach to your 
      precepts, and attach to goodness. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Understand from this simile the importance of those 
      peaceful states, the importance of goodness. and then you will get the pay 
      off. Recall the moral precepts. Recall the goodness, the generosity, the 
      kindness, and the selflessness, that you have done throughout the year. 
      Then you will get the pay off in your meditation. The pay off is that 
      beautiful mind. You understand that this beautiful mind is why we keep 
      precepts, why we are generous, why we give, why we give of ourselves, why 
      we forgive others, and why we forgive ourselves. It’s all part of Dana, 
      all part of giving. It’s why we practise loving kindness and give people 
      the benefit of the doubt. We give our happiness and share our merits with 
      others. Why do we do this? We do that because we see that it actually 
      makes this mind so beautiful. You feel it in daily life; you have 
      something inside of you that you feel very, very proud of. It’s good to 
      feel proud of goodness. </P>
      <FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#000080"><B>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">That Which is Worthy of Praise </P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Goodness is worthy of praise. Good meditation is worthy of 
      praise, and that’s why you should praise yourself. Tell yourself how good 
      meditation is, how wonderful it is. Then you will do it again and again. 
      The mind feeds on praise, feeds on joy. Use that as a skilful means to 
      encourage yourself more, and more, and more. We even have a word in 
      Buddhism, S<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā</FONT>dhu, S<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā</FONT>dhu, 
      S<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā</FONT>dhu, well done, well done, well 
      done! You have heard that so many times. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Buddhism is into praise, into encouragement, because it 
      works. So worship that which is worthy of worship. Don’t praise foolish 
      people; don’t praise sports stars, who win cups, or film stars, or 
      whatever. If someone wins a war, don’t praise that sort of stuff. <I>
      Praise those who are worthy of praise</I>. It’s not worth praising those 
      worldly qualities. If you’ve become a millionaire, that’s not worthy of 
      praise. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">What is worthy of praise? The person who has just given 
      flowers to the shrine, or somebody who has worked so hard on the 
      meditation cushion is worthy of praise. Maybe, it was the first time they 
      have been on a retreat, and they have done so well. That’s worthy of 
      praise. Someone who has for the very first time maintained a mind in the 
      present moment, even if just for a while during this whole nine day 
      retreat, that’s worthy of praise. Praise that which is worthy of praise. 
      Work at that which is truly workable, and then you encourage yourself, and 
      you encourage good qualities in the world. It means that your meditation 
      becomes strong. Goodness becomes strong. Virtue becomes strong. Not only 
      does it mean that your happiness level rises in life, but it also means 
      that when you come to a meditation retreat, you’ve done all of the 
      background work. You come into the retreat not just with an empty hand, 
      but with all these great spiritual qualities, with this great spiritual 
      wealth, with all this goodness that you have done. </P>
      <FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#000080"><B>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Practising Virtue </P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">In the deep meditations, especially the stages of nimittas 
      and Jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā</FONT>nas, your mind becomes 
      powerful, strong and beautiful. But also nimittas come up earlier than 
      expected; they burst through the breath simply because they are just too 
      powerful to ignore. But if nimittas don’t come, or when they come, they 
      are very weak, that may mean that your mind is not pure enough, not strong 
      enough. The mind is not empowered enough by goodness, by virtue, by 
      purity, by strength. When one realises this, one also realises that one 
      doesn’t keep the precepts just to go to heaven. One cannot meditate and 
      just forget the precepts as being a ‘cultural accretion’ to Buddhism. You 
      don’t keep the precepts just because it says so in the scriptures, or 
      because a monk says so. You can see first hand, that one of the reasons 
      why you have to keep these precepts is to have success in your meditation.
      </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">When you see that connection at first hand, you also see 
      the importance of not only keeping precepts, but also of actually doing 
      the opposite of violating the precepts. The opposite of killing is helping 
      people, saving peoples lives, and helping their pain by looking after 
      them. Compassion is the opposite of killing. The opposite of stealing is 
      generosity, not just, not taking from others, but also giving to others. 
      The opposite of adultery is faithful commitment, and keeping your 
      promises. The opposite of lying is being truthful, and speaking kindly to 
      each other. Never saying a word you would not like to have said to 
      yourself. And lastly, the opposite of taking alcohol and drugs that cloud 
      the mind is developing mindfulness, and practising meditation, which 
      clears the mind. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Our practise of virtue is not just avoiding that which is 
      bad; it’s also putting forth effort, and doing that which is good. It’s an 
      active aspect of our lives, supporting: the community, the Buddhist 
      Society, the monastery, our parents, the elderly, or whatever else we can 
      do. We actually go out there and do something rather than thinking, &quot;Look 
      at me, I’m so good, I don’t kill, I don’t steal, I don’t commit adultery, 
      I don’t lie, I don’t take alcohol and drugs. I don’t speak to anybody. I 
      stay in my little home all by myself all day and all night&quot;. But that&#39;s 
      not good enough! Is it? </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Those of you, who have known me for a long time, know just 
      how busy I have been, especially in the first years of building our 
      monastery in Serpentine. That really was hard work, working all day from 
      early in the morning to late at night, and then washing in the cold lake, 
      with the wind as a chill factor as well. We used to work all day and we 
      hardly slept because we slept outside in the wind. We would wake up in the 
      middle of the night and be awake for the rest of the night. On Friday 
      evenings, we used to go to our small City Centre, in North Perth. I looked 
      forward to that very much, because first of all we could have a hot shower 
      for the first time in the week, and wash all the dirt away, and then we 
      could have a proper sleep and catch up. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">It was very hard in those days, and sometimes I thought I 
      was sacrificing my meditation. I thought that I was working too hard, and 
      having no time for myself. Whenever we got back in the evening, we just 
      crashed out until four o’clock in the morning, and then we pulled 
      ourselves out of bed for another days work. It was so hard. I thought I 
      was getting nowhere. But the surprise came when I had a week off. When I 
      sat down to meditate I went straight back again to the beautiful nimittas, 
      and I had a beautiful meditation. I couldn’t really believe it at first. 
      What’s going on? I hadn’t been meditating for weeks, for months, not 
      really continuously. I had been trying but only getting very sleepy. But 
      as soon as I had the time, I was right back there again. At the time I 
      didn’t really understand why. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Why was it so easy to meditate after such a long period of 
      hard work? Of course, it was because I had been building up the virtue, 
      building up the power of the mind. I was being selfless, giving myself up 
      to one of the greatest acts of good kamma in the world – building a 
      monastery. It was a huge act of good kamma. I was actually helping, and I 
      was giving it all my effort, I was also making huge amounts of good kamma. 
      So when I stopped working that beautiful mind was right there, and it just 
      burst into my consciousness. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">I realized then, as I’ve realized many times since, that 
      you don’t lose anything by giving to others. It’s not as if you lose your 
      energy, you gain more energy. People sometimes say, &quot;Ajahn Brahm worked so 
      hard on the retreat, and gave two talks a day as well as all the 
      interviews&quot;. If you count how many hours I gave, it is in fact quite a lot 
      of hours. Actually in the workforce, you probably wouldn’t be expected do 
      as much work as this. Nevertheless, I get so much happiness out of it. If 
      you get happiness out of it then it is good kamma, and whenever you do 
      stop, you get into a beautiful space. I love doing these retreats. They 
      are my holiday, because I get beautiful meditations. You’ve got the 
      opportunity to brighten up your mind by giving even more. </P>

      Accompanied by Virtue </P>
      </FONT></B>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Don’t make too much of the distinction between meditation 
      and the life outside. Make the life outside a support for meditation. Keep 
      your precepts, but also do good things as well. Be of service to the 
      community. Then just start watching the breath and you’ll find these 
      beautiful mind states will come up. Such purity! Such inspiration! Wow! 
      This is so nice, where did that come from? It came from all that 
      selflessness, all that giving, all that pure heartedness. The Buddha said 
      that sam<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā</FONT>dhi meditation, when it is 
      empowered and accompanied by virtue is a great fruit, a great benefit. You 
      can understand that when virtue is behind your meditation, and the 
      goodness is strong, then wisdom comes from sam<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā</FONT>dhi. 
      It’s the practice that is empowered by wisdom, which leads to the 
      destruction of the outflowings of the mind, and the defilements of being, 
      of ignorance and delusion. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Therefore as a practitioner you should practice virtue, 
      Make it complete. You should practise meditation. Make it complete. You 
      should practice wisdom and make it complete for the sake of Enlightenment. 
      But certainly you can see how virtue supports sam<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā</FONT>dhi. 
      So living in the world you can practise meditation, by practising its 
      supports, by making sure that you’re virtuous and good. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">That’s how you should take what you’ve learned on this 
      retreat back out into the world. There are always occasions when you can 
      practise virtue. There is always someone in the office, at home, or 
      someone you meet, who will need your time, who you can care for. Don’t 
      think that you are neglecting your meditation. What you are doing is 
      building the supports for meditation, building the supports for freedom, 
      building the supports for Nibb<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā</FONT>na. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The Buddha said that even monks and nuns should not 
      neglect to make merit, to make puñña. When I first heard that I was 
      astounded. I thought at that time that merit was just what lay people did. 
      I thought that traditional Buddhism, going to the temples, offering d<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā</FONT>na, 
      taking the Five Precepts and doing the chanting, was lay people’s stuff. 
      But it’s monk stuff as well, it’s everybody’s stuff. It is empowering the 
      mind, and you will find the fruits of it when you do your meditation. On 
      retreats such as this, you see the big picture. You see how all this 
      meditation, all this virtue, leads to wisdom, to insight and how that 
      leads to real freedom. It leads to freedom from the defilements, freedom 
      from the <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā</FONT>savas, the outflows of the 
      mind, freedom from rebirth, and the end of sams<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā</FONT>ra. 
      Whether you are a monk or a lay person, once you see the problem, once you 
      see what is really happening, then you see where truth, happiness and 
      freedom really lie. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">There comes a time when you can’t ever forget these 
      teachings, a time when you can’t really throw them away. They keep coming 
      back up, again and again and again. A person I knew came to the Buddhist 
      Society in the early days and then they left and didn’t practise for three 
      or four years. Then they came back again, and said to me, &quot;You know even 
      though I tried, I could not forget these teachings&quot;. You can’t put them 
      aside. What has happened is that they have been recorded inside of you, as 
      the recognition of a truth, the recognition of real happiness, and of the 
      path to freedom. It’s happened to me and it’s also happened too many of 
      you in your meditation, which seems so pure, which promises that freedom. 
      You may not be able to put your finger on it and explain it to yourself 
      all that well, but it’s real; it’s there. </P>
      <FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#000080"><B>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">A Moment of Peace </P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The first time I meditated was amazing! The first ten 
      minutes of it is etched into my mind forever. It was in the Wordsworth 
      Room in Kings College at Cambridge University in England. Even now, I can 
      recall that room, where for the first time I went to do some meditation. I 
      never got into Jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā</FONT>nas or anything like 
      that, but it just felt so good. It felt so peaceful, and from that moment 
      on I was hooked. It is strange how this moment of peace rang so many bells 
      inside me, which shows us that, hang on, this <I>is </I>the way to peace. 
      It’s the purest thing I have ever seen, this is real freedom. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The Buddha said &quot;Taste the freedom&quot;. When you have just a 
      small taste of that freedom, it remains in one’s mind forever. One has to 
      develop that, and cultivate it until one doesn’t only get the taste, one 
      gets the whole meal. And that meal does its job, filling the mind with 
      wisdom, and giving full and true liberation. So each one of us – whether 
      we are a monk or a lay person – is on that path to Nibb<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā</FONT>na. 
      We have already gone too far to stop. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">When you’ve tasted some deeper meditation; you’ve tasted 
      something that far exceeds the power, the bliss and the freedom of 
      anything else in the world. The mind will incline to that. It has to keep 
      going back, sometimes in fits and starts, revisiting the experience. 
      Sometimes getting lost and not finding the way back there. But it won’t be 
      able to give up the struggle. It won’t be able to give up the task. It 
      will keep inclining towards Nibb<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā</FONT>na. 
      The experience will change your life style, little by little. You change 
      your life style to fit the path to Nibb<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā</FONT>na.
      </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">You can’t find enough opportunities to help people, or to 
      do generous work, and you look upon it as being a privilege not a chore. 
      If you join a committee it’s a privilege. If you help the community in 
      some way, you say, &quot;Thank you for asking me, it’s a wonderful thing that I 
      can do this for somebody else&quot;. You do good acts and you are generous, 
      because it’s such a wonderful thing to do. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">In Buddhism it is sometimes said that Stream-winners (Sot<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā</FONT>panna) 
      have got to be looked after by the Sangha. There was the case once of a 
      family in the time of the Buddha, who were supposed to be Stream-winners, 
      they always gave so much to the Sangha on alms round. They were quite poor 
      and they didn’t have that much to eat themselves. Lay people started 
      criticising the monks, saying, &quot;It’s good that you receive these things, 
      but those people don’t have enough to eat themselves&quot;. So the Buddha 
      called a meeting and laid down a rule for that sort of situation. The 
      Sangha agreed that in those circumstances they should have compassion for 
      the family, and not be allowed to accept so much from them. Sometimes it 
      is like that when you have so much faith. You think it’s much better to 
      give your food to the Sangha, than to eat it yourself. It’s much better to 
      go hungry. &quot;Please take it. I get so much more happiness from giving, I 
      can eat any day, so please give me the chance to make more merit. Please! 
      Please! Please!&quot; </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">So the monks had to say, &quot;Now hold on, the Buddha said we 
      can’t do this, it comes from the Buddha, so we can’t argue about that&quot;. 
      That’s what happens when we really understand what these things are about. 
      Sometimes you’ve got to restrain people. I’m talking mostly about those 
      people who would give anything; they would give the shirt off their backs, 
      and the food from their plates. Sometimes they even give their lives. 
      Those people may become poor, but their nimittas are just something to 
      behold. Wow! Who cares about being hungry when you’ve got beautiful 
      nimittas? Wow! That’s really nice. That’s purity. This is actually 
      inspirational merit making, and we need to be inspired like that when we 
      get into Jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā</FONT>nas. </P>
      <FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#000080"><B>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Inspirational Emotions </P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Don’t be afraid of the inspirational emotions. If you have 
      the chance to go to the Holy Places in India, or to some of the old 
      monasteries in Sri Lanka, Burma or Thailand, get your money’s worth. Get 
      in there and cry your eyes out. Get really inspired. Imagine the Buddha 
      sitting there; imagine Ajahn Chah teaching the monks in the forest in the 
      early days. Just allow the piti, the joy, to come up through the whole 
      body and flow right through you. You get so inspired. People don’t know 
      these days how to correctly indulge in the positive emotions, of 
      inspiration, joy and faith. They are called powers, controlling faculties, 
      and they are what really make the meditation buzz along. <I>It’s the fast 
      track to Enlightenment</I>. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">So go to those places and get joy, get inspiration. When 
      you read the suttas, or you chant, chant with your heart, not just your 
      mouth. Don’t worry about what it sounds like ‘outside’, be concerned with 
      what it sounds like ‘inside’, and with where it’s coming from. It’s great 
      to be able to chant and understand the meaning. You get so high, so 
      beautifully high, and that’s a pure emotion. So out there in the world, 
      develop pure emotions and inspirations. They can only be good, and they 
      lead to Nibb<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā</FONT>na. </P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">So, these are some practices that you can take out into 
      the world. You can do them any old time. <I>In particular, there is so 
      much opportunity to do the first two stages of meditation: Present Moment 
      Awareness and Silence</I>. When you are working at your desk, practise 
      present moment awareness, work silently. You will get so much more done. 
      When you are driving your car turn the radio off. Turn the CD off. Don’t 
      even listen to a Dhamma talk by Ajahn Brahm. Listen to the silence, 
      because all you would hear anyway is Ajahn Brahm telling you to be quiet. 
      Anyone who really understands would say, &quot;Oh that’s right&quot;, and just turn 
      it off. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">There are so many opportunities in life to actually 
      practice present moment awareness, and the mindfulness of silence. There 
      are so many times and opportunities during the day to let go. Even if you 
      are late for work, sometimes you just can’t do anything about it; let go. 
      Worrying about it doesn’t get you there any faster. See if you can learn 
      to just be at peace in the world, and try to put these suggestions into 
      your practice. Practise non-controlling, letting go. There are so many 
      opportunities in life. Many times there is nothing you can do. There is no 
      way you can get the aircraft to move faster because you are late. You 
      can’t go up to the captain and ask him to go faster, you just can’t do 
      that in life, that’s why you have to let go. We all have to let go of some 
      things in life, so we might as well start now. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">You’ve learnt how to let go of a lot in this meditation 
      retreat. When you go outside, you’ve learnt the skill of letting go of 
      things that you can’t control. You’ve done that for all of the retreat, so 
      now you can do it. That really helps you in the world outside. Things you 
      can’t do anything about, just let go. If it’s your husband, or your wife, 
      if you can’t do anything about them, just let them go. If your children 
      are messing around and you can’t do much about them, just let them go. 
      Through your practise, you know the skills of letting go. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">With children, you can always use the simile of the water 
      buffalo. At one time in Thailand, a man was taking his water buffalo out 
      to the fields to graze. The water buffalo became very excited and ran off. 
      The man tried to stop him. <I>Just try stopping a water buffalo</I>. Think 
      how big a water buffalo is. It’s huge, and this was just a small Thai 
      farmer. He held onto the rope. The rope became twisted around his finger 
      and pulled his finger off! He came into the monastery missing half a 
      finger. Obviously, there was blood everywhere, and quite a lot of pain. 
      The abbot took him to the local hospital and got him patched up. The 
      farmer was okay afterwards. But that was a great metaphor which he gave 
      us. The metaphor was that you are foolish to try to stop a water buffalo; 
      it will just pull your fingers off. Your husband, your wife, your 
      children, and sometimes your mind are like a water buffalo. If you try and 
      stop them, what happens is that something is ‘pulled off’, and you get a 
      lot of pain and suffering. What happens if you do let the water buffalo 
      go? The water buffalo only runs about half a kilometre or so down the 
      road. It doesn’t go that far. It stops and settles itself down, and then 
      you can walk gently up to it and pull it back again. It’s stopped, and 
      it’s easy to control. Sometimes that’s what you need to do with husbands, 
      and wives, and kids. They run off, and then they stop and you can pull 
      them in. Often, the mind is like that in meditation; it’s running off into 
      thoughts and fantasies. Let it go. Don’t let it pull your finger off. Once 
      it’s gone a little way down the road, when it’s stopped and it’s had its 
      little bit of fun, okay now bring it back to the silence. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">That’s actually a nice simile for your life. You’re 
      learning how to let go. You can do that in your mind. You can also do that 
      with other things in life, and become a much more peaceful person and a 
      much more efficient manager. You can become: a manager of your husband, a 
      manager of your wife, a manager of your kids, a manager of your accounts, 
      a manager of your life. I often say meditation is like a microcosm of the 
      real world, if you know how to meditate, you know how to live. If you know 
      how to let go and be at peace, you know everything you need to know about 
      living in the world. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">You can live a very happy life, a very beautiful life, 
      even if you want to take it that one step further and become Enlightened. 
      You know how to do that too. <I>It’s the same process only intensified</I>. 
      So that’s what you do out there in the world; don’t think it’s going to be 
      too much of a transition to be outside. It’s going to be a jolt to the 
      system but actually you’ll learn to adapt. You can be at peace among the 
      peaceful. You can work with the people who are working, and laugh with 
      those who are laughing. You can be sympathetic to those who are crying, 
      and you have all the resources to help and serve in the world. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">I mentioned at the beginning of this retreat that there is 
      no difference between vipassan<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ā</FONT> 
      meditation, and samatha meditation. Now I’ll also add that there is no 
      difference between the Bodhisatta way, and the Arahant way. All these are 
      just differences which people make because they don’t really understand. 
      The best thing that you can do for the whole world, the best gift you can 
      give to others, is to become Enlightened, so that you can have huge 
      compassion and huge resources of wisdom to share with others. You become 
      Enlightened for your own sake, and for the sake of others. There is no 
      difference between these two ways. People make all these differences. So 
      go out there into the world, and for your own sake become Enlightened, and 
      become Enlightened for the sake of others. </P>
      <FONT SIZE="6">
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">T</FONT>hat’s the path and that’s the way. If you haven’t 
      got your ‘pay cheque yet’, don’t worry, it is coming. It might come on 
      Saturday. Leave your address and the postman will come sometime. </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">I hope you have had a very lovely retreat. There are still 
      a few hours to go. So just be alert, the postman might be knocking soon.
