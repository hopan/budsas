    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><I></I><B></B><FONT SIZE="6">A</FONT> noble follower 
      paying obeisance to the Buddha, Dhamma and the Sangha would always begin 
      by chanting with faith the Nine Special Qualities of the Buddha in 
      veneration.
      <P>There he recollects the fourth sublime virtue of the Buddha as the 
      virtue of Sugato. The uniqueness of the word Sugato is mainly attributed 
      to the Bosat as an aspirant to Buddhahood, striving on with diligence to 
      perfect himself in the journey through samsara or the repeated cycles of 
      Birth and Death adhering to pleasant manners and habits. </P>
      <P>From the time the Bosat made His firm resolve at the feet of the Buddha 
      Dipankara countless aeons earlier He remained steadfast to His noble 
      resolve, existence after existence or the samsara to the moment of 
      Full-Enlightenment or Buddhahood at Buddhagaya. </P>
      <P>Plunging into samsara, He never turned back midway or gave up His noble 
      strife of attaining Buddhahood. His manner of going about was pleasant 
      throughout samsara striving for perfection and had gone to an excellent 
      state, the attainment of the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana, the Deathlessness.
      </P>
      <P>It must be mentioned that through countless aeons of time the 
      Bodhisatva followed the path to Buddhahood fulfilling the Ten Virtues 
      (Paramitas) to perfection amidst many sacrifices. </P>
      <P>He had trodden upon the path of detachment, the Noble Eightfold Path or 
      the Middle Path. Avoiding the two extremes of self indulgence and self 
      mortification, the Bosat discovered and followed the Middle Path in 
      eradicating all defilements and attaining Samma Sambodhi, the perfect 
      Enlightenment. </P>
      <P>He had gone correctly and never did He ever go back to the defilements 
      which He had abandoned. Thus Sugato means &#39;Well-Gone&#39; (Sobhana-Gaman). The 
      Bosat adhered to pleasant manners and habits in going through all His 
      endeavours. </P>
      <P>By complete destruction of cravings connected with the wrong view of an 
      everlasting soul and the wrong view of Nihilism or the non-existence of a 
      soul, the Buddha took the Middle path to attain Nirvana. It was the Noble 
      Eightfold Path, the path taken by the Buddhas. For this reason too, He is 
      called Sugato. </P>
      <P>During His lifetime He worked steadfast to enlighten mankind of the 
      transient nature of all component things in the universe. He suffered the 
      insults and humiliations of His fellow men at times, but more from 
      sympathy with the sufferings of others, wandering from place to place, 
      sleeping only for about one and a half hours at night, carried forward His 
      selfless service for the good and happiness of mankind for forty five long 
      years. Thus His great service to humanity is also defined in Sugato. </P>
      <P>The Buddha was also endowed with incomparable physical beauty. An aura 
      consisting of six colours surrounded the Buddha radiating over quite a 
      distance. All along the pathways it dazzled with splendour wherever the 
      Buddha walked. Therefore, Sugato also means excellent and beautiful. </P>
      <P>His walk was graceful and the measured treading of the feet was gentle 
      and steady. It has been said that no foot prints were visible on the 
      ground where the Buddha traversed and He always proceeded without blemish. 
      Even the soles of His sacred feet never got soiled of dust or dirt. </P>
      <P>As a result of accumulated meritorious deeds in His sojourn through 
      samsara, it was said that mounds of earth and the troughs along those 
      ancient gravel roads as well as the rugged surfaces were spontaneously 
      created into smooth paved pathways, where the Buddha was journeying 
      through. Thus He advanced majestically on His missions unscathed. </P>
      <P>The Compassionate Teacher in focusing His visual perceptions at a close 
      range ahead (an extent of Sathara Riyans or two yards) would lead the 
      procession of the Sangha to expound the Dhamma while His depth of insight 
      penetrated into the true nature of the whole world. </P>
      <P>Many were drawn to the Buddha due to His faultless supreme voice the 
      uniqueness of which was described with relevance to eight great qualities 
      known as the &quot;Brahma Swara&quot;. (This is well defined in the virtue of 
      Bhagava, the ninth great virtue of the Supreme Buddha). </P>
      <P>Though the Buddha spoke in the Pali Language, it was said that each one 
      heard the Dhamma in his own language. All these qualities too attribute to 
      the virtue of Sugato. </P>
      <P>The arrival of the Blessed One accompanied by His disciples to preach 
      the Dhamma to His followers would have been a magnificent sight. Deities 
      from the six Heavenly Realms and the men paid reverence with flowers and 
      incense wherever the Buddha set foot. </P>
      <P>They accursed much merit in doing so. Furthermore His speech too was 
      Sublime - Sugato. The Buddha adhered to certain moral principles in the 
      choice of His words, conducive to good and well-being of His followers. Of 
      His method of Preaching, it was said: Such speech as the Blessed One knows 
      to be false and untrue, harmful to people, displeasing and unwelcome to 
      the listener, He did not speak and refrained from using. </P>
      <P>Such speech as was true but harmful to people, displeasing and 
      unwelcome to the listener, He did not use. </P>
      <P>Such speech as He knew to be true, conducive to good, yet displeasing 
      and unwelcome, He knew when to speak. Such speech as was untrue and 
      incorrect, harmed others, yet pleasing and welcome to still others, He did 
      not use. Such speech as He knew to be true, but harmful, though pleasing 
      and welcome to still others, He also did not speak. </P>
      <P>And of speech He knew to be true, pleasing and welcome, contributes to 
      the good of others, He knew the time and where to speak. The Buddha thus 
      displayed supremacy in addressing His followers transforming them to lead 
      righteous lives. He was Sugato, His speech too was sublime. </P>
      <P>Throughout its peaceful march for nearly 2,500 years, no conversion has 
      been made either by force or implementing other methods, such as favouring 
      charities to the poor and the needy with the ulterior motive of getting 
      them under one&#39;s control and unethically converted. </P>
      <P>Today the downtrodden are compelled to change their religion, under 
      obligation to such organizations. Living upon this planet amidst 
      catastrophes of great magnitude, the tsunamis, hurricanes tonados, 
      whirlwinds, floods, droughts, earthquakes, landslides, avalanches, wild 
      fires, heatwaves, volcano eruptions, infectious diseases, other fatal 
      accidents, strikes by lightning, acid rains, even explosions across the 
      cosmos with intense radiations, the sentient beings have no place to hide 
      themselves for protection. </P>
      <P>Furthermore considering other crisis with regard to food, energy, 
      pollution, poverty, shortage of water, rising sea levels due to global 
      warming etc. the human race should strive to lead the journey through this 
      short spell of life on a virtuous path - &quot;Shabana Gaman&quot;, the Path of 
      Sugato. </P>
