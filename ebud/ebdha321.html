      <td width="100%"><B></B><FONT SIZE="6">T</FONT>he term Brahma occurs 
      fairly frequently in Buddhist literature. There are many terms that are 
      prefixed with the word Brahma. Some of the well-known are Brahma-cariya, 
      Brahma-vihara, Brahma-kaya, Brahma-danda, Brahma-jala, Brahma-cakka and 
      Brahma-sara. Even the Brahma world as well as denizens of such worlds 
      known as Maha-brahma, Brahma-sahampati, Brahma-sanankumara are also 
      mentioned.
      <P>In phrases such as &#39;Brahmati matapitaro&#39;, the term Brahma is used to 
      give it a special ethical connotation. What we propose here is to examine 
      how this pre-Buddhist word came to be used in Buddhist literature and to 
      discuss the changes it has undergone in this process of adaptation. </P>
      <P>The 6th century B. C., the period to which the Buddha belongs is a 
      period in which Indian religious and philosophical scene underwent a 
      radical change. By this time the Brahmanic religious tradition had reached 
      a very high stage of development. It began with the Vedas and developed 
      through the Brahmanas, Aranyakas and reached its climax in the Upanishads.
      </P>
      <P>It was at such a time that the Buddha appeared on the religious scene 
      of India. During this period there were two distinct groups of religious 
      thinkers: one group advocating the belief that salvation had to be 
      attained through Karma marga or Yajan marga, i. e. through the path of 
      sacrifice; and the other holding that salvation is possible only through 
      the path of wisdom or Jnana-marga. </P>
      <P>Besides these two religious paths, both put forward by the Brahmins, 
      there was the path to salvation through ascetic practices put forward 
      mainly by such groups as Ajivakas, Paribbajakas, and Niganthas. The latter 
      group belonged mainly to the Sramana tradition which was opposed to the 
      Brahmana tradition. Even the Buddha belongs to this Sramana tradition. </P>
      <P>The Buddha who had mastered all the religious traditions of the time 
      not only rejected the prevalent views on salvation, but presented a novel 
      philosophy of emancipation. He discarded such views as divine creation, 
      belief in a permanent self, determinism and annihilationism, and presented 
      his teaching basing it on the fundamental doctrine of paticcasamuppada or 
      dependent co-origination. </P>
      <P>This fundamental doctrine formed the foundation for his other basic 
      teachings such as karma, rebirth and freedom. Even the theory and practice 
      of Buddhist ethics is founded on this doctrine of paticcasamuppada, which 
      is the central philosophy of Buddhism. </P>
      <P>The oldest scriptures that record the teachings of the Buddha are 
      referred to as the Tripitaka (Three Baskets) written in the Pali language. 
      When one examines the Tripitaka, it becomes quite clear that the Buddha&#39;s 
      teaching is basically different from Vedic and Brahmanic teachings. </P>
      <P>Yet, it becomes also clear that in spite of this difference, the Buddha 
      himself had to adapt and use certain cherished beliefs, concepts and terms 
      that were in vogue among the Brahmins, in order to put across his own 
      teachings. Among such pre-Buddhistic concepts, the Buddha adopted the 
      concept of Brahma occupies an important place. As mentioned before, the 
      word Brahmao ccurs frequently in pre-Buddhist as well as in Buddhist 
      literature indicating a wide variety of senses and context. </P>
      <P>(1) The technical terms used in Buddhist literature can be classified 
      into three groups. <BR>
      (2) The terms that are common in form as well as in meaning in both 
      Brahmanic and Buddhist literature. <BR>
      (3) The terms that are common in form, but different in meaning. </P>
      <B>
      <P>Terms that denote completely a Buddhist meaning. </P>
      </B>
      <P>According to this classification the term Brahma falls into the second 
      group. In Buddhism it is used in a sense quite different from the sense in 
      which it is used in Brahmanism. Both Brahma and Brahman connote the idea 
      of the Highest. In the earliest stages the term Brahman meant the 
      universe. Hence the first beginning of the Brahma ideal could be traced to 
      the Purusa Sukta which occurs in the 10th Mandala of the Rgveda. </P>
      <P>It alludes to some kind of primordial universal matter. Gradually this 
      idea developed and finally it came to be accepted that the Brahman or 
      Brahma is the source of the whole universe. In the early Brahmana period 
      Prajapati is considered more important and he is considered the primordial 
      being and Brahma occupies a secondary place. </P>
      <P>In the Satapatha Brahman it is clearly mentioned that Prajapati created 
      the Brahma. But in later Brahmana texts their positions were reversed, 
      Brahma superseding Prajapati, with Brahma being considered as the 
      foundation as well as the source of the universe. </P>
      <P>This idea reached its culmination in the Upanishad literature, where 
      reference is made to the undifferentiated unity of Brahman and Atman, that 
      is the Universal Soul and the Individual Soul, in other words, the 
      macrocosm and the microcosm. </P>
      <P>Brahman as the Cosmic Soul is universal, permanent, indestructible, 
      unique; it is the primordial essence, the ultimate ground of existence. 
      The final goal came to be considered as the realization of the unity 
      between Brahman and Atman; the realization of &quot;oneness&quot; between the 
      universal soul and the individual soul. </P>
      <P>The attainment of this undifferentiated unity is considered in the 
      Upanishads as the goal and ideal of all Brahmins. It was said that there 
      are two paths open to this goal. One is the path of Sacrifice (Yajna or 
      Karma-marga) and the other the Path of Knowledge (Jnana-marga). The latter 
      was followed by the Upanishad sages, the munis who practised severe 
      ascetic practices. </P>
      <P>The Buddha&#39;s attitude towards this long-cherished concept of Brahmais 
      two-fold. </P>
      <P>- Complete rejection of the Brahma concept. <BR>
      - Giving new meanings to certain ideas connected with the Brahma concept.
      </P>
      <P>Both as religion and philosophy, Buddhism is based on the &quot;no soul&quot; 
      view. Therefore, the Buddhist attitude to the Upanishadic view of reality 
      needs no examination. In the Vasettha-sutta of the Dighanikaya, the 
      attempt to reach the Brahma that no one has seen is compared to the effort 
      of a line of blind men. The Buddhist teaching that everything is 
      impermanent rejects the belief in a permanent substance that underlines 
      everything in the universe. </P>
      <P>The Buddhist theory of causality shows that if there is a Brahma, he 
      cannot be uncaused and similarly cannot be eternal. According to the 
      Buddhist doctrine of paticasamuppada the universe is not the creation of a 
      personal God or impersonal Godhead, but the outcome of causes and 
      conditions. </P>
      <P>Though the Buddha rejected this Brahma concept which was prevalent in 
      pre-Buddhistc times, it is clearly seen that he used some aspects of this 
      concept to put across his own philosophy. </P>
      <P>Buddhism does not deny the existence of Brahma. It speaks of 
      Brahma-lokas, refers to Maha Brahama as the Lord of the Brahama-lokas. In 
      many suttas this supreme Brahma is referred to as Sahampati. He is 
      represented as one who has cultivated his mind and as one who honours and 
      pays reverence to the Buddha. </P>
      <P>This shows that Buddhahood is higher than Brahmahood. The Buddhist 
      texts also refer to many instances when Brahma came to meet the Buddha. 
      Among these Brahmas are Sanamkumara, Ghatikara, Narada. </P>
      <P>Reference is also made to the path leading to the Brahma World. The 
      Tevijja Sutta says that the path to the Brahma World is through the 
      development of jhanas pertaining to the five material spheres. The Brahma 
      Worlds are known as Suddhavasas, the Pure Abodes. </P>
      <P>It is said that the attainment of the First jhana leads to the Brahma 
      Worlds called &quot;Brahama-parisajja&quot;, &quot;Brahma-purohita&quot; and &quot;Maha Brahma&quot;; 
      the Second Jhana to Parittabha, Appamanabha and Abhassara; the Third Jhana 
      to Parittasubha, Appamanasubha and Subhakinna. </P>
      <P>The Fourth Jhana is said to lead the non-Anagamins to Vehapphala and 
      Asannasatta Brahma-lokas and the Anagamns to Aviha, Atappa, Sudassi and 
      Akanittha Brahma-loka. This shows that Buddhism too has a parallel concept 
      of the attainment of companionship with Brahma. But this, however, does 
      not mean that Buddhism, like Brahmanism, admits the possibility of eternal 
      companionship with Brahma. </P>
      <P>What is meant by this jhanic attainment is the experiencing of a very 
      high level of mental development through the jhanic process. </P>
      <P>The teaching on the four Brahma-Viharas (four Sublimes States) is 
      another instance which shows how the Buddha adopted another important 
      aspect of the pre-Buddhist Brahma concept. Many scholars are of the 
      opinion that the teaching on Brahma-Vihara is purely Buddhist. Perhaps 
      this is more likely to be an adaptation of a pre-Buddhist concept to suit 
      the Buddhist point of view. This becomes clear from Buddhaghosa&#39;s 
      definition of Brahma-vihara: </P>
      <I>
      <P>&quot;Why are these called Brahma-viharas? It is because they are supreme 
      and faultless. These states constitute the best mode of conduct towards 
      others. The Brahmas live with their minds freed of the five hindrances. 
      The Yogins who are endowed with these states also live with faultless 
      minds like the Brahmas&quot;. </P>
      </I>
      <P>As the parents have these mental attitudes towards their children, they 
      too can be called Brahmas. In fact in comparing the parents to the 
      Brahmas, the Buddha appears to have added a new dimension to the Brahma 
      concept. </P>
      <P>The Buddhist path leading to Nibbana is called the &quot;Brahma-faring&quot; 
      (Brahmacariya). The Buddha addressing the first disciples who grasped his 
      teaching said, &quot;Come O! monk, the doctrine is well taught. Practise this 
      Brahma faring for the perfect ending of suffering&quot;. </P>
      <P>The five ascetics who were the first disciples of the Buddha were 
      already following some kind of a restrained noble life. By inviting them 
      to lead &quot;Brahmacariya&quot; a new Buddha seems to have made clear that his 
      interpretation of the Brahma faring meant something different from what 
      they were already engaged in. The Varnasrama dharma followed by the 
      Brahmins divides the life into four stages. </P>
      <P>These four stages are studentship (brahamacriya), householder 
      (grhastha), forest entry (vanaprastha) and renunciation (sannyasi). Here, 
      Brahmacariya meant merely the studentship, limited to the student days of 
      one&#39;s life. But Brahmacariya in Buddhism is not limited to any particular 
      period of life. It is valid for all stages of life and can be commenced by 
      renunciation of the worldly life. </P>
      <P>It is somewhat parallel to the sannyasi stage in the &quot;varnasrama 
      dharma&quot; of the Brahmins. From this it becomes clear that the Brahmacariya 
      in Buddhism, which developed from a pre-Buddhist idea, was identified as 
      the path leading to the ending of defilement resulting in the destruction 
      of suffering. </P>
      <P>In general the term Brahma is used in the sense of Supreme, Noble, 
      Highest, Holy and so on. This shows how important the idea of Brahma had 
      been to the Brahmins and how much influence it exerted on Buddhism. It is 
      also seen that in the canonical texts, the two terms Brahma and Dhamma are 
      at time used co-terminously. </P>
      <P>Terms such as Brahma-cakka, Dhamma-cakka, Brahma-bhuta, Dhamma-bhuta, 
      Brahma-kaya, Dhamma-kaya, illustrate such synonymity of the two terms. 
      This clearly shows that the Buddha used the pre-Buddhistic Brahma concept 
      to give a new dimension to certain important Buddhist concepts. </P>
