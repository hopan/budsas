      <TD WIDTH="100%"><B></B><FONT SIZE="6">A</FONT>jahn Pasanno described the 
      four major modes of clinging. Recognizing where the mind is clinging, the 
      quality of clinging, and the capacity of the mind to grab hold of things 
      and get stuck on them is extremely important as we learn to live a life 
      which is peaceful, skillful, wise and harmonious. The next step then is to 
      follow through by letting go of that which is being clung to. So much of 
      our practice day-to-day -- in our livelihood, in the people we live with, 
      in our meditation -- has to do with letting go. It's Buddhist jargon that 
      we repeat over and again: Letting go, letting go, letting go.
      <P>Even though there is a necessary, profound emphasis on clinging, we can 
      come to assume that it is the basic nature of our being: Fundamentally, we 
      are the grip incarnate. But this is a mistaken way of viewing things, of 
      not looking at the situation in a full, comprehensive, accurate way. While 
      we might feel like every time we look at our mind it is grasping at 
      something, in a way that is just circumstantial evidence. What we find as 
      we train the mind and look into its ways more and more consistently and 
      effectively is that there are also moments of letting go -- states of 
      nonclinging, bliss, relief and delightful peace. </P>
      <P>We can think of those moments of peace as the islands of goodness, the 
      lotus flowers arising out of the muddy bottom of our minds, the 
      fundamental nature of which seems to be a dark rot. However, we also begin 
      to see that although clinging is an extraordinarily strong habit, it's 
      also something which arises. It comes into being. It's an impermanent, 
      unstable, dependently originated quality that arises due to causes. It's 
      not there all the time. </P>
      <P>Once, after a monk called Vakkali had died, the Buddha said,&quot;Monks, do 
      you see that strange smoky haze going here and going there? That's Mara, 
      the evil one. Do you know what he's doing? He's looking for the 
      consciousness of Vakkali but can't find him anywhere. Why can't Mara find 
      him? Because Vakkali died as a Noble One, and his consciousness is not 
      established in any realm.&quot;Vakkali escaped. And this is a capacity we all 
      have, to escape, to let go. The Buddha deeply encouraged Dharmic escapism: 
      Ours is a burning house: &quot;Everything is on fire, run for the exit!&quot; But 
      sometimes people see escaping as life-negating. Escapism is a bad thing, 
      right? We like the living world and the people and creatures and trees and 
      sky, even the bad weather and clouds and the nighttime. </P>
      <P>If we look more closely and contemplate, however, we see that this is a 
      superficial view of escaping or letting go. What is life really like in 
      the moment of letting go -- when we are in the presence of something that 
      we long for but the heart recognizes we don't have to have? Or when we are 
      in the presence of someone who is angry with us and we feel compassion for 
      them without fighting back or taking it personally. That's what is meant 
      by escaping from the burning house. It's not disconnecting, it's not 
      shutting down, it's not taking refuge in some sort of numbed-out emptiness 
      of &quot;not me, not mine, doesn't exist, everything is empty, it's your 
      problem.&quot; It's not a walling off of the heart and calling it liberation -- 
      like locking ourselves into a safe and calling it emptiness. Instead, 
      there's a genuine attunement, but there's no dukkha created around it. 
      It's the heart resting in <I>vijja, </I>in true knowing, true mindfulness.
      </P>
      <P>In the ancient Indian epic the Ramayana, the hero and the heroine are 
      named Rama and Sita. They are the ideal couple -- the beautiful and 
      faithful, virtuous woman and the handsome, noble prince -- and they get 
      caught up in a great tangled plot together. What occurred to me is that 
      there is a Buddhist version of the perfect couple: Rama is an anagram of 
      Mara, and Sita is an anagram of <I>sati. </I>On the one hand you have 
      Mara, death and delusion, that which clings to the sensual, to thought and 
      feeling, to the conditioned world. Then there's sati, mindfulness, the 
      quality of true awareness that is an attribute of the unconditioned. 
      Mara's searching for Vakkali is the mind that sees things in worldly 
      terms. It can't recognize the unconditioned. No matter where Mara looks, 
      he'll never find the unconditioned because he's looking on the basis of 
      the conditioned. If the heart is clinging, then the unconditioned is 
      invisible. It's only when the heart lets go of the conditioned -- when 
      there's nonidentification with the loved and the hated, the pleasant and 
      the painful -- that there's true abandonment and liberation. In letting 
      go, the unconditioned becomes apparent and the heart awakens to the 
      unborn, the unformed, the undying. </P>
