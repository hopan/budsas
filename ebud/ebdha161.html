    face="Times New Roman">he Buddhist festival known as the Kathina revolves around the
    simple act of offering a piece of cloth to a monk or a nun. But it's really much more than
    that. What this ceremony symbolizes is the profound relationship between the two halves of
    the Buddhist community: the Sangha and lay society. In the Kathina, there is a recognition
    of the physical dependency of the monastics on their lay supporters.<o:p> </o:p> </font><p><font
    face="Times New Roman">In the U.S., the idea of consciously becoming dependent on others
    is anathema to us. This is the land of the rugged individualist, where we &quot;don't need
    nothin' from nobody.&quot; We get out there and do it on our own. Plow the land. Build a
    house. Make our own world. The way people relate to those living on welfare, hand-outs, or
    begging illustrates society's view that dependence is a lower form of life. You have
    failed if you are on welfare. You are in a degraded state if you need help. Most people
    would probably agree that this is the national mindset. <o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So what on earth is this business of choosing to live on
    hand-outs for the rest of your life? The set up in the Buddhist tradition runs counter to
    the self-sufficient, rugged-individualistic mindset. People often say to us: &quot;You
    mean you don't grow anything? You just live on what people give you?&quot; They become
    puzzled or upset. These things need to be explained.<o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">However it might be misconstrued by others, the Buddha
    himself was very clear about the value of monastics being physically dependent on the
    greater lay community. For one, religious figures often get put into a high position in
    society. They become invested with a lot of power and authority by people around them.
    Begging is a brilliant way of limiting that area of power and control. While you may be an
    extremely high and revered spiritual teacher, at the beginning of the day, your bowl is
    still empty. You have no money to buy what you want or to go where you like. There may be
    a lot of power and authority in some areas of your life, but there is zero in others.
    Physical dependence is a skillful way to keep the power given to religious figures under
    control and in balance. <o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We can also reflect on the four requisites as laid out by
    the Buddha: food, lodging, robes, and medicine. These are the basic supports for life.
    Because of our dependency, we reflect on the physical needs that we have and we learn to
    use frugally what we have been given. We reflect on being easy to support. Of course,
    these are not highly refined metaphysical reflections; they are much more basic. The monk
    is hungry; give him food. This one's cold; wrap some cloth around him. The relationship
    between the monastics and the lay community is built on that physical dependency. We are
    not able to ask for anything and therefore must rely entirely upon the quality of our
    lives. If our lives are useful and have meaning to the greater community, then the bits of
    cloth will show up. The food will arrive. And if our lives are not worthy, then it won't
    show up. <o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha was a genius in establishing this kind of
    contact. Simply to survive, the monastics must consciously and on a daily basis interact
    with the greater society. We can't depend upon ourselves. We can't live independently from
    you. We can't shut the door and say that you laypeople are not welcome to visit us
    &quot;serious meditators.&quot; Our bodies are fueled by the food you offer us. In fact,
    scientists say that all the cells of the body are replaced every seven years, so any of us
    who has been ordained for that long now has a body that is completely donated. <o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Looking at our lives of dependency in this way, we start
    to relate to things in a different fashion. If it were not for the accumulated kindnesses,
    efforts, and good will of countless hundreds and thousands of people, this body would not
    be able to sustain itself. Kindness is the actual physical fabric of what we think of as
    &quot;me.&quot; Monastics are made up of all those little potluck dishes you have offered
    to us. I find this a very beautiful and comforting thought. <o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In return, the monastic community endeavors to live life
    in a way that brings clarity of mind. Our intention is to live harmoniously and
    respectfully both within our community as well as within the greater world. We create and
    hold a space-a sacred space that encourages safety and freedom. Within this environment,
    the very best qualities of the human heart can be developed. <o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Not surprisingly, one of these qualities is that of
    generosity. The Buddha said, &quot;If you knew the karmic results of giving, you wouldn't
    eat even one meal without sharing what you've got with somebody else.&quot; Ajahn Sumedho
    often adds: &quot;Happiness is when you get what you want, but joy comes from
    giving.&quot; Perhaps this sounds like a line to get people to empty their pockets:
    &quot;Giving is really good for you folks,&quot; as Jimmy Swaggert used to say. &quot;The
    rattle of small change makes me nervous. Only folding money please.&quot; <o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And, of course, these kinds of teachings can be abused;
    however, the Buddha felt it was so important to establish &quot;an economy of gifts&quot;
    that he was prepared to be criticized on the one hand by the brahmins-who felt he had
    betrayed his class by forsaking his life as a noble prince and begging in the streets-and
    on the other hand by the samanas, the ascetic wanderers, who felt it was outrageous that
    the Buddha would sometimes accept offerings of fine food, expensive cloth, and grand
    dwelling places. The Buddha's reasoning on this latter point was that as long as an
    offering was not solicited and the nun or monk used it for supporting the practice of the
    holy life without attachment, it could be considered a pure offering.<o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Through practice, we can experience for ourselves that
    giving is so powerful because it is the most practical and direct method of counteracting
    selfishness. That which wants to hang on to something &quot;for me&quot; is a barricade
    blocking the door to liberation. &quot;Me first&quot; means &quot;me last&quot; to
    Nibbana. That which doesn't want to bother with other people and is concerned only with
    &quot;my own&quot; protection, &quot;my own&quot; comfort, &quot;my own&quot; preferences
    is the real problem. <o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Asian countries, babies are taught when they are about
    six months old to put food into alms-bowls. The whole family applauds as the sticky rice
    drops from that little hand into the monk's bowl. The kid gets the idea early on: when
    stuff leaves your hand, you feel happy. It feels good to give.<o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But generosity is not just giving material things. It's
    giving one's time or attention. It's being in conversation and actually listening to what
    the other person is saying. How many of us can do that? That is a true form of giving. In
    giving our attention, we are giving our heart. <o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha talked about different ways of giving. There's
    what he might have called &quot;cheapo&quot; giving, which says, &quot;I'm going to get
    rid of this anyway, so I might as well give it to you.&quot; Then there's the medium level
    of giving, which is sharing something that is valuable to you with others. However regal
    giving, or raja dana, is the most powerful form of giving. It is giving what is most
    precious to you. With all three forms, giving with an expectation of return is not giving
    at all. It's called cutting a deal. Deal-making does not bring particularly bright states
    of mind. It's more like a business transaction: &quot;I'll stake this much and get back
    that much.&quot; Instead, giving should be done as the Christians recommend-without
    expecting anything in return. You are not giving in order to get; giving is a pure and
    unselfish act of kindness. <o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is often a barrier to giving, though. When you think
    about giving away something that you like, questions come up: &quot;Can I really afford
    this?&quot; &quot;Maybe I haven't got the time.&quot; We might have to exert some real
    effort to climb over these barriers of second thoughts, and this is not comfortable. There
    can be feelings of grief or pain when you give something to another person. But on the
    other side, there is a sigh of relief. Now we are in a space of freedom. When we make a
    gesture to go against self-centered habits, we feel delight. <o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha also made a clear reference to the fact that
    giving impersonally to the Sangha is of far greater karmic significance than giving to an
    individual, even if that person is a fully enlightened Buddha. In giving to an individual,
    we are still caught within the bounds of the idea of self. &quot;This is me here giving to
    you there.&quot; That's the human tendency. Something in us wants to bond to a particular
    monk or teacher on a one-to-one basis. However, it's of far greater benefit to everyone to
    give from the heart whatever supports the Sangha and therefore all beings. By that very
    gesture, we have expanded our own heart beyond the personal, self-centered view. <o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is in this way that the offering of the Kathina
    cloth-and all these other useful gifts for the monastery-is the most meritorious of all
    material offerings to the Sangha. The simple gesture of offering cloth is a way of
    manifesting the interdependence of our relationship. The monastics and the laypeople are a
    single, unified, whole community. What is given to us will be used and looked after. Your
    offerings will be helpful to the development of this monastery and to this way of life for
    years to come.<o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
