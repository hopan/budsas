<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Today I'll continue my discourse on the practical exercise
  of mindfulness meditation. Yesterday I dealt with how to practice walking meditation
  systematically and methodically. Even though you are treading on the right path leading to
  the cessation of all kinds of suffering, if your practice is not systematic and methodical
  your success will be delayed. So systematic practice is vitally needed for a meditator to
  achieve his goal. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the same way sitting also should be systematic and
  methodical. If you can sit systematically then you can concentrate your mind very well in
  a short time. The Buddha prescribed a mode of sitting for meditation: sitting in a cross
  legged position, keeping the body erect, and also the neck and head in an upright
  position. In that way the body is supported. The eyes should be closed. The mind should be
  focussed on the area or the point of the body you should be aware of. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But for Westerners it's difficult to sit cross legged
  position systematically because they are not accustomed to sitting on the floor. They
  usually sit on chairs so they find it difficult to sit in a cross legged position on the
  floor comfortably. That's why they have to use a cushion or something like that. So for
  Westerners the mode of sitting mentioned by the Omniscient Buddha in the discourse is not
  good for their comfortable and diligent mindfulness and deep concentration. But if they
  try to sit in that cross legged position, gradually they can become accustomed to it and
  they can do it very well. Some of the meditators sit on their cushion and they bend their
  legs in a somewhat cross legged position. It's good for them to focus their mind on the
  abdominal movement because if they sit on the cushion they can keep their body in an
  upright position. The body rarely bends when they sit say for some ten or twenty minutes,
  because of their cushion. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But when they get painful sensations then unconsciously or
  consciously they change their position. When they change their position some of them sit
  with their knees upright. It's very awkward for them and also not suitable for practice of
  the Dhamma. They should not sit in a position with their knees keeping upright because it
  doesn't help them to concentrate their mind well on the object of meditation. It's not
  systematic sitting. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another aspect of the practice is that when you feel a
  painful sensation to be unbearable you have a tendency to change position. You should be
  patient with the pain and note it as much as possible attentively and methodically, not to
  change instantly but you should proceed with mindfulness of the pain. Eventually if the
  painful sensation becomes unbearable you can change only once in a sitting. But for some
  who can sit an hour without changing position it is not good to change the position in a
  sitting. Such yogis should not change their position. If the pain becomes unbearable then
  you should get up and practice walking meditation. That's better because when you have a
  change in the position then your concentration has been broken. Even though you continue
  to sit after changing your position you can't get deep concentration. So it's not very
  beneficial for you to change your position if you can sit an hour without changing it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And in walking too, you should not walk only at ten
  minutes or fifteen minutes, for a short time. You should walk at least an hour if you can
  walk without any disturbance to your bodily processes. Only after that you should sit
  again for meditation. The most important point in walking is not to look round here and
  there. Naturally you have a tendency or desire to look round when you hear the sound of
  someone's voice, when you feel something is happening nearby or someone is coming towards
  you, and so on. But whenever you have a desire or tendency to look round, you should make
  a mental note of that desire or tendency as: desire, desire, desire, tendency, tendency,
  and so on. When that desire has disappeared you won't look round and you can resume your
  walking. Your concentration is still stable to a certain extent. It's not broken. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yesterday I explained to you how a meditator can observe
  twelve parts of a step, including intention before every action as mentioned in the
  Commentary to the Pali text. But it depends on you how many of the actions you should
  note. You should watch some objects as comfortably as you feel. If you have to exert or
  endeavour your utmost to be aware of any number of objects uncomfortably, you should not
  do that. If you do that you feel tense on your neck or your back, and sometimes you feel a
  headache. Sometimes you feel dizzy because you have to strain too much to be aware of each
  part of the step. So it depends on you; you yourself know. Normally for a meditator it
  should be adequate to note four or five objects of a step comfortably without strains with
  your relaxation: intending, lifting, moving, dropping, or touching. If you are able to
  observe these four or five objects precisely and very attentively then you can attain a
  deep concentration on the movement of the foot. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To be aware of these four or five objects very precisely
  and attentively you have to slow down your stepping. Unless your step is slow you cannot
  catch each individual part of the step very well. It's indispensable for you to slow down
  your step so that you can note all these four or five objects very precisely and
  attentively. Now when you are able to note all these four objects very well, your
  concentration gradually becomes better and better. You can note intention very
  concentratedly. Then the lifting movement you can note with diligent mindfulness. Then the
  pushing movement and putting movement and touching sensation you can know very well
  without looking here and there. In this way when you practice walking meditation for about
  three or four days you can attain a deep concentration. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And as to walking meditation the Buddha said there are
  five benefits of walking: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(1) The first benefit is that you can walk on foot a very
    long journey, because you have practised walking. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(2) Then the second benefit is you will be perseverant
    with the strenuous effort in your practice. Because you see, it's the nature of a human
    being to stay still and sit idly, enjoying something. He doesn't want to walk or stand. He
    likes sitting better than straining and walking. In other words he is naturally lazy to
    walk so he would like to sit always. So if a person trained himself in walking for a very
    long time then because of his exertion he likes to walk. He is not reluctant to walk. That
    means he has the energy or effort to do something actively with alertness. Walking makes
    him active and alert. So whatever he does he puts the utmost effort in the doing of that
    thing. That's why the Buddha said, if you practise walking you become industrious,
    perseverant, with utmost effort. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(3) You yourself know when you are afraid of cholesterol
    in your body you do jogging every morning or every evening. Jogging is a sort of walking
    practise. When the time comes up you are not lazy to do jogging. That's because you have
    practised that jogging. That's what the Buddha said. One of the benefits of walking is the
    perseverant and diligent effort one can have. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(4) Then the fourth benefit of walking is healthiness. If
    a person practises walking he is healthier than the person who is lazy. By practising
    walking you can be healthy both mentally and physically. Mental health is much more
    important than physical health. Regarding healthiness, the Buddha said the food you have
    taken is easily digested. Because of the digestion you are healthy. That's the benefit of
    walking. After you have taken a lot of food into your stomach, if you lie down or if you
    sit it's somewhat difficult for you to digest it. After you have taken that much food,
    then if you walk the food is easily digested. So healthiness together with digestion is
    one of the benefits of walking. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you are lazy you can't meditate. If you are lazy you do
    not come here for meditation. Because you are not lazy you come here to meditate.
    Yesterday when I explained how to practise walking meditation systematically, after the
    talk most of the yogis took an interest in walking and they practised it. Then at the time
    of the interview they told me, 'I enjoy it.' Why do you enjoy it? Because you like to be
    industrious and to be perseverant as the result of walking meditation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(5) The most important benefit of walking, what the Buddha
    said in accordance with this discourse, is concentration. The Buddha said the
    concentration you have attained in walking meditation lasts very long. You can easily
    concentrate your mind on the movement of the foot in a short time when you take an
    interest in walking, and also do it strenuously, because in walking the object of
    meditation is more pronounced than in sitting.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In sitting the respiration or abdominal movement is not
  distinct to your mind. In the beginning of sitting you may find it and you may be able to
  note it very well: rising, falling, rising, falling. Sometimes it becomes irregular
  because you make too much effort in your noting of the abdominal movement so that it can
  be more distinct. But in walking you didn't have such a problem. In walking naturally the
  lifting movement, pushing movement, dropping movement of the foot is very prominent, very
  distinct to your mind so that you can easily note it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the object of meditation is prominent or predominant
  then you can easily note it. You can easily watch it. Because you can easily watch it your
  mind becomes very quickly concentrated on it. Then that concentration becomes also deep so
  it will last very long. One of the benefits of walking is to attain a long lasting
  concentration of the mind. Naturally some of you practise walking meditation
  systematically and diligently so you have had some concentration of the mind which is
  somewhat deep, better than you have had in sitting meditation. You know it through your
  experience. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That's what the Buddha said, you can attain long lasting
  concentration by means of walking. So when you are aware of each individual movement of
  the foot, and sometimes the intention too, then the mind becomes gradually concentrated on
  the movement of the foot very well. And the more energetically you note the movement the
  more deep is the concentration of the mind. Then when concentration becomes deeper and
  deeper you feel your feet become light as they automatically lift, automatically push
  forward, automatically drop down. You come to realise it. Sometimes you get startled at
  the experience of this automatic lifting and pushing and dropping of the foot. and as soon
  as you feel it you say to yourself, 'Hah, what's that? Am I mad or not?' In this way you
  get startled at the unusual experience of the movement of the foot. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When I conducted a meditation retreat in England at the
  Manjusri Tibetan Monastery, the Manjusri Institute in northern England near the border of
  Scotland, one of the meditators had put much effort into his practise both sitting as well
  as walking, and awareness of the activities too. So after about four days' meditation he
  came to me and asked a question. 'Venerable Sir, my meditation is getting worse and
  worse,' he said. 'Now what happen to your meditation?' I asked him. Then he said, 'When I
  am walking one day, Venerable Sir, then gradually I am not aware of myself. The foot
  itself had lifted, and it itself pushed forward, and then dropped down by itself. There's
  no I or no me, no self, no myself. Sometimes though I control my foot, the foot doesn't
  stay with the ground. It lifted by itself. Sometimes it pushed forward very long. I
  couldn't control it. Then sometimes it's getting down by itself. So my meditation is
  getting worse and worse. What should I do?' Then eventually he said, 'I think I have gone
  mad.' Such an experience was very amazing. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is a benefit of walking meditation. First of all he
  said, 'I don't know myself. I'm not aware of myself. I don't know my body, my leg.' That
  means the realisation of the movement of the foot. The movement of the foot has destroyed
  the idea of an 'I' or a 'you,' a 'self' or a 'soul,' a 'person' or 'being.' Here what he
  was realising was the impersonal nature of our bodily process called Anatta. No soul,
  non-ego, non-self nature of our bodily phenomena. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he said, 'The foot is automatically lifted up by
  itself. It's automatically pushed forward by itself,' that means there's no person or no
  being, no self who lifted the foot, who pushed it forward, who dropped it down. It's the
  realisation of the impermanent nature of physical processes or physical phenomena: Anatta.
  Before he didn't realise the physical process of the rising-falling movement and the other
  parts of the body in sitting, he realised the processes of rising, lifting movement,
  pushing movement, the falling movement of the phenomena as it really is. So he has
  destroyed the false idea of an I or a you, a person or a being, a self or a soul. Anatta. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It was very interesting. Not only this yogi but also many
  yogis in Burma experienced it in this way. And sometimes before you experience this stage
  of insight knowledge you feel you are walking on waves of the sea. Or you are standing on
  a boat which was floating on the waves of the sea. Sometimes you may feel you are walking
  on a heap of cotton. Sometimes you feel you are walking in the air. That is also one of
  the insight knowledge which penetrates into the true nature of material process, material
  phenomena. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In accordance with the Buddha's philosophy this so-called
  person is composed of six elements: the four material elements and the one mental element.
  Of the four physical, material elements the first one is the element of hardness and
  softness. We call it pathavi-dhatu. The second is the element of fluidity and coalition.
  We call it apo-dhatu in Pali. The third is the element of heat and cold, temperature. We
  call it tejo-dhatu . The fourth is the element of motion, movement, vibration, expansion
  and contraction. This is called vayo-dhatu in Pali. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">These four primary material elements constitute the
  so-called bodily process. When you feel your body then you may have a sensation of
  hardness or softness. That is pathavi-dhatu. You may feel heat or cold. That's tejo-dhatu.
  You feel the nature of fluidity or coalition. That's apo-dhatu. You may feel motion,
  movement, vibration, supporting. This is vayo-dhatu, one element. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">These four primary elements together with the other minor
  elements are composed as a material unit called the indestructible unit - Kalapa. These
  eight elements cannot be divided, cannot be destroyed even with the atomic bomb. You can
  divide the atom into say nucleus and proton and neutron and so on. But the tiniest detail
  of the atom consists of these four primary elements. So you can't divide it. You can't
  destroy it so it is called the unit of indestructibility - Avinibhoga-rupa in Pali. So
  when the innumerable number of these material units are composed then they become a body:
  a finger, a nail, a hair, and so on. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, in between these units there's a space. That space is
  known as akasa-dhatu,. This is one of the six elements which constitutes the so-called
  bodily process. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the sixth one is the mental element. That is, mind,
  consciousness, mental processes, emotional processes. All these are called vinyana-dhatu,
  the mental element or mind element. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Normally we are not able to penetrate into these elements
  and realise them in their true nature. That's why we take these compounded elements for a
  personal being, an I or a you, because we can't divide. Our intellectual knowledge is not
  enough to penetrate into these elements, and realise them in their true nature. So we
  think this is a body, this is a mind, this a man, this is a woman, this is a leg, this is
  a nose, this a hair. If we have penetrating insight knowledge through our vipassana
  meditation, insight meditation, then we can penetrate into these primary elements and know
  them and their nature and also their appearance and disappearance, and the nature of
  transitoriness of these elements. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So here when you practise walking meditation you feel that
  you are walking on a boat which is floating on the waves of the sea, or as though you were
  walking on the air, or as though you are walking on a heap of cotton. You are realising
  the specific nature or specific characteristic of the wind element vayo-dhatu. Vayo-dhatu,
  the wind element has movement, motion, supporting, vibrating as its specific
  characteristics, or individual characteristics. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Normally we do not realise it. But when we watch the
  movement of the foot while we are walking very closely, attentively and precisely, then
  our concentration becomes deeper and deeper. Then, because of deep concentration the
  insight knowledge or experiential knowing becomes penetrating and sharp. So that
  penetrating insight realises the process of movement and its specific characteristics of
  movement, motion, vibrating and supporting. So we feel we are walking on the air, or we
  are standing on the boat, or on the waves of the sea. Because the waves of the sea are
  always moving. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then, gradually our concentration becomes deeper. You will
  feel the specific characteristics of the wind element in that way. At that time you very
  often feel you are not yourself. Here 'you are not yourself' means you are not mad. You
  are not aware of your body. You are not aware of yourself. What you are here realising is
  just movement. A great deal of movement which is going on of its own accord. So in this
  way you have destroyed the idea of a personal being, a self or a soul by means of the
  walking meditation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But here you should be careful not to expect any unusual
  experiences when you are walking. When you expect anything, the expectation disturbs your
  concentration. Then the concentration becomes weak. Then you can't experience anything
  new. So you mustn't expect anything. But what I have explained to you is that your noting
  of the movement of the foot has such and such a benefit you can experience. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So what you should do is just be mindful of what is
  happening to your body and mind, that's all. Except for mindfulness you mustn't do
  anything else. You mustn't expect anything, you mustn't be curious or inquisitive about
  anything. But what you should do is be mindful of what's happening. If you have
  expectation, that expectation must be aware of expecting. If you have curiosity, curiosity
  must be aware of curiosity, and so on until it has disappeared. You mustn't allow them to
  disturb your concentration and mindfulness. So what you should do is just be mindful while
  you are walking, while you are sitting, while you are lined up, while you are eating,
  while you are dressing, while you are showering, whatever you are doing. What you should
  do is just be mindful of it as it is, that's all. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the time of the Buddha tbere was a bikkhuni named
  Patajara. Bikkhuni is a woman monk . This Patajara was the daughter of a wealthy person.
  Say a billionaire, not a millionaire. But when she was grown up she married a servant, so
  she had to go to the other village and stay there because she was afraid of their parents.
  Then she had a great deal of trouble because she was a human being. Human beings are
  surrounded by many sufferings, dukkha. Her husband died. Her two sons and her parents also
  died. Her half brothers died. The house of Patajara collapsed in a storm due to the heavy
  rain. So she was mad because of her anxiety, sorrow, worry, lamentation, and despair and
  she roamed in the city. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But one day the Buddha summoned her to the audience in the
  monastery of Jetavana who listened to the Buddha's sermon. The Omniscient Buddha knew that
  she was Patajara and also that her mental faculties were ripe for the attainment of
  enlightenment. So the Buddha said to her, 'Oh beloved sister, please be careful, please
  come round.' When she heard what the Buddha said she came round. Her mind became normal.
  Then the Omniscient Buddha told her to sit and listen to the sermon. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">While she was listening to Dhamma the Buddha explained to
  the audience the Four Noble Truths. The first is the truth of suffering, Dukkha. The
  second is the Truth of the Cause of Suffering, Samudaya . The third is the truth of the
  Cessation of Suffering, Nirodha. Then the fourth is the Truth of the Way Leading to the
  Cessation of Suffering. That is Mindfulness and Meditation. When the Buddha explained the
  truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering, and how to practise mindfulness
  and meditation -- when anyone wants to get rid of all kinds of suffering -- then Patajara
  with a great deal of suffering wanted to get rid of it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So while listening to Dhamma she tried to be mindful of
  what is happening to her body and mind, and also consciousness, the hearing. In this way
  she gradually concentrated her mind very well. And when she had attained a deep
  concentration her insight knowledge became penetrating and realised all mental and
  physical phenomena in their true nature. And eventually she attained the four stages of
  enlightenment which completely uprooted all mental defilements together with their
  potentialities. Then she lived happily and peacefully without any suffering, stress or
  worries, sorrows and lamentation. She became free from all kinds of mental and physical
  suffering. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But what I should tell you is this woman attained the
  first stage of enlightenment while she was listening to Dhamma and after that she asked
  the Buddha for ordination as a Bikkhuni. So the Buddha told the other Bikkhunis to ordain
  her. After he ordained her as a Bikkhuni she proceeded with her practise of mindfulness
  and meditation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And one day at night she practised walking meditation the
  whole night. Then because of her walking meditation her concentration became deeper and
  deeper and also stable and firm. When she had realised the viability of her concentration
  she went to her room and sat for meditation. When she approached her bed she noted all
  activities: her standing, standing, and bending bending , then turning, turning, when you
  sit down on the bed, sitting down, sitting down. Then after she had settled herself on the
  seat she took a small stick and stretching her arm, reached her arm to the lamp which was
  flaming. Then with that stick she noticed stretching, stretching. She then pressed the
  flame with the stick, pressing, pressing, pressing. Then the flame submerged into the oil
  and it was extinguished. As soon as the flame had submerged into the oil she attained
  three other higher stages of enlightenment, and all defilement was destroyed by this
  enlightenment. She became Arahant and lived in peace and happiness. Here, because of deep
  concentration she attained from walking meditation, she could be aware of all daily
  activities, and that awareness made her attain to the other higher stages of enlightenment
  which totally destroy all defilements. </font></p>
