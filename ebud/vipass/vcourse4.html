<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Today we continue the discourses on practical exercises of
  Mindfulness meditation. Yesterday I explained systematic walking and also systematic
  sitting. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes when you sit for meditation, after you have
  meditated about fifteen or twenty minutes you have a desire to change your position
  because of the severity of the painful sensation or any mental distraction. When you know
  that it's not good to change your position and your sitting then you do not change it. But
  though you do not change your position your hands are moving here and there. Sometimes the
  hand touches the face or the head. Without any sensation of itching you may rub the face
  or the hand. While your hand is placed in the lap, when you feel restless or when you feel
  severe pain, then you do not change the position but the hand lifted itself and then
  touched the knee, and so on. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So what I mean is that in systematic sitting for
  meditation you mustn't move even the hands. You should sit like a statue so that your
  concentration doesn't break but becomes deep and stable. When you move your hand from one
  place to another then the mind goes with the hand and concentration breaks. So you mustn't
  move the hand. So when you sit for meditation please be careful. You must remind yourself
  of this statue. [Say to yourself]: I must sit like a statue of the Buddha, here. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Unconsciously you moved your hand. But even when we say
  it's an unconscious movement, actually your mind goes with the hand. Without intention to
  move, you don't move. Because you have intention to move, you do move. That one thing -
  wishing, intention - is mental process. The concentration of the mind is also mental
  process. And when you move your hand then your mind goes with the hand and concentration
  breaks. So please be careful not to move even your hands from one place to another. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then in walking meditation the most important thing is not
  to look round here and there. Once you look round, then the mind goes with the eye and
  concentration breaks. You have to control your eyes not to look round. The best way to
  control your eyes is noting the desire to look round. Without desire or tendencies you
  won't look round here and there. Because of the desire to look round you do it. So that
  desire or tendency must be noted until it has disappeared. When the desire has
  disappeared, you won't look round. So please be careful to watch the desire to look round.
  If the desire is watched and if the desire's stopped you won't look round and your
  concentration doesn't break. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In walking meditation yesterday I explained to you how you
  experienced the movement of the foot when your concentration's good enough. But here what
  I want to tell you is there are two levels of understanding, right understanding of the
  physical process and mental process. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">First of all, what you should know is that there are five
  mental faculties a yogi must be possessed of. The first one is <b>saddha.</b> Saddha is
  Pali; sradha is Sanskrit. It means faith or confidence of belief. Here faith is not blind
  faith. It is faith through right understanding of the truth. Because you have some
  knowledge of the truth then you believe in it. That belief is known as saddha, faith. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So faith through right understanding is one of the mental
  faculties a yogi must possess. Without faith or belief in the Dhamma or the truth you do
  not follow it, you do not practise it. Because you have some degree of faith or belief in
  the truth, you follow it, you practise it. So faith or confidence of belief in the Dhamma
  is a very important mental factor to enable a meditator to practise systematic meditation
  strenuously. Without firm or strong faith in Dhamma or the truth you won't practise any
  Dhamma. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second one is <b>viriya</b>, in Pali. Viriya is effort
  or energy. When you believe in any Dhamma you make enough effort to practise it or follow
  it. So faith or belief or confidence is the cause, strenuous effort is the effect. When
  you put enough effort into your practise you will be able to be mindful of each and every
  activity of your body and mind for the whole day. When you can be mindful of all mental
  and physical phenomena in nature, then mindfulness becomes continuous, constant and
  powerful. Then here viriya, effort or energy, is the cause mindfulness is effect. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mindfulness is called <b>sati</b>. Because of strenuous
  effort mindfulness becomes continuous, constant and powerful. When sati, mindfulness,
  becomes constant and powerful then your mind is well concentrated on any mental process or
  physical process which is observed. Unless mindfulness is continuous and powerful you
  won't gain any deep concentration. Only when mindfulness becomes continuous and constant
  and powerful then your concentration becomes better and better, deeper and deeper. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then concentration is called <b>samadhi</b> in Pali. The
  Lord Buddha said, `Oh bikkhus, cultivate concentration of the mind. The mind which is
  concentrated gives rise to realisation of phenomena.` Another word: cultivate the
  concentration of the mind. One who is well concentrated realises the phenomenon as it
  really is. That's what the Buddha said. Here the concentration is the cause and
  realisation or right understanding is effect. Without deep concentration you are not able
  to realise any phenomena and their true nature as they really are. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So samadhi, concentration, is the cause, realisation or
  right understanding, <b>pannya</b>, is effect. Pannya is Pali. Here pannya means right
  understanding of mental and physical phenomena. Pannya is translated into wisdom, insight,
  enlightenment. So here what we need in this context, pannya means penetrating knowledge,
  right understanding of body-mind processes. Without deep concentration you are not able to
  rightly understand any mental or physical phenomena and their true nature. Only if your
  mind is concentrated to a larger extent, then you are able to rightly understand body-mind
  processes and their true nature. Here samadhi, concentration, is the cause, pannya, right
  understanding or penetrating insight, is effect. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When bodily and mental processes are fully realised then
  you don't have any mental defilements such as greed, desire, craving, attachment, hatred,
  ill-will, anger, ignorance, jealousy, false view, and so on. These are called mental
  defilements because when the mind is full of these undesirable mental or emotional states
  the mind gets defiled. They are called kilesas in Pali, in Sanskrit kelayasas and are
  translated as mental defilements or mental impurities. So long as you have any of these
  mental defilements in your mind you are sure to suffer. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Suppose you are angry with someone or with something. That
  anger is mental defilement. When you get angry your mind gets defiled, and you suffer
  because of that anger. When you have anger you get suffering. Do you agree with me on this
  point? Then should you have or should you abandon it? Should you have the anger or should
  you welcome the anger? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Pali for anger is dosa. But dosa has two aspects, the dosa
  which is increasing and the dosa which is decreasing. So when you are angry with someone
  or something your dosa is progressive dosa. And again when you are unhappy or when you are
  dejected or depressed that state of mind is also called dosa. This dosa is depressive
  dosa. What I mean is whether you have anger or depression or unhappiness your mind is full
  of dosa, defilement. Then you are unhappy. You get a great deal of suffering. That's why
  we called dosa a mental defilement, or mental impurity. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So then we take another mental state, lobha. Lobha is
  Pali. It has very wide meaning. It means desire, greed, acquiring, lust, attachment. All
  the senses of these words are covered by that of lobha. So when we want to say lobha we
  use the word attachment as the equivalent to lobha, because attachment is an English word
  which covers all the senses of desire, craving, lust, greed, and so on. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you have lobha you are sure to suffer. Say when you
  are greedy to be wealthy then you have to do many works to earn a great deal of money and
  you get a great deal of dukkha suffering. That lobha, greed, is the cause of suffering. If
  you are attached to your wealth you would have a great deal of suffering. Because when you
  are attached to your wealth you try to maintain it, or you try to make it double. Then
  that attachment to your wealth is because of suffering, dukkha. If you are attached to
  your wealth you'll protect yourself from thieves, or robbery, undesirable relatives,
  especially sons and daughters. Then you have dukkha, suffering. The cause of suffering or
  dukkha is attachment. Lobha. Even if you are attached to your good experiences and
  meditation it's dukkha. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Meditation is the thing which you should experience, not
  the thing which you are attached to. If you are attached to your good experiences you had
  yesterday, today if your concentration is poor you get restless because you want to
  re-experience those good things you had yesterday. The more effort you put in and your
  noting, then the more distractions you have, and the more restless you become. Then the
  more suffering, the more dukkha you have. That is not because of meditational experience
  but because of attachment to it. That's why the Buddha said attachment is samodhyasacca.
  Samodhya is the cause or the origin, sacca is the truth. Samodhyasacca means the truth of
  the cause of suffering. So attachment is the cause of suffering. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This lobha, attachment, is also one of the mental
  defilements which is because of suffering, dukkha. Then should you be attached to anyone
  or anything? If you are attached to anyone or anything, what would happen to you? Yes, you
  would be surrounded by a great deal of suffering. When you are attached to your beloved
  friend, then when he gets into any trouble you feel sorry and unhappy. That sorrow and
  unhappiness, is it desirable or undesirable. Then it's dukkha, yes. Where does the dukkha
  comes from? It comes from attachment to your friend. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then if you are attached to your son or daughter or parent
  then you have more dukkha. The result of the attachment is dukkha. So whatever you are
  attached to or whoever you are attached to, it's sure you suffer, you have dukkha. Then
  should you have the attachment or shouldn't you have attachment? No. Yes, why? Because you
  are afraid of dukkha. Everyone, including me, is afraid of dukkha. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then if we are afraid of dukkha what should we do? We
  should destroy the cause of dukkha, the attachment. If we are able to destroy attachment,
  the cause of dukkha, suffering, then there won't arise any dukkha at all. Then we are free
  from dukkha. The attachment is a mental defilement which must be destroyed by one who
  wants to get free from all kinds of dukkha. When the attachment has been completely
  destroyed you won't have any dukkha at all. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Say all of you are working at home or at the office or at
  the company or any place. Though you come here to meditate sometimes your mind goes back
  to work. Why? Because you are attached to it. When you have less attachment to the work
  you have less dukkha. When you have a great attachment to your work you have a great deal
  of dukkha even though you are meditating. So attachment is the cause of suffering. The
  Buddha said it is the second truth, the truth of the cause of suffering, dukkha. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You know there are the <b>Four Noble Truths</b>. The first
  truth is the Noble Truth of Suffering, dukkha. The second is the Noble Truth of the Cause
  of Suffering, dukkha, attachment. The third is the Truth of the Cessation of Dukkha,
  suffering. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Do you want to destroy dukkha or not? When you have dukkha
  you're suffering. You are afraid of suffering so you want to destroy dukkha. If you want
  to exterminate this dukkha what should you do? You have to eradicate the attachment. You
  have to uproot attachment, the cause of dukkha. When attachment has been destroyed then
  your dukkha, suffering ceases to exist. Then you have attained the state of the cessation
  of suffering. This State of Cessation of Suffering is called Nibbana. This is the Third
  Truth, the Truth of the Cessation of Suffering. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the fourth one is the Truth of the Way leading to the
  Cessation of Suffering. That means if you follow this Way then you'll be able to destroy
  all kinds of mental defilement and there won't arise any dukkha at all. The Truth of the
  Way leading to the Cessation of Suffering is called Magga-sacca, in Pali. The third one is
  called Nirodha-sacca, the truth of the cessation of suffering. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Have you heard of the way leading to the cessation of
  suffering? The <b>Noble Eight-fold Path</b>. You may not have some knowledge of this Noble
  Eight-fold Path theoretically, but practically you have it. This noting of your
  bodily-mental process comprises the Noble Eight-fold Path. When you know rising, falling,
  rising, falling. When you watch, pain, pain. When you are aware of the movement of the
  foot, lifting, pushing, dropping, touching, and so on. When you are aware of a bending
  movement, stretching of the arms, sitting down and rising from the seat. All this
  awareness or mindfulness or noting consists of the Noble Eight- fold Path. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So this is the way you are following which leads you to
  the cessation of suffering. This is the fourth truth. And when you note the lifting
  movement, pushing movement, dropping movement, touching sensation of the foot, then you
  have to make a mental effort to be aware of the movement. That mental effort or energy is
  one of the eight mental factors of the noble path. It's called Right Effort, or Right
  Energy. Samma-vayama. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because of that right effort you are aware of the lifting
  movement, pushing movement, dropping movement of the foot. That awareness is sammasati.
  Right Mindfulness. When you are aware of the movement of the foot precisely and
  attentively your mind is concentrated on the movement momentarily. That concentration is
  known as samma samadhi, Right Concentration. Why is it right? Because it causes the right
  insight, penetrating insight, to arise. Or because it's the cause of realisation of the
  mental and physical phenomena and their true nature, and eradication of all mental
  defilements. So that samadhi, is samma-samadhi, right concentration. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Though you put enough effort in the practise, in the
  noting, or in awareness, the mind doesn't stay with the object always. Sometimes the mind
  goes out, wanders. Then one of the mental factors which arises together with mindfulness
  directs the mind to the object of meditation, to the movement of the foot. That mental
  factor is called Right Thought, samma-sankhappa. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this way, whenever you observe the movement of the foot
  these four mental factors are working on the movement and gradually right concentration
  becomes deeper and deeper. Then you come to realise the movement of the foot without
  conscious awareness of your bodily form or yourself. When you are realising these
  movements very clearly you are not aware of yourself, your body. What you are realising at
  that moment is just movement. Then with the deeper concentration you come to the higher
  state of insight which penetrates into the movement and realises its rising and passing
  away. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you note the lifting movement then you know you come
  to realise a series of many broken movements one after another, arising and passing away.
  Before you come to realise this state you think the movement is only one and the same.
  Before that you think, my foot, I lifted, I am pushing it forward, I dropped it down.
  There you have I or me. You think, who does lifting, pushing, dropping, and so on. But
  when you are able to realise a series of broken movements rising and passing away one
  after another, then you don't have that idea of I or you, myself or a person, a being. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What you are understanding is a series of broken movements
  which are arising and passing away in an ever-changing process. Then that realisation or
  that right understanding destroys the false idea of an I or a you, a person, a being,
  which is the seat of all kinds of mental defilement. When you have done with this false
  idea of a person there won't arise any defilement because mental defilements arise
  depending on this false idea of a person, a being, a self or a soul. When that idea has
  been exterminated you won't have any mental defilement, because its seat has been
  destroyed. Then when you do not have mental defilements there won't arise any suffering at
  all. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So you have attained the cessation of suffering by way of
  cultivating the Noble Eight-fold Path by being aware of the movement of your foot. If you
  are able to realise, `this is not me, this is not my foot, this is just a natural process
  of movement which is rising and passing away,` that understanding is Right Understanding,
  samma-ditthi, one of the eight mental factors of the Noble Path. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then here you have developed the five mental factors. The
  first one is mental effort, Right Effort, samma-vayama. The second is awareness or
  mindfulness, Right Mindfulness, samma-sati, The third is samadhi, Right Concentration. The
  fourth is samma- sankhappa, Right Thought. The fifth is Right Understanding, samma-
  ditthi. Here samma ditthi, Right Understanding is the most important factor because it
  penetrates into the true nature of body-mind processes and their true nature, as they
  really are. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So you have cultivated five mental factors of the Noble
  Path. The Noble Path consists of eight factors. The other three are samma- vaca, Right
  Speech, samma-kammanta, Right Deed, and samma ajiva, Right Livelihood. Right Speech here
  means abstention from unwholesome or immoral speech. That's samma-vaca. Samma-Kammanta
  means abstention from unwholesome or immoral deeds or actions. Samma-ajiva means
  abstention from unwholesome livelihoods. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you are meditating and concentrating your mind very
  well on the object of meditation, the movement of the foot, do you abstain from bad speech
  or right speech? You are abstaining from immoral speech. Then you have samma vaca, Right
  Speech. And also abstaining from immoral deeds or actions. Then you have samma kammanda,
  Right Deed. Then when you are meditating having this Right Understanding do you take
  what's not given by the owner? Then are you killing some living being? No. And you are not
  smuggling goods? So abstention from bad livelihood. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">These three - samma-vaca, samma-kammanta, samma-ajiva -
  Right Speech, Right Deed, Right Livelihood - are connected with moral conduct, precepts.
  When you fully observe the precepts you have these three. So when you note or are mindful
  of the movement of the foot how many mental factors you have? Eight. This eight is the
  Noble Eight-fold Path. When you have fully developed this Noble Eight-fold Path you are
  sure to destroy those mental defilements which are the causes of suffering beginning with
  attachment. Then you are free from all kinds of suffering. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">First of all I would like to explain how you can make
  powerful and strong the five mental faculties. The first is saddha, faith. The second is
  viriya, effort or energy. The third is mindfulness. The fourth is concentration. The fifth
  is right understanding, pannya. Because I wanted to explain to you how you can develop
  right understanding my talk went astray. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Please remember these five mental factors are very
  important for the yogi because he must be endowed with all of them. The first, saddha,
  faith; the second, viriya, effort or energy; the third, sati, mindfulness; the fourth,
  samadhi, concentration; the fifth, pannya, right understanding. You have all of these five
  but sometimes it's weak. Sometimes it's strong. So you have to make it strong all the
  time. May all of you have these five mental factors stronger and stronger and achieve your
  goal. </font></p>
