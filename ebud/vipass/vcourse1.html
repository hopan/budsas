<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Today we start our Vipassana Meditation Retreat: mental
  training, or mental development. Why should we train our mind? Because we want to free it
  from all kinds of mental distortions such as greed, hatred, anger, stresses, strains, and
  despair. When our mind is free from all kinds of these mental distortions we can live
  blissfully and peacefully. That's why we have to train our mind, by means of Vipassana
  meditation or insight meditation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font COLOR="#800080">* Samatha and Vipassana
  meditation.</font></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are two types of meditation in Buddhism. One is <b>Samatha</b>
  meditation; the other is <b>Vipassana</b> meditation. Samatha here means concentration.
  Vipassana here means insight or experiential knowledge of bodily and mental phenomena. Of
  these two types of mental training Samatha meditation is practised to attain higher
  concentration of the mind, peaceful and blissful living and the cessation of suffering.
  Vipassana meditation is practised to attain not only deep concentration of the mind but
  also liberation from all kinds of mental and physical dukkha or suffering, through
  realisation of our body-mind processes and their true nature. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As I explained to you, Samatha meditation is practised to
  attain higher concentration of the mind. So when you practise Samatha meditation, the
  first type of mental training or mental culture, you have to concentrate your mind on a
  single object of meditation. You want to concentrate your mind on a single object very
  deeply. That object may be a concept or observed reality, but most Samatha meditative
  objects are concepts. There are also a few objects which are observed reality as the
  object of meditation in the first type of training and Samatha meditation. But whatever
  the object may be the aim of Samatha meditation is to obtain deep concentration of the
  mind, or the higher concentration of the mind. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So you have to take a single object and focus your mind on
  it. When you focus your mind on this object gradually the mind will be concentrated on it
  very deeply. But in the beginning of the practise your mind may go out or wander. Your
  mind doesn't stay with the object always. Sometimes it just goes out and thinks about
  something else. It wanders and goes astray. Then you have to bring the mind to the object
  and focus it on that object again and again. Whenever the mind goes out you bring it back
  and focus it on the object of meditation. In this way your mind gradually becomes
  concentrated well on the object of meditation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As you have practised it for some days or months the
  concentration becomes better and better, deeper and deeper. Finally the mind is absolutely
  concentrated on the object of meditation as its absorbed into the object of meditation.
  Such a state of mind which is absorbed into the object of meditation is called <b>jhana</b>,
  or <b>apana</b> in Pali. Jhana means 'fixed as', or absorption. When the mind is totally
  fixed to the object of meditation it's called jhana, fixed mind. And also it is called
  absorption, apana. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Jhana has four stage, or five stages, in accordance with
  the teaching of the Buddha. So, the second stage of jhana concentration becomes better
  than the first. Then the third stage, the concentration better than the second. So with
  the fourth. As long as the mind is deeply concentrated on the object of meditation its
  free from all mental impurities such as desire, greed, lust, hatred, anger, ignorance, and
  jealousy. Because there are no impurities in the mind which is absorbed into the object of
  meditation you feel happy and peaceful, and calm and tranquil. Tranquillity, serenity and
  calmness is the result of Samatha meditation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But in ancient times there were some devotees who
  practised Samatha meditation with a view to obtaining supernormal powers such as
  clairvoyance and clairaudience. These supernormal powers can be attained based on all the
  four jhanas, of the four stages. When a meditator is skilled in entering any stage of
  jhana he can then proceed with his meditation in order to attain psychical or supernormal
  powers. But though he may be able to attain them through the four stages of jhana,
  concentration, he is not able to rightly understand the intrinsic nature of mental and
  physical phenomena. He is not able to destroy any mental defilement because the purpose of
  Samatha meditation is to obtain deep higher concentration of the mind and psychical or
  supernormal powers. Because he is not able to uproot any of the mental defilements such as
  anger, hatred, desire, and craving, he cannot get free from all kinds of suffering, mental
  or physical, because these mental defilements are the causes of the suffering, dukkha. As
  long as one can uproot or exterminate these mental defilements, mental impurities, he is
  subject to suffering, dukkha. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The aim of Vipassana meditation is to free oneself from
  all kinds of dukkha, mental suffering and physical suffering, through realisation of the
  body-mind processes and their true nature. So if you are able to realise mental and
  physical phenomena as they really are you can do away with all kinds of mental impurities
  or mental defilements which arise dependent on misunderstanding or ignorance of mental and
  physical phenomena and their true nature. That's why we have to practise Satipatthana
  Vipassana meditation, insight meditation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But you may practise Samatha meditation with a view to
  gaining some deep concentration on which your insight knowledge is built. Such a kind of
  Samatha meditation is more beneficial than that which I explained to you for the purpose
  of higher concentration and supernormal powers. So in ancient times, in the time of the
  Buddha some meditators developed Samatha meditation further, first of all so they could
  gain some degree of concentration such as access concentration, and if was possible jhana
  concentration or absorption concentration. When they had attained absorption concentration
  or jhana concentration they made this the basis for Vipassana meditation or Insight
  Meditation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here access concentration means that neighbouring
  concentration to jhana concentration. When you have attained access or neighbouring
  concentration you are sure to attain jhana concentration, absorption concentration, in a
  short time. If the purpose of a meditator is to practise Vipassana meditation based on
  excessive concentration he or she can attain this by means of Samatha meditation. Such
  kind of Vipassana meditation is known as Vipassana meditation or insight meditation
  preceded by Samatha meditation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So Vipassana meditation is of two types. The first,
  Vipassana meditation, insight meditation is preceded by Samatha meditation. The second is
  the pure Vipassana meditation or insight meditation not preceded by Samatha meditation.
  The first type of Vipassana meditation or Insight Meditation is practised by those who
  have ample time to devote to their meditation. They have to spend maybe three or four
  months on Samatha meditation. And when they are satisfied with their attainment of jhana
  concentration they proceed with Vipassana meditation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Pure Vipassana meditation is practised by those who
  haven't enough time to devote to their meditation like yourselves, because you do not have
  three or four months or six months or a year for your meditation. So you can spend about
  ten days on your meditation. For such meditators pure Vipassana meditation is suitable.
  That's why we have to conduct a ten days Vipassana meditation retreat. Actually ten days
  meditation is not enough. The period is too short a time for a meditator to succeed in any
  noticeable experience in his meditation. But there are some who have some experience in
  Vipassana meditation who when their meditation experience becomes major can attain the
  higher stages of insight knowledge of the body-mind processes of their true nature.
  Although you can spend just ten days on your meditation, if you strive to attain the deep
  concentration with a strenuous effort without much interval or break in the course of your
  meditation for the whole day, then you are able to have some new experience of meditation.
  So the point is to practise intensively and strenuously as much as you can. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font COLOR="#800080">* Preparatory Stages</font></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Before you practise insight meditation there are some
  preparatory stages you should go through. The first the Pali scriptures mention is when
  one has spoken contemptuously or in jest or malice to or about a noble one - a puggala in
  Pali - who has attained some state of sanctity or enlightenment in accordance with the
  teaching of the Buddha. Then he should apologise to the Buddha. He should apologise that
  noble one, a puggala. If he is not available here, if he is deceased, he should make
  apology through his meditation teacher. I think you need not do this because you may not
  have spoken ill of any noble one, a puggala, because you may not met such a person in
  Australia. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second stage is that you should entrust yourself to
  the Lord Buddha who teaches the technique of Vipassana meditation, by interesting yourself
  in the Buddha you can go through your course happily and peacefully. Though you may have
  unwholesome or dreadful visions in your meditation you won't fear them because you have
  entrusted yourself to the Buddha. Also you have to place yourself under the guidance of
  your meditation teacher so he can frankly instruct you without any hesitancy. If you do
  not place yourself under the guidance of your teacher he may not be reluctant to instruct
  you even though you have some defects in your practise. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font COLOR="#800080">* Four Protective Meditations</font></b>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you have done this you should develop the four
  protective meditations for some minutes. These four are (1) recollection of the Buddha's
  attributes; (2) development of love and kindness or metta towards all living beings; (3)
  reflection upon the loathsome nature of our body; (4) reflection on the nature of death. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you recollect the attributes of the Buddha you can
  select one of nine attributes. Out of these nine attributes of the Buddha you can choose
  the first or the second or any of the nine as the object of your meditation and reflect on
  it. Here Arahat is the first attribute. Arahat means the Buddha who is worthy of honour
  because he has completely destroyed all mental activities and attained to the cessation of
  all kinds of dukkha. You have to recollect this achievement of the Buddha, thinking about
  its meaning. That's the worthiness of honour through his attainment of the cessation of
  all kinds of suffering by destroying all mental defilements so he lived in peace and bliss
  and happiness. When you recollect these attributes you feel happy and brave to face any
  kind of dukkha or suffering in the course of your meditation as well as in your daily
  life. This must be done about two minutes. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then you have to develop your metta, loving-kindness, the
  feeling of loving-kindness towards all living beings, wishing all living beings peace and
  happiness, and free from all kinds of mental and physical suffering, dukkha. This feeling
  of detached love is developed in yourself. Then you feel happy and tranquil, your mind
  easily concentrated on any object of meditation. This must be done about five minutes. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">After that you have to reflect upon the loathsome nature
  of the body, thinking about its repulsiveness such as blood, pus, phlegm, intestines, and
  so on. This body is full of these impurities and repulsiveness. The result is you are
  detached from this body to a certain extent because you find it loathsome or repulsive.
  This also must be done about two minutes. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then after that you should reflect upon the nature of
  death. Life is uncertain, death is certain. Life is precarious and death is sure. Everyone
  who is born is subject to death. So all men are mortal. In this way you have to think
  about the surety of death for every living being. You can arouse strenuous effort in your
  practise by thinking, 'I'll have to practise this meditation strenuously before I die, or
  before I am dead. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is what the Buddhist meditational texts mention as a
  preliminary stage for both the Samatha meditator and Vipassana meditator. They are not
  compulsory, not indispensable. But the texts mention they should be done. These four
  protective meditations, recollection of the Buddha's attributes and development of
  loving-kindness, metta, towards all living beings is the most important thing for a
  meditator to pacify his distracted mind and also to practise meditation happily and
  peacefully. So you should do that. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font COLOR="#800080">* Beginning Vipassana Meditation</font></b>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you have done these preliminary stages then you have
  to focus your mind on your bodily and mental processes, be aware of any mental and
  physical processes as they really are. That is the beginning of Vipassana meditation. The
  principle of Vipassana meditation is to be aware of whatever arises in your body and mind
  as it really occurs. In other words, any activity of the body and mind must be very
  attentively observed as it really is. This is the principle of Vipassana meditation. So
  any mental process or physical process is the object of Vipassana meditation. When you
  find any mental process or physical process on any part of your body and mind
  distinctively rising, then you must note it, you must observe it, you must be aware of it
  as it really is. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Any mental or physical phenomenon can be the object of
  insight meditation, Vipassana meditation. You have a variety of meditational objects in
  Vipassana meditation, not like Samatha meditation. In Samatha meditation you have to take
  only a single object to focus your mind. But in Vipassana meditation there are many
  varieties of mental or physical processes as the object of meditation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The mentality or physicality which is more pronounced than
  the other should be observed, you should be mindful of as it is. But the beginner may get
  confused what object to observe or to be mindful of. To avoid this confusion the most
  Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw taught this technique of meditation to his disciples in
  accordance with the four foundations of mindfulness, instructing them to begin with the
  movement of the abdomen. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you focus your mind on the abdomen you find a rising
  movement and falling movement. When you breath in the abdomen rises; when you breathe out
  the abdomen falls. So rising movement and falling movement is the primary object of this
  insight meditation to begin with. But though the abdomen rises through the pressure of the
  air you breathe, this meditation is not a breathing meditation, not a respiratory
  meditation. Though the abdomen falls through the pressure of the breath which is going
  out, this is not a breathing meditation because there the Omniscient Buddha classified the
  wind or the air in six groups. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font COLOR="#800080">* The Wind or Air Element</font></b>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One group of the air or wind is vayo-dhatu. That means the
  wind which exists in the abdomen. This also must be focussed, must be realised by a
  meditator and not identified with his self, his person or bis being. The other aspect of
  wind or air is breathing, respiration. Though the respiration is connected with the rise
  and fall of the abdomen, the rising movement/falling movement is not breathing, not
  respiration. It's the wind or the air which expands and contracts in the abdomen. So
  contemplation of the abdomen's movement is not breathing meditation, not respiration
  meditation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you practise respiration meditation your mind has to
  focus at the nostrils or the top of the upper lips. You focus the mind there and note it
  and breathe in. When you breathe out you focus your mind on the nostrils or on the top of
  the upper lips, and note outward breathing and so on. So, when you focus your mind on the
  abdominal movement and concentrate on it then this contemplation is not contemplation
  breathing meditation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then what is it? This is the meditation of elements.
  Element here means the physical elements: wind or air. We have to focus our mind not only
  on the wind or air elements but also upon the other mental or physical elements too.
  Whatever is predominant, mental phenomena or physical phenomena must be observed as they
  are. So you have to focus your mind on the abdominal movement and notice or observe it:
  rising-falling, making mental note as rising- falling. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font COLOR="#800080">* Sitting</font></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you sit in the wrong position you can't feel the
  pressure of the rising movement or falling movement very well, so you have to sit
  comfortably in the right position. You should not sit in the cross legged position because
  if you cross one leg against another in a short time you feel pressure, a painful
  sensation of aching or numbness. You need not sit in a cross legged position. Your legs
  must be evenly placed side by side, the right leg inside and the left leg outside. Then
  you don't feel any pressure because the two legs are evenly placed side by side. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then your body must be kept in an erect position. Your
  body must be straight. The neck and head also must be in a straight line with the body.
  But you must not stretch out your body. You must keep it straight erect, then close your
  eyes. The right hand must be put on the left one with the palm upward. But you may put
  both hands on both knees with the palms upward. Now relax yourself. Do not feel tense both
  physically and mentally. Relieve all your tensions, mental or physical tensions, and sit
  as comfortably as you can. </font></p>
  <p><font COLOR="#800080" face="Times New Roman"><b>* Rising and Falling Movement of the
  Abdomen </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then focus the mind on the abdominal movement and observe
  the outward movement and inward movement of the body, making a mental note: rising,
  falling. When the abdomen rises you note rising; when the abdomen falls you notice
  falling. You must not pay any attention to the form of the abdomen. What you should
  perceive is the pressure of the rising movement and the falling movement. Whenever the
  rising movement is distinct you should note it rising. When the falling is pronounced you
  note it falling. In the beginning of the practise you need to label such as rising,
  falling, sitting, touching and so on. You have to make a mental note. Because for the
  beginner labelling or mental note helps him to focus the mind on the object very precisely
  and closely. So in the beginning of the practise you need to label or make a mental note
  such as rising, falling, rising, falling. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">During your contemplation of the rise and fall of the
  abdomen your mind may go out. Then when the mind goes out you must now bring it back to
  the primary object, that's the rise and fall of the abdomen. As soon as you are aware that
  your mind is wandering you follow it and note it. Observe it as it is. Say, 'wandering,
  wandering,' or 'thinking, thinking,' or imagining, imagining,' and so on until that
  wandering mind has disappeared. Only after the wandering mind has disappeared do you
  return to the primary object, the rise and fall of the abdomen. Then note as usual rising,
  falling, rising, falling. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the beginning of the practise your mind is still with
  the rise and fall of the abdomen, the primary object, about say five or ten seconds. And
  then it goes out. Whenever you know that the mind is going out you should be aware of it
  going out and make a mental note, 'we are going out,' or 'thinking, thinking,' 'imagining,
  imagining.' If you see any mental image then you note, seeing, seeing, seeing until that
  mental image has disappeared. Only after it has disappeared do you return to the primary
  object and note as usual, rising falling, rising falling. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the beginning of the practise the rise and fall of the
  abdomen is not so pronounced, not so predominant to the beginner's mind. Then the
  meditator is not satisfied with the movement of the abdomen so he makes it vigorous, rapid
  or quick. You mustn't do that. You mustn't breathe quickly or vigorously or deeply so that
  you can feel it very distinctly. Because if you do that you get fatigued. You feel fatigue
  in a short time, then you can't concentrate on it. So breathing must be normal. When you
  put some mental effort in your noting of the rise and fall of the abdomen you can feel it
  to a certain extent and note rising falling, rising falling. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As you have meditated say about four or five days then the
  rise and fall of the abdominal movement will become clearer and clearer, more and more
  distinct to your mind. So in the beginning of this practise, not satisfied with your
  noting of the abdominal movement, you must not breathe in deeply or vigorously or quickly.
  Breathing must be normal. Note as much as it is distinct to your mind. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font COLOR="#800080">* Distractions</font></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">During your contemplation of the rising movement and
  falling movement of the abdomen you may hear any sound, a voice, a noise. And you should
  observe it, make a mental note, hearing hearing hearing hearing, about four or five times.
  After that you come to the primary object, the rise and fall of the abdomen, and note as
  usual. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes you may smell any scent or odour while you are
  contemplating on the abdominal movement. Then you leave the abdominal movement alone and
  note: smelling smelling smelling. Only after that you come to return to the primary object
  and note as usual. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes you may feel hot or cold while you are engaged
  in the rising and fall of the abdomen. Then you leave the abdomen alone and focus your
  mind on the feeling of cold or the sensation of the hot, and observe it as it really is.
  Make a mental note: hot, hot or cold, cold. When the feeling of cold or hot subsides you
  return to the primary object, the rising and fall of the abdomen and note as usual rising
  falling, rising, falling. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you have sat say about fifteen or twenty minutes you
  may feel pain or stiffening or itching on any part of your body. Then you must observe
  that painful or itching sensation as it really occurs. Make a mental note: pain pain pain
  pain pain. When you note the pain your noting should be energetic, precise. When the pain
  is noted superficially and lightly then you can't overcome it. Actually the pain doesn't
  become severe, but with the power of deep concentration the mind becomes so sensitive to
  the pain that it perceives it very well, so you think the pain becomes severe. So you have
  to continue to contemplate the pain as much as possible with utmost patience. That
  patience is the best quality of a meditator, to bear the pain and to overcome it. However
  severe the pain may be you must not give it up. You should concentrate on it as much as
  possible with the utmost patience. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So not only for the pain itself but also in other aspects
  of this meditation patience is the best quality of a yogi. You have to be patient with
  your mind; you have to be patience with your physical discomfort; you have to be patient
  with the disturbances coming from outside. When you are not patient with these things your
  concentration very often is broken, goes away. So you have to have the best quality of a
  meditator, that's patience. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a Burmese saying: <b><i>Ten yi khan neg ban yau</i></b>
  . The meaning is: <b>Patience leads to Nibbana</b>, or the cessation of all kinds of
  suffering. So patience is the best quality of a yogi who will be successful in this
  meditational practise. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes you can't bear the severity of the pain. Then
  you want to change your position so that you can relieve it. You must not change your
  position in a sitting, but there is an exception when a meditator can sit say an hour
  without changing position. After an hour's meditation if he wants to change his position
  he must not do that. He should get up and practise walking meditation because the changing
  of the position in a sitting makes your concentration break. So it's not good. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you change your position very often this becomes
  habitual so that when your meditational experience is even at an advanced stage you want
  to change your position though you don't have any unbearable pain. Sometimes unconsciously
  you have changed your position. Only after you have changed position do you know, 'Ah, I
  have changed my position.' Then concentration breaks. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So those who can sit without changing position an hour
  should not change this position in a sitting even once. But for beginners if they are not
  able to sit when thirty minutes, half an hour, is up without changing position they can
  change once in a sitting, not twice. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Suppose the beginner meditates in sitting then after ten
  minutes' meditation feels a painful sensation and wants to change his position. Then he
  can change it because he cannot sit even an hour. So he should change his position, but
  this must be done mindfully. When you want to change you must note, wanting wanting.
  That's a mental process which must be observed: wanting wanting, or wishing wishing,
  intending intending. Then you change your position, you stretch out your legs, and
  stretching, stretching, stretching. Then again you shift your body, then shifting
  shifting, moving moving. When you settle it on again, then touching touching, sitting
  sitting. When you bend your legs, bending bending, and so on. All actions and movements
  involved in changing the position you must be mindful of as they really are. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">After you have changed position then you return to the
  primary object, the rise and fall of the abdomen, and note as well rising falling, rising
  falling. But after five or ten minutes' meditation you may feel pain unbearable, then you
  may feel you want to change your position. You mustn't do that. Patiently observe the pain
  as much as possible as long as you can. When you feel it unbearable then get up and
  practise walking meditation. You may sit say about twenty minutes or thirty minutes, it
  doesn't matter. You may sit as long as you can with a change of position once - only once,
  not twice. After that you practise walking meditation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As I told you this Vipassana meditation, insight
  meditation, is to put an end to all kinds of suffering through realisation of our
  body-mind processes and their true relation. That's why we have to observe whatever mental
  states, emotional states or physical activities become prominent to our mind. That's why
  we have to be mindful of our painful sensation. Make a mental note, pain pain. The same
  with the stiffening, itching or any physical discomfort or mental or emotional states
  which are arising very prominently. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes you may have two or more objects of meditation,
  that's two or more objects of physical mental processes which are arising at the same
  moment. Then you may get puzzled which object should be noted. You should not get puzzled
  about it. It is the most prominent object of physical or mental processes that you must be
  aware of. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Suppose when you observe the rise and fall of the abdomen
  you feel numbness on your leg. And also you feel an itching sensation in the back. And
  your mind is also thinking about something, about your walk or your travel. Then you have
  four objects of meditation. One is the rise and fall of the abdomen, the other is
  numbness, the third is the itching sensation in the back, and the fourth is a thought
  about your family. What should you do with these four objects that you should be mindful
  of? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You should note the most prominent object. When numbness
  on the leg is more distinct than the other three you should note, numb. You should observe
  it, make a mental note, numb numb, or numbness numbness and so on until it has subsided.
  After it has subsided you return to the primary object, the rise and fall of the abdomen. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But it may be the itching sensation which is more distinct
  than the abdominal movement. Then you should go to the itching sensation and note as
  usual, itching itching itching. Focus in your mind on the itching sensation attentively
  and precisely. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of the four objects of meditation, if the thought about
  your family is more distinct than the other three then you should observe the thought,
  observe this mental state which must be realised by the meditator. Observing the thought,
  make a mental note, thinking thinking thinking thinking. When you note the thought that
  noting must be energetic, precise and somewhat quick, so that the mindfulness or the
  noting becomes more and more powerful than the process of thinking. When the noting mind
  becomes more powerful than the process of thinking, then it overwhelms the process of
  thinking and that process of thinking stops. After the thought has stopped or disappeared
  you return to the primary object, the rise and fall of the abdomen, and note it as usual. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this way when you have two or more objects of a mental
  or physical process you must be aware of the most distinct or prominent object of
  meditation, making mental note as it is. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To summarise, be mindful of mental states, emotional
  states, and physical processes in sitting meditation. You have to begin with the rise and
  fall of the abdomen as soon as you have settled yourself on the seat. But if there are any
  other mental states, emotional states or physical processes which are more distinct than
  the abdominal movement then you observe the one which is the more pronounced. Note it as
  usual. After that object has disappeared you return to the primary object, that's the rise
  and fall of the abdomen, and note it as usual. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font COLOR="#800080">* The Four Foundations of
  Mindfulness.</font></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">First of the four foundations of mindfulness, the
  meditator must be aware of whatever arises within the body and mind as it really occurs.
  So while you are walking also you must be aware of the movement of the foot. When you
  walk, first of all you must stand still at the starting point of the walk. Stand still and
  first make a mental note, standing standing standing, about ten times, perceiving the
  inner posture of standing. Not the form of the body but the erect posture for standing.
  After that you walk, left step, right step. Then you note, left right, left right, being
  aware of the movement of the foot very precisely and attentively. Or you can note,
  stepping stepping stepping. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But your mind doesn't stay with the movement of the foot
  very long. It may stay with the movement of the foot say about one or two minutes, then
  the mind goes out, wanders about. But in the beginning of the practise you are not aware
  of the wandering mind. You think you are focussing your mind on the movement of the foot
  but actually the mind is going out still asleep. As soon as you know that the mind is
  wandering or thinking about something else then unconsciously you bring it back to the
  foot. Then you have a chance to note the wandering mind because the mind has already
  stayed with the movement of the foot. Then you have to note left right, left right.
  Labelling or seeing is not the important thing. What is important is to note the movement
  of the foot, to perceive the movement of the foot, to be aware of the movement of the
  foot, but without labelling or mental note. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Your mind may not at first be able to focus on the
  movement of the foot very precisely. That's why we use labelling as an instrument to help
  focus our mind on the movement of the foot. But when you have practised walking meditation
  for say about half an hour, you may be able to note that the mind is wandering when it
  goes out. As soon as you know the mind is wandering you must stop walking and make a
  mental note, wandering wandering, or thinking thinking, imagining imagining, as the case
  may be. After that you return to the movement of the foot and note, left right, left
  right. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you are able to concentrate to a certain extent by
  being aware of the movement of the foot, make a mental note left and right, you should
  note two parts of the step: lifting parts and dropping parts. When you lift the foot note
  it, lifting. When you put it down note it, putting. In this way: lifting, putting,
  lifting, putting. Or lifting dropping, lifting dropping. When you note two parts of a step
  you need not label left and right. Left and right must be dropped when you make a mental
  note, lifting dropping, lifting dropping. Slowly not quickly. Gradually you must make your
  step slower and slower so that you can easily note the movement of the foot very well. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you are well able to note lifting dropping then you
  can increase to one more object. Three parts of a step must be noted: lifting part,
  pushing part, dropping part. When you lift the foot note lifting. When you push it forward
  note pushing. When you drop it down you note dropping. In this way lifting, pushing,
  dropping; lifting pushing dropping. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you find it difficult to perceive the movement of the
  foot because of labelling or making a mental note, then you should try without labelling
  or making a mental note. Just be aware of the movement of the foot: lifting movement,
  pushing forward movement, and dropping movement. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you reach the other end of the walk you have to stand
  still and note your posture of standing, the posture of your body, standing standing about
  ten times. When you want to turn your body then note wanting wanting, then intending
  intending, then turning turning, very slowly. The movement of turning must be noted very
  slowly. Then again when you face the direction you came, then you stand still and note the
  standing posture ten times. Then walk again, lifting pushing dropping, and lifting pushing
  dropping. And so on. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you are able to walk an hour it's better, because in
  walking meditation the movement of the foot, the object of meditation is very distinct,
  very clear to your mind so you can easily observe it. You can easily be aware of it. But
  as the principle of Vipassana meditation goes on, any mental states, emotional states or
  physical activities must be observed as they are so, except sitting and walking. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are many actions and movements you have to do in
  your daily life. Those daily activities also must be noted such as stretching of the arms
  and bending of the arms, raising the hand, putting down the hand, and sitting down and
  rising from the seat. All the actions and movements you are doing must be observed as they
  really occur: while you are eating, while you are washing, while you are showering, while
  you are preparing your beds. There are many many activities involved in these actions.
  These activities must be noted, you must be aware of them. To be able to note these
  activities you have to deliberately slow down your actions and movements. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the next talk I'll continue to explain to you the
  practical exercise on this meditation. May all of you rightly understand the technique of
  this meditation and practise intensively during this retreat and achieve your goal. </font></p>
