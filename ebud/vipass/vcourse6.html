<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We'll continue our discourse on the chapter of clear
  comprehension in the Maha-satipatthana Sutra. Before I go to this chapter I would like to
  continue to explain the six sense bases and the six objects, and the six consciousnesses,
  because yesterday I dealt with contemplating on the consciousness of seeing with several
  objects. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the chapter of Dhammanusati, Contemplation of dhamma,
  the Buddha said, 'Whatever you see you must be mindful of as it really is. Whatever you
  hear you must be aware of as it occurs. Whatever you smell you must be aware of as it
  really occurs. Whatever you taste you must be aware of as it really occurs. Whatever you
  touch you must be aware of as it really occurs. Whatever you think or think about you must
  be aware of as it really occurs.' The Buddha teaches us to be aware of all six sense bases
  and all six objects and the six final kinds of consciousness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we see a visible object the consciousness of seeing
  arises dependent on the eye - one of the six bases - and the visible object. When your eye
  has contact with a visible object then there arises a consciousness of seeing. So
  consciousness of seeing arises dependent on the eye and the visible object. The eye is one
  of six sense bases. The visible object is one of six objects. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So when you see something you must be aware of it as
  seeing, seeing, seeing. As long as you see it you must be aware of it, you must note it.
  When you note the consciousness of seeing, it means you note the eye and visible object
  too, because when there is no eye and when there is no visible object the consciousness
  for seeing doesn't arise. Consciousness of seeing arises dependent on both eye and visible
  object. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So if you observe the consciousness of seeing then it
  means you observe eyes and visible object too. So whenever you see something you must not
  watch the thing which is seen. You must not watch the thing with which you see. What you
  need to observe is seeing, the consciousness for seeing - because when you observe the
  visible object which is seen then you have to note seeing, seeing, not object, object.
  When you note seeing, seeing, seeing it's the consciousness for seeing, not the visible
  object. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Only when you note the consciousness for seeing, the
  noting mind disturbs the process of seeing. So the process of seeing becomes weak and it
  doesn't see the object very well. It cannot judge about the object, whether it is pleasant
  or unpleasant, bad or good. Then you won't have any defilement arising dependent on the
  consciousness for seeing or the visible object. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So whatever you see you must be aware of by making the
  mental note seeing, seeing, seeing. Whatever you hear you must be aware of by making the
  mental note hearing, hearing. Whatever you smell you must observe the consciousness of
  smelling, making the mental note smelling, smelling. Whatever you taste you must be aware
  of it, make a mental note tasting, tasting. Whatever you touch you must observe it as
  touching, touching, touching. Whatever you think about you must be aware of it, make a
  mental note of it as thinking, thinking, and so on. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you hear some sound or voice, that is an audible
  object, that consciousness of hearing arises dependent on the ear and audible objects.
  When you note smelling, smelling then consciousness for smelling arises dependent on nose
  and sense odour. When you note tasting, tasting the consciousness for taste arises
  dependent on the tongue and the food. When you note touching, touching the consciousness
  for touching arises dependent on the body and a tangible object. When you note thinking,
  thinking that thought arises dependent on the mind and the dhamma, that is what it to be
  thought about. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">These six sense bases are also called 'sense doors.' The
  term door is used for these three sense bases. Literally it is translated into door. Eye
  is a sense door, ear is a sense door, nose is a sense door, tongue is a sense door, body
  is a sense door, and mind is a sense door. The sense door eye is called cakkha-dvara. That
  means the eye door. cakkhu means the eye, dvara means door. Cakkha-dvara means the eye
  door. In the same way the ear door, the nose door, the tongue door, the body door, the
  mind door, and so on. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Why these six sense bases are called doors is because the
  consciousness comes to your mind through the eye. Sometimes these mental states come to
  the mind through the ear, sometimes through the nose, sometimes through the tongue,
  sometimes through the body, sometimes through the mind. So they are called the doors. Here
  the Lord Buddha said, 'Your six sense doors must be closed so that you don't have any
  mental defilements.' Then do you know how to close the door? By noting of six things, six
  consciousness of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, and thinking about. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the point, what the Buddha said. When you see,
  say, a very beautiful rose you realise the rose is very beautiful. Its scent is very
  sweet. When you judge like that there arises a pleasant feeling about the rose. When you
  feel a pleasant feeling what will arise? Attachment, to what? To the rose. To the feeling
  or to the rose? To the rose. And pleasant feeling, attachment, arises dependent on that
  feeling. This attachment is to the rose. Then if the flower is not beautiful, is ugly and
  produces a bad smell, when you see it how do you feel, pleasant or unpleasant? Unpleasant.
  You'll judge the flower is very ugly, 'I don't want to see it.' Then what mental state
  arises? Aversion. Anger. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you judge the flower is beautiful and pleasant then
  you have attachment or desire for it or to it. When you judge the flower is ugly and
  produces a bad odour then you have aversion or anger depending on the unpleasant feeling.
  Here you could not close your eye doors so these mental defilements come into the mind.
  One of the mental defilements comes to your mind through the eye doors. Then when you have
  defilements is it good or bad? Bad. Yes. Mental defilement is dukkha, suffering, and also
  the cause of dukkha, suffering. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then what's the thing with which you have to close these
  six doors? Noting, yes, mindfulness. Mindfulness is called sati, in Pali. So you must
  close all these six doors with mindfulness. And do you know how to close them with
  mindfulness? Yes, noting, being mindful of. That's why the Buddha said, 'Whatever you see
  must be noted or mindful of, as it is. Whatever you hear must be mindful of or noted.
  Whatever you smell must be observed. Whatever you taste you must be aware of. Whatever you
  touch must be noted. Whatever you think about must be watched, as it is.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is how to close the six doors so that any of the
  mental defilements cannot come into the mind. If you open the door then these mental
  defilements are waiting there outside the door to come into the mind. When the mental
  defilements come into the mind you are lucky or unlucky? Unlucky. Sorrow, worry, anxiety,
  strain, stress and depression, agony, anguish - a lot of suffering coming into your mind
  through these six sense doors. So it's very important. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This technique which closes these six doors is called
  indriya- samatta in Pali. Here indriya means six doors, samatta means their closing or
  closed. So indriya-samatta is the most important factor in the teaching of the Buddha
  which enables a person to get free from all kinds of suffering. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes you practise walking meditation say, and here
  the place for walking is very narrow, very small. So sometimes when you pass each other
  you can't help to look askance. Then you feel pleasant or unpleasant, at least disturbed.
  Your concentration is disturbed by the consciousness for looking or seeing. Then
  concentration is gone. Then sometimes through that contact of the eye and the visible
  object, if any desire attachment comes into the mind then you suffer. Or any aversion or
  anger comes into the mind through those eye doors then you suffer. Why? Because you do not
  close your doors. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here let me ask you a question. Which of these six doors
  is the worst thing, which makes man suffer? The mind. How do you know it? Through your
  experience? Yes. Though you are meditating sitting here, and noting rising, falling,
  rising, falling, sitting, touching, rising, falling, sitting, touching. At the beginning
  of sitting the mind is concentrated to a certain extent on the rise and fall of the
  abdomen. But gradually when your mental effort becomes less, concentration becomes weak.
  Then the mind goes to your son? Yes, and if the son is very good you feel pleasant about
  him. If the son is bad you feel unpleasant about him. Then that pleasantness causes
  attachment or desire or love to arise. Aversion causes anger or hatred or disgust to
  arise. These are mental defilements. Then you suffer. But you are sitting here in the
  hall. You suffer a lot. Why? Because you could not close your mind doors. So to close
  these six doors is very important to live happily and peacefully. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That's why I also ask you could you note every thought in
  our interview. I want to remind you to note almost every thought as much as possible. Do
  not fail to note the thoughts because these thoughts make you suffer a lot. Their rise
  depends on mind and the thinkable object, dhamma. We call it dhamma, that object. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, yesterday I explained to you when you look straight
  you must be aware of it; when you look aside you must be aware of it. But the Buddha
  proceeded with his chapter of clear comprehension like this, 'When you bend your arms or
  legs you must be aware of it. When you stretch out you must be aware of it, as it is.' So
  when you bend the arms, observe, bending, bending, bending, bending, slowly. Not quickly.
  Slowly. Why do you need to slow down your activities? If you bend fast could you catch
  each movement of the arm? You can't. So to catch and to observe each movement of the arm
  you have to slow it down. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And why do you need to observe each movement of the arm
  very closely and precisely? Yes, here as you know there are three aspects of existence,
  mental or physical phenomena. Normally we do not realise or experience these three aspects
  of body-mind processes, or mental and physical phenomena. These processes of existence are
  called general characteristics of mental and physical phenomena or common characteristics
  of mental and physical phenomena. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yesterday I told you about two levels of understanding of
  mental and physical phenomena. The first level is understanding of specific
  characteristics of mental and physical phenomena. I explained that the mind has its
  characteristics, cognising or perceiving the object. Then desire or lobha, attachment, has
  the specific characteristic of clinging to the object. Then dosa had the specific
  characteristic of rudeness. When you become angry you become rude. So dosa, anger,
  aversion has the specific characteristic of rudeness. And moha is ignorance. Sometimes it
  is translated into 'delusion,' but 'ignorance' is better I think. Ignorance, moha has the
  specific characteristic of covering the truth. When moha covers the truth you can't
  rightly understand it. You can't realise it because the truth is covered by moha,
  ignorance. Ignorance has the specific characteristic of covering the truth. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">These are the three main roots of evil, the Buddha said:
  lobha, desire, attachment, craving, and dosa, anger, hatred, aversion, and moha, ignorance
  of the truth. These three mental factors are the main roots of evil, the Buddha said,
  because they make human beings suffer a lot. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I should continue to explain to you the specific
  characteristics of the other physical, material elements. This body, or physical process,
  is composed mainly of four material elements as you know. What are the four material
  elements which constitute the so- called body? Pathavi-dhatu, apo-dhatu, tejo-dhatu,
  vayo-dhatu. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here pathavi means earth; dhatu means the element.
  Pathavi-datu means the earth element. Apo means water; dhatu means the element. Apo-datu,
  water element. Tejo means the fire; dhatu means the element. Tejo-dhatu means the fire
  element. Vayo is wind or air; dhatu is element. Vayo-dhatu, wind element or air element. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">These are the four primary material elements which
  constitute the so-called body of a man or a woman. There are twenty-four other minor
  material elements, twenty-eight all together. The primary material elements are four, then
  the secondary elements are twenty-four. But the twenty-four secondary elements arise
  dependent on the four primary material elements, so the secondary elements are not so much
  important as the primary ones. That's why we have to watch the four primary elements. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here when the say pathavi-dhatu, earth element, actually
  it is not earth because we have not the proper term for this nature, physical
  characteristic. We have to name it as pathavi-dhatu or earth element. Hardness and
  softness are the specific characteristics of the earth element. This hardness and softness
  is called pathavi-dhatu or earth element. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Did you observe it while you were meditating? It may be
  difficult for a meditator who sits on the cushion to find this element. It's better for
  you to sit on the floor without a cushion, then you'll find this element very distinctly.
  When you sit even on the cushion and your legs touch the floor, there you find hardness.
  When you sit on the cushion you find softness. When you feel soft or hard on any part of
  the body you must be aware of it, you must watch it: hard, hard, soft, soft. Why should
  you watch it? To close the door. If you do not observe soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, then
  you feel it pleasant. That pleasant feeling gives rise to attachment, desire for your
  cushion. Because you do not observe soft, soft, soft you are enjoying softness of the
  cushion and a pleasant feeling as well. That pleasant feeling causes attachment and desire
  to arise. So wherever you go you have to take this cushion to sit on. Please be careful
  whenever you observe your physical processes. Any of these specific characteristics of
  these primary four elements are distinct, so you should observe them. You can analyse or
  investigate them. Here analyse means not theoretically analysing, but when you know the
  softness or hardness through your experience by means of mindfulness of it. Then you don't
  take that softness as pleasant or unpleasant; you don't identify the feeling of softness
  with yourself. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The feeling of softness and the pleasant sensation is away
  from you. The feeling, the sensation of softness and pleasantness is here. Then you note
  it: pleasant, pleasant, soft, soft, soft. This pleasantness and the feeling of softness is
  not a person, not a being, not I, not you. You know that through your experience. Because
  you observe it you are mindful of it, you are aware of it. When you don't feel this
  pleasant or unpleasant sensation of soft as a person a being, an I or a you, then there
  won't arise any attachment or anger or aversion depending on that softness. Then you shut
  up your bodily sense doors and mental defilement cannot come to your mind through these
  doors. That's why the Buddha said, 'When you feel soft or hard you must be aware of it.'
  That is the specific characteristic of the hard element. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The water element actually is not water. Its
  characteristics are fluidity and coalition. Fluidity and coalition are the specific
  characteristics of the water element and your body. Did you find fluidity and coalition in
  your mind when you were meditating? Yes, you experience them when you sit and note
  arising, falling, sitting, touching, arising, falling, sitting, touching. Sometimes you
  have a tearing, and also sometimes you have a sweating. These are the specific
  characteristics of the water element. Sometimes you feel some fluidity on your face or on
  your back. Then you have to note fluidity, fluidity and so on. Then when you open your eye
  and see, there's nothing because the fluidity is internal not external. Your internal
  bodily process, material process, had fluidity as its characteristic. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then tejo-dhatu. We call it the fire element. Except
  that's actually not fire. It's temperature. Tejo-dhatu has as its characteristics heat and
  cold. Heat and cold are the specific characteristics of tejo-dhatu the Fire element or
  temperature element. Then do you experience that tejo-dhatu when you sit for meditation? A
  lot! Sometimes you feel as if you are sitting on the fire. Sometimes you are sitting on a
  block of ice. Cold and hot. Then you have to watch it, cold, cold, hot, hot. If you do not
  observe it then you'll identify that feeling of cold with yourself: 'Oh I am cold, I am
  cold. I need some sweater or some blanket to cover on me,' because you identify the cold
  with yourself. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Actually cold is not yourself. Theoretically you know cold
  is not a person, not a being, not a man or not a woman, but you perceive it to be a person
  because, 'I cold.' I am the man who feels cold. I am the woman who feels hot. Then cold
  and hot are identified with yourself and your person. Why? Because you do not close your
  door. Then what should you do? You should close your door, and note cold, cold, hot, hot,
  hot. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When your mindfulness becomes powerful and concentration
  deeper then you realise cold separate from your body or away from your body. The feeling
  of cold or hot is there. You are here, you are realising and noting it. Sometimes when
  concentration becomes deeper then there's no you or no person who notes the cold. But
  there's the mind that notes it. Then you come to realise the dual process of mentality and
  physicality and sensation too. At that moment your bodily form has disappeared from your
  mind. You are not aware of it; you are not conscious of it. Then you feel there's no
  person, no being, no I or no you, no self. What is really existing is a dual process of
  feeling of cold and the mind that notes it, that's all. Then there won't arise any mental
  defilement because these mental defilements arise dependent on the idea or the concept of
  a person, a being, an I or a you, a self. If you have destroyed that idea of a personal
  being then there won't arise any mental defilements because it has no seeds to grow out of
  it. Then here you have closed your doors. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">After that there's the fourth one, vayo-dhatu, the Wind
  element or air element. It's also not actually wind or air. The wind element has movement
  as its specific characteristic: movement, motion, vibrating, supporting. Did you
  experience these specific characteristics when you sat in meditation? Rising falling, yes.
  Rising and falling, then sitting down and rising from the seat, you have the wind element.
  When you rise from the seat you have to rise gradually. Then that movement is the wind or
  air element. Both. So when you note rising, rising, rising, rising, or getting up, getting
  up, getting up, then what you should realise is the process of the rising movement from
  this your seat until you stand still. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There you realise the specific characteristic of the wind
  element, a series of many movements arising and passing away. The same way when you sit
  down, you have to be aware of sitting, sitting, sitting, sitting, sitting, sitting,
  sitting. Here what you are aware of is this sitting movement, all the movements which are
  involved in the act of sitting. Then you know the wind or air element. Then when your
  concentration is good enough and you come to realise when you sit down you don't find any
  man or human being or any body. What you find is a series of many movements going on. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You don't identify those movements with yourself. In other
  words you don't regard them as a person, a being, an I or a you. What is it? That's a
  natural process of physical phenomena. When you know that there won't arise any concept of
  a being a person an I or a you depending on that movement. You close your door. There
  won't arise any mental defilement, desire or attachment, anger or aversion. Then you live
  happy. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, these are the specific characteristics of the primary
  material elements. I explained you the three specific characteristics of three groups of
  evil, lobha, dosa and moha, and also the specific characteristics of consciousness, mind.
  You have to realise them in the first level of understanding. Then when you proceed with
  your practise intensively and strenuously, when mindfulness is continuous and
  concentration deep, then you come to realise the general characteristics of mental and
  physical phenomena. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those three aspects of existence, anicca, dukkha and
  anatta, Impermanence, suffering and impersonal nature, these are three characteristics of
  the existing mental and physical phenomena. Or these are known as general characteristics
  of mental and physical phenomena. After you have well realised the specific
  characteristics of mental and physical phenomena you are able to realise these three
  general characteristic of existing physical phenomena: impermanence, suffering, and
  impersonal nature or no- soul, no self, non-ego nature, of mental and physical phenomena. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What's impermanent? When a mental process arises and then
  passes away, that's impermanence. Having, raising, and then passing away very instantly.
  So when your concentration is good enough to note rising, falling, rising, falling, then
  you have to realise a series of many rising movements one after another; a series of many
  falling movements. A series of many movements means one movement arises and then passes
  away, then another movement arises and passes away, then another movement arises and
  passes away. Then we come to realise these elements are impermanent because they arises
  and then very instantly pass away. You have to go to that stage. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">May all of you be able to realise both specific
  characteristics and general characteristics of body-mind process and achieve your goal. </font></p>
