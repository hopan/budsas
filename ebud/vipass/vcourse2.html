<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Today I'll deal with the continuation of my talk on the
  practical exercise of Vipassana meditation or insight meditation. Yesterday I explained
  walking meditation very briefly. So today I think I should elaborate on the practise of
  walking meditation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As to walking meditation the Buddha laid emphasis on
  awareness of the movement of the foot while you are walking. The commentary to the
  discourse explains how walking meditation should be practised. Yesterday I told you to be
  aware of the movement of the foot and the step, first of all noting left and right then
  lifting dropping, and then lifting, pushing forward and dropping. Though you make a mental
  note left and right your mind must follow the whole process of the movement of the foot
  very attentively and closely. And to do that you have slow down your stepping. You must
  walk slowly so that you can be aware of the movement of the foot very closely and
  precisely. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">For beginners, and also in the beginning of the practise
  for experienced meditators too, in every walking the first ten minutes should be spent
  noting left and right. But about after two days or two or three days meditation the
  experienced meditator should spend about five minutes noting left and right. You have to
  slow down your stepping. And for the beginner he should note left right, left right about
  ten minutes. After that he should note either two parts or three parts. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here two parts means a step is noted in two parts. The <b>lifting
  part</b> and the <b>dropping part</b> of the step must be noted. So you have to note
  lifting dropping, lifting dropping. But if you think you are able to note three steps you
  can skip the noting of two steps and go straight to the noting of three parts. That means
  after you have noted the left and right for ten minutes you pick up three parts of a step:
  lifting pushing dropping, lifting pushing dropping. Awareness of two parts of a step is
  not very good because if you actually lift the foot and drop it down then you have to lift
  it from the same place and you have to put it down to the same place - because after you
  have lifted the foot actually you have to push it forward to a certain extent a certain
  distance, and then you put it down. Without noting the pushing movement after the lifting
  movement you have skipped one process of the pushing movement and then you note dropping.
  The middle part of the step is lost. So if you think you are able to note three parts you
  should note them as: lifting pushing dropping, lifting pushing dropping. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Your stepping must be short. The step should be about the
  length of a foot so that you can put your foot down very well and note it very precisely
  and closely. If your step is long, before you put your foot well on the ground or on the
  floor then unconsciously you have already lifted the heel of the other foot. Then you lose
  awareness of the lifting of the heel when you note lifting. That is because your step is
  long. So your step must not be long. It should be about the length of the foot so that you
  can concentrate your mind well on its movement very precisely, and also to have a clear
  experience of its movement. Then after you have put down your foot very well, established
  it in its place, you begin to lift the heel of the other foot. Then you can note it very
  well and you can be aware of the very beginning of the lifting of the heel of the other
  foot. So your stepping should be about the length of a foot, not longer than that, So you
  should be careful. Then when you drops your foot down then your foot touches the ground on
  the floor, the carpet, and you can note it touching. In this way you can note lifting,
  pushing, dropping, touching. Then when your foot touches the ground or the floor or the
  carpet you are to lift the other foot from the very beginning of the lifting of the heel.
  When you are about to lift the heel of the other foot you have to press the front floor a
  little bit. You must be aware of that pressing. After you have noted the pressure of the
  foot your mind goes to the other foot and note it as lifting, slowly. Then again lifting
  then pushing then putting down or dropping, touching, pressing. Lifting, pushing,
  dropping, touching, pressing. But the commentary said a step may be noted in six parts.
  When you lift the heel note, lifting; when you raise the toes note, raising. In this way,
  lifting, raising. Then pushing, dropping, touching, pressing. You'll have to slow down
  your step very well. If you do not slow the stepping you are not able to note these three
  parts of the step. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here again I want to tell you that this Vipassana
  meditation is practised to realise body-mind processes and their true nature. So whatever
  you are aware of, bodily processes or mental processes, the aim of awareness is to realise
  them in their true nature. You should keep this in your mind when you practise this
  meditation. This meditation is not just for concentration but for realisation of mental
  physical processes too. That realisation enables the meditator to be free from all kinds
  of mental and physical sufferings and to live happily and blissfully. That realisation is
  called vipassana nana, insight knowledge. Insight knowledge leads a person to the
  enlightenment which destroys all kinds of suffering. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So very action is preceded by a mental process a wishing,
  wanting or intention. When you wish to lift the foot you do it. So lifting of the foot is
  preceded by wishing, or wanting or intention which are mental processes, mental phenomena.
  Not only lifting of the foot but also all other actions and movements are preceded by
  wishing, wanting or intention, mental processes. So if you are able to note this mental
  process - wishing, wanting or intention -- you come to realise the relationship between
  the movement of the foot and the mental process that's intention or wishing or wanting. To
  realise how these two processes - physical and mental processes of intention - are related
  to each other you have to attain deep concentration by being aware of the movement of the
  foot. And when you have realised how these two processes are related to each other you
  don't have any idea of a person who is walking, a being who is lifting the foot, a self
  who is pushing forward the foot. What you realise is that there's an intention of wishing,
  a mental process, which causes the movement of the foot to arise. Without intention or
  wishing or wanting lifting of the foot, the movement cannot be done. In this way you come
  to realise the law of cause and effect in your walking meditation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So you have to note intending, but you can note wishing or
  wanting. Usually we instruct our yogis to note intending, lifting; intending, raising -
  raising of the toes; intending, pushing; intending, dropping; touching, intending,
  pressing. When you note touching it's not preceded by the intention, because as soon as
  you drop your foot to the ground it touches the ground whether it has intention or not.
  Actually the foot, a physical process, hasn't any intention to touch the ground. Even
  though it hasn't any intention, when you drop it down it touches the ground. So before
  touching you need not note intention because there's no intention before the touching
  sensation. So intending, dropping; touching; then intending, dropping; then touching; then
  intending, pressing. Again your mind goes to the other foot and notes intending, lifting;
  intending, raising; intending, pushing forward; intending, dropping; touching; intending,
  pressing, and so on. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As to the awareness of the movement of the foot, the
  commentary to the Pali text mentions how a meditator experiences or realises the movement
  of the foot through his personal or direct experience when he is practising walking
  meditation. But I need not explain to you how the commentary mentions it because later on
  you will know yourself through your experience. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You should be careful not to look round here and there
  while you are walking. Once you look round the mind goes with your eye. Then your
  concentration is broken. If the mind doesn't stay with the movement of the foot,
  concentration is broken. So you have to control your mind. And also before you practise
  walking you should determine that, `I won't look round here and there while I'm practising
  walking meditation. Though I may have a tendency or desire to look round I will note that
  desire or tendency until it has disappeared. After the desire or tendency has disappeared
  you won't look round. Then your concentration won't be broken since the mind will stay
  with the foot. So you should be careful to control your eyes. You must not look at the
  foot. If you do you feel tense on your neck or on your back because your head has to bend
  too much. So you have to keep your eyes looking at a place about four or five feet ahead
  of you. During walking meditation if your mind goes out you should note: going out going
  out, or wandering wandering. If you think about anything else then you note, thinking
  thinking, and so on. Whatever thought arises must be noted during your walking meditation.
  After the thought has disappeared you return to the primary object of noting: intending,
  lifting; intending, raising, intending, pushing; intending, dropping; touching; intending,
  pressing, and so on. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What I have now explain to you is how you can be aware of
  all the movements of the foot so that you can realise them in their true nature. But for
  the beginner you need not note all these six points or twelve objects of meditation. For
  beginners that's enough to note four or five objects. Say: intending, lifting, moving,
  dropping, touching. But your noting gradually increases. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">First of all note left and right about ten minutes, then
  leave the two objects of lifting and dropping and go to noting of the three objects. Say,
  lifting moving dropping; lifting pushing dropping; about ten minutes. Then note intending,
  lifting, pushing, dropping; intending, lifting, pushing, dropping until the end of all
  your walking meditation. Then what is the result of the awareness of the movement of the
  foot? If you strive your best you will note it through your direct experience of the
  movement of the foot. Here because you do not get yet accustomed to concentrate the
  movement of the foot, sometimes you may feel headache or dizzy. Then you should stand
  still and note dizziness: dizzy dizzy dizzy, or headache headache, and so on. And if that
  feeling of dizziness has disappeared resume your walking and note as usual intending
  lifting pushing dropping and touching and so on. But wherever you go you must be aware of
  your step when you go to your room, when you go to the dining room, when you come from
  your room, when you come from the dining room. You must be aware of your step. At least
  left right, left right. If it is possible, lifting, pushing, dropping. You must not go
  anywhere unmindfully because this meditation needs continuity of mindfulness for the whole
  day so that your concentration becomes deeper and deeper, through which the insight
  knowledge or realisation of mental and physical processes arises. So you mustn't walk fast
  while you are in retreat. Wherever you go you must walk slowly and be mindful of your step
  very attentively. </font></p>
