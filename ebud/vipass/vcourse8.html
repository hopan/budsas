<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Today I'll continue that chapter of clear comprehension
  and discourse on the Mahasatipatthana sutra. But I'll summarise it because there are some
  aspects of Dhamma which should be dealt with for your progress in your meditation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha said, 'When you bend your arms and legs you
  must be aware of it as it is.' When you stretch out the arms and legs you must be aware of
  it as it is. When you dress you must all be aware of it. When you take off clothes you
  must be aware of it; when you put on clothes you must be aware of it. That's what the
  Buddha instructed us about daily activities. Then, when you hold the plate, you note it.
  When you hold the cup in the saucer you note it, holding. When you touch it, touching.
  When you decide to keep inside and so on. Whatever you are doing, in holding, drinking tea
  or coffee, you note it. The Buddha said when you answer the call of nature these
  activities you must be aware of as they are. When you go to the toilet you should be aware
  of all the activities involved. Then, every day, the Buddha said when you eat food then
  note all the activities in the act of having the food. When you drink water or when you
  drink anything you must be aware of all the activities involved in these actions. When you
  chew something you must note chewing. When you lick something you must note the licking.
  We have a Burmese medicine for clearing of the throat, called yessa. That means a lickable
  salt. There we have to lick it. We mustn't take it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font COLOR="#800080">* Postures</font></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you walk you must be aware of all the movements of
  the foot, slowing down your stepping. When you sit you should note the upright posture of
  the sitting. Not the form of the body, but the upright position of your body must be noted
  as sitting. When you focus your mind on your sitting you know that you are sitting. Then
  you note sitting. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Burma some meditators when they are instructed to note
  the sitting posture find out the form of the body, the shoulder, the leg, the eyes, the
  nose, the head. Because they are looking for the form of the body they couldn't note it.
  But the Buddha doesn't instruct us to note these forms of the body. What the Buddha
  instructs is to note the upright posture of the body as sitting, because he would like us
  to realise the supporting nature of vayo-dhatu, the wind element. When you sit there's an
  air inside the body, and also air outside the body. The two airs support the body so it is
  sitting in an upright position. So to realise the nature of the supporting wind element
  the Buddha teaches us to note sitting. So you should focus your mind on the upright
  posture of the body and note it as sitting. In the same way the upright position of
  standing must be noted: standing standing standing, sitting sitting sitting and so on. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes some yogis misunderstand this instruction so
  when they are instructed to note the sitting posture what they notice is the contact
  between the body and the floor or the seat. It's wrong. That's contact or touching, not
  sitting. The commentary to the text explains that sitting means the bending posture of the
  lower and the upright posture of the upper body. I instructed you to be aware of the
  upright posture of sitting, the upper body, because if you go down and be aware of the
  bending posture of the lower body your mind tends to go to the contact. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font COLOR="#800080">* Noting objects</font></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So in sitting meditation if you are able to note the
  rising and fall of the abdomen very well and the concentration is somewhat good, then the
  mind tends to go out and wander because it can easily note the two movements of the
  abdomen. Then you need some more objects to note so as to make the mind too busy to have
  any time to go out. So when you are able to note the rise and fall of the abdomen very
  well you should note the sitting posture and the touching sensation too, either of the two
  or one of the two. Say rising falling and sitting, or rising falling, touching - any point
  of the touching sensation which is more distinct than the other points. So, rising falling
  sitting touching, rising falling sitting touching. You must be aware of four objects
  successively and continuously, not separately. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some meditators misunderstand so they note two objects
  separately. Sometimes they note rising and falling, rising and falling; sometimes sitting,
  touching, sitting, touching. When you are able to note these four objects constitutively
  and successively you must do four, not two separately. But sometimes you may be not able
  to note all the four constitutively. Then you should note their rise and fall separately,
  then sitting touching. If the abdominal movement is good for you to note you should stay
  with it. Unless it's good for some reason you can note the sitting and touching sensations
  alternately: sitting touching, sitting touching. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes some meditators very easily feel their heartbeat
  when concentrating on the movement of the abdomen, because when they note the rise and
  fall of the abdomen they make too much mental effort breathing. That effort makes the
  heart beat and sometimes they confuse the movement of the abdomen with the heartbeat. For
  such meditators the sitting posture and touching sensation are good at the beginning of
  the practise. Later on you will be able to note all these four objects very well,
  systematically and methodically. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So if a meditator has no problem with the heartbeat he
  should continue to note the rise and fall of the abdomen. But if he thinks he needs more
  objects then note the sitting posture and touching sensation too. So rising falling,
  sitting touching; rising falling, sitting touching. You have to note the sitting posture
  and touching sensation before the rising movement starts again. In other words between the
  falling movement and the rising movement you should insert the two objects, sitting and
  touching, so that your mind doesn't have any time to go out. The point is to make the mind
  quite occupied with the object. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One meditator here reported in his interview that he
  didn't note the intention before lifting. He noted only six objects of movements of the
  foot. I asked why he didn't note anything. He said because he was too busy to note this
  and this before lifting. A bit of time, even a millionth of a second, and the mind goes
  out. So the mind must be occupied with objects. You should note intending, lifting,
  pushing, dropping, touching, pressing, and so on. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The same with sitting. When you think you have a little
  bit of time between the falling movement and the rising movement of the abdomen, you must
  fill up that gap with the two objects or one of the two, the sitting posture and the
  touching sensation. So after you have noted the falling movement you note sitting,
  touching before you start to note the rising movement. Sometimes you may find it difficult
  to note two objects before rising again. Then you should note one object, the sitting or
  touching sensation, so that you have better and deeper concentration. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So when you sit you must be aware of the sitting posture.
  When you stand you must be aware of the standing posture. When you lie down you must be
  aware of the lying posture: lying lying lying. In Burma one of the old monks about ninety
  years could walk twenty-four hours; he could sit twenty-four hours; lie down twenty-four
  hours by being aware of it without sleeping. Two years back he passed away at the age of
  ninety-two I think. He had been meditating since forty years of age. I think you should
  imitate him. He could sit for twenty-four hours without changing position. He walked
  twenty-four hours. He lay down twenty-four hours. If you lie down two minutes then you
  fall asleep. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In lying down you see the abdomen movement is very
  distinct. When lying down note, rising falling lying, rising falling lying, rising falling
  lying. This is good medicine for insomnia. When you wake up the first thing of which you
  are conscious most be noted. During any meditation of ten days you are not able to do that
  even though you try it. As the Buddha said, as soon as you are awake you should note the
  consciousness about wakening: wakening wakening wakening wakening. After that you want to
  open your eyes: wanting wanting, or wishing wishing. And then when you open the eyes,
  opening opening. And so on. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">These are the examples you should take for awareness for
  daily activity. The Buddha teaches us these examples. The point is to have continuous and
  constant mindfulness for the whole day. There is not a mental state, emotional state or
  physical process of which you should not be mindful as it is so that you can have a
  continuity of mindfulness which is the cause of deep concentration on which insight
  knowledge is built up. When that insight knowledge is realised, or the specific
  characteristics or general characteristics of mental and physical processes, then you go
  through all thirteen stages of insight knowledge one after another, and higher and higher.
  After you have completed all the thirteen stages of insight knowledge you become
  enlightened. That means you attain the first stage of enlightenment. It's called Magga.
  The Path. When you have attained the first stage of enlightenment you totally uproot the
  most important defilement, sakaya-ditthi, the false view of a person a being an I or a
  you, and also doubt about the triple gems. These two mental defilements are uprooted,
  including their potentiality. Then you feel happy, you live in peace and happiness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are some who have gone through about four or five
  stages. There may be someone who has gone through about eight or seven. There may be some
  who have gone through ten or eleven. I would like all of you to complete all thirteen
  stages of insight knowledge. Ten days meditation is just training, just the learning
  stage. But you have some deep concentration occasionally and also some insight which
  penetrates into reality of the body- mind processes. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font COLOR="#800080">* Benefits of mindfulness
  meditation</font></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So now I would like to explain to you the benefits of this
  mindfulness meditation, because we haven't time enough. I think I should explain to you
  the seven benefits of this mindfulness, vipassana meditation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>1. Purification</b><br>
  Saddana vissudi means this mindfulness meditation must be practised for purification of
  beings. This is the first benefit. If you are mindful of any mental or physical process,
  if your concentration is good enough, at the moment of deep concentration on this mental
  or physical process your mind is purified. It's free from all kinds of mental defilements,
  all kinds of hindrances. To purify one's mind one has to practise mindfulness meditation.
  Translated literally, the meaning is that to purify your mind and body you must practise
  mindfulness meditation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>2. Overcoming sorrow</b><br>
  Then the second benefit is overcoming worry, sorrow and lamentation. The second benefit is
  sorrow and worry. You overcome sorrow and worry even though you failed in your business.
  You don't worry about it; you don't feel sorry. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>3. Overcoming lamentation</b><br>
  The third benefit is overcoming lamentation. When you have completely realised the mental
  and physical processes and their true nature by means of mindfulness meditation, even
  though your relative dies, or even though your sons or parents die you won't cry over it.
  You have exterminated this lamentation for the dead. When you practise this mindfulness
  meditation to attain higher stages of insight knowledge, at least eleven stages should be
  attained through this mindfulness meditation, then you don't feel sorry or worry and you
  don't have lamentation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Burma some of the female meditators practise this
  meditation in the first retreat say about ten or fifteen days, then the second two months
  or two and a half months then later on she may continue every day at home. Then when her
  husband dies she won't feel sorry. She won't lament. Is it good or bad? Good. Why doesn't
  she feel sorrow and find that she laments? Attachment. Attachment is destroyed to a
  certain extent. She can have less attachment to her husband by means of mindfulness
  meditation because she has realised the specific and general characteristics of body-mind
  processes to a large extent. So her attachment to her husband becomes less and less,
  because the less attachment doesn't make her weep or cry or lament. That's why I would
  like you to do it at least two or three months intensively and strenuously. In Burma many
  meditators take two or three months. Some meditators practise six months continuously. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>4. Overcoming grief</b><br>
  Then, the fourth benefit is the overcoming of grief. In the full retreat you can do away
  with grief, when your mindfulness meditation is fully practised. Here grief means mental
  suffering. Mental suffering is exterminated, done away with, by this mindfulness
  meditation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>5. Overcoming physical suffering</b><br>
  And also pain here means physical suffering. All kinds of physical suffering are destroyed
  through mindfulness meditation. In Burma there are some who cured illness by means of
  mindfulness meditation. The fifth benefit is overcoming physical suffering, dukkha. Mental
  suffering is known as domanassa in Pali. Physical suffering is known as dukkha. Domanassa
  is mental suffering, mental dukkha. Physical suffering is dukkha itself. These two aspects
  of suffering are removed by means of mindfulness meditation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>6. Enlightenment</b><br>
  Then the sixth benefit is attainment of path knowledge. That's one of enlightenment. In
  Buddhism there are four stages of enlightenment a meditator has to attain through his
  mindfulness meditation, after he has completed all thirteen stages of insight knowledge.
  The first stage is known as sotapanna-magga . The second stage is known as
  sakadagami-magga. Third stage is known anagami-magga. The fourth stage is known as
  arahatta-magga. All these four stages of enlightenment can be attained when you have
  thoroughly realised anicca, dukkha and anatta of bodily and mental processes. When
  impermanence, suffering, the impersonal nature of body-mind processes are thoroughly
  realised then you can attain all these four stages of enlightenment. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's easy to explain about this attainment of four stages
  of enlightenment but practically it's very difficult. But difficulties must be overcome by
  perseverance. Patience and perseverance are needed to overcome difficulties in any work.
  Then the attainment of these four stages of enlightenment, path knowledge is the sixth
  benefit. Path knowledge here means the four stages of enlightenment. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>7. Nibbana</b><br>
  Then finally you attain to Nibbana by mindfulness meditation. What do you mean by Nibbana?
  Where do you see Nibbana, on earth or underground or in heaven or in the sky? Nowhere. Ah,
  but the Buddha said Nibbana is in you. The place where you attain to Nibbana is yours,
  your body and mind. Unless you have realised your body-mind processes you cannot attain
  Nibbana. Only when you have fully realised your body-mind processes and two levels of
  understanding, then you are sure to attain Nibbana. So Nibbana is with you, not very far,
  very close. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nibbana means the cessation of all kinds of suffering.
  When mental suffering as well as physical suffering ceases to exist that state is known as
  Nibbana. Where do you have mental and physical suffering? Mind and body. These two kinds
  of suffering exist in the mind and body. Where do these two aspects of suffering stop or
  cease? Our mind and body. Because they arise in my mind and body, so they must stop at my
  mind and body. The cessation of all kinds of suffering, mental and physical suffering,
  ceases to exist when you have eradicated all mental and physical defilements by means of
  mindfulness meditation. So the attainment of the cessation of suffering is the seventh
  benefit of mindfulness meditation. You should remember these benefits theoretically and
  you should experience them practically. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font COLOR="#800080">* The five mental faculties</font></b>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So to gain these seven benefits what you need first is
  faith or belief in the triple gems, especially in the technique of your meditation: faith
  or belief or confidence through understanding. Blind faith is not needed here. Faith
  through understanding is called saddha. That saddha is the first mental faculty. Here
  mental faculties we call indriya in Pali. There are five indriyas, five mental faculties a
  yogi must be endowed with. The first is faith, blind faith or faith with understanding.
  You have to understand the Buddha Dhamma or the technique to a certain extent so that you
  can have faith in it. Without understanding it you can't have any faith or confidence or
  belief in it Faith with understanding is the basic requirement of a meditator for success
  in his meditation. The second need is energy. If you do not put enough energy into your
  practise you can't realise any mental or physical phenomena. It's called viriya in Pali. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third need is sati. It's translated as mindfulness,
  awareness, the third faculty a yogi must be endowed with. It means when you have faith
  with understanding of the technique or the Dhamma, you put enough energy or viriya in your
  practise, then you are able to be mindful of any mental or physical process as it really
  is. Then when mindfulness becomes continuous and constant your mind becomes concentrated
  on the object of meditation very well. So the fourth one is concentration, samadhi,
  concentration of mind. When the mind is deeply concentrated on any mental or physical
  phenomenon there arises insight knowledge or penetrating knowledge or experiential
  knowledge which penetrates into the intrinsic nature of mental and physical phenomena,
  specific individual characteristics of the body-mind processes. This is the intrinsic or
  true nature of mental and physical phenomena. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So when you realise any specific characteristic of mental
  or physical phenomena you have insight. Or when you realise the passing away of any mental
  or physical processes, or their coming and going, then you come to realise the general
  characteristic of anicca, impermanence, the general characteristic of mental and physical
  phenomena. That realisation, right understanding or insight or experiential knowledge is
  known as pannya in Pali. Pannya is sometimes translated as wisdom. Here insight or
  enlightenment is the fifth faculty with which a yogi must be endowed. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You should have five mental faculties: faith, energy,
  mindfulness, concentration, and insight and enlightenment. Faith means saddha. Energy
  means viriya. Mindfulness means sati. Concentration means samadhi. Insight, enlightenment,
  pannya. So, saddha, viriya, sati, samadhi, pannya, these are the five mental faculties a
  yogi must be endowed with. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font COLOR="#800080">* Balance</font></b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And here these five mental faculties must be strong
  enough, powerful and sharp. The Vissudimagga, a meditation text, mentions when these five
  mental faculties become sharp you are sure to realise either the specific or general
  characteristics of body- mind processes. So you should try to make them sharp and keep
  balance. Here also the text said of the five mental faculties, saddha and pannya, faith
  and understanding or insight must be kept balanced. So viriya and samadhi, concentration
  and energy or effort must be kept in balance. When saddha is strong and viriya is weak,
  when faith is strong and energy or effort is weak, then the yogi may become credulous. The
  yogi tends to have gullibility. He is easily deceived. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And saddha, faith or confidence must be balanced with
  wisdom or pannya, insight knowledge. When you have some insight knowledge into the
  physical and mental processes then you know the only way which can lead you to the
  cessation of suffering or to the realisation of body-mind processes is mindfulness
  meditation. You can judge through your experience, then nobody can deceive you about the
  method or technique of the meditation. So you don't believe in any other technique or any
  other way because by way of mindfulness you have experienced some realisation or
  understanding of mental and physical phenomena. You yourself know it's the right way so
  you don't believe in any other way, you don't become credulous. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But if wisdom is strong and faith is weak, then he can be
  a fool in his meditation because his concentration is weak. His concentration is weak
  because he has a lot of preconceived ideas through theoretical knowledge of Buddhism and
  other philosophies. So whenever he has experienced, or before he has any experience, he
  analyses the technique or the experience. He thinks about it. He uses preconceived ideas
  to analyse this technique or the experience. Then he has a lot of thoughts which distract
  him. How can he concentrate his mind on the object? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That's why we ask our yogis to keep aside all thought, all
  analytical knowledge, preconceived ideas, philosophical thinking, logical reasoning while
  they are engaged in meditation, so that there won't be hindrances to their progress. If he
  has a great deal of knowledge about Dhamma or any other philosophy, he attempts to analyse
  or reason, he attempts to criticise the Dhamma or the experience or the technique. Then
  it's a hindrance. So wisdom or knowledge must be balanced with saddha. Because I have
  faith, confidence in this technique I come here and practise. So these must be kept aside
  as long as I'm engaged in this mindfulness meditation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then concentration and energy must be in balance. When
  concentration is strong and energy, effort is weak you have the close friend of a yogi,
  sloth and torpor. So when you can concentrate very well on the abdominal movement and
  concentration becomes deeper and deeper, the noting mind notes the object of its own
  accord without any effort. Then the effort or energy becomes gradually less and less,
  decreasing. Concentration becomes weaker and weaker and gets into sloth and torpor. So
  when concentration's strong and effort is weak you are sure to get into sloth and torpor.
  To correct it you must make some more effort in your noting. Be careful, note
  energetically and precisely. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then when viriya, energy is strong and concentration is
  weak you can't concentrate too well, because when you are greedy to experience more and
  more Dhamma you put too much effort into your noting. You note very energetically when the
  mind is not concentrated you are not satisfied with your practise. Then you get restless
  and have distraction distraction distraction, and depression. No concentration at all. So
  energy or effort must be kept by concentration, and balance. Your effort must be reduced.
  You must reduce your effort, then again you note feeling calmness and tranquillity. Be
  calm and tranquil and note steadily. Do not be greedy, do not hesitate. Then your mind
  will concentrate gradually. So these two twins mental faculties must be in balance. Then
  you are sure to attain the four stages of enlightenment. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i><b>Please try to make steady effort, enough effort, and
  have a great deal of faith and confidence in your practise.</b></i> </font></p>
