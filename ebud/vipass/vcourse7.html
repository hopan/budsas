</font>

<hr width="30%">

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I will review my talk on the two levels of understanding
  so that you can remember it. The first level is understanding the specific characteristics
  of mental and physical phenomena. The second is understanding the general or common
  characteristics of mental and physical phenomena. Each mental process or physical process
  has its specific characteristics. Those characteristics are not concerned or connected
  with other mental processes. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The three main roots of evil, called mula priyaya in Pali,
  are anger, greed, and delusion or ignorance (I prefer ignorance): lobha, dosa, moha in
  Pali. You should have these terms because they are not very difficult to remember. Lobha
  is greed, desire, craving, attachment. All the senses of these words are covered by lobha.
  So when you say lobha, it means desire; when you say lobha it means greed; when you say
  lobha it means craving; when you say lobha it means lust; when you say lobha it means
  attachment. To cover the senses of all these words we use the word attachment. So, lobha
  or attachment or desire, greed is one of the main roots of evil, evil things, evil deeds,
  evil speech, evil mind. When the mind becomes evil it's due to one of these three roots.
  Either lobha or dosa or moha. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dosa means anger, hatred, ill will, aversion. Dosa is
  anger, hatred, ill-will, aversion. Moha is ignorance. Occasionally it is translated
  delusion. I do not like this word delusion. I preferred 'ignorance,' because when you say
  illusion sometimes you get confused with wrong view: sakaya-ditthi, atta-ditthi. Say when
  you stretch out your legs towards the Buddha statue, does it mean respect or disrespect to
  the Buddha? When you stretch out your arms towards the Buddha statue then do you mean it
  as respect or disrespect to the Buddha? Respect, when you stretch out your arms. When you
  stretch out your legs towards the Buddha statue what do you mean? Disrespect. Yes. But
  sometimes you did it out of mere ignorance because you did not know it was disrespectful.
  You happened to stretch out your legs towards the Buddha. That behaviour is regarded as
  something with no volition or motive. Without disrespect you happened to do it. So if you
  feel disrespect towards the Buddha when you stretch out this leg then you must withdraw
  it. But if you do not withdraw it and keep stretching out then it's disrespect. It's done
  out of ignorance. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There's a Burmese story but it may be everywhere in the
  world. There were two carpenters working together. One was the father, the other his son.
  The son was very foolish. The father was chopping a log when a deadly fly, one that is
  very harmful, that bites and sucks the blood of human beings, came to the father's
  forehead. The father was occupied over this work. He couldn't do anything with the fly.
  Then the son saw it. Out of compassion for his father he took an axe and he killed the
  deadly fly. The dead fly has gone. And father is very happy. He lie down and sleep for
  good. Now that killing was done out of ignorance, moha. This evil thing was done out of
  moha, ignorance. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So to eradicate this ignorance is the most important
  thing, in your daily life as well as your meditative life too. What should you do?
  Ignorance must be replaced by right understanding. Moha must be replaced by wisdom, or
  insight knowledge or enlightenment. To attain this what should you do? Yes, be mindful of
  your body-mind processes as they really are. You can learn scriptures so that you have a
  theoretical knowledge of the teaching of the Buddha, but theoretical knowledge has nothing
  to do with insight knowledge or enlightenment. While you are being mindful of any mental
  or physical process, if any theoretical knowledge comes to your mind and you use it for
  analysing any experience or technique then that theoretical knowledge is a hindrance to
  your concentration. It can't eradicate the ignorance. Ignorance must be replaced by right
  understanding through personal experience of Dhamma, body-mind processes. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Any evil deed or evil speech, evil mind, arises dependent
  on any of these three roots of evil, on lohba or on dosa or on moha. So these three roots
  of evil are completely destroyed. There won't arise any evil deed, evil speech or evil
  mind, and you have a wholesome speech and mind which result in happiness and peace. For
  example lobha: greed, desire, craving, lust, attachment. Lobha has as its characteristic
  the nature of clinging to the object. So clinging or being attached is the specific
  characteristic of lobha. The specific characteristic of dosa is rudeness. Dosa is
  translated 'aversion.' It cannot have any characteristic of clinging because aversion is
  the opposite of clinging. Every mental state or emotional state, mental process, has its
  own specific characteristics. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So in the course of your meditational practise when the
  mind becomes deeper and deeper and more and more concentrated you come to realise mental
  or physical processes which are observed in their true nature. In the beginning of this
  realisation of mental and bodily processes you rightly understand their specific
  characteristics which are observed. So when you note attachment: attachment attachment
  attachment attachment, the attachment doesn't go away. It passes there in you mind and you
  continue to note attachment attachment attachment attachment attachment. The more mindful
  of attachment the more concentrated your mind is on it. When the mind is well concentrated
  on the attachment you come to realise attachment has the clinging nature to the object.
  You come to realise this. That is insight knowledge you have attained through your
  experience of mental processes. That is the first level of understanding of the specific
  characteristic of lobha, attachment. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then when you observe the rising and falling movements of
  the abdomen very attentively and energetically, when concentration becomes deeper you come
  to realise the rising and falling movements without being conscious of the form of the
  body or the form of the abdomen. The form of the abdomen has disappeared in your mind; you
  are not aware of it. What you are realising is just the rising movement and falling
  movement and the mind that notes it. When your realisation becomes more and more clear and
  sharp what you are realising is just motion, movement, outward movement and inward
  movement. These are two processes of movements rising and passing away alternately. And
  also you know the mind that notes it is also rising and passing away. When you are
  realising the motion without being aware of yourself and your bodily form and the abdomen
  it means you are rightly understanding the specific characteristic of the wind element
  vayo-dhatu. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Why can you say this understanding of the process of dual
  movement is right? It may be wrong, because we have an abdomen and that abdomen rises and
  then falls back. If we are not conscious of the form of the abdomen and the form of the
  body and note just movements then it may be wrong. We can say definitely it's right
  because this right understanding has destroyed the false idea of a self, a soul, a person,
  a being. When you rightly understand just the outward movement and inward movement only
  you do not identify any movement of rising and falling with yourself, with your person,
  with your being. Then that idea or concept of a person a being an I or a you has been
  destroyed. When you don't have any idea of an I or you, a person or being, there won't
  arise any mental defilements such as lust greed hatred ignorance and so on. When mental
  defilements are destroyed there won't arise any suffering at all. Then you have attained
  the state of the cessation of all kinds of suffering. This cessation of suffering is
  attained through right understanding of the specific characteristic of the wind element
  which is constantly observed. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It leads you to the cessation of suffering because you
  follow any teaching of any religion to destroy dukkha, suffering and live happily and
  peacefully. That's your aim of following any doctrine, is it not so? That aim can be
  fulfilled by right understanding of mental and physical processes, especially here,
  rightly understanding the specific characteristic of the wind element Wyandotte. Is the
  doctrine which instructs you to be mindful of any mental or physical process so you can
  rightly understand it in its true nature right or wrong? Right, why? It leads you to the
  cessation of suffering which is undesirable for you. So out of two levels of right
  understanding, as soon as your concentration is good enough, deep enough, you come to
  realise the first understanding, the specific characteristic of mental and physical
  phenomena. Then when you proceed with your practise mindfulness becomes clear and sharp
  and concentration becomes deeper. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When concentration becomes deeper you come to realise the
  second aspect of mental and physical processes. That's the second level of understanding,
  that is, impermanence, suffering, and the impersonal nature of the process or no soul, no
  person. In Pali these are called anicca, dukkha, anatta. Anicca, impermanence; dukkha,
  suffering; anatta, impersonal nature or no soul no self. These three characteristics are
  concerned with all mental and physical processes. They are called common characteristics
  of mental and physical processes because they are in common with all mental and physical
  processes. So when you have lobha, attachment to have tea at this time, then does that
  lobha, attachment last very long? No. Then how long does it last? Yes. It lasts until you
  note it. When you note it you no longer have attachment to having tea. Then could we say
  attachment lasts very long or attachment is permanent? Because it rises and then passes
  away, it's impermanent. In other words lobha has the characteristic of impermanence, and
  the same with dosa and moha and the other mental and emotional states. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some meditators are very sensitive to the arising of
  anger. So if you feel anger then is that anger everlasting or transient? Transient. Yes.
  When you note it very attentively it goes away, it disappears. It arises and then
  vanishes, so it's impermanent. There, dosa has also the characteristic of impermanence. In
  the same way, the rising and fall of the abdomen has the characteristic of impermanence.
  The bending movement and stretching movement of the arms has the characteristic of
  impermanence. Lifting, pushing, putting movements of the foot have the characteristic of
  impermanence. So it's the nature of impermanency to be in common with every mental and
  physical phenomenon. So they are called common or general characteristics. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Not only impermanence but also suffering, dukkha. Also the
  impersonal nature of mental and physical processes, anatta, no self-nature. So these three
  are called the common or general characteristics of body-mind processes. But at the third
  stage of insight knowledge you can more clearly realise these three characteristics of
  mental and physical processes. In the first stage of insight knowledge you realise the
  specific characteristics of mental and physical processes. Then it goes on the second
  stage and the third stage too. So when you proceed with your practise strenuously and
  intensively, concentration becomes deeper and deeper. Then you come to realise the
  movement of the foot and, say, the second level of right understanding. That's the general
  characteristic of the wind element vaya-dhatu. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you note lifting what you are aware of is the lifting
  movement of the foot. When you note pushing what you are aware of is the pushing movement
  of the foot. When you note dropping what you are aware of is the dropping movement. When
  you note touching what you are aware of is the touching sensation. When you note pressing
  you note pressure. There, when you are aware of the lifting movement with deep
  concentration you do not realise it as permanent, a single process of movement. You
  realise it as a series of broken movements rising and passing away, from the very
  beginning of the lifting of the foot. There are many many movements which are rising and
  passing away. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then sometimes meditators report their experience like
  this. 'When I note the lifting movement - lifting lifting lifting - there are many many
  movements I experience, from the very beginning of lifting many tiny movements.' Then
  sometimes they said, 'When I note lifting I find it as a folded Chinese fan.' This is
  folded, then it's stretched out it. The yogi knows it. He realises there are a series of
  many tiny movements arising and passing away one after another and he thinks, 'Oh this is
  like a Chinese fan.' That means he realises the impermanence of each movement. One
  movement arises and then passes away, then another movement arises and passes away. In
  this way he sees a series of many gentle and soft tiny movements arising and passing away
  one after another. Then he realises impermanence. When he experiences the state of
  impermanence he is sure to realise the other mental and physical processes too as
  impermanent. So when he bends the arm he aware of bending bending bending, slowly slowly.
  Then because his concentration is good enough, deep enough, he comes to realise this
  bending movement is a series of many bending movements arising and passing away one after
  another. That is the realisation of the impermanence of mental and physical processes.
  Also he realises the mind that notes it is impermanent. This realisation is the second
  level of right understanding upon the general characteristic of the wind or air element,
  vayo-dhatu. When you are realising this impermanence of phenomena you come to realise they
  are rising and passing away, never lasting even a minute or second, ever changing, always
  appearing and disappearing. So they are not good or bad. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then he comes to dukkha, suffering, because when he sees
  any mental or physical process ever changing, constantly rising and passing away every
  instant, the so-called mind is oppressed by that constant appearance and disappearance of
  phenomena. That is dukkha. Then when he discovers nothing is permanent, everything is
  transient and ever changing, appearing and disappearing, then does he take this mental
  process of ever changing as a person or a being, an I or a you? No. The idea of a person,
  a being arises dependent on the idea of a permanent body-mind process. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you take this body of mine as permanent then you take
  it as a person, a being, an I or a you. When you realise this body-mind process is ever
  changing and transient and impermanent, it doesn't last even a millionth of a second, you
  don't take it to be a person, a being, an I or a you. Then you don't have the idea of
  atta. When you don't have the idea of atta it's called anatta. Anatta means non-self, non
  person, no person, or the impersonal nature of mental and physical processes. So in this
  way you come to realise the general or common characteristics of physical processes and at
  the same time the mind notes it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When your right understanding or insight knowledge of
  mental and physical processes as impermanent becomes clearer, you come to realise the mind
  that notes it is also impermanent. Then you don't take any of the dual processes of
  mentality and physicality to be a person a being an I or a you. What you are realising at
  that moment is the incessant and continuous and constant changing of mental and physical
  processes which are arising and passing away one after another. When you take a set of
  phenomena which are forever changing you don't take them to be a person or a being. That
  false idea of a person a being, a self or a soul has been destroyed by right understanding
  of mental and physical processes. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So when you have rightly understood these body-mind
  processes in their true nature in these two aspects ignorance has been replaced by right
  understanding, insight knowledge we call it: vipassana nana. Vipassa nana. In other words,
  right understanding, vipassana nana, insight knowledge or experiential knowledge, has
  destroyed ignorance. Yesterday I told you ignorance has the characteristic of covering the
  truth. When ignorance has been destroyed, you uncover the truth. You can realise this
  truth: impermanence, suffering, no soul, no self nature of mental and physical phenomena.
  But because they are ever changing and constantly appearing and disappearing you come to
  realise it's dukkha. Then, do you want that to occur? If that occurs it's not wanted, not
  desired. Then you have to be mindful of whatever arises in your body and mind so that you
  can rightly understand mental and physical processes in their two aspects, their specific
  and general or common aspects: specific aspects of materiality and mentality, and general
  characteristics of materiality and mentality. Specific characteristics are where any
  mental or emotional state has its own characteristics, which are nothing to do with the
  other mentalities and physicalities. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are only three common and general characteristics.
  Anicca, dukkha, anatta. Anicca means impermanence, transience, transitoriness, and flux.
  Dukkha, suffering, dissatisfaction, discomfort, and so on. Then anatta, no-self, no soul,
  no person, non-ego. These are the three characteristics of the whole of existence. If you
  rightly understand, if you can penetrate into these three aspects of body-mind processes,
  mental and physical phenomena, you are sure to be able to destroy attachment to any living
  being or non-living thing. When attachment, the cause of suffering has been destroyed
  there won't arise any suffering, dukkha at all. Without suffering, dukkha, you live in
  peace and happiness, when the cessation of suffering you have attained. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I think now you have rightly understood the aim of your
  mindfulness about all daily activities. So do not be reluctant, do not feel lazy. Be aware
  of all daily activities in more detail so you can have continuous mindfulness and deep
  concentration and a penetrating insight which realises the specific and general
  characteristics of mental and physical phenomena. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">May all of you practise your meditation very intensively
  and continuously without any laziness, reluctance and tiredness and anger. </font></p>
