    <p><i>The following pages were originally intended as new
    sections to be added to the second edition of my introductory
    book on the Dhamma, &quot;What is Buddhism?&quot;. However,
    as many people are greatly interested in the practice of
    meditation, and as many are also separated from the sources
    of a living tradition, it is hoped that the following may be
    of value even apart from the sections of the book which they
    supplement. </i></p>
    <p><i>When we consider meditation, we cannot stress too much
    the importance of having the right reasons for taking it up.
    Meditation -- or, as a better translation of samadhi,
    collectedness -- is only one aspect of Buddhist practice, and
    must, to be successful, go hand in hand with such other
    practices as generosity, gentleness, nonviolence, patience,
    contentment and humility. If such genuine qualities of the
    Dhamma neither exist in oneself initially, nor grow through
    one's practice, then something is drastically wrong, and only
    a foolhardy person will try to proceed. The practice of
    collectedness is based upon firm roots of virtue (sila) and
    cannot succeed in anyone who does not make a real effort to
    be strict in keeping the precepts. </i></p>
    <p><i>The signs of &quot;progress&quot; in collectedness are
    not strange visions, peculiar feelings and the like (though
    it is conceivable that these may arise also where progress is
    achieved), but rather an all-round and harmonious growth in
    the way of Dhamma. If one is without a teacher then one has
    to be doubly vigilant, otherwise one will never become aware
    whether one of Mara's distractions is likely to succeed, or
    whether one does in fact tread the Middle Practice-Path. </i></p>
    <p><i>This essay is an extract from &quot;Buddhism
    Explained&quot;, the second edition (revised and enlarged) of
    the book formerly known as &quot;What is Buddhism?&quot;,
    published by The Social Science Press of Thailand, Phya Thai
    Road, Chula Soi 2, Bangkok. </i></p>

    <h3 align="center"><font color="#008000">TWO STREAMS IN
    MEDITATION</font></h3>
    <p>Two apparently distinct streams of Buddhist meditation may
    be discerned, though when meditation is established, these
    are seen to be complementary. </p>
    <p>It may be profitable for some people whose minds are very
    active and who suffer from distraction, to follow with
    mindfulness the mad monkey-mind's acrobatics. As the mind is
    really a series of mental events which arise and pass away
    with incredible rapidity, each of which is a mind complete
    with supporting mental factors, so at the beginning this kind
    of mindfulness is really one &quot;mindful&quot; mind
    watching other &quot;minds&quot; (which are all within one's
    own mental continuity of course). One thereby develops the
    ability to look into the mind and to see where it has gone
    to. Has it gone to the past, present or future? Has it gone
    to materiality, or to feelings, or perhaps to cognitions, to
    volitional activities, or has it gone to consciousness? By
    this method of &quot;Where has it gone?&quot;, the distracted
    mind slowly comes under the surveillance of the mindful mind,
    until mindfulness forms a strong foundation for further
    development. Considerable, though mundane, brilliance of mind
    is both needed and developed by this practice, which however
    should be balanced by the tranquility of the absorptions.
    When the mind has become calm, one should start to practice
    for the absorptions (<b>jhana</b>), which will in their turn
    be the basis for the arising of real insight. This method is
    called &quot;<b>wisdom-leading-to-calm</b>&quot;.</p>
    <p>Other methods suited to those whose minds are less
    disturbed initially, include the classic forty subjects of
    meditation (see Appendix); and these, together with more
    developed types of meditation practice, involve the use of a
    definite object for concentration. This may be one's own body
    or a part of it, a colour or a picture, a word or a phrase,
    or abstract contemplation and so forth. All these methods
    involve some firm but gentle discipline of the mind, in that
    each time it strays away, it must be gently brought back
    again (by mindfulness, of course) to concentrate again on the
    chosen subject. </p>
    <p>Some people have the quite mistaken idea that practice of
    this sort must necessarily lead to tranquility almost at
    once. They may be surprised when beginning to practice
    themselves, since they actually experience more troubles than
    they had previously. This is firstly, because they never
    before really looked into their mind to know the state it has
    always been in; and secondly, because having taken up a
    discipline of the mind, it is as though one stirs up with a
    stick a stagnant pond, or pokes with a stick a fire
    smoldering under ashes. The wild elephant of the mind, long
    accustomed to roam in the jungle of desires, does not take
    readily to taming, or to being tied to the post of practice
    with the thongs of mindfulness. However, diligence and
    heedfulness will eventually win for one the fruits of
    tranquility. </p>
    <p>All these forty subjects are of this second type in which
    the calm gained from practice is then used for the arousing
    of wisdom. They are for this reason called &quot;<b>calm-leading-to-wisdom</b>&quot;
    methods, and are very important in the present distracted
    age. For their full explanation one should consult the <b>&quot;Path
    of Purification&quot;</b> (Visuddhi-magga, translation),
    although even the great learning in that book cannot replace
    the personal contact with a teacher. </p>

    <h3 align="center"><font color="#008000">PRACTICAL ADVICE FOR
    MEDITATORS</font></h3>
    <p>Turning from the psychological to the practical aspect,
    meditation for laypeople may be divided into two categories:
    that which is done intensively, and that which one practices
    while going about one's daily life. The meditation practiced
    intensively is also of two sorts: regular daily sitting, and
    occasional retreat practice. </p>
    <p><a name="31"></a> </p>
    <h4><font color="#800080">Regular Daily Sitting</font></h4>
    <p>As to material considerations, the place for meditation
    should be fairly quiet. If one has a small room which can be
    used for this purpose, so much the better, and in any case,
    it is better to meditate alone, unless other members of the
    household also practice. Where this latter is the case one
    should make sure that one's mind is pure also in relation to
    others, for otherwise greed, hatred, and the rest of the
    robber gang are sure to steal away the fruits of meditation. </p>
    <p>Quietness is best obtained by getting up early before
    others rise; and this is also the time when the mind is clear
    and the body untired. The sincere meditator therefore keeps
    regular hours, for he knows how much depends on having just
    enough sleep to feel refreshed. </p>
    <p>After rising and washing one should sit down in clean
    loose clothing in the meditation place. One may have a small
    shrine with Buddhist symbols, but this is not essential. Some
    people find it useful to begin by making the offerings of
    flowers, incense, and light, carefully reflecting while doing
    so. It is very common in Buddhist countries to preface one's
    silent meditation by chanting softly to oneself, &quot;Namo
    tassa bhagavato arahato samma-sambuddhassa,&quot; with the
    Refuges and Precepts. If one knows the Pali passages in
    praise of the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha, these may also be
    used at this time. [*] </p>
    <p>* [See &quot;The Mirror of the Dhamma&quot;, WHEEL No. 54
    a/b.] </p>
    <p>Another useful preliminary is a reflection, a discursive
    recitation, of some truths of the Dhamma, such as the passage
    suggested below: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;Having this precious opportunity of human birth,
        I have two responsibilities in the Dhamma: the benefit of
        myself and the benefit of others. All other beings,
        whether they be human or non-human, visible or invisible,
        great or small, far or near, all these beings I shall
        treat with gentleness and wish that they may dwell in
        peace. May they be happy . . . May they be happy . . .
        May they be happy . . . ! I shall help them when they
        experience suffering, and be glad with them when they are
        happy. May I develop as well the incomparable equanimity,
        the mind in perfect balance that can never be upset! </p>
        <p>&quot;In looking to the welfare of others, I shall not
        forget my own progress on the path of Dhamma. May I
        indeed come to know how, driven here and there by the
        winds of kamma, I have suffered an infinity of lives in
        all the realms of existence! I must also turn my mind to
        consider how short and fleeting is this life. How mind
        and body are ever changing, arising and declining from
        moment to moment. How neither mind nor body belongs to
        me, neither of them is mine. I must also turn this mind
        to consider how beset by troubles is this brief life.
        Having been sired by craving and born out of ignorance, I
        must realize that death is inescapable, that old age and
        disease are natural to my condition. I must make efforts
        to realize for my own good and the good of others that
        this person called 'myself' is a complex of mentality and
        materiality wherein no abiding entity such as a soul or
        self is found. </p>
        <p>&quot;May I through this practice experience insight
        into impermanence, ill and no-self! May I be one who
        dwells in the Void! And having realized this sublime
        truth may I show the way to others!&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>When sitting, care should be taken that the body is kept
    erect, yet relaxed. There should be no strain, but neither
    should the head droop, nor the lumbar region sag. The body
    should feel poised and balanced upright. Although the
    cross-legged positions (such as the lotus posture) are best
    when the meditator is seated on a fairly soft mat, a chair
    may be used by those unaccustomed to the lotus posture or
    else unable to train themselves to sit in that way. Sitting
    in lotus posture or half-lotus posture will be found much
    easier if a rather hard cushion is placed so as to raise the
    buttocks. The knees will then tend to touch the ground and a
    firm three pointed sitting (two knees and buttocks) is then
    attained. </p>
    <p>One should sit for the same length of time every day
    until, as one becomes more proficient in collecting the mind,
    automatically one will feel like extending the practice. One
    widely used method for measuring the meditation period is
    sitting for the length of time taken for a stick of incense
    to burn down. Having placed the hands in meditation posture
    relaxed in the lap, the eyes may be closed or left slightly
    open according to which is found most comfortable. </p>
    <p>Methods used for helping to concentrate the mind are many,
    and the two main streams in classical meditation have been
    briefly reviewed in the section above. Other helpful methods
    include the repetition of a word or phrase and perhaps with
    it the use of a rosary. If one practices mindfulness of
    breathing, one may find the use of a word such as &quot;<b>Buddho</b>,&quot;
    or &quot;<b>Araham</b>&quot; good for quietening the mind.
    The first syllable is silently repeated when breathing in,
    and one concentrates on the second during the out-breathing.
    Also the counting of breath (up to ten, but generally not
    over this number to prevent the mind wandering) is used as an
    aid for concentration. But any such aids should be dropped
    when concentration improves. When the meditation is on a
    phrase only, a rosary may be used in conjunction, each
    repetition being marked by one bead. </p>
    <p>One's meditation goes well if one finds the mind
    increasingly absorbed on the chosen meditation subject, but
    one should not assume that meditation is useless just because
    for a period, longer or shorter, not much more than
    sleepiness or distraction is experienced. These hindrances
    have to be faced; and if they are met, not by irritation or
    despair, but by quietly observant mindfulness, they can and
    will be overcome. For success, great persistence and evenness
    of effort are necessary. </p>
    <p>The meditation period may close with some chanting, the
    usual subject being the well being of others and the
    distribution of merits to them. A translation, or the
    original Pali, of the <b>Metta Sutta</b> (Discourse on
    Lovingkindness [*]) may be chanted at this time and, as it is
    not long, can be easily memorized. As methods of chanting
    vary, it is very helpful if one can obtain recordings,
    perhaps on tape, of the passages one wishes to learn,
    recorded by bhikkhus. </p>
    <p>* [See &quot;The Practice of Lovingkindness (Metta)&quot;,
    trans. Nanamoli, WHEEL No. 7.] </p>
    <p>While on the subject of chanting, it is very useful to
    know a few discourses of Lord Buddha in one of the Buddhist
    classical languages, and to use these for collecting the mind
    if there should be an occasion when no concentration at all
    can be obtained. At such a time a meditator should not feel
    depressed but should continue sitting and chant softly to
    himself. This is what Buddhist monks do twice a day as part
    of their mental development, and it is useful as well for
    fostering a more devotional approach necessary as balance
    with intellectual characters. Another useful method for the
    overcoming of distraction is <b>walking-practice</b>, which
    may be done in any passage of the house or in a secluded walk
    in the garden. A length of twenty or thirty paces will be
    sufficient, for if longer the mind tends to wander, and if
    shorter, distraction may be increased. One should walk at the
    speed one feels to be natural, with the hands clasped the
    left in the right, and arms relaxed in front of the body. At
    the ends of the walk one should turn in a clockwise
    direction. [*] </p>
    <p>* [The tradition of &quot;keeping the right side
    towards&quot; respected persons and objects has a
    psychological basis. Also note in English right (for side)
    and right (good, correct).] </p>
    <p>Perhaps a few words on devotion would not be out of place
    here, for this is very important in meditation practice. No
    one who is not a devoted Buddhist takes up Buddhist
    meditation, for the simple reason that he does not have the
    Buddhist ideals in his heart. The taking to heart of the <b>Triple
    Refuge</b> and the understanding of the <b>Triple Gem</b> are
    closely linked with Buddhist meditation. A really devoted
    Buddhist, who puts his whole life into the Dhamma, will have
    no insurmountable difficulties in meditation practice.
    Whatever obstacles he comes to, those he leaps over,
    sustained by devotion. He is prepared for the way to be long
    and hard because he realizes that he has made it like that.
    If he finds his way blocked, his meditation failing to
    progress and he himself without a teacher, he does not waver
    or falter on the way. He thinks, &quot;I am now experiencing
    the results of intentional actions (kamma) made by me in the
    past.&quot; And he remembers Lord Buddha's last words:
    &quot;Subject to breaking-up are all compounded things. With
    mindfulness strive on.&quot; All difficulties are compounded
    things and will eventually change; meanwhile much may be done
    with mindfulness, vigor and devotion. </p>
    <p>If one is not too tired after work and if there is
    opportunity in the evening, another period of sitting can be
    undertaken then. In any case, before sleep, it is a wise
    practice to sit, if only for a few minutes, so as to purify
    the mind before lying down. One may consider thus: &quot;When
    I lie down there is no certainty that I shall awake.&quot;
    One may, therefore, be lying down to die, and this is a good
    reflection to rouse skillful states of mind and banish
    sensual unskillful ones. If one practices this, &quot;the
    lying-down to die,&quot; it will be a very good preparation
    for the real event, which is bound to take place at some time
    in the unknown future. It may even generate the right
    conditions for the arising of insight allowing one &quot;to
    die,&quot; giving up the grasping at what does not belong to
    one, that is, the mind and body. At this time also, a Dhamma
    phrase or word may be used, repeating which one eventually
    falls to sleep. In this way one ends and begins the day with
    practice of Buddhist teachings. And apart from devotion of
    one's whole day to them, what could be better? </p>
    <p><a name="32"></a> </p>
    <h4><font color="#800080">Retreats</font></h4>
    <p>Regarding the second division of intensive practice, that
    is, when undertaken in retreat, much will depend upon what
    facilities are available to the earnest student. There are
    now a few places in the West where meditation instruction can
    be sought. The most important thing is to have direct contact
    with an able meditation master (books serve at the beginning,
    while even a teacher is later found deficient in some way).
    After satisfying this one condition, only one other is
    necessary: one must strive with diligence to practice and
    realize his teachings. If these two conditions are fulfilled,
    then one is the most fortunate among human beings. </p>
    <p>Many will be without access to a teacher and some may like
    to try a period of solitary meditation in some quiet part of
    the country. This should only be attempted if one has already
    developed a good power of mindfulness. Otherwise what was
    meant to foster meditation may become a very unprofitable
    time, perhaps accompanied by the seeming intensification of
    the mental defilements. </p>
    <p><a name="33"></a> </p>
    <h4><font color="#800080">Daily Life</font></h4>
    <p>As to the other sort of meditation practice, which is
    performed in daily life, though much may be written, the
    following few words may serve as a guide. First, one should
    not deceive oneself regarding concentration of the mind. It
    is of no use pretending to oneself or to others that one's
    daily life is meditation -- unless of course one has already
    great powers of concentration. Only the real adept, often one
    who has sat for many years keeping the monastic discipline,
    can really perceive ordinary life as meditation; and such a
    one would be most unlikely to tell others of this fact.
    Refusing to allow pride an opportunity to distort the real
    state of mental affairs, one should take stock with fairness
    and admit one's limitations. This is already a great step
    forward. The layman who thinks of himself as an Arahat
    already, has blocked off very effectively all real progress;
    while the honest man has at least the wisdom to be humble. </p>
    <p>Much may be accomplished with mindfulness, while without
    it there is no hope for meditation in daily life. How are
    quite ordinary events capable of being made into meditation?
    By mindfulness, which to begin with, may be defined as, <b>awareness
    of the present work in hand</b>. At first great effort has to
    be made in order to remain mindful of what one is supposed to
    be doing, nor can one pretend that such mindfulness is
    pleasant always. To escape from dull and unliked work and
    situations, we tend to turn either to fantasy worlds, hopes,
    or else to memories, which are respectively the delusive
    escapes into the present, future or past. But for one really
    interested in understanding himself, none of these courses is
    very rewarding, since they are compounded of delusion with
    various ingredients, such as fear, craving or ignorance.
    While in the practice of strict meditation, mindfulness may
    follow all the wanderings of the mind; in daily life it is
    better that the mind should be constantly returned to the job
    in hand. One should not &quot;send&quot; one's mind anywhere,
    neither to a dream-world nor to the past, nor to the future.
    Lord Buddha compared these periods of time thus: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><b><i>&quot;The past is like a dream,<br>
        The future as a mirage,<br>
        While the present is like clouds.&quot;</i></b></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Such a simile may be useful as the mind darts about
    between dreams, mirages and clouds, all insubstantial, though
    the ever-changing present, so like the clouds in the sky, is
    the only aspect of time compared to things of greater
    reality. One may also consider meditation as the exercise of
    mindfulness which keeps the mind &quot;inside&quot; this
    body, that is, always focused upon some aspect of it. Of
    course only the most sincere meditator, who sees the
    advantage in this to be greater than any pleasure offered by
    the world, is likely to practice in this way, since this cuts
    off not only interest in outer objects but also the toying
    with pleasant or intriguing ideas. </p>
    <p>Indeed, with work that is really interesting, the way of
    mindfulness is the only way to convert one's day into
    something worthwhile. Days pass and bring us nearer to death
    and an unknown rebirth, while it is now that one has the
    chance to practice Dhamma. Instead of reacting with aversion
    or deluded fantasies towards what one does not like (or in
    other situations indulging one's greed), the Way of
    Mindfulness constitutes the Middle Practice-Path transcending
    these ancient patterns of reaction. There is no need to be
    ruled either by greed or by hatred, nor to be dominated by
    delusion; but only mindfulness shows the way beyond these. </p>
    <p>Constantly bringing the mind back and disengaging it from
    tangles is the basic practice in everyday life. It is also
    wise to take advantage of those odd times during work when
    one waits for something to do, to meet someone, for a bus or
    train, or any time when one is alone for a few minutes.
    Instead of turning to a newspaper for distraction, to the
    wireless, or to another person for gossip, it is more
    profitable to &quot;retire inside&quot; oneself. Disengaging
    attention from exterior objects, take up mindfulness of
    breathing, or the repetition of some phrase of Dhamma, or
    significant word such as &quot;Buddho&quot; or
    &quot;Arahant,&quot; doing this until one has again to attend
    to work. Going inwards as often as possible will be found
    very useful, strengthening one's sitting practice just as the
    latter in turn strengthens the ability to turn within. </p>
    <p><b>Mindfulness of breathing</b> is especially good as a
    concentration method for use during travel and during the
    times when one is restlessly expecting a bus or a train. Why
    be agitated or impatient? A little mindful breathing is just
    the practice for these moments, since it calms the feverish
    workings of the mind and the restless movements of the body.
    One does not have to aimlessly stare out of windows while
    traveling! Why be a slave of the &quot;eye-dominant&quot;
    when a little useful practice could take its place? One does
    not have to listen to the idle chatter of others, so why be a
    slave to the &quot;ear-dominant&quot;? One cannot shut one's
    ears, but everyone can withdraw attention to some extent
    while practicing mindfulness. </p>
    <p>It is mindfulness also which helps to bring into focus
    counteractive contemplations. Lust, for instance, is soon
    dissipated by thoughts of a decaying corpse. The looks which
    are bestowed on pretty girls (or handsome man) seem
    ridiculous when it is thought that old ladies and equally
    ancient men never attract such desire-filled attention. Only
    when one sees how lust burns up the one who indulges in it,
    only then does it seem worth relinquishing. </p>
    <p>Similarly gluttony, even in a mild form, can be demolished
    by contemplating the bodily processes connected with food.
    Chewed food looks a good deal less palatable then when the
    same stuff before mixing with spittle was nicely laid out on
    plates. Vomit is just the same substances in the process of
    change but does not readily arouse greed. Excrement even if
    placed on the finest gold plate fails to become attractive --
    yet this is the remnants of the food so eagerly gorged! By
    the time that one has contemplated food in these three
    stages, greed has quite disappeared, and one may take food
    just as a medicine to preserve the body. </p>
    <p>Mindfulness is also responsible for becoming sufficiently
    aware in a moment of anger to turn the mind to other subjects
    or persons. It is mindfulness that warns one of an
    approaching situation where anger may arise, and makes it
    possible to turn aside and dwell in equanimity, or where the
    Divine Abidings are well developed, in friendliness. </p>
    <p>When envy rears its ugly head, mindfulness gives one
    presence of mind to know &quot;envy has arisen,&quot; and if
    efforts to arouse gladness with others' joy fail, it is
    mindfulness that helps one dwell in equanimity, or if all
    else fails, helps turn attention to other objects. </p>
    <p>Lord Buddha has truly said, &quot;<b>Mindfulness, I
    declare, is helpful everywhere.</b>&quot; </p>
    <p>The social implications of meditation should be obvious
    from the above. Those who have the strange delusion that
    Buddhism is a religion of meditative isolation, offering
    society no social benefits, should understand that a Buddhist
    believes society can only be changed for the better, and with
    some degree of permanence, by starting work on himself.
    Buddhist ideals of society are expressed in a number of
    important discourses addressed by Lord Buddha to lay people,
    and in them the developments of the individual is always
    stressed as a very necessary factor. The advantages of a
    society in which there are a large number of those dwelling
    at peace with themselves need hardly be stressed. The
    development of wisdom and compassion by one man has its
    effect in leavening the materialistic dough around him. The
    Buddhist call is therefore first to gain peace in one's own
    heart, when will follow, quite naturally, peace in the world.
    Trying to obtain peace the other way round will never be
    practical nor produce a lasting peace, for the roots of
    greed, hatred, and delusion have still a firm grip on the
    hearts of people. Impractical? Only for those who do not
    practice. Those who take up the cultivation of mindfulness
    find out for themselves how it helps to solve life's
    problems. </p>
    <p>Although many journeys to remote and attractive places are
    now performed with ease, the way leading to Nibbana still
    needs effort. But if the way is sometimes drear, with
    mindfulness the only guiding light, at least from reflection
    one knows that the goal is glorious and of great worth, not
    only for oneself but for others as well. </p>

    THEIR PERFECTION<br>
    (Brahma-vihara)</font></h3>
    <p>The way to that goal leads through what are called the <b>Divine
    Abidings</b>, [*] which train the deep-rooted emotions from
    being unskillful into the skillful way of the Dhamma. As had
    already been emphasized above, the aim of oneself as of all
    beings, is to gain happiness-producing conditions. Therefore
    one must act in such a way that happiness will result from
    one's actions. One should, in this case, treat others as they
    would wish to be treated, for every living being is dear to
    itself, and wishes its own welfare and happiness. One cannot
    expect to have an isolated happiness arising from no cause or
    from itself, nor can happiness be expected if one maltreats
    other beings, human or otherwise. Every being desires life
    and is afraid of death, this being as true of ourselves as of
    other creatures. </p>
    <p>* [See Nyanaponika, The Four Sublime States, WHEEL No. 6.]
    </p>
    <p>Only a man who constantly leads an upright and
    compassionate life is really dear to himself, for he does
    actions which are of great profit, of great happiness. Other
    people, although they think that they are dear to themselves,
    are really their own worst enemies, for they go about doing
    to themselves what only an enemy would wish for them. </p>
    <p>Good conduct depends on a well-trained mind which has
    gradually been freed from the clutches of greed, hatred and
    delusion. To hold one's neighbor as dear as one should truly
    hold oneself, is easily said but with difficulty done. It is
    the particular merit of Lord Buddha's teachings that they
    always point out how a method is to be translated into
    experience, the method here being the mental training of the
    Divine Abidings. When we say &quot;mental,&quot; this word
    should be understood not in the narrow sense of the
    intellectual processes, but rather to include the full range
    of the mind-and-heart, intellect and emotions. </p>
    <p>There are four states of Divine Abidings: <b>friendliness,
    compassion, gladness</b> and <b>equanimity</b>. These,
    especially the first, are very popular meditations in
    Buddhist countries. What follows is a short explanation of
    each. </p>
    <p>Friendliness (<b>metta</b>) is an unselfish love which can
    be extended to everyone. This becomes easy once one has
    gained the meditative absorptions, when the quality of
    friendliness becomes an integral part of one's character. In
    the normal way of things, people only &quot;love&quot; the
    few people to whom they are especially attached by ties of
    family, etc. Such is love with sensual attachment, a limited
    love, and those outside that love are either ignored or
    disliked. Sensual love, then, is not only linked to
    attachment (greed), but also to hatred and delusion, so that
    the person who is content with this love pays a heavy price
    for it. A love without attachment is scarcely conceivable to
    many people, but such love is much superior to the former;
    being without attachment it can become infinite and need not
    be confined to this or that group of beings. As it can be
    made infinite, leaving none outside it, there is no question
    of the three roots of unskill being linked with it. </p>
    <p>Friendliness can be developed gradually in one's
    meditation period every day, but if it is really effective it
    must show in one's daily life. It makes life easier by
    turning persons whom one formerly disliked or hated into, at
    the beginning, those whom one disregards, and then as one's
    practice becomes stronger, into objects for the arising of
    loving-kindness. It is Lord Buddha's medicine for the disease
    of hatred and dislike. Finally, one is warned that it has two
    enemies: the &quot;near&quot; one is sensual attachment,
    often miscalled &quot;love,&quot; while the &quot;far&quot;
    enemy to its development is hatred. In the development of
    friendliness one must beware of these two. </p>
    <p>Compassion (<b>karuna</b>) is taking note of the
    sufferings of other beings in the world. It overcomes callous
    indifference to the plight of suffering beings, human or
    otherwise. Likewise, it must be reflected in one's life by a
    willingness to go out of one's way to give aid where
    possible, and to help those in distress. It has the advantage
    of reducing one's selfishness by understanding others'
    sorrows. It is Lord Buddha's medicine for cruelty, for how
    can one harm others when one has seen how much they have to
    suffer already? It has also two enemies: the &quot;near&quot;
    one is mere grief; while its &quot;far&quot; enemy is
    cruelty. </p>
    <p>Gladness (<b>mudita</b>) is to rejoice with others over
    their success, gains happiness. It overcomes the grudging
    attitude to others, and the envy which may arise on hearing
    of others' joy. It must show in one's life as a spontaneous
    joy at the very time when one learns that other people have
    some gain or other, material or immaterial. It has the
    advantage of making one open-hearted towards others, and does
    away with secretiveness. A person who develops gladness
    attracts many friends who are devoted to him, and with them
    and others he lives in harmony. It is Lord Buddha's medicine
    for envy and jealousy, which it can inhibit completely. The
    two enemies of gladness are the merely personal happiness of
    reflecting on one's own gains -- this is the &quot;near&quot;
    enemy; while the &quot;far&quot; one is aversion to, or
    boredom with, this gladness. </p>
    <p>Equanimity (<b>upekkha</b>) is to be developed to deal
    with situations where one should admit that it is beyond
    one's powers to change them. It overcomes worry and useless
    distraction over affairs which either do not concern one or
    else cannot be changed by oneself. It is reflected in one's
    life by an ability to meet difficult situations with
    tranquility and undisturbed peace of mind. The advantage to
    be seen in its development is that it makes one's life more
    simple by disengaging from useless activity. It is Lord
    Buddha's medicine for distraction and worry, and its enemies
    are mere indifference, which is the &quot;near&quot; one;
    while greed, and its partner resentment, which involve one
    unskillfully in so many affairs, are its &quot;far&quot;
    enemies. </p>
    <p>The mind well-practiced in these four virtues, and then
    well-trained by their use in daily life, has already gained
    very much. </p>
    <p>Three of the perfections (<b>parami</b>), or qualities,
    practiced by many Buddhists who aspire to enlightenment may
    also be outlined here, as they too have an intimate bearing
    on the practice of meditation. </p>

    <h3 align="center"><font color="#008000">PATIENCE AND ITS
    PERFECTION<br>
    (Khanti-Parami)</font></h3>
    <p>Patience is an excellent quality much praised in Buddhist
    scriptures. It can be developed easily only if restlessness
    and hatred have already been subdued in the mind, as is done
    by meditation practice. Impermanence, which has the tendency
    to make one rush around and thus miss many good chances,
    results from the inability to sit still and let things sort
    themselves out -- which sometimes they may do without one's
    meddling. The patient man has many a fruit fall into his lap
    which the go-getter misses. One of them is a quiet mind, for
    impatience churns the mind up and brings with it the familiar
    anxiety-diseases of the modern business world. Patience
    quietly endures -- it is this quality which makes it so
    valuable in mental training and particularly in meditation.
    It is no good expecting instant enlightenment after five
    minutes practice. Coffee may be instant, but meditation is
    not, and only harm will come of trying to hurry it up. For
    ages the rubbish has accumulated, an enormous pile of mental
    refuse, and so when one comes along at first with a very tiny
    teaspoon and starts removing it, how fast can one expect it
    to disappear? Patience is the answer, and determined energy
    to go with it. The patient meditator really gets results of
    lasting value; the seeker after &quot;quick methods&quot; or
    &quot;sudden enlightenment&quot; is doomed by his own
    attitude to long disappointment. </p>
    <p>Indeed, it must soon become apparent to anyone
    investigating the Dhamma, that these teachings are not for
    the impatient. A Buddhist views his present life as a little
    span perhaps of eighty years or so, and the latest one so far
    of many such lives. Bearing this in mind, he determines to do
    as much in this life for the attainment of Enlightenment as
    possible. But he does not overestimate his capabilities; he
    just quietly and patiently gets on with living the Dhamma
    from day to day. Rushing headlong at Enlightenment (or what
    one thinks it is), like a bull in a china shop, is not likely
    to get one very far, that is unless one is a very exceptional
    character who can take such treatment, and most important,
    one who is devoted to a very skillful master of meditation. </p>
    <p>With patience one will not bruise oneself, but will go
    carefully step by step along the way. We learn that a
    Bodhisatta is well aware of this, and that he cultures his
    mind with this perfection so that it is not disturbed by any
    of the untoward occurrences common in this world. He decides
    that he will be patient with exterior conditions -- not to be
    upset when the sun is too hot or the weather too cold. Not to
    be agitated by other beings which attack his body, such as
    bugs and mosquitoes. Neither will he be disturbed when people
    utter harsh words, lies or abuse about him, either to his
    face or behind his back. His patience is not broken even when
    his body is subjected to torment, blows, sticks and stones,
    tortures, and even death itself; he will endure these
    steadily, so unflinching is his patience. Buddhist monks also
    are advised to practice in the same way. </p>
    <p>In Buddhist tradition the perfection of patience is rather
    better known than some of the others. This is because a quite
    outstanding Birth Story illustrates it. The Khantivadi
    (Teacher of Patience) Birth Story [*] should be read many
    times and made the object of deep and frequent reflections.
    Only an exceptionally noble person, in this case Gotama in a
    previous life, when he was called the Patience-teaching
    Rishi, can gently exhort a raging and drunk monarch, who out
    of his jealous anger, is slowly cutting that person's body to
    pieces. Such nobility did the Bodhisatta have and such
    nobility, steadfast endurance, and gentleness, is required of
    all who would try to reach the goal of Enlightenment. </p>

    Society.] </p>

    <h3 align="center"><font color="#008000">ENERGY AND ITS
    PERFECTION <br>
    (Viriya-parami)</font></h3>
    <p>Just as Enlightenment is inconceivable unless a person has
    patience, so it is not attainable without effort being made.
    The Dhamma never encourages the doctrine of fatalism, and
    true Buddhists never think of events as being rigidly
    predetermined. Such fatalism is combated by mindfulness and
    by energy itself. This perfection is the counterpart of the
    previous one, and balanced by practice, they ensure that the
    sincere Buddhist neither passively accepts what he should
    combat nor rushes around to the disturbance of himself and
    others when he should have patience. By way of warning it may
    be mentioned here that in the Buddhist world can be found a
    number of &quot;methods&quot; which seem to promise the
    riches of Dhamma all in no time. One hears such remarks as,
    &quot;What's the use of books and study?&quot; Or even,
    &quot;The development of calm is a waste of time! One should
    only develop insight.&quot; Such lop-sided approaches do not
    reflect the wisdom of Lord Buddha, who taught time and again
    the necessity of a balanced development of mind. Books and
    their study are useful to some people who wish to gain a good
    background of what Lord Buddha really said, before taking up
    more intensive practice. As for the other assertion, no real
    insight (only delusive ideas) will arise to the person whose
    mind has no experience of calm. Such views as these, which
    are usually based on some peculiar experience of those
    &quot;teachers&quot; who originate them, are apt to mislead
    many, since the craving for quick results coupled with the
    dislike of the necessary hard work, are easily stirred up.
    There must be patience to accept that the conditions required
    for success of meditation (as outlined here) have to be
    fulfilled, and the only result if failing to do so, is
    straying off the Way. The meditator applies himself steadily
    to whatever task he has in hand and, coming to the end of it,
    does not feel tired at all but straightaway takes up a new
    objective. </p>
    <p>It is interesting in this respect that tiredness is of two
    kinds: that relating to physical exhaustion; and the other
    kind which is mentally induced and involves the unskillful
    factors of sloth and torpor. While the former is of course
    unavoidable, the latter occurs only when the unskillful root
    of delusion (or dullness) becomes predominant in the mind.
    This happens when there is a situation which is unpleasant to
    &quot;me,&quot; unwanted, and from which &quot;I&quot; want
    to escape. People complain that they become much more tired
    sitting in meditation while practicing intensively than they
    do when, say, they do a bit of heavy reading. When the self
    feels threatened by a self-revealing event, then this self,
    rooted in unknowing, throws up a dense fog of torpor
    proceeding from the root of delusion. On the other hand, many
    who have practiced much meditation remark that they do not
    have to sleep so long as they did formerly, while energy,
    when it becomes a perfection as practiced by the Bodhisatta,
    is quite natural and unforced. </p>
    <p>This perfection is illustrated by the story of the
    caravan-leader who saved the merchants, men and animals
    entrusted to his care, by vigorous action. When others would
    have given themselves up to death since the caravan had taken
    a wrong course in the desert and all supplies were exhausted,
    their leader forced one of them to dig for water, which he
    found. In this way, in a previous life did Gotama, as the
    caravan-leader, make effort not only for his own life but
    also for the welfare of others. Monks are also referred to as
    &quot;caravan-leaders&quot; in several places in Pali
    scriptures, showing that it is not only Lord Buddha or a
    Bodhisatta who is able to guide others. If we deal
    energetically with our own training then we too have energy
    for the advancement of others. Many other stories like the
    above could be found in Buddhist works showing how necessary
    is energy, from which spring persistence and determination
    for the seeing of the truly real, Nibbana. </p>

    <h3 align="center"><font color="#008000">COLLECTEDNESS AND
    ITS PERFECTION <br>
    (Samadhi-parami)</font></h3>
    <p>Bearing in mind the meanings of this word together with
    such specialized terms as (mind-) development (<b>bhavana</b>),
    absorption (<b>jhana</b>), insight (<b>vipassana</b>),
    one-pointedness (<b>ekaggata</b>), and meditaton exercise (<b>kammatthana</b>),
    we may now examine what constitutes perfected collectedness.
    What especially marks off the good Buddhist's practice,
    whether he be a Bodhisatta or not, from that of an ordinary
    meditator (in any religion), is that the latter will most
    likely become firmly attached to the delights occurring in
    the upper reaches of the sensual realm, or to the pure joys
    of the realm of form and, as a result, come to birth in one
    of these heavenly states. If one gets oneself trapped in one
    of these bourns, where pleasures and joys are great and
    sufferings but little, then it is unlikely that one will be
    able to generate the energy necessary for the perfection of
    wisdom. Therefore, the good meditator tries to become
    proficient in the absorptions (so that he can enter them when
    he likes, and emerge when he likes), while not being attached
    to them. But one should note that this applies only to the
    skilled meditator who has already obtained the absorptions.
    If one has not reached to these levels, then ardent
    aspiration, not detachment, will be the correct attitude. </p>
    <p>After these absorptions have been attained, they may be
    reviewed as impermanent, unsatisfactory and devoid of self or
    soul (<b>aniccam</b>, <b>dukkham</b>, <b>anatta</b>), at
    which time detachment from them will naturally arise and
    insight (vipassana) be experienced. The absorptions (and the
    powers which may arise in connection with them) are thus, in
    the Buddhist way of training, never an end in themselves but
    are always used to promote insight and wisdom, which arise
    when the collected mind is set the task of examining the mind
    and body in order to know completely their characteristics. </p>
    <p>A story which brings out the meaning of this perfection is
    told of Kuddalamuni's life. His name means the Mattock sage
    and he was thus called because of the difficulty he
    experienced in freeing himself from attachment to his
    mattock. Several times leaving his house with intent to
    meditate in the forest, he was dragged back by the memory of
    his mattock and his old occupation of farming. One day,
    reflecting on the inconstancy with which he pursued
    meditation, he took his mattock and, whirling it round his
    head, sent it spinning into the depths of the nearby Ganges.
    Having done this, he burst out in a great cry of joy. The
    local rajah who was passing that way with his army, sent a
    man to enquire why this farmer was so joyful, to which the
    sage replied by relating his experience. The rajah and many
    others were much impressed by his reply, and some followed
    him to take up a meditative life in the forest; after which,
    we are told, all passed away to experience life in the realm
    of form. The Mattock-sage, who was none other than Gotama in
    a past life, exhibited even then another aspect of the
    perfection of meditation: the ability to train others in
    meditation after gaining proficiency in it oneself. </p>
    <p>Finally, we may add brief notes on some of the dangers to
    meditation practice. </p>
    <p align="right">[<a href="#00">^</a>]</p>
    <hr width="30%">
    <p><a name="8"></a> </p>
    <h3 align="center"><font color="#008000">DANGERS TO
    MEDITATION</font></h3>
    <p>While the number of ways a meditator may go astray is
    legion, the few mentioned below deserve a special mention due
    to their common occurrence. First, a danger that cannot be
    stressed enough is the lack of right motivation for the
    practice of meditation. When the Eightfold Path is described,
    in its &quot;wisdom&quot; section, standing next to the (at
    first) intellectual right understanding, comes right
    motivation, thus emphasizing that the emotional roots
    underlying practice of the Way must be skillful ones: those
    connected with renunciation (<b>non-greed</b>), goodwill (<b>non-hatred</b>)
    and <b>non-violence</b> are mentioned. If one approaches
    Buddhist meditation with neither right understanding
    regarding dukkha and its cessation, nor with right motives,
    then one's meditation is liable to seriously astray. </p>
    <p>There have, for instance, been those who took up
    meditation as a way to invest themselves with power, so that
    they could easily sway or hypnotize disciples. Others have
    seen it as a quick way to gain both disciples and riches.
    Fame may also be an unworthy motive. All these, as motives
    for playing with meditation, may easily lead the unwary into
    illness, and sometimes mental unbalance. There is nothing
    worse in Buddhist meditation, where a person's own sure
    experience is of paramount importance, than a half-baked
    disciple who sets himself up as a master. </p>
    <p>This obviously leads on to a further danger -- that of
    pride, of which there are several forms. One such is the
    pride of the person who has seen manifestations of light
    during meditation, and supposes this to be the sign preceding
    mental absorption. Then there is the pride of one who touches
    on a mental absorption if only for an instant and as a result
    assumes that he has become a Noble One, and this can be a
    very powerful factor in convincing himself if not others.
    Quite ordinary people who take up meditation may beware of
    the common &quot;holier-than-thou&quot; attitudes: &quot;I
    make an effort, whereas you . . .,&quot; or, &quot;I meditate
    every day, whereas you . . .&quot; Pride is a great obstacle
    to any progress, and while it is only a Buddha or Arahat who
    is entirely rid of it, everyone should have the mindfulness
    to check it. </p>
    <p>Related to this is the danger for the person who always
    looks for so-called progress. He is sure that he is making
    &quot;progress&quot; because in meditation he sees lights,
    hears sounds, or feels strange sensations. He becomes more
    and more fascinated by these as time goes by, and gradually
    forgets that he started with the aspiration to find the way
    to Enlightenment. His &quot;meditation&quot; then degenerates
    into visions and strange happenings, leading him into the
    realms of occultism and magic. There is no surer way for a
    meditator to become entangled than this way. Fascinating
    though all such manifestations may be, they should be
    rigorously cut down by resorting to bare attention, never
    permitting discursive thought regarding them, and thus
    avoiding these distractions. </p>
    <p>Among &quot;<b>visions</b>&quot; which one may see,
    whether they be internal (produced from one's own mind) or
    external (produced by other beings), there may be for some
    meditators an experience of the fearful, such as the sight of
    one's own body reduced to bones or inflated as a rotting
    corpse. If such an experience occurs, or others of a similar
    nature, one should withdraw the mind from the vision
    immediately, supposing that one has no teacher. Visions of
    the fearful variety which occur to some people may be very
    useful if rightly employed, but without a teacher's guidance
    they should be avoided. </p>
    <p>Another danger is trying to meditate while one is still
    too emotionally insecure, unbalanced or immature. An
    understanding of the value of meritorious deeds or
    skillfulness will come in useful here. As merit purifies the
    mind, it will be an excellent basis for mind-development, and
    both the ease with which absorptions are gained and the ease
    with which insight arises are to some extent dependent upon
    merit. Meritorious deeds are not difficult to find in life.
    They are the core of a good Buddhist life: <b>giving and
    generosity, undertaking the precepts, help and service to
    others, reverence, listening whole-heartedly to Dhamma,
    setting upright one's understanding of Dhamma</b> -- all
    these and more are meritorious deeds which bring happiness
    and emotional maturity. <b>Merit</b>, one should always
    remember, opens doors everywhere. It makes possible, it makes
    opportunities. To have a mind at all times set upon making
    merit, is to have a mind that may be trained to develop
    absorptions and insight. </p>
    <p>Obviously it follows that to try to practice meditation
    while all the time retaining one's old cravings, likes and
    dislikes is, to say the least, making one's path difficult if
    not dangerous. Meditation implies renunciation, and no
    practice will be successful unless one is at least prepared
    to make efforts to restrain greed and hatred, check lust, and
    understand when delusion is clouding the heart. How far one
    carries renunciation and whether this involves outward
    changes (such as becoming a monk or nun), depends much on a
    person and his circumstances, but one thing is sure: inward
    renunciation, an attitude of giving-up with regard to both
    unskillful mental events and bodily indulgence, is absolutely
    essential. </p>
    <p>Often connected with the above dangers is another, to be
    seen in cases where a man suddenly has an opportunity to
    undertake a longer period of meditation practice. He sits
    down with the firm resolve, &quot;Now I shall meditate,&quot;
    but though his energy is ever so great and though he sits and
    sits and walks and walks, still his mind is disturbed and
    without peace. It may well be that his own strong effort has
    much to do with his distractions. Moreover, he has to learn
    that it is necessary to meditate knowing the imitations of
    his character. Just as any other worker who knows the limits
    of his strength and is careful not to exhaust himself, so is
    the able meditator careful. With mindfulness one should know
    what are the extremes, of laziness and of strain, to be
    avoided. </p>
    <p>It is through straining or forcing meditation practice
    that many emotionally disturbed states arise. Sudden bursts
    of intense anger all over insignificant trifles, fierce
    cravings and lusts, strange delusions and even more peculiar
    fantasies can all be produced from unwisely arduous practice.
    </p>
    <p>With all these dangers it is a skilled teacher who is most
    necessary to give advice, so that these and other wrong
    turnings are avoided and one keeps straight along the way to
    Nibbana. Those who are without a teacher should proceed with
    utmost caution, making sure that their development of
    mindfulness is very good indeed. If they are mindful and see
    that despite their efforts, their meditation practice is
    making no real difference to their lives in terms of greater
    internal peace, or externally in relation to others, then it
    should be apparent that something is wrong. Meditation may be
    laid aside for some time while making efforts to contact a
    genuine source of information, preferably a living meditation
    master, in the meantime giving due attention to unsolved
    moral problems, which until sorted out will not permit the
    mind to develop; and making a great effort to live one's life
    according to Buddhist standards. When quite basic matters of
    this sort are neglected, one cannot hope to make much
    progress upon the Middle Practice-Path. </p>

    <h4 align="center"><font color="#800080">40 MEDITATION
    EXERCISES<br>
    as listed in the Path of Purification</font></h4>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If one has no meditation teacher from whom one may request
    a meditation subject, then one has to rely upon one's
    knowledge of one's character in order to prescribe for
    oneself a suitable meditation. There are forty meditation
    exercises (kammatthana) noted by the great teacher
    Buddhaghosa as being suited to certain types of character.
    For the purposes of meditation, he considers six characters:
    faithful, intelligent, and speculative (in which the skillful
    roots of non-greed, non-hatred and non-delusion are variously
    dominant); and greedy, hating, and deluded (in which greed,
    hatred and delusion, the unskillful roots, are dominant). The
    trouble here is twofold: firstly, very few &quot;pure&quot;
    types can be found, most people being mixtures of two or more
    of them -- and moreover ever-changing mixtures; and secondly,
    it is rather difficult to judge which class one's character
    belongs to since one's own delusion and pride are apt to blur
    one's judgements. This is but one small matter in which the
    value of the meditation teacher may be discerned very easily.
    One may learn much about oneself, however, by being mindful
    at the time when some unexpected event takes place. At that
    time one can spot one's reaction and the stains which are
    present in the mind. Later judgements are not worth very
    much, since by that time the mind has got round to
    self-justifications, and other kinds of distortions of the
    original event. </p>
    <p>Below is given the list of the forty meditation exercises
    with some notes upon their practice, the characters which are
    benefited, and the types of stains combated by them. The most
    widely used meditation exercises are starred (*). </p>

    <p>Apart from the possible exception of 5-8, no special moral
    stain is counteracted by these ten kasinas. As they are to be
    developed through the eye, they will not be very suitable for
    anyone with weak sight (according to Buddhaghosa). </p>
    <p>The only one of the ten kasinas which seems to be
    practiced much these days is that of light, which some people
    find arises quite naturally when they begin to concentrate
    the mind. While Acariya Buddhaghosa's explanations in
    &quot;Path of Purification&quot; tend to stress the
    importance of using exterior supports for practice (the
    making of the earth kasina is very minutely described),
    whenever the writer has heard of them being employed (in
    Thailand), they are always in the nature of visions (nimitta)
    arising internally and being developed from this basis. It
    appears that contemplations of an exterior earth, etc. kasina
    is unknown in Thailand. </p>

    <p>These and similar lists in the Satipatthana Sutta reflect
    the time when disposal of corpses upon charnel-grounds was
    common. Now, however, even in Buddhist lands they are
    difficult to find, let alone in Western countries. Teachers
    in Thailand at the present time stress that one's own body is
    to be seen in these ways as a vision (<b>nimitta</b>) arising
    in the course of mind-development. As these can be fearful,
    one should have the instruction of a skilled teacher for
    dealing with such visions, when they can be of great
    advantage. It may be stressed here that there is nothing
    morbid in contemplating such sights, interior or exterior, as
    these. The body's decay is just something natural, but
    normally it is not seen because people do not like to admit
    this. Instead of facing bodily decay and bringing it out into
    the open, dead bodies are even made to look attractive by
    embalmers and cosmeticians; and where this cannot be done,
    they are stowed away in beautiful coffins with bright
    flowers, etc. Buddhist training makes one look squarely at
    those aspects of life which normally (that is, with craving)
    are not considered &quot;nice,&quot; and makes one calmly
    face them in respect of one's own mind and body. </p>

    recommended for intelligent characters; 28 recommended for
    greedy characters; 29 recommended for deluded/speculative
    characters; and 30 recommended for intelligent characters. </p>
    <p>This group of ten has a more miscellaneous character than
    the previous two groups. In practicing the first three
    recollections (21-230 one recited the lists of qualities of
    each one of these [*]. Or if the mind does not become
    concentrated in this way, one chooses one particular quality
    and recites that silently and continuously (such as
    &quot;Buddho&quot; or &quot;Araham&quot;). Rosaries are used
    in some places in connection with practice of this sort. </p>
    <p>The recollections on virtue and generosity are specially
    good to cultivate in one's old age. One reviews all the
    meritorious deeds (punna) made by one in the course of life,
    and recollecting them the mind becomes tranquil and happy,
    and having such a mental state at the time of death, one is
    sure to be reborn in very favorable surroundings. One cannot
    recollect the celestials (deva) except by hearsay unless one
    has seen them. This practice is suitable for those who have
    increased the range of their minds and so have made contact
    with other more subtle beings. Death may be recollected by
    intelligent characters since they will not be frightened at
    the prospects which this practice opens up. It is a great
    incentive to practice now when one does not know whether even
    one second from hence, one will be alive. The twenty-eighth
    recollection -- on the body -- is for greedy characters, who
    need to develop dispassion regarding the body. This is
    achieved by the analysis of the body into thirty-two
    unbeautiful parts, and then by selecting one or more of these
    and examining it. However, this practice comes to perfection
    when with insight the body is illuminated and its various
    components are clearly seen and their nature understood. </p>
    <p>The mindfulness of breathing is recommended for calming
    and clearing the mind, and a person of almost any temperament
    may practice it with benefit, though great care is needed in
    the subtler ranges of this exercise. The breathing is never
    forced but observed constantly with mindfulness, the point of
    concentration being usually the nose-tip or nostrils.
    However, teachers vary in their practice of it. The
    recollection of peace, says the great Acariya, is only of
    certain benefit to those who have already experienced
    Nibbana, such as stream-enterers; but others can gain some
    calm from contemplation of peacefulness. The peace spoken of
    here is really Nibbana, and as one cannot recollect what one
    has not known, if a worldling (puthujjana), this is a
    practice for the Noble Ones (ariya). </p>

    <p>Those practices not mentioned in connection with character
    are suited to anyone. As all of these practices are aimed at
    the lessening and eventual destruction of the stains (<b>kilesa</b>),
    one may appreciate how important they are thought in Buddhist
    training. Where the stains are present, there the darkness of
    unknowing holds sway; but where they are not found, there
    shines forth the wisdom and compassion of Enlightenment. </p>
