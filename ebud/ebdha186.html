    <p align="center"><strong><font face="Times New Roman">FOREWORD</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From time immemorial, man has been preoccupied with the
    pursuit of happiness in life, from the cradle to the grave. He works and struggles very
    hard to attain happiness, very often without knowing exactly what happiness means because
    of his ignorance of the nature of life. Although all religions provide advice and
    guidelines for their adherents to practise in order to attain happiness in life, more
    often than not, these advices and guidelines are ignored owing to man's craving, hatred
    and illusion. Many people who experienced frustrations and sufferings hope and pray to
    find happiness for present life and here after, others, though enjoying a large measure of
    happiness on earth, are still not contented and crave for eternal bliss in heaven after
    leaving this world. For the ordinary man, as for the child, it is difficult to make a
    distinction between happiness and pleasure. To him, that which gives pleasure gives
    happiness, and to be happy is to experience pleasure.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Very often, we consider childhood days to be a period of
    happiness. In reality, as children we do not understand what happiness is. Under - the
    protection of our parents, we pass our days in a perpetual round of enjoyment which
    undoubtedly gives us pleasure. As we enter adolescence, changes take place in the mind and
    physical body causing us to become aware of the existence of the opposite sex and we begin
    to experience a new kind of attraction giving rise to disturbing emotions. At the same
    time, curiosity drives us to find out about the facts of life, through peer discussion and
    book reading. Before long, we find ourselves on the threshold of adulthood, the crucial
    time in our life when we look for a suitable life-partner to begin a relationship that
    will put to the test all the qualities that we have acquired earlier in life. Love, sex,
    and marriage then become matters of great importance that will determine the quality of
    the married life we will have.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Young people today are exposed to a large variety of
    &quot;Western&quot; influences which are disseminated through the mass media such as books
    and magazines, television, video cassettes and movies, resulting in the acquisition of
    distorted ideas regarding love, sex, and marriage. The age-old &quot;Eastern&quot; moral
    virtues and values are being gradually eroded in the face of these influences. Practices
    unheard of and never carried out by the older generation have become commonplace among
    young people today. Are the &quot;Western&quot; influences really responsible for this
    state of affairs or should the parents be blamed for the misdeeds of their children for
    not exercising proper control and supervision over them? In this book, it is explained
    that most television programmes and movies do not represent the way most decent people in
    the West think or behave and that there is a vast &quot;silent majority&quot; of decent
    couples who are as deeply religious and &quot;conservative&quot; about love, sex, and
    marriage as any &quot;Eastern&quot; couple. If young people want to ape the West, they are
    advised to ape this `silent majority' who are no different from their decent neighbour who
    lives next door to them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Modern life is fraught with all kinds of tension and
    stress. Doubtless, very often it is tension and stress that creates problems in many a
    marriage. If a proper analysis is made into the root causes of such social problems as
    pre-marital sex, teenage pregnancies, unhappy marriages and divorces, child-abuse and
    wife-battering, we inevitably discover that it is due mainly to selfishness and lack of
    patience, tolerance and mutual understanding. In the <b>Sigalovada Sutta, </b>the Buddha
    gives good advice on how to maintain peace and harmony in the home between husband and
    wife in order to achieve a happy married life. Parental responsibilities for children and
    the children's duties towards parents are also clearly mentioned in the <b>Sutta </b>as
    useful guidelines for the attainment of a happy home. In this book, the Ven. Author
    stresses the important point that marriage is a partnership of two individuals and that
    this partnership is enriched and enhanced when it allows the personalities involved to
    grow. In the Buddhist perspective, marriage means understanding and respecting each
    other's beliefs and privacy. The present time is most opportune for a book of this nature
    to be published to provide the followers of the Buddhist religion, in particular the
    young, with a clear understanding of life's important matters like love, sex and marriage
    which will not only help them to live a happy married life but also assist them to lead
    peaceful and contented lives.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font><font COLOR="#7f0000"><b></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><a name="1"></a><font face="Times New Roman">1. INTRODUCTION</font></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From the Buddhist point of view, marriage is neither holy
    nor unholy. Buddhism does not regard marriage as a religious duty nor as sacrament that is
    ordained in heaven. A cynic has said that while some people believe that, marriage is
    planned in heaven, others say that, it is recorded in hell also! Marriage is basically a
    personal and social obligation, it is not compulsory. Man and woman must have freedom
    either to get married or to remain single. This does not mean that Buddhism is against
    marriage. Nobody in this world would say that marriage is bad and there is no religion
    which is against marriage.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Practically all living things come into being as a result
    of sex life. Among human beings, the institution of marriage has come about so that,
    society guarantees the perpetuation of the human species and also ensures that the young
    would be cared for. This is based on the argument that children born through the pleasure
    of sex must be the responsibility of the partners involved, at least until they have grown
    up. And marriage ensures that this responsibility is upheld and carried out.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A society grows through a network of relationships which
    are mutually inter-twined and inter-dependent. Every relationship is a whole-hearted
    commitment to support and to protect others in a group or community. Marriage plays a very
    important part in this strong web of relationships of giving support and protection. A
    good marriage should grow and develop gradually from understanding and not impulse, from
    true loyalty and not just sheer indulgence. The institution of marriage provides a fine
    basis for the development of culture, a delightful association of two individuals to be
    nurtured and to be free from loneliness, deprivation and fear. In marriage, each partner
    develops a complementary role, giving strength and moral courage to one another, each
    manifesting a supportive and appreciative recognition of the other's skill in caring and
    providing for a family. There must be no thought of either man or woman being superior -
    each is complementary to the other; marriage is a partnership of equality, gentleness,
    generosity, calm and dedication.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Buddhism, one can find all the necessary advice which
    can help one to lead a happy married life. One should not neglect the advice given by the
    Enlightened Teacher if one really wants to lead a happy married life. In His discourses,
    the Buddha gave various kinds of advice for married couples and for those who are
    contemplating marriage. The Buddha has said, &quot;If a man can find a suitable and
    understanding wife and a woman can find a suitable and understanding husband, both are
    fortunate indeed'&quot;.</font></p>

    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><a name="2"></a><font face="Times New Roman">2. THE NATURE OF LOVE AND
    PLEASURE</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Love</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are different kinds of love, and these are variously
    expressed as motherly love, brotherly love, sensual love, emotional love, sexual love,
    selfish love, selfless love and universal love.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If people develop only their carnal or selfish love
    towards each other, that type of love cannot last long. In a true love relationship, one
    should not ask how much one can get, but how much one can give.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When beauty, complexion and youth start to fade away, a
    husband who considers only the physical aspects of love may think of acquiring another
    young one. That type of love is animal love or lust. If a man really develops love as an
    expression of human concern for another being, he will not lay emphasis only on the
    external beauty and physical attractiveness of his partner. The beauty and attractiveness
    of his partner should be in his heart and mind, not in what he sees. Likewise, the wife
    who follows Buddhist teachings will never neglect her husband even though he has become
    old, poor or sick.</font></p>
    <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I have a fear that the modern girl loves to be
    Juliet to have a dozen Romeos. She loves adventure... The modern girl dresses not to
    protect herself from wind, rain and sun, but to attract attention. She improves upon
    nature by painting herself and looking extraordinary.&quot; - (Gandhi)</font></i><b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sex</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sex by itself is not &quot;evil&quot;, although the
    temptation and craving for it invariably disturbs the peace of mind, and hence is not
    conducive to spiritual development.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the ideal situation, sex is the physical culmination of
    a deeply satisfying emotional relationship, where both partners give and take equally.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The portrayal of love by commercial groups through the
    mass media in what we call &quot;western&quot; culture is not &quot;real&quot; love. When
    an animal wants to have sex, it shows its &quot;love&quot;, but after having experienced
    sex, it just forgets about love. For animals, sex is just an instinctive drive necessary
    for procreation. But a human being has much more to offer in the concept of love. Duties
    and responsibilities are important ingredients to maintain unity, harmony and
    understanding in a relationship between human beings.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sex is not the most important ingredient for happiness in
    a married life. Those who have become, slaves to sex would only ruin love and humanity in
    marriage. Apart from that, a woman must cease to consider herself as the object of a man's
    lust. The remedy is more in her hand than in a man's. She must refuse to adorn herself
    simply to please a man, even if he is her husband. If she wants to be an equal partner
    with a man, she should dress so that her dignity is enhanced, and she does not become a
    sex symbol. &quot;Marriage for the satisfaction of the sexual appetite is no marriage. It
    is oncupiscence.&quot; -- (Gandhi)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Love may indeed be a product of sex, but the reverse is
    likewise true: sex is an expression of love. In the ideally happy married life, both love
    and sex are inseparable.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha's Explanation</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We can study the Buddha's teaching regarding the feelings
    that man and woman have for each other. The Buddha says that he had never seen any object
    in this world which attracts man's attention more than the figure of a woman. At the same
    time the main attraction for the woman is the figure of a man. It means that by nature,
    woman and man give each other worldly pleasure. They cannot gain happiness of this kind
    from any other object. When we observe very carefully, we notice that among all the things
    which provide pleasure, there is no other object that can please all the five senses at
    the same time beside the male and female figures.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The ancient Greeks knew this when they said that
    originally man and woman were one. They were separated and the two parts that were divided
    are constantly seeking to be re-united as man and woman.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Pleasure</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Young people by nature like to indulge in worldly
    pleasures which can include both good and bad things. Good things, like the enjoyment of
    music, poetry, dance, good food, dress and similar pursuits do no harm to the body. They
    only distract us from seeing the fleeting nature and uncertainty of existence and thereby
    delay our being able to perceive the true nature of the self.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The faculties and senses of young people are very fresh
    and alert; they are very keen to satisfy all the five senses. Almost everyday, they plan
    and think out ways and means to experience some form of pleasure. By the very nature of
    existence, one will never be completely satisfied with whatever pleasure one experiences
    and the resultant craving in turn only creates more anxieties and worries.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When one ceases to crave for sensual pleasure and does not
    seek to find physical comfort in the company of others, the need for marriage does not
    arise. Suffering and worldly enjoyment are both the outcome of craving, attachment and
    emotion. If we try to control and suppress our emotions by adopting unrealistic tactics we
    create disturbances in our mind and in our physical body. Therefore we must know how to
    handle and control our human passion. Without abusing or misusing this passion, we can
    tame our desires through proper understanding.</font></p>
    <font COLOR="#7f0000"><b><p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">[<a href="#top">^</a>]</font></strong></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><a name="3"></a><font face="Times New Roman">3. THE REALITY OF MARRIED
    LIFE</font></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">John J. Robinson in his book &quot;<b>Of Suchness</b>&quot;
    gives the following advice on love, sex and married life. &quot;Be careful and discreet;
    it is much easier to get married than unmarried. If you have the right mate, it's
    heavenly; but if not, you live in a twenty-four-hour daily hell that clings constantly to
    you, it can be one of the bitterest things in life. Life is indeed strange. Somehow, when
    you find the right one, you know it in your heart. It is not just an infatuation of the
    moment. But the powerful urges of sex drive a young person headlong into blind acts and
    one cannot trust his feelings too much. This is especially true if one drinks and get
    befuddled; the lousiest slut in a dark bar can look like a Venus then, and her charms
    become irresistible. Love is much more than sex though; it is the biological foundation
    between a man and a woman; love and sex get all inter-twined and mixed up&quot;.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Problems</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Almost everyday, we hear people complaining about their
    marriages. Very seldom do we hear stories about a happy marriage. Young people reading
    romantic novels and seeing romantic films often conclude that marriage is a bed of roses.
    Unfortunately, marriage is not as sweet as one thinks. Marriage and problems are
    interrelated and' people must remember that when they are getting married, they will have
    to face problems and responsibilities that they had never expected or experienced
    hitherto.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">People often think that it is a duty to get married and
    that marriage is a very important event in their lives. However, in order to ensure a
    successful marriage, a couple has to harmonise their lives by minimising whatever
    differences they may have between them. Marital problems prompted a cynic to say that
    there can only be a peaceful married life if the marriage is between a blind wife and a
    deaf husband, for the blind wife cannot see the faults of the husband and a deaf husband
    cannot hear the nagging of his wife.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Sharing and Trust</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the major causes of marital problems is suspicion
    and mistrust. Marriage is a blessing but many people make it a curse due to lack of
    understanding.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Both husband and wife should show implicit trust for one
    another and try not to have secrets between them. Secrets create suspicion, suspicion
    leads to jealously, jealousy generates anger, anger causes enmity and enmity may result in
    separation, suicide or even murder.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If a couple can share pain and pleasure in their
    day-to-day life, they can console each other and minimize their grievances. Thus, the wife
    or husband should not expect to experience only pleasure. There will be a lot of painful,
    miserable experiences that they will have to face. They must have the strong willpower to
    reduce their burdens and misunderstandings. Discussing mutual problems will give them
    confidence to live together with better understanding.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Man and woman need the comfort of each other when facing
    problems and difficulties. The feelings of insecurity and unrest will disappear and life
    will be more meaningful, happy and interesting if there is someone who is willing to share
    another's burden.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Blinded by Emotions</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When two people are in love, they tend to show only the
    best aspects of their nature and character to each other in order to project a good
    impression of themselves. Love is said to be blind and hence people in love tend to become
    completely oblivious of the darker side of each other's natures.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In practice, each will try to highlight his or her
    sterling qualities to the other; and being so engrossed in love, they tend to accept each
    other at &quot;face value&quot; only. Each lover will not disclose the darker side of his
    or her nature for fear of losing the other. Any personal shortcomings are discreetly swept
    under the carpet, so to speak, so as not to jeopardise their chances of winning each
    other. People in love also tend to ignore their partner's faults thinking that they will
    be able to correct them after marriage, or that they can live with these faults, that
    &quot;love will conquer all&quot;.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, after marriage, as the initial romantic mood
    wears off, the true nature of each other's character will be revealed. Then, much to the
    disappointment of both parties, the proverbial veil that had so far been concealing the
    innermost feelings of each partner is removed to expose the true nature of both partners.
    It is then that disillusion sets in.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Material Needs</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Love by itself does not subsist on fresh air and sunshine
    alone. The present world is a materialistic world and in order to meet your material
    needs, proper financing and budgeting is essential. Without it, no family can live
    comfortably. Such a situation aptly bears out the saying that &quot;when poverty knocks at
    the door, love flies through the window&quot;. This does not mean that one must be rich to
    make a marriage work. However, if one has the bare necessities of life provided through a
    secure job and careful planning, many unnecessary anxieties can be removed from a
    marriage.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The discomfort of poverty can be averted if there is
    complete understanding between the couple. Both partners must understand the value of
    contentment. Both must treat all problems as &quot;our problems&quot; and share all the
    &quot;ups&quot; and &quot;downs&quot; in the true spirit of a long-standing life
    partnership.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Pre-marriage Advice</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <b>Anguttara Nikaya </b>contains some valuable advice
    which the Buddha gave to young girls prior to their marriage. Realising that there could
    be difficulties with the new in-laws, the girls were enjoined to give every respect to
    their mothers-in-law and fathers-in-law, serving them lovingly as their own parents. They
    were expected to honour and respect their husband's relatives and friends, thus creating a
    congenial and happy atmosphere in their new homes.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">They were also advised to study and understand their
    husbands' natures, ascertain their activities, characters and temperaments, and to be
    useful and cooperative at all times in their new homes. They should be polite, kind and
    watchful of their husbands' earnings and see to it that all household expenditures were
    properly administered. The advice given by the Buddha more than twenty-five centuries ago

    THE BUDDHIST CONCEPT OF MARRIAGE</font></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In view of what has been said about &quot;birth and
    suffering&quot;, some people have criticised Buddhism saying that it is against married
    life. They are wrong. The Buddha never spoke against married life. However, he pointed out
    all the problems, difficulties and worries that people would have to face when they take
    on the responsibility of marriage. Just because he warned one against problems in marriage
    does not mean that the Buddha condemned marriage.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The act of marriage itself implies that a person is still
    more attached to the physical world and since our mental faculties are influenced by
    craving, attachment and human emotions, it is but natural that problems would arise. This
    happens when we have to consider the needs of others and to give in to what others need.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Role of Religion</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A deep analysis of the nature of self is important to help
    us to understand the origin of our problems, worries, miseries and how to overcome them.
    Here, religious advice is important for maintaining a tranquil life. However, a man should
    not become a slave to any religion. <b>Man is not for religion, religion is for man. </b>That
    means man must know how to make use of religion for his betterment and for his happiness
    in a respectable way. Simply by following certain religious vows, precepts or commandments
    with blind faith or by force, thinking that we are duty-bound to observe them will not
    develop proper understanding.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One important aspect of Buddhism is that the Buddha did
    not impose any religious laws or commandments. The Buddha was a unique teacher who had set
    out a number of disciplinary codes for us to uphold according to our way of life. Those
    who follow the precepts observe them voluntarily but not as obligatory religious laws. It
    is up to us to follow the advice through our own understanding and experience of what is
    good for us and for others. Through trial and error, we will learn to follow the advice
    which will give us just peace and happiness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One should try to understand the nature of the worldly
    life: By knowing that you have to face problems, you will be able to strengthen your mind
    and be more prepared to face the problems that could arise if you get married. Religion is
    important to help you overcome your problems. Whatever you learnt about religious
    principles when you were young can be adopted to avoid misunderstanding, disappointment
    and frustration. At the same time, certain good qualities such as patience and
    understanding which we learned through religion are important assets to help us to lead a
    peaceful married life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Normally, it is due to a lack of mutual understanding that
    many married couples lead miserable lives. The result of this is that their innocent
    children also have to suffer. It is better to know how to handle your problems in order to
    lead a happy married life. Religion can help you to do this. </font></p>

    THE RELIGIOUS DILEMMA</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Individual Rights</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the causes of greatest concern among those who do
    not belong to the non-Semitic religions is the problem of conversion before marriage.
    While Buddhists and Hindus never demand that a couple must belong to the same religion
    before a marriage can be solemnized, many others tend to take advantage of this tolerance.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Marriage, contrary to what many romantic novels say, does
    not mean the total and absolute merging of two people to the extent that each loses his or
    her own identity. When a religion demands that both partners must have the same religious
    label, it denies the basic human right of an individual to believe what he or she wants.
    Societies throughout history have proved that &quot;Unity in Diversity&quot; is not only
    possible but also desirable. Out of diversity comes greater respect and understanding.
    This should apply to marriage also. There are many living examples all over the world
    where the husband and wife maintain their own beliefs and yet are able to maintain their
    happy married life without confronting each other.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhists do not oppose the existence of other religions
    even within the same household. Unfortunately this generous attitude has been exploited by
    unscrupulous religionists who are out to gain converts by all means.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Intelligent Buddhists must be aware of this stratagem. No
    self-respecting intelligent human being who really understands what he believes according
    to his own conviction should give up his beliefs merely to satisfy the man-made demands of
    another religion. Buddhists do not demand that their partners embrace Buddhism. Neither
    should they surrender their own beliefs.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Post-marriage Blues</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When young people are in love, they are prepared to make
    many sacrifices so long as they can get married. But after a few years, when the real task
    of building a successful marriage begins, frustrations begin to set in. When a partner who
    had given up his deep-seated religious beliefs for &quot;love&quot; begins to regret
    having done so, unnecessary misunderstandings arise: These provide added tensions at a
    period when there is boredom in a marriage. There will be quarrels. And normally, one of
    the main causes of these quarrels will be the question of which .religion the children
    should belong to.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore, it is most important for one to know that if
    there is a process of conversion involved, it must be based on true conviction and not
    mere convenience or compulsion. Buddhism maintains the freedom of the individual to
    choose. This principle should be respected by all.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">The Ceremony</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is no specific Buddhist ritual or procedure to
    conduct a marriage. Buddhism recognises the traditions and cultures practised by people in
    different countries. Hence, Buddhist religious ceremonies differ from one country to
    another.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In general practice, a religious service for blessing and
    to give advice to the couple is customarily performed either in the temple or at home to
    give a greater significance to the marriage. Nowadays, in many countries, besides the
    blessing service, religious organizations also have been given the authority to solemnise
    and register marriages together with .the issuance of legal marriage certificates.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">By and large, the most important point is that the couple
    should be utterly sincere in their intention to cooperate with and understand each other
    not only during times of happiness but also whenever they face difficulties.</font></p>

    SECURITY, RESPECT AND RESPONSIBILITIES</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sense of Insecurity</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the past, there was no such thing as a legal
    registration of marriages. A man and woman mutually decided to accept each other as
    husband and wife and thereafter they lived together. Their marriage was carried out in the
    presence of the community, and separation was rare. The most important thing was that they
    developed real love and respected their mutual responsibilities.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A legal registration of marriage is important today to
    ensure security and to safeguard property and children. Due to the sense of insecurity, a
    couple performs legal marriages to ensure that they are legally bound not to neglect their
    duties and not to ill-treat each other. Today, some couples even draw up a legal contract
    on what would happen to their property if they were divorced!</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Husband and Wife</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to Buddhist teaching, in a marriage, the husband
    can expect the following qualities from his wife:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- love <br>
      - attentiveness <br>
      - family obligations <br>
      - faithfulness <br>
      - child-care <br>
      - thrift <br>
      - the provision of meals <br>
      - to calm him down when he is upset <br>
      - sweetness in everything</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In return, the wife's expectation from the husband is:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- tenderness <br>
      - courtesy <br>
      - sociability <br>
      - security <br>
      - fairness <br>
      - loyalty <br>
      - honesty <br>
      - good companionship <br>
      - moral support</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Apart from these emotional and sensual aspects, the couple
    will have to take care of day-today living conditions, family budget and social
    obligations. Thus, mutual consultations between the husband and wife on all family
    problems would help to create an atmosphere of trust and understanding in resolving
    whatever issues that may arise.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha's Advice to a Couple</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">1) The Wife</font></i></b></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In advising women about their role in married life, the
    Buddha appreciated that the peace and harmony of a home rested largely on a woman. His
    advice was realistic and practical when he explained a good number of day-to-day
    characteristics which a woman should or should not cultivate. On diverse occasions, the
    Buddha counselled that a wife should:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- not harbour evil thoughts against her husband;<br>
      - not be cruel, harsh or domineering;<br>
      - not be spendthrift but should be economical and live within her means;<br>
      - guard and save her husband's hard-earned earnings and property;<br>
      - always be attentive and chaste in mind and action;<br>
      - be faithful and harbour no thought of any adulterous acts;<br>
      - be refined in speech and polite in action;<br>
      - be kind, industrious and hardworking;<br>
      - be thoughtful and compassionate towards her husband and her attitude should equate that
      of a mother's love and concern for the protection of her only son;<br>
      - be modest and respectful;<br>
      - be cool, calm and understanding - serving not only as a wife but also as a friend and
      advisor when the need arises.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the days of the Buddha, other religious teachers also
    spoke on the duties and obligations of a wife towards her husband - stressing particularly
    on the duty of a wife bearing an off-spring for the husband, rendering faithful service
    and providing conjugal happiness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some communities are very particular about having a son in
    the family. They believe that a son is necessary to perform their funeral rites so that
    their after-life will be a good one. The failure to get a son from the first wife, gives a
    man the liberty to have another wife in order to get a son. Buddhism does not support this
    belief.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to what the Buddha taught about the law of
    Karma, one is responsible for one's own action and its consequences. Whether a son or a
    daughter is born is determined not by a father or mother but the karma of the child. And
    the well-being of a father or grandfather does not depend upon the action of the son or
    grandson. Each is responsible for his own actions. So, it is wrong for men to blame their
    wives or for a man to feel inadequate when a son is not born. Such Enlightened Teachings
    help to correct the views of many people and naturally reduce the anxiety of women who are
    unable to produce sons to perform the &quot;rites of the ancestors&quot;.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although the duties of a wife towards the husband were
    laid down in the Confucian code of discipline, it did not stress the duties and
    obligations of the husband towards the wife. In the <b>Sigalovada Sutta </b>however, the
    Buddha clearly mentioned the duties of a husband towards the wife and vice versa.</font></p>
    <b><blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">2) The Husband</font></i></b></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha, in reply to a householder as to how a husband
    should minister to his wife, declared that the husband should always honour and respect
    his wife, by being faithful to her, by giving her the requisite authority to manage
    domestic affairs and by giving her befitting ornaments. This advice, given over twenty
    five centuries ago, still stands good for today.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Knowing the psychology of the man who tends to consider
    himself superior, the Buddha made a remarkable change and uplifted the status of a woman
    by a simple suggestion that a husband should honour and respect his wife. A husband should
    be faithful to his wife, which means that a husband should fulfill and maintain his
    marital obligations to his wife thus sustaining the confidence in the marital relationship
    in every sense of the word. The husband, being a bread-winner, would invariably stay away
    from home, hence he should entrust the domestic or household duties to the wife who should
    be considered as the keeper and the distributor of the property and the home
    economic-administrator. The provision of befitting ornaments to the wife should be
    symbolic of the husband's love, care and attention showered on the wife. This symbolic
    practice has been carried out from time immemorial in Buddhist communities. Unfortunately
    it is in danger of dying out because of the influence of modern civilization.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">The Past</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the past, since the social structure of most
    communities was different from that we find today, a husband and wife were interdependent
    on each other. There was mutual understanding, and the relationship was stable because
    each knew exactly what his or her role was in the partnership. The `love' that some
    husbands and wives try to show others by embracing each other in public does not
    necessarily indicate true love or understanding. In the past, although married couples did
    not express their love or inner feeling publicly, they had a deep even unspoken
    understanding and mutual respect for each other.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The ancient customs which people had in certain countries
    that the wife must sacrifice her life after her husband's death and also the custom which
    prevents a widow from remarrying is foreign to Buddhism. Buddhism does not regard a wife
    as being inferior to a husband.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Modern Society</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some women feel that for them to concentrate on the
    upbringing of the family is degrading and conservative. It is true that in the past women
    had been treated very badly, but this was due more to the ignorance on the part of men
    than the inherent weakness in the concept of depending on women to bring up children.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Women have been struggling for ages to gain equality with
    men in the field of education, the professions, politics and other avenues. They are now
    at par with men to a great extent. The male generally tends to be aggressive by nature and
    the female more emotional. In the domestic scene, particularly in the East, the male is
    more dominant as head of the family whilst the female tends to remain as passive partner.
    Please remember, &quot;passive&quot; here does not mean &quot;weak&quot;. Rather it is a
    positive quality of &quot;softness&quot; and &quot;gentleness&quot;. If man and woman
    maintain their masculine and feminine qualities inherited from nature and recognise their
    respective strengths, then, that attitude can contribute towards a congenial mutual
    understanding between the sexes.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Gandhi's remarks:</font></p>
    <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I believe in the proper education of woman. But
    do believe that woman will not make her contribution to the world by mimicking or running
    a race with man. She can run the race, but she will not rise to the great heights she is
    capable of by mimicking man. She has to be the complement of man&quot;.</font></i><b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Parental Responsibilities</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The basis of all human society is the intricate
    relationship between parent and child. A mother's duty is to love, care and protect the
    child, even at extreme cost. This is the self-sacrificing love that the Buddha taught. It
    is practical, caring and generous and it is selfless. Buddhists are taught that parents
    should care for the child as the earth cares for all the plants and creatures.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Parents are responsible for the well-being and up-bringing
    of their children. If the child grows up to be a strong, healthy and useful citizen, it is
    the result of parents' efforts. If the child grows up to be a ,delinquent, parents must
    bear the responsibility. One must not blame others or society if children go astray. It is
    the duty of parents to guide children on the proper path.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A child, at its most impressionable age, needs the tender
    love, care and attention of parents. Without parental love and guidance, a child will be
    handicapped and will find the world a bewildering place to live in. However, showering
    parental love, care and attention does not mean pandering to all the demands of the child,
    reasonable or otherwise. Too much pampering would spoil the child. The mother in bestowing
    her love and care, should also be strict and firm in handling the tantrums of a child.
    Being strict and firm does not mean being harsh to the child. Show your love, but temper
    it with a disciplined hand - the child will understand.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Unfortunately, amongst present-day parents, parental love
    is sadly lacking. The mad rush for material advancement, the liberation movements and the
    aspiration for equality, have resulted in many mothers joining their husbands, spending
    their working hours in offices and shops, rather than remaining at home tending to their
    off-spring. The children, left to the care of relations or paid servants, are bewildered
    on being denied tender motherly love and care. The mother, feeling guilty about her lack
    of attention, tries to placate the child by giving in to all sorts of demands from the
    child. Such an action spoils the child. Providing the child with all sorts of modern toys
    such as tanks, machine guns, pistols, swords and such like equipment as an appeasement is
    not psychologically good.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Loading a child with such toys is no substitute for a
    mother's tender love and affections. Devoid of parental affection and guidance, it will
    not be surprising if the child subsequently grows up to be a delinquent. Then, who is to
    be blamed for bringing up a wayward child? The parents of course! The working mother,
    especially after a hard day's work in an office to be followed by household chores, can
    hardly find time for the child that is yearning for her care and attention. Parents who
    have no time for their children should not complain when these same children have no time
    for them when they are old. Parents who claim that they spend a lot of money on their
    children but are too busy should not complain when their &quot;busy&quot; children in turn
    leave them in expensive Homes for the Aged!</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Most women work today so that the family can enjoy more
    material benefits. They should seriously consider Gandhi's advice for men to seek freedom
    from greed rather than freedom from need. Of course, given today's economic set-up we
    cannot deny that some mothers are forced to work. In such a case, the father and mother
    must make extra sacrifices of their time to compensate for what their children miss when
    they are away. If both parents spend their non-working hours at home with their children,
    there will be greater understanding between parents and children.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In his discourses, the Buddha has listed certain primary
    duties and functions as essential guide-lines for parents to observe. One of the primary
    guide-lines is, by precept, practice and action, to lead the children away from things
    that are evil and through gentle persuasion, to guide them to do all that is good for the
    family, for society and for the country. In this connection, parents would have to
    exercise great care in dealing with their children. It is not what the parents profess but
    what they really are and do, that the child absorbs unconsciously and lovingly. The
    child's entry to the world is moulded by emulating parental behaviour. It follows that
    good begets good and evil begets evil. Parents who spend much time with their children
    will subtly transmit their characteristics to their offspring.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Duties of Parents</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is the duty of parents to see to the welfare of their
    children. In fact the dutiful and loving parents shoulder the responsibilities with
    pleasure. To lead children on the right path, parents should first set the example and
    lead ideal lives. It is almost impossible to expect worthy children from unworthy parents.
    Apart from the Karmic tendencies children inherit from previous births, they invariably
    inherit the defects and virtues of parents too. Responsible parents should take every
    precaution not to transmit undesirable, tendencies to their progeny.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the <b>Sigalovada Sutta, </b>there are five
    duties that should be performed by parents:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><b><p><font face="Times New Roman">1) The first duty is to dissuade children from evil.</font></b></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Home is the first school, and parents are the first
    teachers. Children usually take elementary lessons in good and evil from their parents.
    Careless parents directly or indirectly impart an elementary knowledge of lying, cheating,
    dishonesty, slandering, revenge, shamelessness and fearlessness for evil and immoral
    activities to their children during childhood days.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Parents should show exemplary conduct and should not
    transmit such vices into their children's impressionable minds.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><b><p><font face="Times New Roman">2) The second duty is to persuade them to do good.</font></b></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Parents are the teachers at home; teachers are the parents
    in school. Both parents and teachers are responsible for the future well-being of the
    children, who become what they are made into. They are, and they will be, what the adults
    are. They sit at the feet of the adults during their impressionable age. They imbibe what
    they impart. They follow in their footsteps. They are influenced by their thoughts, words
    and deeds. As such it is the duty of the parents to create the most congenial atmosphere
    both at home and in the school.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Simplicity, obedience, co-operation, unity, courage,
    self-sacrifice, honesty, straightforwardness, service, self-reliance, kindness, thrift,
    contentment, good manners, religious zeal and other kindred virtues should be inculcated
    in their juvenile minds by degrees. Seeds so planted will eventually grow into fruit-laden
    trees.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><b><p><font face="Times New Roman">3) The third duty is to give the children a good
      education.</font></b></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A decent education is the best legacy that parents can
    bequeath to their children. A more valuable treasure there is not. It is the best blessing
    that parents could confer on their children.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Education should be imparted to them, preferably from
    youth, in a religious atmosphere. This has far-reaching effects on their lives.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><b><p><font face="Times New Roman">4) The fourth duty is to see that they are married
      to suitable individuals.</font></b></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Marriage is a solemn act that pertains to the whole
    lifetime; this union should be one that cannot be dissolved easily. Hence, marriage has to
    be viewed from every angle and in all its aspects to the satisfaction of all parties
    before the wedding.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to Buddhist culture, duty supercedes rights. Let
    both parties be not adamant, but use their wise discretion and come to an amicable
    settlement. Otherwise, there will be mutual cursing and other repercussions. More often
    than not the infection is transmitted to progeny as well.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><b><p><font face="Times New Roman">5) The last duty is to hand over to them, at the
      proper time, their inheritance.</font></b></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Parents not only love and tend their children as long as
    they are still in their custody, but also make preparations for their future comfort and
    happiness. They hoard up treasures at personal discomfort and ungrudgingly give them as a
    legacy to their children.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">The Religion of Compassion</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism is the religion of compassion, and the parents
    should never forget to present it to the children as such. The Buddha taught the Dhamma
    out of compassion for the world. Parents should practise the &quot;Four Sublime States of
    Mind&quot; taught by the Buddha in raising their children. They are:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Metta - loving-kindness or goodwill<br>
      Karuna - compassion<br>
      Mudita - sympathetic joy<br>
      Upekkha - &quot;equanimity&quot; or &quot;even-mindedness&quot;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These four states, well practised will help parents remain
    calm throughout the difficult period of child-rearing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the right or ideal way of conduct towards living
    beings. These four attitudes of mind provide the framework for all situations arising from
    social contact. They are the great removers of tension, the great peacemakers in social
    conflict, the great healers of wounds suffered in the struggle for existence; levellers of
    social barriers, builders of harmonious communities, awakeners of slumbering magnanimity
    long forgotten, revivers of joy and hope long abandoned, promoters of human brotherhood
    against the forces of egotism.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Perhaps the greatest challenge that a married couple has
    to face is the proper upbringing of a child. This is another aspect which distinguishes us
    from animals. While an animal does care for its offspring with great devotion, a human
    parent has a greater responsibility, which is the nurturing of the mind. The Buddha has
    said that the greatest challenge a man faces is to tame the mind. Ever since a child is
    born, from infancy through adolescence to maturity, a parent is primarily responsible for
    the development of a child's mind. Whether a person becomes a useful citizen or not
    depends mainly on the extent to which its mind has been developed. In Buddhism, a good
    parent can practise four great virtues to sustain him or her and to overcome the great
    frustrations which are so closely related with parenthood.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When a child is yet a toddler, unable to express its
    needs, it is quite prone to indulge in tantrums and crying. A parent who practises the
    first virtue of loving kindness can maintain peace within herself or himself to continue
    to love the child while it is being so difficult. A child who enjoys the effects of this
    loving kindness will himself learn to radiate it spontaneously.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As the child becomes more mature as an adolescent, parents
    should practise <i>Karuna</i> or Compassion towards him. Adolescence is a very difficult
    time for children. They are coming to terms with adulthood and therefore are rebellious,
    with a great deal of their anger and frustrations directed at their parents. With the
    practise of Compassion, parents will understand that this rebelliousness is a natural part
    of growing up and that children do not mean to hurt their parents willfully. A child who
    has enjoyed loving kindness and compassion will himself become a better person. Having not
    had hate directed at him, he will only radiate love and compassion towards others.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Just before he becomes an adult, a child will probably
    meet with-some success in examinations and other activities outside the home. This is the
    time for parents to practise sympathetic joy. Too many parents in modern society use their
    children to compete with their associates. They want their children to do well for selfish
    reasons; it is all because they want others to think well of them. By practising
    sympathetic joy, a parent will rejoice in the success and happiness of his or her child
    with no ulterior motive. He is happy simply because his child is happy! A child who has
    been exposed to the effects of sympathetic joy will himself become a person who does not
    envy others and who is not overly competitive. Such a person will have no room in his
    heart for selfishness, greed or hatred.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When a child has reached adulthood and has a career and
    family of his own, his parents should practise the last great virtue of equanimity <i>(Upekkha).
    </i>This is .one of the most difficult things for Asian parents to practise. It is hard
    for them to allow their children to. become independent in their own right. When parents
    practise equanimity, they will not interfere with the affairs of their children and not be
    selfish in demanding more time and attention than the children can give. Young adults in
    the modern society have many problems. An understanding parent of a young couple should
    not impose extra burdens by making unnecessary demands on them. Most importantly, elderly
    parents should try not to make their married children feel guilty by making them feel that
    they have neglected their filial obligations. If parents practise equanimity they will
    remain serene in their old age and thereby earn the respect of the younger generation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When parents practise these four virtues towards their
    children, the children will respond favourably and a pleasant atmosphere will prevail at
    home. A home where there is loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity
    will be a happy home. Children who grow up under such an environment will grow up to be
    understanding, compassionate, willing workers and considerate employers. This is the
    greatest legacy any parent can give to his child.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Parents in Modern Society</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the saddest things about modern society is the lack
    of parental love which children in highly industrialized countries suffer from. When a
    couple gets married, they usually plan to have a number of children. And once the child is
    born, parents are morally obliged to care for him to the best of their ability. Parents
    are responsible to see that a child is not only satisfied materially; the spiritual and
    psychological aspects are very important too.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The provision of material comfort is of secondary
    importance when compared to the provision of parental love and attention. We know of many
    parents from the not-so-well-to-do families who have brought up their children well and
    with plenty of love. On the other hand, many rich families have provided every material
    comfort for their children but have deprived them of parental love. Such children will
    just grow up devoid of any psychological and moral development.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A mother should consider carefully whether she should
    continue to be a working mother or a housewife giving all the affection and care for the
    well-being of her growing child. (Strangely, some modern mothers are also being trained to
    handle guns and other deadly equipments when they should be cuddling their children and
    training them to be good and law-abiding citizens.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The modern trend and attitude of working mothers towards
    their children also tends to erode the time-honoured filial piety which children are
    expected to shower on their parents. The replacement of breast-feeding by bottle feeding
    could also be another factor which has contributed to the erosion of the affection between
    mother and child. When mothers breast-feed and cuddle babies in their arms, the tender
    affection between mother and child is much greater and the influence the mother had on the
    child for its well-being, is much more pronounced. Under such circumstances, filial piety,
    family cohesion and obedience are invariably present. These traditional traits are for the
    good and well-being of the child. It is up to the parents, especially the mother, to
    provide them. The mother is responsible for the child's being good or wayward. Mothers can
    reduce delinquency!</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Parental Control</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many parents try to keep their married children under
    their control. They do not give due freedom to them and tend to interfere with a young
    married couple's life. When parents try to control their married son or married daughter
    and want them to follow their way of life strictly, this will create a lot bf
    misunderstanding between the two generations as well as unhappiness between the couple.
    Parents may be doing it in good faith due to love and attachment towards the children, but
    in so doing, they are inviting more problems to themselves and to the children.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Parents must allow their children to shoulder the
    responsibilities of their own lives and families. For example: if some seeds are dropped
    under a tree, plants might grow after sometime. But if you want those plants to grow
    healthy and independent you must transplant them to open ground somewhere else to grow
    separately, so that they are not hampered by the shade of the parent tree.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Parents should not neglect the ancient wisdom based on
    advice given by religious teachers, wise people and elders who have developed a knowledge
    of the world through their own trial and errors.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Divorce</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Divorce is a controversial issue among the followers of
    different religions. Some people believe that marriage is already recorded in heaven, thus
    it is not right to grant a divorce. But, if a husband and wife really cannot live
    together, instead of leading a miserable life and harbouring more jealousy, anger and
    hatred, they should have the liberty to separate and live peacefully.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Responsibility Towards The Children</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">However<b>, </b>the separation of the couple must be done
    in an atmosphere of understanding by adopting reasonable solutions and not by creating
    more hatred. If a couple has children, they should try to make the divorce less traumatic
    for the children and help them to adjust to the new situation. And it is most important to
    ensure that their future and welfare will be taken care of. It is an inhuman attitude if
    the couple desert their children and allow them to lead a miserable life.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddhist View</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Buddhism, there is no law stating that a husband and
    wife should not be separated if they cannot live together harmoniously. But, if people
    follow the advice given by the Buddha to fulfill their duties towards each other, then,
    such unfortunate occurrences like divorce or separation will never happen in the first
    place.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the past, where religious values were highly respected,
    there were greater efforts on the part of married couples - in the east as well as in west
    -to reach an amicable understanding to develop happy relationships based on respect, love,
    and regard for one another. Couples developed and made their marriages an important
    feature which they cherished in their hearts. Divorce cases were very rare, and were
    considered a disgrace because they indicated the selfishness of one party or the other.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is a fact that until recently divorce cases were still
    rather rare in Buddhist countries. This is mainly because couples considered their duties
    and obligations towards each other, and also basically divorce is not approved by the
    community as a whole. In many cases, when married couples were in trouble, the community
    elders usually rallied round and played an important role to improve the situation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Unfortunately, in the modern society of today, divorce has
    become such a common practice. 1n certain countries it has even become fashionable.
    Instead of regarding divorce as shameful or a failure -to order their lives, sortie young
    couples seem to be proud of it. The main cause of the failure in marriage in modern
    society is the abuse of freedom and too much independence and individualism on the- part
    of the partners. There must be a limit to their independent lives, or else both husband
    and wife will go astray very easily.</font></p>

    POLYGAMY OR MONOGAMY</font></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To the question of whether Buddhists can keep more than
    one wife, the direct answer is not available in the Buddha's teaching, because as
    mentioned earlier, the Buddha did not lay down any religious laws with regard to married
    life although he has given valuable advice on how to lead a respectable married life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Tradition, culture and the way of life as recognised by
    the majority of a particular country must also be considered when we practise certain
    things pertaining to our lives. Some religions say that a man can have only one wife
    whilst others say a man can have more than one wife.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although the Buddha did not mention anything regarding the
    number of wives a man could have, he explicitly mentioned in His discourses that should a
    married man go to another woman out of wedlock, that could become the cause of his own
    downfall and he would have to face numerous other problems and disturbances.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha's way of teaching is just to explain the
    situation and the consequences. People can think for themselves as to why certain things
    are good and certain things are bad. The Buddha did not lay down rules about how many
    wives a man should or should not have which people are forced to follow. However, if the
    laws of a country stipulate that marriages must be monogamous, then such laws must be
    complied with, because the Buddha was explicit about His followers respecting the laws of
    a country, if those laws were beneficial to all.</font></p>

    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Family Planning</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some religions are not in favour of family planning.
    Buddhism does not interfere in this personal choice. Man is at liberty to follow any
    method in order to prevent conception. According to Buddhism, certain physical and mental
    conditions must be present for conception to take place. When any one of these conditions
    is absent (like when family planning is being practised), no conception takes place,
    therefore a life does not come into being. But after conception, abortion is <b>NOT</b>
    acceptable in Buddhism because it means taking away a life that is already present in the
    form of foetus.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Test-tube Babies</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people are interested in the moral implication or
    religious attitude with regard to test-tube babies. If a woman is unable to conceive a
    baby in the normal way, and if she is anxious to have a baby by adopting modern medical
    methods, there is no ground in Buddhism to say that it is either immoral or irreligious.
    Religions must give due credit to man's intelligence and to accommodate new medical
    discoveries if they are harmless and beneficial to mankind. As was mentioned earlier, so
    long as the conditions are right, conception can be allowed to take place, naturally or
    artificially.</font></p>

    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><a name="9"></a><font face="Times New Roman">9. MORALITY</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Premarital Sex</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Premarital sex is a problem which is much discussed in
    modern society. Many young people would like to know the opinion regarding this sensitive
    issue. Some religionists say it can be considered as committing adultery, while others say
    it is immoral and unjustifiable.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the past, young boys and girls were not allowed by
    their parents to move around freely until they were married. Their marriages were also
    arranged and organised by the parents. Of course, this did cause unhappiness in some cases
    when parents chose partners on the basis of money, social status, family obligations and
    related issues. But generally, the majority of parents did try very hard to choose
    partners who would be acceptable to their children.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Today, young people are at the liberty to go out and find
    their own partners. They have a lot of freedom and independence in their lives. This is
    not a bad thing in itself, but some of these people are just too young and too immature to
    see the difference between sexual attraction and true compatibility. That is why the
    problem of premarital sex arises.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Too much laxity in matters concerning sex has also given
    rise to social problems in modern society. The sad part is that some societies do not
    express liberal attitudes towards unmarried mothers, illegitimate children and the
    divorcees while they are quite liberal about free sex. As a result, young people are being
    punished by the same society which encourages free mixing of the sexes. They become social
    outcasts and suffer much shame and humiliation. Many young girls have become victims of
    their own freedom and have ruined their future by violating age-old traditions which were
    valued in the east as well as in the west.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Pre-marital sex is a modern development which has come
    about as a result of excessive social freedom prevalent amongst present day young people.
    Whilst Buddhism holds no strong views either for or against such action, it is thought
    that all Buddhists, particularly people of both sexes in love and contemplating marriage,
    should adhere to the age-old traditional concept that they maintain chastity until the
    nuptial date. The human mind is unstable and forever changing with the result that and'
    illicit action or indiscretion may cause undue harm to either party if the legal marriage
    does not take place as expected. It must be remembered that any form of sexual indulgence
    before a proper marriage is solemnised will be looked down upon by the elders who are the
    guardians of the young people.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Sexual Misconduct</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Laymen are advised in the Buddha's Teaching to avoid
    sexual misconduct. That means, if one wants to experience sex, he must do so without
    creating any violence or by using any kind of force, threat, or causing fear. A decent sex
    life which respects the other partner is not against this religion; it accepts the fact
    that it is a necessity for those who are not yet ready to renounce the worldly life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to Buddhism, those who are involved in
    extra-marital sex with someone who is already married, who has been betrothed to someone
    else, and also with those who are under the protection of their parents or guardians are
    said to be guilty of <b>sexual misconduct, </b>because there is a rupture of social norms,
    where a third party is being made to suffer as a result of the selfishness of one or the
    other partner.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Irresponsible Sexual Behaviour</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha<b> </b>also mentioned the consequences that an
    elderly man would have to face if he married without considering the compatibility of age
    of the other party. According to the Buddha, irresponsible sexual behaviour can become the
    cause of one's downfall in many aspects of life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All the nations of the world have clearly defined laws
    concerning the abuse of sex. Here again, Buddhism advocates that a person must respect and
    obey the law of the country if the laws are made for the common good.</font></p>

    THE EAST AND THE WEST</font></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The following are extracts from a book by the celebrated
    Japanese author - Dr. Nikkyo Niwano. In his book <b>&quot;The Richer Life&quot;</b>, Dr<b>.
    </b>Niwano deals with matters relating to love and marriage, both from the Eastern and
    Western points of view.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In the West, marriage on the basis of romantic love
    has often been considered natural and sometimes ideal. In Asia, in recent years, the
    number of young people who abandon the traditional arranged marriage and select partners
    out of romantic consideration has been growing. But in some cases, romantic marriages lead
    to separation and unhappiness within a short time, whereas the arranged marriage often
    produces a couple who live and work together in contentment and happiness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In spite of its emotional appeal, all romantic
    marriages cannot be called unqualified successes. Romantic love is like the bright flame
    of a wood fire that leaps up and burns clear, but lasts only a short time. Love between
    man and wife burns quietly and slowly like the warming fire of burning coal. Of course,
    bright flaming love can - and ideally ought to - eventually become the calm, enduring fire
    of mature affection. But too often the flame of romantic love is quickly extinguished,
    leaving nothing but ashes, which are a poor foundation for a successful married life!</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Young people in love think of nothing but their
    emotions. They see themselves only in the light of the feeling of the moment. Everything
    they think and do is romantic and has little bearing on the practical affairs of the life
    they must lead after marriage. If the lovers are fortunate enough to have compatible
    personalities, to have sound and similar ideas about life, to share interests, to enjoy
    harmonious family relations on both sides and to be financially secure even after the
    first passion has calmed down, they will still have a basis for a good life together. If
    they are not so blessed, they may face marital failure.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When the time of dates, emotional pictures, dances,
    and parties has passed, the young married couples will have to live together, share meals,
    and reveal to each other their defects as well as their merits. They will have to spend
    more than half of their life each day together; this kind of living makes demands that are
    different from the less exacting needs of dating and first love.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Family relations become very important in married
    life. It is necessary to think about the personalities of the mother and father of the
    prospective marriage partner. Young people sometimes think that the strength of their love
    will enable them to get along well with the most quarrelsome, difficult in-laws; but this
    is not always true. In short, romance is a matter of a limited time and does not become
    rooted in actualities and must be regulated to conform to the needs of work and
    environment in order to bind the couple together in lasting devotion. The two kinds of
    love are different. To mistake one for the other invites grave trouble.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Giving serious, dispassionate thought to the nature
    of the person one contemplates marrying, lessens the likelihood of failure. To prevent
    romance from vanishing after marriage, mutual understanding between the couple is
    indispensable. But the percentage of successful marriages is higher among young people
    whose choice of a partner agrees with the opinions of their parents. To live peacefully,
    it is necessary to realize the difference between romance and married love.&quot;</font></p>

    CELIBACY</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What is Celibacy?</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Celibacy is refraining from the pleasure of sexual
    activity. Some critics of Buddhism say that The Teaching goes against Nature and they
    claim that sex life is natural and therefore necessary.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism is not against sex, it is a natural sensual
    pleasure and very much a part of the worldly life. One may ask, why then did the Buddha
    advocate celibacy as a precept? Is it not unfair and against Nature? Well, the observance
    of celibacy for spiritual development was not a new religious precept at the time of the
    Buddha. All the other existing religions in India at that time also had introduced this
    practice. Even today, some other religionists, like the Hindus and Catholics do observe
    this as a vow.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhists who have renounced the worldly life voluntarily
    observe this precept because they are fully aware of the commitments and disturbances
    which come along if one commits oneself to the life of a family person. The married life
    can affect or curtail spiritual development when craving for sex and attachment occupies
    the mind and temptation eclipses the peace and purity of the mind.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Significance of Celibacy</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">People tend to ask, &quot;If the Buddha did not preach
    against married life, why then did He advocate celibacy as one of the important precepts
    to be observed and why did He advise people to avoid sex and renounce the worldly
    life?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One must remember that renunciation is not compulsory in
    Buddhism. It is not obligatory to renounce the worldly life totally in order to practise
    Buddhism. You can adjust your way of life according to your understanding by practising
    certain religious principles and qualities. You can develop your religious principles
    according to the needs of a lay life. However, when you have progressed and attained
    greater wisdom and realise that the layman's way of life is not conducive for the ultimate
    development of <i>SPIRITUAL VIRTUES </i>and <i>PURIFICATION </i>of the <i>MIND</i>, you<i>
    </i>may choose to renounce the worldly life and concentrate more on spiritual development.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha recommended celibacy because sex and marriage
    are not conducive to ultimate peace and purity of the mind, and renunciation is necessary
    if one wishes to gain spiritual development and perfection at the highest level. But this
    renunciation should come naturally, and must never be <i>FORCED. </i>Renunciation should
    come through a complete understanding of the illusory nature of the self, of the
    unsatisfactory nature of all sense pleasures.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Celibacy versus Responsibility - The Buddha's
    Experience</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha experienced his worldly life as a prince,
    husband and a father before his Renunciation and he knew what married life entailed.
    People may question the Buddha's renunciation by saying that he was selfish and cruel and
    that it was not fair for him to desert his wife and child. In actual fact, the Buddha did
    not desert his family without a sense of responsibility.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He never had any misunderstanding with his wife. He too
    had the same love and attachment towards his wife and child as any normal man would have,
    perhaps even greater. The difference was that his love was not mere physical and selfish
    love, he had the courage and understanding to detach that emotional and selfish love for a
    good cause. His sacrifice is considered all the more noble because he set aside his
    personal needs and desires in order to <i>SERVE ALL OF MANKIND FOR ALL TIME.</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The main aim of his renunciation was not only for his own
    happiness, peace or salvation but for the sake of <i>MANKIND. </i>Had he remained in the
    royal palace, his service would have been confined to only his own family or his kingdom.
    That was why he decided to renounce everything in order to maintain peace and purity to
    gain Enlightenment and then to enlighten others who were suffering in ignorance.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the Buddha's earliest tasks after gaining his
    Enlightenment was to return to his palace to enlighten the members of his family. In fact,
    when his young son, Rahula asked the Buddha for his inheritance, the Buddha said that
    Rahula was heir to the richest wealth, the treasure of the Dhamma. In this way, the Buddha
    served his family, and he paved the way for their salvation, peace and happiness.
    Therefore, no one can say that the Buddha was a cruel or selfish father. He was in fact
    more compassionate and self-sacrificing than anybody else. With his high degree of
    spiritual development, the Buddha knew that marriage was a temporary phase while
    Enlightenment was eternal and for the good of <i>ALL MANKIND.</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another important fact was that the Buddha knew that his
    wife and son would not starve in his absence. During the time of the Buddha it was
    considered quite normal and honourable for a young man to retire from the life of a
    householder. Other members of the family would willingly look after his dependents. When
    he gained his enlightenment, he was able to give them something no other father could give
    -the freedom from slavery to attachment.</font></p>

    SUMMARY</font></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Marriage is a partnership of two individuals and this
    partnership is enriched and enhanced when it allows the personalities involved to grow.
    Many marriages fail because one partner tries to &quot;swallow&quot; another or when one
    demands total freedom. According to Buddhism, marriage means understanding and respecting
    each other's belief and privacy. A successful marriage is always a two-way path:
    &quot;humpy, bumpy&quot;, it is difficult but it is always a mutual path.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Young people in this country and elsewhere sometimes think
    that &quot;old fashioned ideas&quot; are not relevant to modern society. They should be
    reminded that there are some eternal truths which can never become out-of-date. What was
    true during the time of Buddha still remains true today.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The so-called modern ideas we receive through the highly
    glamourous television programmes do not represent the way most decent people in the west
    think or behave. There is a vast &quot;silent majority&quot; of decent couples who are as
    deeply religious and &quot;conservative&quot; about marriage as any Eastern couple. They
    do not behave in the manner that the mass media has portrayed them. Not all the people in
    the west run off to get a divorce or abortion after their first quarrel or dispute.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Decent people all over the world are the same; they are
    unselfish and care deeply about those whom they love. They make enormous sacrifices and
    develop love and understanding to ensure happy and stable marriages. So, if you want to
    ape the west ape the &quot;silent majority&quot;: they are no different from your decent
    neighbour who lives next door to you.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Young people must also listen to their elders because
    their own understanding about married life is not mature. They should not make hasty
    conclusions regarding marriages and divorces. They must have a lot of patience, tolerance
    and mutual understanding. Otherwise, their life can become very miserable and problematic.
    <i>PATIENCE, TOLERANCE AND UNDERSTANDING</i> are important disciplines to be observed and
    practised by all people in marriage.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A feeling of security and contentment comes from mutual
    understanding which is the <i>SECRET</i> of a <i>HAPPY MARRIED LIFE</i>.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Social and Moral Code</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The most important element of the Buddhist reform has
    always been its social and moral code. That moral code taken by itself is one of the most
    perfect which the world has ever known. On this point all testimonials from hostile and
    friendly quarters agree; philosophers there may have been, religious preachers, subtle
    metaphysicists, disputants there may have been, but where shall we find such an
    incarnation of love, love that knows no distinction of caste and creed or colour, a love
    that overflowed even the bounds of humanity, that embraced the whole of sentient beings in
    its sweep, a love that embodied as the gospel of universal <i>'Maitri' </i>and <i>'Ahimsa'.
    - (Prof. Max Muller, A German Buddhist Scholar)</i></font><b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. Morality is based on freedom</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhist morality is based on freedom, i.e. on individual
    development. It is therefore relative. In fact there cannot be any ethical principle if
    there is compulsion or determination from an agent outside ourselves. - <i>(Anagarika B.
    Govinda, A German Buddhist Scholar)</i></font><b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. Knowledge and Morality</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Buddhism there can be no real morality without
    knowledge, no real knowledge without morality; both are bound up together like heat and
    light in a flame. What constitutes <i>'Bodhi</i>' is<i> </i>-not mere intellectual,
    enlightenment, but humanity. The consciousness of moral excellence is of the very essence
    of <i>'Bodhi'. -- (Bhikkhu Dhammapla, A Netherlands Buddhist Scholar)</i></font></p>
