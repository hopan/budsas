    different kinds of cittas arising in our daily life experience objects through the five
    sense-doors and through the mind-door. We see, hear, receive impressions through the other
    doors and think about these objects. Both in the sense-door process and in the mind-door
    process of cittas there are javana-cittas which are in the case of the non-arahat either
    kusala cittas or akusala cittas. The javana-cittas are most of the time akusala cittas
    because we cling to all the objects which are experienced through the sense-doors and
    through the mind-door. We cling to visible object and seeing, to sound and hearing, to all
    the objects we experience. We cling to life we want to go on living and receiving
    sense-impressions. We may not notice when there is clinging after the seeing or hearing,
    especially when we do not feel particularly glad about what was seen or heard. But there
    may be lobha-mula-cittas with indifferent feeling. There are likely to be many moments of
    clinging which pass unnoticed, both in the sense-door processes and in the mind-door
    processes. Time and again an object is experienced through a sense-door and then through
    the mind-door and there are also mind-door processes of cittas which think of concepts
    such as people, animals or things. Clinging to concepts is likely to arise very often and
    thus we think most of the time with akusala citta. When we do not apply ourselves to dana,
    sila or bhavana, thinking is done with akusala citta. Even when we perform good deeds
    there are bound to be akusala cittas shortly after the kusala cittas since there is seeing
    and hearing time and again and after the seeing or hearing attachment or aversion on
    account of what we experience may arise. The kusala cittas and akusala cittas, all the
    cittas which arise in our daily life are of the 'sensuous plane of consciousness' or
    kamavacara cittas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Cittas which experience sense-impressions are bound up
    with defilements and therefore wise people, even those who lived before the Buddha's time,
    who saw the disadvantages of sense-impressions, developed jhana in order to be temporarily
    freed from sense-impressions. Jhanacittas are not kamavacara cittas, they are of another
    plane of consciousness; these cittas experience with absorption a meditation subject
    through the mind-door. At the moment of jhana one is freed from sense-impressions and from
    the defilements which are bound up with them. Jhanacittas comprise rupavacara cittas
    (rupa-jhanacittas) and arupavacara cittas (arupa-jhanacittas). Arupa-jhana is more refined
    than rupa-jhana, since the meditation subjects of a rupa- jhana are no longer dependent on
    materiality. Later on I will deal with their differences. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Apart from the planes of citta which are kamavacara
    cittas, rupavacara cittas and arupavacara cittas, there is still another plane of citta:
    the lokuttara cittas (translated as supramundane cittas) which have nibbana as their
    object. Those who attain enlightenment have lokuttara cittas, experiencing nibbana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As regards jhanacitta, jhanacittas do not have as their
    object, visible object, sound, or any other sense- impression. Jhanacittas arise in a
    process of cittas experiencing a meditation subject through the mind-door. In this process
    there are first kamavacara cittas which experience the meditation subject and then, in
    that same process, the jhanacitta arises. The process is as follows: </font></p>

        attains jhana) </font></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </center></div><p><font face="Times New Roman">For some, 'parikamma' (preparatory
    consciousness) is not necessary, and in this case there are, after the
    mind-door-adverting-consciousness, only three kamavacara cittas arising, instead of four,
    before the jhanacitta arises. Gotrabhu (which 'overcomes' the sense-sphere) is the last
    citta in that process which is kamavacara citta. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the 'Visuddhimagga' (IV, 74) we can read about the
    process of cittas in which jhana occurs for the first time. The 'Visuddhimagga' (IV, 78)
    states that only one single moment of jhanacitta arises, which is then succeeded by the
    bhavanga-citta (life-continuum). After that there is a process of kamavacara cittas,
    reviewing, through the mind-door, the jhana which has just occurred. Further on (IV, 123
    ff. ) we read that absorption can 'last' only when it is absolutely purified of states
    which obstruct concentration. One must first completely suppress lust by reviewing the
    dangers of sense desires and also suppress the other 'hindrances'. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Jhanacittas are kusala kamma of a high degree. When jhana
    has been attained the hindrances of sensuous desire, ill-will, sloth and torpor,
    restlessness and worry, and doubt are temporarily eliminated. Thus one is truly calm, at
    least at that moment. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As we have seen in the preceding chapter, the person who
    wants to cultivate samatha so as to be able to attain jhana, has to develop the five
    jhana-factors, which can inhibit the hindrances, namely: applied thinking (vitakka),
    sustained thinking (vicara), rapture (piti), happy feeling (sukha), concentration
    (samadhi). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Jhana is developed in stages, with each succeeding stage
    being more refined than the preceding one. There are five stages of rupa-jhana in all. For
    the first stage of rupa-jhana it is still necessary that all five jhana- factors arise
    with the jhanacitta, but at each higher stage, when one has become more advanced, jhana-
    factors are successively abandoned. When one attains to the rupa-jhana of the second
    stage, one does not need the jhana-factor which is 'applied thinking' (vitakka). At this
    point the jhanacitta can experience the meditation subject without vitakka (which has the
    characteristic of directing the mind unto an object and the function of 'touching' the
    object). The other jhana-factors still arise with the jhanacitta of the second stage. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the third stage of jhana 'sustained thinking' (vicara)
    is abandoned. At this stage one does not need vitakka or vicara any longer in order to
    become absorbed in the meditation subject. Now there are three factors remaining: rapture
    (piti), happy feeling (sukha) and concentration (samadhi). At the fourth stage rapture
    (piti) is abandoned. There is still happy feeling accompanying the jhana-citta, but piti
    does not arise. Without piti, the jhanacitta is more quiet, more refined. At the fifth
    stage happy feeling (sukha) too is abandoned and there is neutral feeling (upekkha vedana)
    accompanying the jhanacitta instead of happy feeling. At this stage one is no longer
    attached to happy feeling. The jhana-factor which is concentration (samadhi) remains. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people can, at the second stage of jhana, abandon
    both 'applied thinking' and 'sustained thinking' (vitakka and vicara). Consequently, they
    can, in the third stage, abandon rapture (piti) and in the fourth stage happy feeling
    (sukha). Thus for them there are only four stages of jhana instead of five. That is the
    reason why rupa-jhanas can be counted as four stages or as five stages (the fourfold
    system or the fivefold system). When we read in the suttas about four stages of jhana, the
    fourfold system is referred to. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There can be up to five stages of rupa-jhana in all and
    thus there are five types of rupavacara kusala cittas (rupa-jhana kusala cittas).
    Jhanacitta is kusala kamma of a high degree and thus its result is kusala vipaka of a high
    degree. Jhanacittas do not produce vipaka in the same lifespan: their result is rebirth in
    higher planes of existence: rebirth in rupa-brahma planes. If rupavacara kusala citta is
    to produce the next rebirth, there are rupavacara kusala cittas arising shortly before the
    dying-consciousness. The patisandhi-citta of the next life is rupavacara vipakacitta which
    arises in the appropriate rupa-brahma plane. It experiences the same meditation subject as
    the rupavacara kusala cittas arising shortly before the dying-consciousness of the
    preceding life. The five types of rupavacara kusala cittas produce five types of
    rupavacara vipakacittas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Rupavacara vipakacitta can only perform the function of
    patisandhi, bhavanga and cuti. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are five types of rupavacara kiriyacittas which are
    the cittas of the arahats who attain rupa-jhana. They do not have kusala cittas but
    kiriyacittas instead. Thus there are fifteen rupavacara cittas in all. Summarizing them,
    they are: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">5 rupavacara kusala cittas <br>
      5 rupavacara vipakacittas <br>
      5 rupavacara kiriyacittas</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who have attained to the highest stage of rupa-jhana
    and see the disadvantages of rupa-jhana which is still dependent on materiality, might
    want to cultivate arupa-jhana or 'immaterial jhana'. There are four stages of arupa-jhana.
    The first stage of arupa-jhana is the 'Sphere of Boundless Space' (akasanancayatana). In
    order to attain this stage of arupa-jhana one has to attain first the highest stage of
    rupa-jhana in any one of the kasina meditations (The kasina meditations are among the
    meditation subjects of rupa-jhana. They are, for example, coloured disks or a piece of
    earth.) excepting the 'kasina of limited space' and achieve mastery in it. We read in the
    'Visuddhimagga' (X, 6): </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he has seen the danger in that [fine-material fourth
      jhana (The fourth rupa-jhana. Here the counting is according to the 'fourfold system.')]
      in this way and has ended his attachment to it, he gives attention to the 'Base consisting
      of Boundless Space' as peaceful. Then, when he has spread out the kasina to the limit of
      the world-sphere, or as far as he likes, he removes the kasina (materiality) by giving his
      attention to the space touched by it, (regarding that) as 'space' or 'boundless space'.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As regards the 'Sphere of Boundless Space', the
    'Visuddhimagga' (X, 6) explains the 'removing' of the kasina: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And when the kasina is being removed, it does not roll up
      or roll away. It is simply that it is called 'removed' on account of his non-attention to
      it, his attention being given to 'space, space'. This is conceptualized as the mere space
      left by the removal of the kasina (materiality) ...</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this way he can surmount the materiality of the kasina
    and attain the first arupa-jhana, the Sphere of Boundless Space'. The second stage of
    arupa-jhana is: the 'Sphere of Boundless Consciousness' (vinnanancayatana). The meditation
    subject of this stage of arupa-jhana is the consciousness which is the first arupa-jhana.
    The person who wants to attain this stage of arupa-jhana should first achieve 'mastery' in
    the 'Sphere of Boundless Space'; he should see the disadvantages of this stage and end his
    attachment to it. We read in the 'Visuddhimagga' (X, 25): </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">...So having ended his attachment to that, he should give
      his attention to the base consisting of boundless consciousness as peaceful, adverting
      again and again as 'Consciousness, consciousness', to the consciousness that occurred
      pervading that space (as its object)...</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third stage of arupa-jhana is the 'Sphere of
    Nothingness' (akincannayatana). We read in the 'Visuddhimagga' (X, 32) that the person who
    wants to attain this stage should give his attention to the present non-existence of the
    past consciousness which pervaded the 'boundless space' and which was the object of the
    second stage of arupa-jhana, the 'Sphere of Boundless Consciousness'. We read (X, 33): </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Without giving further attention to that consciousness, he
      should (now) advert again and again in this way 'There is not, there is not', or 'Void,
      void', or 'Secluded, secluded', and give his attention to it, review it, and strike at it
      with thought and applied thought.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Further on (X, 35) we read: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">...he dwells seeing only its non-existence, in other words
      its departedness when this consciousness has arisen in absorption.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fourth arupa-jhana is the 'Sphere of Neither
    Perception Nor Non-Perception' (n'eva-sanna-n'asannayatana). The object of this jhana is
    the third stage of arupa-jhana. We read in the 'Visuddhimagga' (X, 49): </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The word meaning here is this: that jhana with its
      associated states neither has perception nor has no perception because of the absence of
      gross perception and presence of subtle perception, thus it is 'neither perception nor
      non-perception' (n'eva-sanna-n'asannam).</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Further on (X, 50) we read: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">...Or alternatively: the perception here is neither
      perception, since it is incapable of performing the decisive function of perception, nor
      yet non-perception, since it is present in a subtle state as a residual formation, thus it
      is 'neither-perception-nor-non-perception'...</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is also explained that the feeling arising with this
    jhana-citta is 'neither-feeling-nor-non-feeling' (since it is present in a subtle state as
    a residual formation); the same applies to consciousness, contact (phassa) and the other
    cetasikas arising with the jhanacitta. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since there are four stages of arupa-jhana, there are four
    types of arupavacara kusala cittas. They produce vipaka in the form of rebirth in the
    happy planes of existence which are the arupa-brahma planes. The four types of arupavacara
    kusala cittas produce four types of arupavacara vipakacittas. Arupavacara vipakacitta can
    only perform the functions of patisandhi, bhavanga and cuti. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are four types of arupavacara kiriyacittas which are
    the cittas of the arahats who attain arupa-jhana. Thus, there are twelve arupavacara
    cittas in all. Summarizing them, they are: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">4 arupavacara kusalacittas <br>
      4 arupavacara vipakacittas <br>
      4 arupavacara kiriyacittas</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who have cultivated jhana can develop the various
    types of 'direct knowledge' (abhinna; Also translated as 'supernormal powers' or 'higher
    intellectual powers'.). They should attain the highest stage of rupa-jhana (the fourth or
    the fifth, according as to whether they follow the fourfold system or the fivefold system)
    in the kasina meditations, and they should exercise 'complete mind-control in fourteen
    ways'; for example, the attainment of the jhana stages in the different kasina meditations
    in order and in reverse order. In developing the 'kinds of direct knowledge' or
    'supernormal powers', one's concentration will become more advanced. The 'supernormal
    powers' (abhinna) are the following: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Magical powers such as passing through walls, walking
      on water, travelling through the air. <br>
      2. Divine Ear, by which one hears sounds both heavenly and human,far and near. <br>
      3. Knowledge of the minds of other people. <br>
      4. Divine Eye, by which one sees the deceasing and rebirth of beings. <br>
      5. Remembrance of one's former lives.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These are the five 'mundane supernormal powers'. However,
    there is a sixth power, which is a Iokuttara citta, namely, the eradication of all
    defilements, when arahatship is attained. The sixth power is the greatest and in order to
    attain it insight has to be fully developed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes three kinds of knowledge are mentioned, namely: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Remembrance of former lives. <br>
      2. Heavenly Eye. <br>
      3. Destruction of the the Asavas.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who have cultivated the right conditions, can
    achieve 'marvels'. In the 'Gradual Sayings' (Book of the Threes, Ch. VI, par. 60, III,
    Sangarava) we read about the greatest 'marvel'. The Budda asked the brahmin Sangarava
    about the topic of conversation of the royal party, when they were together in the palace.
    The brahmin Sangarava answered that they were talking about the fact that in former times
    the monks were fewer in number, but those possessed of supernormal powers were more
    numerous, and that now it was just the opposite. The Buddha said to him: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Now as to that, brahmin, there are these three marvels.
      What three? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The marvel of more-power, the marvel of thought- reading,
      the marvel of teaching. And what, brahmin, is the marvel of more-power? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this case a certain one enjoys sorts of more-power in
      divers ways. From being one he becomes many, from being many he becomes one; manifest or
      invisible he goes unhindered through a wall, through a rampart, through a mountain, as if
      through the air; he plunges into the earth and shoots up again as if in water; he walks
      upon the water without parting it as if on solid ground; he travels through the air
      sitting cross-legged, like a bird upon the wing; even this moon and sun, though of such
      mighty power and majesty,-- he handles them and strokes them with his hand; even as far as
      the Brahma world he has power with his body. This, brahmin, is called 'the marvel of
      more-power.'</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And what, brahmin, is the marvel of thought-reading? In
      this case a certain one can declare by means of a sign 'Thus is your mind. Such and such
      is your mind. Thus is your consciousness...' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And what, brahmin, is the marvel of teaching? In this case
      a certain one teaches thus: 'Reason thus, not thus. Apply your mind thus, not thus.
      Abandon this state, acquire that state and abide therein.' This, brahmin, is called 'the
      marvel of teaching'. So these are the three marvels. Now of these three marvels, which
      appeals to you as the more wonderful and excellent?'</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Of these marvels, master Gotama, the marvel of
      more-power...seems to me to be of the nature of an illusion. Then again as to the marvel
      of thought- reading... this also, master Gotama, seems to me of the nature of an illusion.
      But as to the marvel of teaching... of these three marvels this one appeals to me as the
      more wonderful and excellent.'</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sangarava then asked the Buddha whether he possessed all
    three marvels and the Buddha told him that he did. Sangarava also asked whether any other
    monk possessed them and the Buddha answered: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Yes, indeed, brahmin. The monks possessed of these three
      marvellous powers are not just one or two or three, four, or five hundred, but much more
      than that in number.'</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sangarava then expressed his confidence in taking refuge
    in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, and he asked to be accepted as a lay-follower. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Buddha's time many monks had cultivated conditions
    for 'marvellous powers'. The greatest 'marvel' of these, however, is the 'marvel of
    teaching' since it can lead to the eradication of all defilements, to the end of all
    sorrows. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For those who have accumulations for jhana there are many
    benefits since jhana is kusala kamma of a high degree. One of the benefits is a happy
    rebirth, even for those who can attain only &quot;access-concentration' or upacara
    samadhi. However, even rebirth in a happy plane of existence is dukkha, since life in a
    happy plane may be followed by rebirth in an unhappy plane. Therefore, no birth at all is
    to be preferred to any kind of rebirth. This can be realized only by developing the wisdom
    which eradicates defilements. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Jhana is called in the teachings an 'abiding in ease,
    here, now' (for example, 'Discourse on Expunging', Middle Length Sayings I, No. 8). Those
    who are advanced in the development of calm can have many jhanacittas in succession, since
    they have cultivated conditions for this. They truly are 'abiding in ease, here, now'.
    However, the Buddha would point out that 'abiding in ease' is not the same as 'expunging'
    (eradication). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We read in the 'Discourse on Expunging' that the Buddha
    said to Cunda in regard to the monk who could attain rupa-jhana: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">...It may occur to him: 'I fare along by expunging'. But
      these, Cunda, are not called expungings in the discipline for an ariyan. These are called
      'abidings in ease, here, now' in the discipline for an ariyan.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">With regard to the monk who could attain arupa-jhuna, the
    Buddha said: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">...It may occur to him: 'I fare along by expunging'. But
      these, Cunda, are not called 'expungings' in the discipline for an ariyan; these are
      called 'abidings that are peaceful' in the discipline for an ariyan...</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who have accumulated skill for jhana and have
    developed vipassana can attain enlightenment with absorption. Instead of a meditation
    subject of samatha, nibbana is the object which is experienced with absorption. Lokuttara
    cittas can be accompanied by jhana-factors of different stages of jhana according to one's
    accumulations. In the process during which enlightenment is attained the magga-citta is
    immediately followed by the phala-citta (result of magga-citta). When the phalacittas have
    fallen away the process of cittas is over. The magga-citta of that stage of enlightenment
    cannot arise again, but the phala-citta can arise again, even many times in life, and it
    experiences nibbana with absorption. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who have attained the fourth stage of arupa-jhana,
    the 'Sphere of Neither Perception Nor Non-Perception' and have also realized the stage of
    enlightenment of the anagami or of the arahat, can attain 'cessation' (nirodha-samapatti)
    which is the temporary ceasing of bodily and mental activities. The person who has
    attained 'cessation' ('the stopping of perception and feeling') is different from a
    corpse. We read in the 'Greater Discourse of the Miscellany' (Middle Length Sayings I, No.
    43) that Maha-kotthita asked Sariputta a number of questions. He also asked questions
    about the difference between the dead body and the monk who has attained cessation. We
    read that Maha-kotthita asked: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'In regard to this body, Your reverence, when how many
      things are got rid of, does this body lie cast away, flung aside like unto a senseless log
      of wood?' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'In regard to this body, Your reverence, when three things
      are got rid of: vitality, heat and consciousness, then does this body lie cast away, flung
      aside like unto a senseless log of wood.' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'What is the difference, your reverence, between that dead
      thing, passed away, and that monk who has attained to the stopping of perception and
      feeling?' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Your reverence, the bodily activities of that dead thing,
      passed away, have been stopped, have subsided, the mental activities have been stopped,
      have subsided, the vitality is entirely destroyed, the heat allayed, the sense-organs are
      entirely broken asunder. But that monk who has attained to the stopping of perception and
      feeling, although his bodily activities have been stopped, have subsided, although his
      vocal activities have been stopped, have subsided, although his mental activities have
      been stopped, have subsided, his vitality is not entirely destroyed, his heat is not
      allayed, his sense- organs are purified. This, your reverence, is the difference between a
      dead thing, passed away, and that monk who has attained to the stopping of perception and
      feeling.'</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For those who emerge from cessation, the first citta which
    arises is a phala-citta (lokuttara vipakacitta), having nibbana as its object. In the case
    of the anagami it is the phala-citta of the anagami and in the case of the arahat it is
    the phala-citta of the arahat. The 'Visuddhimagga' (XXIII, 50) states that their minds
    tend towards nibbana. We read: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Towards what does the mind of one who has emerged tend? It
      tends towards nibbana. For this is said: 'When a bhikkhu has emerged from the attainment
      of the cessation of perception and feeling, friend Visakha, his consciousness inclines to
      seclusion, leans to seclusion, tends to seclusion.' (Middle Length Sayings 1,302).</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the 'Lesser Discourse in Gosiriga' (Middle Length
    Sayings I, No. 31) we read that the Buddha came to see Anuruddha, Nandiya and Kimbila when
    they were staying in the Gosinga sal-wood. The Buddha asked them about their life in the
    forest. They could attain all stages of rupa-jhana and arupa-jhana and they could 'abide'
    in them for as long as they liked. The Buddha said: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'It is good, Anuruddha , it is good. But did you,
      Anuruddha , by passing quite beyond this abiding, by allaying this abiding, reach another
      state of further-men, an excellent knowledge and vision befitting the ariyans, an abiding
      in comfort?' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'How could this not be, Lord? Here we, Lord, for as long
      as we like, by passing quite beyond the plane of neither perception-nor-non-perception,
      entering on the stopping of perception and feeling, abide in it, and having seen through
      intuitive wisdom, our cankers come to be utterly destroyed. By passing quite beyond that
      abiding, Lord, by allaying that abiding, another state of further-men, an excellent
      knowledge and vision befitting the ariyans, an abiding in comfort is reached. But we,
      Lord, do not behold another abiding in comfort that is higher or more excellent than this
      abiding in comfort,' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'It is good, Anuruddha, it is good. There is no other
      abiding in comfort that is higher or more excellent than this abiding in comfort.'</font></p>
