    IN THE SENSE-DOOR PROCESS<br>
    AND IN THE MIND-DOOR PROCESS</font> </font></h2>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-ooOoo- </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">E</font><font face="Times New Roman">ach citta
    has its own function to perform ; no citta arises without performing a function. For
    example, seeing and hearing are functions performed by citta. We are not used to
    considering seeing and hearing as functions, because we cling to a self. If we want to
    know more about cittas we should learn about their different functions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first function is the function of patisandhi which is
    the function of the first citta in life. The second function is bhavanga. The
    bhavanga-citta keeps the continuity in a lifespan. As long as one is still alive
    bhavanga-cittas arise and fall away during the time there is no sense-door process or
    mind-door process of cittas. Bhavanga-cittas arise in between the different processes of
    cittas which experience an object through one of the six doors. For example, when there is
    seeing and after that thinking about what was seen, there are different processes of citta
    and there have to be bhavanga-cittas in between the different processes. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When a rupa impinges on one of the senses the current of
    bhavanga-cittas is interrupted; there are a few more bhavanga-cittas arising and falling
    away, and then the panca-dvaravajjana-citta (five-sense-door-adverting-consciousness)
    arises. The panca-dvaravajjana-citta is the first citta of the process of cittas
    experiencing the rupa which has come into contact with one of the senses. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The panca-dvaravajjana-citta performs the function of
    avajjana or adverting to the object which impinges on one of the five senses; it adverts
    to the object through that sense-door. The panca-dvaravajjana-citta is an ahetuka
    kiriyacitta. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The 'Visuddhimagga' (XIV, 107) states concerning the
    panca-dvaravajjana-citta (mind-element) : </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Herein, the mind-element has the characteristic of being
        the forerunner of eye-consciousness, etc., and cognizing visible data, and so on. Its
        function is to advert. It is manifested as confrontation of visible data, and so on. Its
        proximate cause is the interruption of (the continued occurrence of consciousness as)
        life-continuum (bhavanga). It is associated with equanimity (upekkha) only.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The panca-dvaravajjana-citta is the 'forerunner' because
    it arises before panca-vinnana (seeing, hearing, etc.). When it adverts to an object which
    has contacted the eye-sense, it adverts through the eye-door and it is
    eye-door-adverting-consciousness (cakkhudvaravajjana-citta). When it adverts to an object
    which has contacted the ear-sense it is ear-door-adverting-consciousness
    (sota-dvaravajjana-citta). The panca-dvaravajjana-citta is named after the sense-door
    through which it adverts to the object. The panca-dvaravajjana-citta arises countless
    times a day, but we do not notice it. Whenever there is seeing, the
    eye-door-adverting-consciousness (cakkhu-dvaravajjana-citta) has adverted already to the
    visible object which has impinged on the eye-sense, and it has fallen away already.
    Whenever there is hearing or any one of the other panca-vinnanas, the
    panca-dvaravajjana-citta has adverted to the object already and it has fallen away
    already. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The panca-dvaravajjana-citta is succeeded by the other
    cittas of the sense-door process which experience that same object. When that process is
    over, the object is experienced through the mind-door. First there are bhavanga-cittas and
    then the mano-dvaravajjana-citta (mind-door-adverting-consciousness) performs the function
    of avajjana (adverting) through the mind-door. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus there are two kinds of citta which perform the
    function of adverting (avajjana-kicca): the panca-dvaravajjana-citta adverts to the object
    through one of the five sense-doors and the mano-dvaravajjana-citta adverts to the object
    through the mind-door. The mano-dvaravajjana-citta is an ahetuka kiriyacitta ; it is not
    accompanied by unwholesome roots (akusala hetus) or by beautiful roots (sobhana hetus).
    After it has adverted to the object it is followed by kusala cittas or by akusala cittas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When visible object contacts the eye-sense the
    eye-door-adverting-consciousness (cakkhu-dvaravajjana-citta) adverts to visible object
    through the eye-door. When the cakkhu-dvaravajjana-citta has fallen away it is succeeded
    by seeing-consciousness (cakkhu-vinnana). The function of seeing (in Pali : dassana-kicca)
    is performed by seeing-consciousness (cakkhu-vinnana). Seeing is vipaka: it is the result
    of kusala kamma or akusala kamma. We are born in order to receive the results of our deeds
    and therefore the current of bhavanga-cittas is interrupted and vipakacittas arise after
    the panca-dvaravajjana-citta. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The citta which performs the function of seeing
    (dassana-kicca) only sees visible object. This citta does not like or dislike, it is an
    ahetuka vipakacitta. Neither does it think about the object. If one does not develop right
    understanding one does not realize that the citta which only sees visible object is a
    reality different from the citta which likes or disllikes the visible object and different
    from the citta which pays attention to shape and form. Because of our accumulated
    ignorance and wrong view we do not realize the impermanence of citta which falls away as
    soon as it has arisen and which is succeeded by another citta which is a different
    reality. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are only two kinds of citta which can perform the
    function of seeing: one is akusala vipaka and one is kusala vipaka. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When sound has impinged on the ear-sense and the
    ear-door-adverting-consciousness (sota-dvaravajjana-citta) has arisen and fallen away,
    hearing-consciousness arises. The function of hearing (in Pali: savana-kicca) is another
    function of citta. Hearing is ahetuka vipaka. Two kinds of citta can perform the function
    of hearing: one is akusala vipaka and one is kusala vipaka. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another function of citta is the function of smelling (in
    Pali: ghayana-kicca). Two cittas which are both ahetuka can perform this function : one is
    akusala vipaka and one is kusala vipaka. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are two kinds of ahetuka citta which can perform the
    function of tasting (in Pali: sayana-kicca) : one is akusala vipaka and one is kusala
    vipaka. When the citta which performs this function tastes, for example, a sweet or salty
    flavour, it merely experiences that taste; it does not know the name of the taste. The
    cittas which know the conventional name of the taste arise later on. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The function of experiencing impressions through the
    body-sense (in Pali: phusana-kicca) is another function of citta. When an object contacts
    the body-sense, the panca-dvaravajjana-citta adverts to the object through the doorway of
    the body-sense. It is succeeded by body-consciousness (kaya-vinnana) which performs the
    function of experiencing an impression through the body-sense. Two kinds of citta which
    are both ahetuka can perform this function: one is akusala vipaka and one is kusala
    vipaka. The objects experienced by kaya-vinnana are the rupas which are: solidity
    (experienced as hardness or softness), temperature (experienced as heat or cold), motion
    (experienced as motion or pressure). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, summarizing the functions performed by the cittas
    which are the panca-vinnanas, they are: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">the function of seeing (dassana-kicca) <br>
      the function of hearing (savana-kicca) <br>
      the function of smelling (ghayana-kicca) <br>
      the function of tasting (sayana-kicca) <br>
      the function of experiencing bodily impressions (phusana kicca)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and experiencing bodily
    impressions are different functions, not performed by a self, but by citta. These cittas
    arise because of their own appropriate conditions. In order to remind people of this
    truth, the Buddha often explained how cittas experience objects through the five senses
    and through the mind-door. He would point out the different conditions through which
    cittas arise and the impermanence of these conditions. Since the conditions through which
    cittas arise are impermanent, cittas cannot be permanent. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We read in the 'Kindred Sayings' (IV, Salatana-vagga,
    Kindred Sayings on Sense, First Fifty, Ch. IV, par. 93, Duality II) that the Buddha said
    to the monks. </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Owing to a dual (thing), monks, consciousness comes into
      being. And what, monks, is that dual owing to which consciousness comes into being? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Owing to the eye and objects arises eye-consciousness. The
      eye is impermanent, changing, its state is 'becoming otherness'. So also are objects. Thus
      this dual, mobile and transitory, impermanent, changing,- - its state is 'becoming
      otherness'. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Eye-consciousness is impermanent, changing, its state is
      'becoming otherness'. This eye-consciousness, arising as it does from an impermanent
      relation, how could it be permanent? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now the striking together, the falling together, tile
      meeting together of these three things (That is: eye, visible object and
      eye-consciousness.), this, monks, is called 'eye-contact'. Eye-contact is impermanent,
      changing, its state is 'becoming otherness'. That condition, that relation of the uprising
      of eye-contact, they also are impermanent... This eye-contact, arising as it does from an
      impermanent relation, how could it be permanent? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Contacted, monks, one feels. Contacted, one is aware.
      Contacted, one perceives. Thus these states also are mobile and transitory, impermanent
      and changing. Their state is 'becoming otherness'... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The same is said with regard to the other doorways.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the process of citta, the panca-vinnana is succeeded by
    sampaticchana-citta. This citta, which performs the function of sampaticchana (receiving
    the object), receives the object after the panca-vinnana has fallen away.
    Sampaticchana-citta is ahetuka vipaka. Two kinds of citta can perform this function: one
    is akusala vipaka and one is kusala vipaka. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kamma does not only produce the dvi-panca-vinnanas (the
    five pairs) and sampaticchana-citta, it also produces santirana-citta
    (investigating-consciousness) which succeeds sampaticchana-citta. Santirana-citta performs
    in the sense-door process the function of santirana (investigating the object) ; it is
    ahetuka vipakacitta. . </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As we have seen (Ch. 9), there are three kinds of
    santirana-citta which can perform the function of investigating: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Santirana-citta which is akusala vipaka, accompanied by
      upekkha. <br>
      2. Santirana-citta which is kusala vipaka, accompanied by upekkha. <br>
      3. Santirana-citta which is kusala vipaka, accompanied by somanassa (in case the object is
      extraordinarily pleasant). </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Santirana-citta is succeeded by votthapana-citta
    (determining-consciousness). Votthapana is another function of citta; the votthapana-citta
    determines the object in the sense-door process. After it has determined the object it is
    succeeded by kusala cittas or by akusala cittas. The conditions through which it arises
    are different from the conditions for santirana-citta which is produced by kamma.
    Votthapana-citta is not vipaka and it is not kusala or akusala but it is an ahetuka
    kiriyacitta. As we have seen, the votthapana-citta is actually the mano-dvaravajjana-citta
    which performs the function of votthapana in the sense-door process and is then called
    votthapana-citta. The mano-dvaravajjana-citta performs two function in the mind-door
    process it performs the function of adverting to an object through the mind-door, and in
    the sense-door process it performs the function of votthapana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we do not know about the cittas arising in processes
    and their different conditions we may think that there is a 'self' who decides at certain
    moments to do good deeds or bad deeds. In reality there is no person, no 'self' who
    decides, but there are cittas which are conditioned by accumulations of kusala and
    akusala. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Cittas experience pleasant or unpleasant objects through
    the senses and through the mind-door. If someone has accumulated a great deal of lobha and
    dosa, lobha-mula-cittas are likely to arise when the object is pleasant and
    dosa-mula-cittas are likely to arise when the object is unpleasant. These cittas arise
    because of conditions, they are not self, they are beyond control. However, through the
    study of Dhamma and above all through the development of 'insight' there can be conditions
    for kusala cittas and then there is 'wise attention' (yoniso manasikara) to the object. No
    matter whether the object is pleasant or unpleasant, in the sense-door process the
    votthapana-citta can be succeeded by kusala cittas and in the mind-door, process the
    mano-dvaravajjana-citta can, after it has adverted to the object, be succeeded by kusala
    cittas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We are inclined to think that in the process of cittas,
    akusala vipakacittas which experience an unpleasant object should necessarily be followed
    by akusala cittas, since we let ourselves be ruled by the objects we experience. However,
    if there is 'wise attention' there is no aversion towards unpleasant objects. Kusala
    cittas and akusala cittas arise because of conditions which are entirely different form
    the conditions for vipakacittas. Akusala vipaka and kusala vipaka are the result of kamma.
    We wish to control our vipaka, but this is impossible. When it is time for akusala vipaka,
    we cannot prevent it from arising. We should realize that our life is nama and rupa, which
    arise because of condition and fall away immediately. If we would only realize that vipaka
    is but a moment of citta which falls away as soon as it has arisen, we would be less
    likely to have aversion towards unpleasant objects we experience. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One may wonder whether it is necessary to know in detail
    about cittas and their functions. Is it not enough to know only about kusala cittas and
    akusala cittas? Apart from kusala cittas and akusala cittas we should know also about
    other kinds of cittas which perform different functions in the processes of cittas and
    which arise because of different conditions. Then there will be more understanding of the
    fact that there is no self which can direct the arising of particular cittas at particular
    moments. There is no self which can decide for kusala cittas. People have different
    accumulation and thus, when an object presents itselt, there will, in the process of
    cittas which experience it, be the arising of kusala cittas or akusala cittas, according
    to one's accumulations. When, for example, different people smell delicious food, some
    people may have akusala cittas while others may have kusala cittas. Those who are attached
    to food are bound to have lobha-mula-cittas. In the case of someone who has accumulations
    for dana (generosity), kusala citta may arise when he has smelled the food ; he may wish
    to offer food to the monks. In the case of others again there may be kusala cittas with
    panna which realizes smell, for example, as only smell, a rupa which is not some 'thing',
    which is devoid of 'self'. If there can be 'wise attention' to the object at this moment,
    there will be more conditions for 'wise attention' in the future. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kusala cittas and akusala cittas are bound to arise
    because we have accumulated both kusala and akusala. People are inclined to blame the
    world for the arising of their defilements since they do not know that defilements are
    accumulated in the citta; defilements are not in the objects around ourselves. One might
    wish to be without the six doors in order to have no defilements. However,<b> the only way
    to eradicate defilements is : knowing the realities which appear through the six doors. </b>We
    read in the 'Kindred Sayings' (IV, Salayatana-vagga, Kindred Sayings on Sense, Fourth
    Fifty, Ch.III, par. 194, On fire) that the Buddha said to the monks: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I will teach you, monks, a discourse (illustrated) by fire
        a Dhamma-discourse. Do you listen to it. And what, monks, is that discourse? </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It were a good thing, monks, if the organ of sight were
        seared with a red-hot iron pin, on fire, all ablaze, a glowing mass of flame. Then would
        there be no grasping of the marks or details of objects cognizable by the eye. The
        consciousness might stand fast, being firmly bound by the satisfaction either of the marks
        or the details (of the objects). Should one die at such a time, there is the possibility
        of his winning one of two destinies, either hell or rebirth in the womb of an animal.
        Seeing this danger, monks, do I so declare. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It were a good thing, monks if the organ of hearing were
        pierced with an iron spike, on fire...  if the organ of smell were pierced with a sharp
        claw, on fire... if the organ of taste were seared with a sharp razor, on fire... if the
        organ of touch were seared with a sword, on fire... </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It were a good thing, monks, to be asleep. For sleep, I
        declare, is barren for living things. It is fruitless for living things, I declare. It is
        dull for living things, I declare. For (if asleep) one would not be applying his mind to
        such imaginations as would enslave him, so that (for instance) he would break up the
        Order. Seeing this danger (of being awake), monks, do I so declare. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As to that, monks, the well-taught Ariyan disciple thus
        reflects: </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Let alone searing the organ of sight with an iron pin, on
        fire, all ablaze, a glowing mass of flame, what if I thus ponder: Impermanent is the eye,
        impermanent are objects, impermanent is eye-consciousness, eye-contact, the pleasant or
        unpleasant or neutral feeling which arises owing to eye-contact, - - that also is
        impermanent...' </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So seeing, the well-taught Ariyan disciple is repelled by
        the eye, by objects, by eye-consciousness, by eye-contact. He is repelled by that pleasant
        or unpleasant or neutral feeling that arises owing to eye-contact... Being repelled he is
        dispassionate. Dispassionate, he is set free. By freedom comes the knowledge, 'I am
        freed', so that he realises: 'Destroyed is rebirth. Lived is the righteous life. Done is
        the task. For life in these conditions there is no hereafter.' </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Such, monks, is the Dhamma-discourse (illustrated) by
        fire.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This sutta reminds us to be mindful at this moment, when
    we are seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, experiencing objects through the body-sense or
