    </font></h2>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-ooOoo- </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">W</font><font face="Times New Roman">hen we are
    angry with other people we harm ourselves by our anger. The Buddha pointed out the adverse
    effects of anger (dosa). We read in the 'Gradual Sayings' (Book of the Sevens, Ch.VI, par.
    10, Anger) about the ills a rival wishes his rival to have and which are actually the ills
    coming upon an angry woman or man. The sutta states: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">...Monks, there is the case of the rival, who wishes thus
      of a rival: 'Would that he were ugly!'. And why? A rival, monks, does not like a handsome
      rival. Monks, this sort of person, being angry, is overwhelmed by anger; he is subverted
      by anger: and however well he be bathed, anointed, trimmed as to the hair and beard, clad
      in spotless linen; yet for all that he is ugly, <br>
      being overwhelmed by anger. Monks, this is the first condition, fostered by rivals,
      causing rivals, which comes upon an angry woman or man.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Again, there is the case of the rival, who wishes thus of
      a rival: 'Would that he might sleep badly!' And why? A rival, monks, does not like a rival
      to sleep well. Monks, this sort of person, being angry, is overwhelmed by anger... and in
      spite of his lying on a couch, spread with a fleecy cover, spread with a white blanket,
      spread with a woollen coverlet, flower embroidered, covered with rugs of antelope skins,
      with awnings above; or on a sofa, with crimson cushions <br>
      at either end; yet for all that he lies in discomfort, being overwhelmed by anger. Monks,
      this is the second condition....</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We then read about other ills a rival wishes for his
    rival, which come upon an angry woman or man. We read that a rival wishes his rival to be
    without prosperity, wealth and <br>
    fame. Further we read that a rival wishes a rival to be without friends and this happens
    to someone who is an angry person. 
 </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The text states: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Monks, this sort of person, being angry... whatever
      friends, intimates, relations and kinsmen he may have, they will avoid him and keep far
      away from him, because he is overwhelmed by anger...' </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A rival wishes his rival to have an unhappy rebirth and
    this can happen to an angry person. We read: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'
... ..Monks, this sort of person, being angry...
      he misconducts himself in deed, in word and thought; so living, so speaking and so
      thinking, on the breaking up of the body after death he is reborn in the untoward way, the
      ill way, the abyss, hell....'</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We would like to live in a world of harmony and unity
    among nations and we are disturbed when people commit acts of violence. We should consider
    what is the real cause of war and discord between people: it is the defilements which
    people have accumulated. When we have aversion we think that other people or unpleasant
    situations are the cause of our aversion. However, our accumulation of dosa is the real
    cause that aversion arises time and again. If we want to have less dosa we should know the
    characteristic of dosa and we should be aware of it when it arises. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dosa has many degrees; it can be a slight aversion or it
    can be more coarse, such as anger. We can recognize dosa when it is coarse, but do we
    realize that we have dosa when it is more subtle? Through the study of the Abhidhamma we
    learn more about the characteristic of dosa. Dosa is an akusala cetasika (mental factor)
    arising with an akusala citta. A citta rooted in dosa is called in Pali: dosa-mula.citta.
    The characteristic of dosa is different from the characteristic of lobha. When there is
    lobha, the citta likes the object which it experiences at that moment, whereas when there
    is dosa, the citta has aversion towards the object it experiences. We can recognize dosa
    when we are angry with 
 someone and when we speak disagreeable words to him. But when
    we are afraid of something it is dosa as well, because one has aversion towards the object
    one is afraid of. There are so many things in life we are afraid of: one is afraid of the
    future, of diseases, of accidents, of death. One looks for many means in order to be cured
    of anguish, but the only way is the development of the wisdom which eradicates the latent <br>
    tendency of dosa. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dosa is conditioned by lobha: we do not want to lose what
    is dear to us and when this actually happens we are sad. Sadness is dosa, it is akusala.
    If we do not know things as they are, we believe that people and things last. However,
    people and things are only phenomena which arise and fall away immediately. The next
    moment they have changed already. If we can see things as they are we will be less
    overwhelmed by sadness. It makes no sense to be sad about what has happened already. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the 'Psalms of the Sisters' (Therigatha, 33) we read
    that the king's wife Ubbiri mourned the loss of her daughter Jiva. Every day she went to
    the cemetery. She met the Buddha who told her that in that cemetery about eighty-four
    thousand of her daughters (in past lives) had been burnt. 
 </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha said to her: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'O, Ubbiri, who wails in the wood <br>
      Crying, O Jiva! O my daughter dear! <br>
      Come to yourself! See, in this burying-ground <br>
      Are burnt full many a thousand daughters dear, <br>
      And all of them were named like unto her. <br>
      Now which of all those Jivas do you mourn?'</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After Ubbiri pondered over the Dhamma thus taught by the
    Buddha she developed insight and saw things as they really are; she even attained
    arahatship. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are other akusala cetasikas which can arise with
    cittas rooted in dosa. Regret or worry, in Pali: kukkucca, is an akusala cetasika which
    arises with dosa-mula-citta at the moment we regret something bad we did or something good
    we did not do. When there is regret we are thinking of the past instead of knowing the
    present moment. When we have done something wrong it is of no use having aversion. 
 </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Envy (issa) is another cetasika which can arise with
    dosa-mula-citta. There is envy when we do not like someone else to enjoy pleasant things.
    At that moment the citta does <br>
    not like the object it experiences. We should find out how often envy arises, even when it
    is more subtle. This is a way to know whether we really care for someone else or whether
    we only think of ourselves when we associate with others. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Stinginess (macchariya) is another akusala cetasika which
    may with dosa-mula-citta. When we are stingy there is dosa as well. At that moment we do
    not like someone else to share in our good fortune. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dosa always arises with an unpleasant feeling (domanassa
    vedana). Most people do not like to have dosa because they do not like to have an
    unpleasant feeling. As we develop more understanding of realities we want to eradicate
    dosa not so much because we dislike unpleasant feeling but rather because we realize the
    adverse effects of akusala. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The doorways through which dosa can arise are the five
    sense-doors and the mind-door. It can arise when we see ugly sights, hear harsh sounds,
    smell unpleasant odours, taste unappetizing food, receive painful bodily impressions and
    think of disagreeable things. Whenever there is a feeling of uneasiness, no matter how
    slight, it is a sign that there is dosa. Dosa may often arise when there are unpleasant
    impressions through the senses, for example, when the temperature is too hot or too cold.
    Whenever there is a slightly unpleasant bodily sensation dosa may arise, be it only of a
    lesser degree.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dosa arises when there are conditions for it. It arises so
    long as there is still attachment to the objects which can be experienced through the five
    senses. Everybody would like to experience only pleasant things and when we do not have
    them any more, dosa can arise. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another condition for dosa is ignorance of Dhamma. If we
    are ignorant of kamma and vipaka, cause and result., dosa may arise very easily on account
    of an unpleasant experience through one of the senses and thus dosa is accumulated time
    and again. An unpleasant experience through one of the senses is akusala vipaka caused by
    an unwholesome deed we perforrned. When we, for example, hear unpleasant words from
    someone else we may be angry with that person. Those who have studied Dhamma know that
    hearing something unpleasant is akusala vipaka which is not caused by someone else but by
    an unwholesome deed we performed ourselves. A moment of vipaka falls away immediately, it
    does not stay. Are we not inclined to keep on thinking about an unpleasant experience? If
    there is more awareness of the present moment one will be less inclined to think with
    aversion about one's akusala vipaka. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we study the Abhidhamma we learn that there are two
    types of dosa-mula-citta; one is asarikharika (unprompted) and one is sasankharika
    (prompted). Dosa is sasankharika prompted) when, for example, one becomes angry after
    having been reminded of the disagreeable actions of someone else. When dosa is sankharika
    (unprompted) it is more intense than when it is sasankharika. Dosa-mula-cittas are called
    patigha.sampayutta, or accompanied by patigha, which is another word for dosa.
    Dosa.mula-cittas are always accompanied by domanassa (unpleasant feeling). The two type of
    dosa-mula-citta are: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Accompanied by unpleasant feeling, arising with anger,
      unprompted (Domanassa-sahagatam, patigha-sampayuttam, asankharikam ekam) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. Accompanied by unpleasant feeling, arising with anger,
      prompted (Domanassa-sahagatam, <br>
      patigha-sampayuttam, sasankharikam ekam)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As we have seen, there are many degrees of dosa; it may be
    coarse or more subtle. When dosa is coarse, it causes akusala kamma-patha (unwholesome
    deeds) through body, speech or mind. Two kinds of akusala kamma-patha through the body can
    be performed with dosa-mula-citta: killing and stealing. If we want less violence in the
    world we should try not to kill. When we kill we accumulate a great deal of dosa. The
    monk's life is a life of non-violence; he does not hurt any living being in the world.
    However, not everyone is able to live like the monks. Defilements are anatta (not self);
    they arise because of conditions. The purpose of the Buddha's teachings is not to lay down
    rules which forbid people to commit ill deeds, but to help people to develop the wisdom
    which eradicates defilements. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As regards stealing, this can either be performed with
    lobha-mula-citta or with dosa-mula-citta. It is done with dosa-mula-citta when there is
    the intention to harm someone else. Doing damage to someone else's possessions is included
    in this kamma-patha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Four kinds of akusala kamma-patha through speech are
    performed with dosa-mula-citta: lying, slandering, rude speech and frivolous talk. Lying,
    slandering and frivolous talk can either be done with lobha-mula-citta or with
    dosa-mula-citta. Slandering, for example, is done with dosa-mula-citta when there is the
    intention to cause damage to someone else, such as doing harm to his good name and causing
    him to be looked down upon by others. Most people think that the use of weapons is to be
    avoided, but they forget that the tongue can be a weapon as well, which can badly wound.
    Evil speech does a great deal of harm in the world; it causes discord between people. When
    we speak evil we harm ourselves, because at such moments akusala kamma is accumulated and
    it is capable of producing akusala vipaka. We read in the 'Sutta Nipata' (the Great
    Chapter, 'Khuddaka Nikava'): </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Truly to every person born <br>
      An axe is born within his mouth <br>
      Wherewith the fool cuts himself <br>
      When he speaks evil.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As regards akusala kamma-patha through the mind performed
    with dosa-mula-citta, this is the intention to hurt or harm someone else. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">People often speak about violence and the ways to cure It.
    Who of us can say that he is free from dosa and that he will never kill? We do not know
    how much dosa we have accumulated in the course of many lives. When the conditions are
    there we might commit an act of violence we did not realize we were capable of. When we
    understand how ugly dosa and to what deeds it can lead we want to eradicate it. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In doing kind deeds to others we cannot eradicate the
    latent tendency of dosa, but at least at those moments we do not accumulate more dosa. The
    Buddha exhorted people to cultivate lovingkindness (metta). We read in the 'Karaniya
    Metta-sutta'; (Sutta Nipata, vs. 143-152 : I am using the translation by Nanamoli
    Thera, Buddhist Publicafion Society, Kandv, Sri Lanka.) what one should do in order to
    gain the 'state of peace'. One should have thought of love for all living beings: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">. ...In safety and in bliss <br>
      May creatures all be of a blissful heart. <br>
      Whatever breathing beings there may be, <br>
      No matter whether they are frail or firm, <br>
      With none excepted, be they long or big <br>
      Or middle-sized, or be they short or small <br>
      Or thick, as well as those seen or unseen, <br>
      Or whether they are dwelling far or near, <br>
      Existing or yet seeking to exist, <br>
      May creatures all be of a blissful heart. <br>
      Let no one work another one's undoing <br>
      Or even slight him at all anywhere; <br>
      And never let them wish each other ill <br>
      Through provocation or resentful thought. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And just as might a mother with her life <br>
      Protect the son that was her only child, <br>
      So let him then for every living thing <br>
      Maintain unbounded consciousness in being, <br>
      And let him too with love for all the world <br>
      Maintain unbounded consciousness in being <br>
      Above, below, and all around in between, <br>
      Untroubled, with no enemy or foe.... </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha taught us not to be angry with those who are
    unpleasant to us. We read in the Vinaya (Mahavagga X, 349 : Translation by Nanamoli
    Thera.) that the Buddha said to the monks: 
 </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">They who (in thought) belabour this: That man has me
      abused, has hurt, has worsted me, <br>
      has me despoiled: in these wrath is not allayed. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">They who do not belabour this: That man has me abused, has
      hurt, has wosted me, has me despoiled: in them wrath is allayed. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nay, not by wrath are wrathful moods allayed here (and) at
      any time, but by not-wrath are they allayed: this is an (ageless) endless rule....</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At times it seems impossible for us to have metta instead
    of dosa. For example, when people treat us badly we may feel very unhappy and we keep on
    pondering over our misery. When dosa has not been eradicated there are still conditions
    for it to arise. In being mindful of all realities which appear the wisdom is developed
    which can eradicate dosa. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dosa can only be eradicated stage by stage. The sotapanna
    (who has attained the first stage of enlightenment) has not yet eradicated dosa. At the
    subsequent stage of enlightenment, the stage of the sakadagami (once-returner), dosa is
    not yet eradicate completely. The anagami (non-returner, who has attained the third stage
    of enlightenment) has eradicated dosa completely; he has no more latent tendency of dosa. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We have not eradicated dosa, but when dosa appears, we can
    be mindful of its characteristic in order to know it as a type of nama, arising because of
    conditions. When there is no mindfulness of dosa when it appears, dosa seems to last and
    we take it for self; neither do we notice other namas and rupas presenting themselves.
    Through mindfulness of namas and rupas which present themselves one at a time, we will
    learn that there are different characteristics of nama and rupa, none of which stays; and
    we will also know the characteristic of dosa as only a type of nama, not self. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When a clearer understanding of realities is developed we
    will be less inclined to ponder for a long time over an unpleasant experience, since it is
    only a type of nama which does not last. We will attend more to the present moment instead
    of thinking about the past or the future. We will also be less inclined to tell other
    people about unpleasant things which have happened to us, since that may be a condition
    both for ourselves and for others to accumulate more dosa. When someone is angry with us
    we will have more <br>
    understanding of his conditions; he may be tired or not feeling well. Those who treat us
    badly deserve compassion because they actually make themselves unhappy. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Right understanding of realities will help us
    most of all to have more lovingkindness and compassion towards others instead of dosa. </font></p>
