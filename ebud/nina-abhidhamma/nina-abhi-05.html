    </font></h2>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-ooOoo-</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">L</font><font face="Times New Roman">obha,
    attachment, leads to sorrow. When we really understand this, we would like to eradicate
    lobha. The eradication of lobha, however, cannot be done at once. We may be able to
    suppress lobha for a while, but it will appear again when there are the right conditions
    for its arising. Even though we know that lobha brings sorrow, it is bound to arise time
    and again. However, there is a way to eradicate it: it can be eradicated by the wisdom
    which sees things as they are. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we study cittas more in detail it will help us to
    know ourselves. We should know not only the coarse lobha but also the degrees of lobha
    which are more subtle. The following sutta gives an example of lobha which is more subtle.
    We read in the 'Kindred Sayings' (I, Sagatha-vagga IX, Forest Suttas,par.14): </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"> 
A certain monk was once staying among the Kosalese
       
in a certain forest-tract. Now while there that monk,  
after he had returned
      from his alms-round and had  
broken his fast, plunged into the lotus-pool and sniffed
       
up the perfume of a red lotus. Then the deva who  
haunted that forest-tract,
      moved with compassion for  
that monk, desiring his welfare, and wishing to agitate <br>
       
him, drew near and addressed him in the verse: 
</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'That blossom, water-born, thing not given, <br>
      You stand sniffing up the scent of it. <br>
      This is one class of things that may be stolen. <br>
      And you a smell-thief must I call, dear sir.' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Monk : <br>
      'Nay, nought I bear away, I nothing break. <br>
      Standing apart I smell the water's child. <br>
      Now for what reason am I smell-thief called? <br>
      One who does dig up water-lilies, one <br>
      Who feeds on lotuses, in motley tasks <br>
      Engaged: Why have you no such name for him?' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Deva : <br>
      'A man of ruthless, wicked character, <br>
      Foul-flecked as is a handmaid's dirty cloth: <br>
      With such the words I say have no concern. <br>
      But this it is meet that I should say (to you): <br>
      To him whose character is void of vice, <br>
      Who ever makes quest for what is pure: <br>
      What to the wicked but a hair-tip seems, <br>
      To him does great as a rain-cloud appear....'</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We should also know the more subtle lobha which arises
    when we enjoy a fragrant smell or beautiful music. It seems that there are no akusala
    cittas when we do not harm others, but also the more subtle lobha is akusala; it is
    different from generosity which is kusala. We cannot force ourselves not to have lobha,
    but we can get to know the characteristic of lobha when it appears. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Not only the suttas, but the Vinaya (Book of Discipline
    for the monks) also gives examples of lobha which is more subtle. Each part of the
    teachings, the Vinaya, the Suttanta and the Abhidhamma can help us to know ourselves
    better. When we read the Vinaya we see that even the monks who lead a life of contentment
    with little, still have accumulated conditions for lobha. Every time there was a case
    where monks deviated from their purity of life, a rule was laid down in order to help them
    to be more watchful. Thus we can understand the usefulness of the rules, which go into
    even the smallest details of the monk's behaviour. The rules help the monk to be watchful
    even when performing the most common actions of daily life such as eating, drinking,
    robing himself and walking. There are rules which forbid seemingly innocent actions like
    playing in the water or with water (Pacittiya 53), or teasing other monks. Such actions
    are not done with kusala cittas, but with akusala cittas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We read in the Vinaya ('Suttavibhanga', Pacittiya 85) that
    the monks should not enter a village at the wrong time. The reason is that they would
    indulge more easily in worldly talk. We read: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now at that time the group of six monks, having entered a
      village at the wrong time, having sat down in a hall, talked a variety of worldly talk,
      that is to say: talk of kings, of thieves, of great ministers, of armies, of fears, of
      battles, of food, of drink, of clothes, of beds, of garlands, of scents, of relations, of
      vehicles, of villages, of little towns, of towns, of the country, of women, of strong
      drink, of streets, of wells, of those departed before, of diversity, of speculation about
      the <br>
      world, about the sea, on becoming and not becoming thus and thus....</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This passage is useful for laypeople as well. We cannot
    help talking about worldly matters, but we should know that our talking, even if it seems
    innocent, often is motivated by lobha-mula-cittas or by dosa-mula-cittas (cittas rooted in
    aversion). In order to know ourselves we should find out by what kind of citta our talking
    is motivated. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Every time a lobha-mula-citta arises lobha is accumulated.
    When the conditions are there, lobha can motivate ill deeds through body, speech or mind.
    When we see to what kind of deeds lobha can lead we shall feel a stronger urge to
    eradicate it. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ill deeds are called in Pali: akusala kamma. Kamma is the
    cetasika (mental factor arising with the citta) which is 'intention' or 'volition';,
    in Pali: cetana. However, the word 'kamma' is also used in a more general sense for the
    deeds which are intended by cetana. The term 'kamma-patha' (literally 'course of action')
    is used as well in this sense. There are akusala kamma-pathas and kusala kamma-pathas, ill
    deeds and good deeds, accomplished through body, speech and mind. As regards akusala
    kamma-patha, there are ten akusala kamma-pathas and these are conditioned by lobha, dosa
    and moha. Moha, ignorance, accompanies every akusala citta, it is the root of all evil.
    Thus, whenever there is akusala kamma-patha, there must be moha. Some akusala kamma-pathas
    can sometimes be performed with lobha-mula-citta and sometimes with dosa-mula-citta.
    Therefore, when we see someone else committing an ill deed we cannot always be sure which
    kind of citta motivates that deed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The ten akusala kamma-pathas are the following: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. 
 
 Killing <br>
      2. 
 
 Stealing <br>
      3. 
 
 Sexual misbehaviour <br>
      4. 
 
 Lying <br>
      5. 
 
 Slandering <br>
      6. 
 
 Rude speech <br>
      7. 
 
 Frivolous talk <br>
      8. 
 
 Covetousness <br>
      9. 
 
 Ill-will <br>
      10. 
 Wrong view (ditthi)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Killing, stealing and sexual misbehaviour are three
    akusala kamma-pathas accomplished through the body. Lying, slandering, rude speech and
    frivolous talk are four akusala kamma-pathas accomplished through speech. Covetousness,
    ill-will and wrong view are three akusala kamma-pathas accomplished through the mind. As
    regards akusala kamma-patha through the body, killing is done with dosa-mula-citta.
    Stealing can sometimes be performed with lobha-mula-citta and sometimes with
    dosa-mula-citta. It is done with lobha-mula-citta if one wishes to take what belongs to
    someone else in order to enjoy it oneself. It is done with dosa-mula-citta if one wishes
    someone else to suffer damage. Sexual misbehaviour is Performed with lobha-mula-citta. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of the akusala kamma-pathas through speech, lying,
    slandering and frivolous talk are performed with lobha-mula-citta if one wishes to obtain
    something for oneself, or if one wishes to endear oneself to other people. As regards
    lying, we may thing that there is no harm in a so-called 'white lie' or a lie said for
    fun. However, all kinds of lies are motivated by akusala cittas. We read in the 'Discourse
    on an exhortation to Rahula at Ambalatthika'; (Middle Length Sayings II, no. 61,
    Bhikkhu-vagga) that the Buddha spoke to his son Rahula about lying. The Buddha said: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even so, Rahula, of anyone for whom there is no shame at
      intentional lying, of him I say that there is no evil he cannot do. Wherefore, for you,
      Rahula, 'I will not speak a lie, even for fun' - - this is how you must train yourself,
      Rahula.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lying can also be done with dosa-mula-citta and this is
    the case when one wants to harm someone else. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As regards slandering, we all are inclined to talk about
    other. When there is no intention to harm the reputation of others, there is no akusala
    kamma-patha. However, when talking about others becomes a habit, there can easily be an
    occasion for akusala kamma-patha. This kind of akusala kamma-patha is performed with
    lobha-mula-citta if one slanders in order to obtain something for oneself or to please
    others. It is performed with dosa-mula-citta if one wants to harm someone else. We will be
    less inclined to talk about others or to judge them when we see ourselves and others as
    phenomena which arise because of conditions and which do not stay. At the moment we talk
    about other people's actions, these phenomena have fallen away already; What they said or
    did exists no more. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Rude speech is performed with dosa-mula-citta. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Frivolous talk is talk about idle, senseless things. This
    kind of talk can be performed with lobha-mula-citta or by dosa-mula-citta. Frivolous talk
    is not always akusala kamma patha. It can be done with by akusala citta which does not
    have the intensity of akusala kamma-patha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As regards akusala kamma-patha through the mind, ill-will,
    the intention to hurt or harm someone else is performed with dosa-mula-citta and
    covetousness and wrong view are performed with lobha-mula-citta. There is akusala
    kamma-patha which is covetousness when one intends to obtain what belongs to someone else
    by dishonest means. As regards ditthi (wrong view), there are many kinds of ditthi;
    however, three kinds of ditthi are akusala kamma-patha through the mind. One of them is
    ahetuka-ditthi, the belief that there is no cause for the existence of beings and no cause
    for their purity or corruption. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another wrong view which is akusala kamma-patha through
    the mind is akiriya-ditthi, the belief that there are no good and bad deeds which produce
    their results. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third wrong view which is akusala kamma-patha through
    the mind is natthika-ditthi or nihilism. Natthika-ditthi is the belief that there is no
    result of kamma and that there is no further life after death. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All degrees of lobha, be it coarse or more subtle, bring
    sorrow. We are like slaves as long as we are absorbed in and infatuated by the objects
    which present themselves through eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body-sense and mind. We are not
    free if our happiness depends on the situation we are in, and the way others behave
    towards us. One moment people may be kind to us, but the next moment they may be
    unpleasant. If we attach too much importance to the affection of other, we shall be easily
    disturbed in mind, and thus become slaves of our moods and emotions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We can become more independent and free if we realize that
    both we ourselves and other people are only nama and rupa, phenomena arising because of
    conditions and falling away again. When others say unpleasant things to us there are
    conditions which cause them to speak in that way, and there are conditions which cause us
    to hear such words. Other people's behaviour and our reactions to it are conditioned
    phenonomena which do not stay. At the moment we are thinking about these phenomena, they
    have already fallen away. The development of insight is the way to become less dependent
    on the vicissitudes of life. When there is mindfulness of the present moment, we attach
    less importance to the way people behave towards us. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since lobha is rooted so deeply, it can only be eradicated
    in different stages. Ditthi has to be eradicated first and then the other kinds of
    attachment can be eradicated. The sotapanna (the person who has realized the first stage
    of enlightenment) has eradicated ditthi; he has developed the wisdom which realizes that
    all phenomena are nama and rupa, not self. Since he has eradicated ditthi, the
    lobha-mula-cittas with ditthi do not arise any more. As we have seen, four types of
    lobha-mula-citta arise with ditthi (they are ditthigata-sampayutta) and four types arise
    without ditthi (they are ditthigata-vippayutta). As for the sotapanna, the four types of
    lobha-mula-citta without ditthi still arise; he has not yet eradicated all kinds of
    attachment. The sotapanna still has conceit. Conceit can arise with the four types of
    lobha-mula-citta which are without ditthi (ditthigata-vippayutta). There may be conceit
    when one compares oneself with others, when one, for example, thinks that one has more
    wisdom than others. When we consider ourselves better, equal or less in comparison with
    others we may find ourselves important and then there is conceit. When we think ourselves
    less than someone else it is not necessarily kusala; there may still be a kind of
    upholding of ourselves and then there is conceit. Conceit is rooted so deeply that it is
    eradicated only when one has become an arahat. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The person who has realized the second stage of
    enlightenment, the sakadagami (once-returner), has less lobha than the sotapanna. The
    person who realized the third stage of enlightenment, the anagami (never-returner), has no
    more clinging to the objects which present themselves through the five senses, but he
    still has conceit and he clings to rebirth. The arahat has eradicated lobha completely. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The arahat is completely free since he has eradicated all
    defilements. We read in the 'Kindred Sayings' (IV, Salayatanavagga, Kindred Sayings on
    Sense, Third Fifty, Ch. IV, par. 136, Not including), that the Buddha said to the monks,
    while he was staying among the Sakkas at Devadaha: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Devas and mankind, monks, delight in objects, they are
      excited by objects. It is owing to the instability, the coming to an end, the ceasing of
      objects, monks, that devas and mankind live woefully. They delight in sounds, scents,
      savours, in touch, they delight in mindstates and are excited by them. It is owing to the
      instability, the coming to an end, the ceasing of mindstates, monks, that devas and
      mankind live woefully.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">But the Tathagata, monks, who is Arahat, a
      fully-enlightened one, seeing as they really are, both the arising and the destruction,
      the satisfaction, the misery and the way of escape from objects, - - he delights not in
      objects, takes not pleasure in them, is not excited by them. It is owing to the
      instability, the coming to an end, the ceasing of objects that the Tathagata dwells at
      ease.. . </font></p>
