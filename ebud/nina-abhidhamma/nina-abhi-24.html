    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A. One cannot attain enlightenment without having
    cultivated the right conditions. </font></p>
    <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">B. What are the conditions for enlightenment? </font></em></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A. We read in the 'Kindred Sayings' (V, Maha-vagga, Book
    XI, Kindred Sayings on Streamwinning, Ch. I, par. 5, Sariputta) about four conditions for
    becoming a sotapanna (streamwinner). The sutta states: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now the venerable Sariputta went to see the Exalted One,
      and on coming to him saluted him and sat down at one side. To the venerable Sariputta so
      seated the Exalted One said this: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">''A limb of stream-winning! A limb of stream-winning!' is
      the saying, Sariputta. Tell me, Sariputta, of what sort is a limb of stream-winning.' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Lord, association with the upright is a limb of
      stream-winning. Hearing the good Dhamma is a limb of stream-winning. Applying the mind is
      a limb of stream-winning. Conforming to the Dhamma is a limb of stream-winning.' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Well said, Sariputta! Well said, Sariputta! Indeed these
      are limbs of stream-winning. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now again, Sariputta, they say: 'The stream! the stream!'
      Of what sort is the stream, Sariputta?' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'The stream, lord, is just this Ariyan Eightfold Way, to
      wit: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right
      effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Well said, Sariputta! Well said, Sariputta! The stream is
      just this Ariyan Eightfold Way. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now again, Sariputta, they say, 'Stream-winner!
      Stream-winner!' Of what sort is a stream-winner, Sariputta?' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Whosoever, lord, is blessed with this Ariyan Eightfold
      Way,-- such an one of such a name, of such and such a clan, is called 'Stream-winner.''</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">B. As regards the first condition, association with
    the righteous person, is this essential? Would it not be possible to find the right path
    by oneself? </font></em></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A. Only Buddhas have accumulated such wisdom that they can
    find the Path by themselves, without the help of a teacher. Other people, however, need
    the teachings of a Buddha in order to find the right path, because ignorance has been
    accumulated for an endlessly long time. We need association with the right person, the
    good friend in Dhamma, who can point out to us the right path, because our defilements
    prevent us from finding the right path. Our friend in Dhamma can encourage us to develop
    mindfulness of nama and rupa. </font></p>
    <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">B. What should one do if there is no such friend in
    Dhamma, who can point out the right way of practice? </font></em></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A. Reading the Buddhist scriptures is very helpful. The
    teachings can encourage us to be mindful of nama and rupa in daily life. We might,
    however, interpret the teachings in the wrong way. It depends on conditions whether we
    come into contact with the right person who can help us to understand the teachings and
    the practice in accordance with the teachings. Accumulated kusala kamma can be the
    condition for us to meet the right person. </font></p>
    <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">B. How can we find out whether we really understand
    the teachings and practise the right path? </font></em></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A. We can find out through the practice. If we practise in
    the wrong way we may eventually find out that it does not lead to right understanding of
    the realities of our daily life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we have heard the Dhamma from the right person, we
    should 'apply the mind'; this is the third condition. We should not blindly follow the
    person who teaches us Dhamma, but we should investigate the scriptures ourselves, ponder
    over the Dhamma, and consider it carefully, in order to test the truth. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The real test of the truth is the practice itself.
    Therefore, the fourth condition is 'conforming to the Dhamma', which is the practice: the
    development of the Eightfold Path. By being mindful of the phenomena appearing through the
    six doors we can prove whether it is true that these phenomena are only nama and rupa,
    arising because of conditions. We can prove whether they are impermanent or permanent,
    whether they are dukkha or happiness, whether they are anatta or 'self'. Through the
    practice we will have more confidence (saddha) in the Buddha's teachings. We will have
    more confidence when we experience that through right understanding of nama and rupa in
    daily life and there will be less clinging to 'self'. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lokuttara cittas cannot arise without the cultivation of
    the right conditions. Some people wish for an end to dukkha but they do not develop
    understanding in daily life. They hope that one day lokuttara cittas will arise. The
    Buddha pointed out that the realization of the Four Noble Truths is difficult, not in
    order to discourage people, but in order to remind them not to be heedless. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We read in the 'Kindred Sayings' (V, Maha-vagga, Book XII,
    Kindred Sayings about the Truths, Ch. V, par. 5, The keyhole) that Ananda watched in
    Vesali the Licchavi youths practising archery. He went to see the Buddha and said: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Here, lord, robing myself in the forenoon and taking bowl
      and outer robe I set out for Vesali on my begging rounds. Then, lord, I saw a number of
      Licchavi youths in the gymnasium making practice at archery, shooting even from a distance
      through a very small keyhole, and splitting an arrow, shot after shot, with never a miss.
      And I said to myself, lord: 'Practised shots are these Licchavi youths! Well practised
      shots indeed are these Licchavi youths, to be able even at a distance to splinter an arrow
      through a very small keyhole, shot after shot, with never a miss!' ' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Now what think you, Ananda? Which is the harder, which is
      the harder task to compass: To shoot like that or to pierce one strand of hair, a hundred
      times divided, with another strand?' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Why, lord, of course to split a hair in such a way is the
      harder, much the harder task.' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Just so, Ananda, they who penetrate the meaning of: This
      is dukkha, this is the arising of dukkha, this is the ceasing of dukkha, this is the
      practice that leads to the ceasing of dukkha, pierce through something much harder to
      pierce. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Wherefore, Ananda, you must make an effort to realize:
      This is dukkha. This is the arising of dukkha. This is the ceasing of dukkha. This is the
      practice that leads to the ceasing of dukkha.'</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">B. I really feel discouraged when I hear this sutta.
    It seems that it is impossible to attain enlightenment. </font></em></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A. If one develops the right Path, not the wrong Path, one
    will know the Four Noble Truths: one will attain enlightenment. The way to know the Four
    Noble Truths is to be mindful of the realities which appear now: seeing, visible object,
    lobha, dosa or any other reality. We should not be discouraged when we do not seem to make
    rapid progress. Most people cling to a result and they become impatient when they do not
    notice an immediate result; clinging to a result, however, is not helpful for the
    development of wisdom, it is akusala. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people feel that the development of samatha can give
    a more immediate result. Samatha, when it is developed, has tranquillity as its result.
    When jhana is attained, lobha, dosa and moha are temporarily eliminated. However, the
    attainment of jhana is extremely difficult and many conditions have to be cultivated. When
    one cultivates samatha, but one cannot attain 'access-concentration' or jhana, the five
    hindrances are bound to arise: there will be sensuous desire, ill-will, sloth and torpor,
    restlessness and worry, and doubt. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The aim of vipassana is not tranquillity, but the
    eradication of wrong view and eventually of all defilements. This goal may seem far off,
    but each short moment of right awareness of nama or rupa is very fruitful; it will help to
    eliminate clinging to the concept of self. While one is mindful, there is no lobha, dosa
    or moha. Although tranquillity is not the aim, at the moment of right mindfulness the
    kusala citta is peaceful. </font></p>
    <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">B. Is enlightenment or the experience of nibbana the
    same as thinking about nibbana? </font></em></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A. Is the direct experience of the characteristics of nama
    and rupa the same as thinking about them? </font></p>
    <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">B. No, it is different. </font></em></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A. Even so is the direct experience of nibbana different
    from thinking about it. </font></p>
    <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">B. Through which door does the person who attains
    enlightenment experience nibbana? </font></em></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A. Nibbana cannot be experienced through any of the five
    senses, it is experienced through the mind-door. </font></p>
    <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">B. Objects which contact the five sense-doors or the
    mind-door are experienced by cittas arising in processes of citta. What is the process of
    cittas like which experience nibbana? How many cittas experience nibbana directly? </font></em></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A. The person who is about to attain enlightenment has
    developed the knowledge of conditioned realities in the practice of vipassana. He has
    realized the characteristics of nama and rupa more and more clearly and he experiences
    their arising and falling away. Panna has been developed to the degree that it can realize
    the nama and rupa which present themselves through the six doors as anicca (impermanent),
    dukkha and anatta (not self). In the process during which enlightenment is attained, the
    mano-dvaravajjana-citta (mind-door- adverting-consciousness) takes as its object one of
    the three characteristics of reality: anicca, dukkha or anatta. </font></p>
    <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">B. I understand that anicca, dukkha and anatta are
    three aspects of the truth of conditioned realities. Thus, if one sees one aspect, one
    also sees the other aspects. Why can one not experience the three characteristics at the
    same time? </font></em></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A. Cittas can experience only one object at a time. It
    depends on one's accumulations which of the three characteristics is realized in the
    process of cittas during which enlightenment is attained: one person views the reality
    appearing at that moment as anicca, another as dukkha, and another again as anatta. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The mano-dvaravajjana-citta of that process adverts to one
    of these three characteristics and is then succeeded by three or four cittas which are not
    yet lokuttara cittas. but maha-kusala cittas (kusala cittas of the sensuous plane of
    consciousness), accompanied by panna. The first maha-kusala citta is called parikamma, and
    it still has the same object as the mano-dvaravajjana-citta. If the
    mano-dvaravajjana-citta had anicca as the object, parikamma realizes the characteristic of
    anicca. </font></p>
    <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">B. What does parikamma mean? </font></em></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A. Parikamma means preparatory. The citta is called
    'preparatory' because it is the first of the maha-kusala cittas before the lokuttara
    cittas in that process arise. The parikamma is succeded by upacara, which still has the
    same object as the mano-dvaravajjana-citta. </font></p>
    <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">B. What does upacara mean? </font></em></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A. Upacara means proximatory. This citta, which is the
    second maha-kusala citta in that process, is nearer to the moment the lokuttara cittas
    will arise. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The upacara is succeeded by the anuloma, which still has
    the same object as the mano-dvaravajjana-citta. </font></p>
    <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">B. What does anuloma mean? </font></em></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A. Anuloma means adaptation. Anuloma is succeeded by
    gotrabhu which is the last citta of the sensuous plane of consciousness; it is the last
    kamavacara citta in that process. Gotrabhu is sometimes translated as 'change of lineage'.
    </font></p>
    <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">B. I have heard that in the practice of samatha there
    is gotrabhu as well. Is the gotrabhu in samatha the same type of citta, or is there a
    difference between gotrabhu in samatha and gotrabhu in vipassana </font></em></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A. Gotrabhu is the last kamavacara citta in a process,
    before a citta of another plane of consciousness arises in that process. The other plane
    of consciousness may be rupavacara (in the case of rupa-jhana), arupavacara (in the case
    of arupa-jhana) or lokuttara. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In samatha, gotrabhu is the last kamavacara citta before
    the rupa-jhanacitta or the arupa-jhanacitta arises. In vipassana, gotrabhu is the last
    kamavacara citta of the non-ariyan before the lokuttara citta arises and he becomes an
    ariyan. The object of the gotrabhu arising before the lokuttara citta is different from
    the object of gotrabhu in samatha. </font></p>
    <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">B. What is the object of gotrabhu which arises before
    the lokuttara citta? </font></em></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A. Gotrabhu arising before the lokuttara citta has nibbana
    as object. </font></p>
    <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">B. Why is gotrabhu not lokuttara citta? It is the
    first citta which has nibbana as object. </font></em></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A. At the moment of gotrabhu the person who is about to
    attain enlightenment is still a non-ariyan. Gotrabhu does not eradicate defilements.
    Gotrabhu is succeeded by the magga-citta which eradicates the defilements that are to be
    eradicated at the stage of the sotapanna. The magga-citta is the first lokuttara citta in
    that process of cittas. When it has fallen away it is succeeded by two (or three)
    phala-cittas which are the result of the magga-citta and which still have nibbana as the
    object. As we have seen, the magga-citta is succeeded immediately by its result, in the
    same process of citta. The magga-citta cannot produce vipaka in the form of rebirth, such
    as the kusala citta of the other planes of consciousness. The phala-cittas are succeeded
    by bhavanga-cittas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people do not need the moment of parikamma
    (preparatory consciousness) and in that case three moments of phala-citta arise instead of
    two moments. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Summarizing the process of citta, during which
    enlightenment is attained, it is as follows: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- mano-dvaravajjana-citta
      (mind-door-adverting-consciousness) <br>
      - parikamma (preparatory; for some people not necessary) <br>
      - upacara (proximatory) <br>
      - anuloma (adaptation) <br>
      - gotrabhu (change of lineage) <br>
      - magga-citta <br>
      - phala-citta (two or three moments, depending on the individual)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">B. When the lokuttara cittas have fallen away and
    there are kamavacara cittas again, can nibbana also be the object of kamavacara citta? </font></em></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A. Nibbana can be the object of kamavacara-cittas which
    arise after the lokuttara cittas have fallen away. Before someone becomes an ariyan there
    can only be speculation about nibbana. Since the ariyan, however, directly experiences
    nibbana, he can reflect upon his experience afterwards. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We read in the 'Visuddhimagga' (XXII, 19) that, after the
    lokuttara cittas have fallen away, the person who attained enlightenment reviews in
    different mind-door processes of citta the path, fruition, the defilements which have been
    abandoned, the defilements still remaining and nibbana. </font></p>
    <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">B. Could enlightenment occur in the middle of one's
    daily activities or is it necessary to go into solitude in order to attain nibbana? </font></em></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A. Since we cultivate wisdom in daily life, why could the
    development of wisdom to the degree of enlightenment not occur in daily life?
    Enlightenment can occur in the middle of one's daily activities if the wisdom is developed
    to that degree. As we have seen, the attainment of nibbana is only a few moments of citta
    which arise and fall away within split seconds. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We read in the 'Discourse to Dighanakha' (Middle Length
    Savings II, No. 74) that the Buddha taught Dhamma to the wanderer Dighanakha on Vulture's
    Peak near Rajagaha. He taught him about the getting rid of wrong views and about the
    impermanence of conditioned realities. Sariputta, who was an ariyan but had not attained
    arahatship, was also present at the time of that discourse. We read: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now at that time the venerable Sariputta was standing
    behind the Lord, fanning the Lord. Then it occurred to the venerable Sariputta: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'The Lord speaks to us of getting rid of these things and
      those by means of super-knowledge, the Well-farer speaks to us of casting out these things
      and those by means of superknowledge'. While the venerable Sariputta was reflecting on
      this, his mind was freed from the cankers without clinging... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sariputta did not go into solitude in order to attain
      arahatship; he was fanning the Buddha.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We read in the 'Kindred Sayings' (V, Khandha-vagga, Middle
    Fifty, Par. 89, Khema) that Khemeka, who was an anagami attained arahatship while he was
    preaching and monks who were listening attained arahatship as well. We read: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now when this teaching was thus expounded the hearts of as
      many as sixty monks were utterly set free from the asavas, and so was it also with the
      heart of the venerable Khemaka. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If one is on the right path, panna can be developed, no
    matter what the circumstances are, even to the degree of enlightenment. </font></p>
    <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">B. Would someone else be able to notice it when a
    person attains nibbana? </font></em></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A. Can you see whether someone else is mindful or not
    mindful? Who knows the cittas of other people? If we haven't developed the 'supernormal
    power' (abhinna) of knowing the cittas of other people, we cannot know when someone else
    is mindful of nama and rupa or when he attains nibbana. </font></p>
    <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">B. Can one attain, in the course of one life, the four
    stages of enlightenment, which are the stages of the sotapanna, the sakadagami, the
    anagami and the arahat? </font></em></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A. All four stages can be attained in the course of one
    life. We read in the suttas about disciples of the Buddha who attained the ariyan state
    but not yet arahatship and realized arahatship later on. For example, Ananda did not
    attain arahatship during the Buddha's life, but he became an arahat after the Buddha had
    passed away, the evening before the first great council was to start. </font></p>
    <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">B. The arahat has eradicated all defilements and thus
    he has reached the end of the cycle of birth, old age, sickness and death; he has realized
    the end of dukkha. He will not be reborn, but he still has to die; therefore, has he
    really attained the end of dukkha at the moment he realizes arahatship? </font></em></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A. Even the arahat is subject to death, since he was born.
    He can also experience unpleasant results of akusala kamma committed before he attained
    arahatship. However, since he has no more defilements and cannot accumulate any more kamma
    which might produce vipaka, he is really free from sorrow. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In 'As it was said' ('ltivuttaka', Ch. II, par. 7,
    'Khuddaka Nikaya') two 'conditions of nibbana' (dhatu, which literally means element) are
    explained. Sa-upadi-sesa nibbana is nibbana with the five khandhas still remaining. For
    the arahat who has not finally passed away yet, there are still citta, cetasika and rupa
    arising and falling away, although he has eradicated all defilements. An-upadi-sesa
    nibbana is nibbana without the khandhas remaining. For the arahat who has finally passed
    away, there are no longer citta, cetasika and rupa arising and falling away. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We read in the verse, after the explanation: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">These two nibbana-states are shown by him<br>
      Who sees, who is such and unattached. <br>
      One state is that in this same life possessed. <br>
      With base remaining, though becoming's stream <br>
      Be cut off. While the state without a base <br>
      Belongs to the future, wherein all <br>
      Becomings utterly do come to cease. <br>
      They who, by knowing this state uncompounded <br>
      Have heart's release, by cutting off the stream, <br>
      They who have reached the core of dhamma, glad <br>
      To end, such have abandoned all becomings.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">B. When one has become an arahat there will be no more
    rebirth. If one only attains the stage of the sotapanna in the course of one's life, how
    many more times does one have to be reborn? </font></em></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A. The sotapanna will not be reborn more than seven times;
    thus, eventually there will be an end to rebirth for him. If we do not cultivate
    vipassana, the number of rebirths will be endless. It was out of compassion that the
    Buddha spoke about the dangers of rebirth; he wanted to encourage people to develop
    mindfulness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We read in the 'Kindred Sayings' (V, Maha-vagga, Book XII,
    Kindred Sayings about the Truths, Ch. V, part 6, Gross darkness) that the Buddha said to
    the monks: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Monks, there is a darkness of interstellar space,
      impenetrable gloom, such a murk of darkness as cannot enjoy the splendour of this moon and
      sun, though they be of such mighty magic power and majesty.' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">At these words a certain monk said to the Exalted One: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Lord, that must be a mighty darkness, a mighty darkness
      indeed! Pray, lord, is there any other darkness greater and more fearsome than that?' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'There is indeed, monk, another darkness, greater and more
      fearsome. And what is that other darkness? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Monk, whatsoever recluses or brahmins understand not, as
      it really is, the meaning of: This is dukkha, this is the arising of dukkha, this is the
      ceasing of dukkha, this is the practice that leads to the ceasing of dukkha, such take
      delight in the activities which conduce to rebirth. Thus taking delight they compose a
      compound of activities which conduce to rebirth. Thus composing a compound of activities
      they fall down into the darkness of rebirth...and despair. They are not released from
      birth, and death...and despair. They are not released from dukkha, I declare. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">But, monk, those recluses or brahmins who do understand as
      it really is, the meaning of : This is dukkha, this is the practice that leads to the
      ceasing of dukkha, such take not delight in the activities which conduce to rebirth...They
      are released from dukkha, I declare. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Wherefore, monk, an effort must be made to realize: This
      is dukkha. This is the arising of dukkha. This is the ceasing of dukkha. This is the
      practice that leads to the ceasing of dukkha.'</font></p>
