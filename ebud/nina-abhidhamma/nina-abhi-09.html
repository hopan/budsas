    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-ooOoo-</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">T</font><font face="Times New Roman">here are
    eighteen types of ahetuka citta, or cittas arising without hetu (root). Fifteen types of
    ahetuka citta are vipaka. As we have seen, ten of these fifteen cittas are dvi-panca
    vinnanas. They are: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">two seeing-consciousness <br>
      two hearing-consciousness <br>
      two smelling-consciousness <br>
      two tasting-consciousness <br>
      two body-consciousness </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Seeing-consciousness is the result of kamma. When it is
    the result of an ill deed, seeing-consciousness is akusala vipakacitta which experiences
    an unpleasant object; when it is the result of a good deed, it is kusala vipakacitta which
    experiences a pleasant object. The function of seeing consciousness is to experience
    visible object. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> 
Kamma which produces seeing-consciousness does not
    only produce the vipakacitta which is seeing-consciousness, it also produces two other
    kinds of vipakacitta, which succeed seeing-consciousness. Seeing-consciousness is
    succeeded by vipakacitta which receives the object. This citta, which is called
    sampaticchana-citta (receiving-consciousness). Visible object which is experienced by
    seeing-consciousness does not fall away when seeing-consciousness falls away, because it
    is rupa; rupa does not fall away as rapidly as nama. When an object is experienced through
    one of the six doors, there is not merely one citta experiencing that object, but there is
    a series of cittas succeeding one another, which share the same object. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> 
If the seeing-consciousness is akusala vipaka, the
    sampaticchana-citta (receiving-consciousness) is also akusala vipaka; if the
    seeing-consciousness is kusala vipaka, the sampaticchana-citta is also kusala vipaka. Thus
    there are two types of sampaticchana-citta: one is akusala vipaka and one is kusala
    vipaka. Sampaticchana-citta: is ahetuka vipaka; there are no akusala hetus (unwholesome
    roots) or sobhana hetus (beautiful roots) arising with this type of citta.
    Sampaticchana-citta succeeds seeing-consciousness; seeing- consciousness is a condition
    for the arising of sampaticchana-citta. Likewise, when there is a process of cittas
    experiencing sound, sampaticchana-citta succeeds hearing-consciousness. It is the same
    with regard to nose, tongue, and body. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sampaticchana-citta always arises with upekkha
    (indifferent feeling), no matter whether the sampaticchana- citta is akusala vipaka or
    kusala vipaka. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After the sampaticchana-citta has arisen and fallen away,
    the process of cittas is not yet over. The sampaticchana-citta is succeeded by another
    ahetuka vipakacitta which is still the result of kamma. This type of citta is called
    santirana-citta (investigating-consciousness). Santirana-citta investigates or considers
    the object which was 'received' by the sampaticchana-citta. Santirana-citta succeeds
    sampaticchana-citta through five sense-doors; sampaticchana-citta is a condition for the
    arising of santirana-citta. When seeing has arisen, sampaticchana-citta succeeds the
    seeing-consciousness, and santirana-citta succeeds the sampaticchana-citta in the process
    of cittas which experience visible object through eye-door. It is the same with the
    santirana- citta which arises in the process of cittas experiencing an object through
    ear-door, nose-door, tongue-door, body-door. It succeeds the sampaticchana-citta. We
    cannot choose whether santirana-citta should arise or not; cittas arise because of
    conditions, they are beyond control. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Santirana-citta is also an ahetuka vipakacitta. When the
    object is unpleasant (anittharammana), the santirana- citta is akusala vipaka and it is
    accompanied by upekkha (indifferent feeling). As regards santirana-citta which is kusala
    vipaka, there are two kinds. When the object is pleasant (ittharammana), but not
    extraordinarily pleasant, santirana-citta is accompanied by upekkha. When the object is
    extraordinarily pleasant (atittharammana), the santirana-citta is accompanied by
    somanassa. Thus, there are three kinds of santirana- citta in all. It depends on
    conditions which kind of santirana-citta arises. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, there are fifteen (15) types of ahetuka citta which
    are vipaka. Summarizing them, they are: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">10 cittas which are dvi-panca-vinnana (five pairs) <br>
      1 sampaticchana-citta (receiving-consciousness) which is 
akusala vipaka <br>
      1 sampaticchana-citta which is kusala vipaka <br>
      1 santirana-citta (investigating-consciousness) which is akusala vipaka, accompanied by
      upekkha <br>
      1 santirana-citta which is kusala vipaka, accompanied by upekkha <br>
      1 santirana-citta which is kusala vipaka, accompanied by somanassa </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Seven types of the ahetuka vipakacittas are akusala vipaka
    and eight types are kusala vipaka, since there are two types of santirana-citta which are
    kusala vipaka. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As we have seen, there are altogether eighteen ahetuka
    cittas. Of these eighteen ahetuka cittas fifteen are vipakacittas and three are
    kiriyacittas. Kiriyacittas are different from akusala cittas and kusala cittas and from
    vipakacittas. Akusala cittas and kusala cittas are cittas which are cause; they can
    motivate ill deeds and <br>
    good deeds which are capable of producing their appropriate results. Vipaka-cittas are
    cittas which are the result of akusala kamma and kusala kamma. Kiriyacittas are cittas
    which are neither cause nor result. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One type of ahetuka kiriyacitta is the
    'five-door-adverting-consciousness', in Pali: panca-dvaravajjana-citta. ('Panca' is five,
    'dvara' is door, 'avajjana' is adverting or turning towards.';) When an object
    impinges on one of the five senses, there has to be a citta which adverts or turns towards
    the object through that sense-door. When visible object impinges on the eye-sense, there
    has to be the adverting-consciousness which adverts towards visible object through the
    eye-door, or cakkhu-dvaravajjana-citta (eye-door-adverting- consciousness), before there
    can be seeing-consciousness (cakkhu-vinnana). When sound impinges on the ear-sense, the
    ear-door-adverting-consciousness (sota-dvaravajjana-citta) has to advert to the sound
    through the ear-door before there can be hearing-consciousness (sota-vinnana). The
    panca-dvaravajjana-citta merely turns towards the object which impinges on one of the five
    sense-doors. But it does not see or hear. The panca-dvaravajjana-citta is an ahetuka
    kiriyacitta, it arises without hetu (root); there is not yet like or dislike. The
    panca-dvaravajjana-citta is succeeded by one of the dvi-panca-vinnanas (five pairs), which
    is vipakacitta. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Each citta which arises in the process of cittas
    experiencing an object has its own function. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The cittas which experience an object through one of the
    senses do not know anything else but that object. When one, for example, is reading, the
    citta which sees experience only visible object and it does not know the meaning of the
    letters. After the eye-door process has been completed visible object is experienced
    through the mind-door and then there can be other mind-door processes of cittas which know
    the meaning of what has been written and which think about it. Thus, there are processes
    of cittas which experience an object through one of the senses and processes of cittas
    which experience an object through the mind-door. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another type of ahetuka kiriyacitta is the
    mano-dvaravajjana-citta (mind-door-adverting-consciousness), which arises both in the
    sense-door process and in the mind-door process but performs two different functions
    according as it arises in each of those two kinds of processes. When an object contacts
    one of the sense-doors, the panca-dvaravajjana-citta (five-door-adverting-consciousness)
    turns towards the object, one of the dvi-panca-vinananas experiences it,
    sampaticchana-citta receives the object and santirana-citta investigates it. The
    santirana-citta is succeeded by an ahetuka kiriyacitta which experiences the object
    through that sense-door and 'determines' (votthapana) the object. It is actually the same
    type of citta as the mano- dvara vajjana-citta, (mind-door-adverting-consciousness, the
    first citta of the mind-door process), but when it arises in the sense-door process it can
    be called votthapana-citta, since it performs the function of determining the object in
    the sense-door process. The votthapana-citta, after it has determined the object, is, on
    the case of non-arahats, followed by akusala cittas or by kusala cittas. It depends on
    one's accumulations of akusala and kusala whether the votthapana citta will be succeeded
    by akusala cittas or by kusala cittas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After the cittas of the sense-door process have fallen
    away the object can be experienced through the mind-door. The mano-dvaravajjana-citta is
    the first citta of the mind-door process which experiences that object which has fallen
    away already. In the sense-door process the panca-dvara vajjana-citta adverts to the
    object which has not fallen away yet. For example, it adverts to visible object or sound
    which is still impinging on the appropriate sense-door. The mano-dvaravajjana-citta which
    arises in the mind-door process however, can experience an object which has fallen away
    already. After the mano-dvaravajjana-citta has adverted to the object it is succeeded by
    either kusala cittas or akusala cittas (in the case of non-arahats), which experience that
    same object. The mano-dvaravajjana-citta itself is neither akusala citta nor kusala citta;
    it is kiriyacitta. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although the votthapana-citta in the sense-door process
    and the mano-dvaravajjana-citta in the mind-door process are the same type of citta, an
    ahetuka kiriyacitta, their functions are different. In the sense-door process this citta
    performs the function of votthapana (determining the object) and in the mind-door process
    it performs the function of avajjana (adverting). Thus, whenever we deal with the
    mano-dvaravajjana-citta we have to know what function it is performing. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When sound impinges on the earsense it can be experienced
    by cittas arising in the ear-door process and after that it is experienced by cittas
    arising in a mind-door process. Processes of cittas which experience in object through one
    of the five senses and through the mind-door succeed one another time and again. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">How can there be akusala cittas or kusala cittas in the
    process of cittas which experience an object through one of the sense-doors, when one does
    not even know yet what it is that is experienced? There can be akusala cittas or kusala
    cittas before one knows what it is. One can compare this situation with the case of a
    child who likes a brightly coloured object such as a balloon before it knows that the
    object is a balloon. We can have like or dislike of an object before we know what it is. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another ahetuka kiriyacitta is the hasituppada-citta
    (smile-producing-consciousness). Only arahats have this kind of citta. Laughing and
    smiling can be motivated by different kinds of cittas. When people who are <br>
    not arahats smile, it is usually motivated by lobha or by kusala citta. Arahats do not
    have any defilements; they do not have akusala cittas. Neither do they have kusala cittas;
    they do not accumulate any more kamma. Instead of kusala cittas they have kiriyacittas,
    accompanied by sobhana (beautiful) roots, sobhana kiriyacittas. Arahats do not laugh
    aloud, because they have no accumulations for laughing; they only smile. When they smile
    the smiling may be motivated by sobhana kiriyacitta or by the ahetuka kiriyacitta which is
    called hasituppada-citta. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, of the eighteen ahetuka cittas, fifteen are
    vipakacittas and three are kiriyacittas. The ahetuka kiriyacittas are: 
</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Panca-dvaravajjana-citta
      (five-door-adverting 
consciousness) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. Mano-dvaravajjana-citta (mind-door-adverting-
      consciousness), which performs the function of 
adverting to the object through the
      mind-door 
when it arises in the mind-door process and 
which performs the
      function of votthapana 
(determining the object) when it arises in the 
sense-door
      process 
</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. Hasituppada-citta (smile-producing-consciousness) 

      </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who are not arahats can have only seventeen of the
    eighteen ahetuka cittas. These seventeen types of ahetuka citta arise in our daily life.
    When an object impinges on one of the five senses, panca-dvaravajjana- citta
    (five-door-adverting consciousness) turns towards the object through that sense-door. This
    citta is followed by panca-vinnana which experiences the object, by sampaticchana-citta
    which receives it, by santirana-citta which investigates it and by votthapana-citta which
    determines the object and then by akusala cittas or kusala cittas. When the cittas of the
    sense-door process have fallen away the object is experienced through the mind-door. The
    mano-dvaravajjana-citta adverts to the object through the mind-door and is then followed
    by akusala cittas or kusala cittas. There is 'unwise attention' (ayoniso manasikara) to
    the object which is experienced if akusala cittas arise, and there is 'wise attention'
    (yoniso manasikara) to the object if kusala cittas arise. For example, when we see insects
    there may be dosa-mula-cittas (cittas rooted in aversion). Thus, there is ayoniso
    manasikara (unwise attention). The dosa may be so strong that one wants to kill the
    insects; then there is akusala kamma. If one realizes that killing is akusala and one
    abstains from killing, there are kusala cittas and thus there is yoniso manasikara (wise
    attention). If one studies Dhamma and develops vipassana (insight) it is a condition for
    yoniso manasikara. When we are mindful of the nama or rupa which appears through one of
    the six doors, there is yoniso manasikara at that moment. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When there are two people in the same situation, one
    person may have ayoniso manasikara and the other may have yoniso manasikara. This depends
    on their accumulations. We read in the 'Kindred Sayings' (lV, Salayatanavagga, Kindred
    Sayings on Sense, Fourth Fifty, Ch.V, par. 202, Lustful) about the monk who, <br>
    after he has experienced an object through one of the six doors, has ayoniso manasikara,
    and about the monk who has yoniso manasikara. We read that Maha-Moggallana said to the
    monks: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Friends, I will teach you the way of lusting and
      also 
of not lusting.... </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And how, friends, is one lustful? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Herein, friends, a monk, seeing object with the
      eye, 
feels attachment for objects that charm, feels aversion from objects that
      displease, abides without mindfulness 
of the body, and his thoughts are mean. He
      realizes not, in its true nature, that emancipation of heart, 
that emancipation of
      wisdom, wherein those evil, unprofitable states that have arisen cease without remainder. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">This monk, friends, is called 'lustful after objects 

      cognizable by the eye, nose, tongue... objects cognizable by the mind'; When a monk
      so abides, friends, if Mara come upon him by way of the eye, Mara gets an 

      opportunity. If Mara come upon him....by way of the 
mind, Mara gets access, gets
      opportunity.... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">So dwelling, friends, objects overcome a monk, a 
monk
      overcomes not objects. Sounds overcome a monk, a monk overcomes not sounds. Scents,
      savours, tangibles and mind-states overcome a monk, a monk overcomes not sounds, scents,
      savours, tangibles and mind-states. This monk, friends, is called 'conquered by objects,
      sounds, scents, savours, tangibles and <br>
      mind-states, not conquerer of them.'; Evil, unprofitable states, passion-fraught,
      leading to rebirth overcome him, states unhappy, whose fruit is pain, whose future is
      rebirth, decay and death. Thus, friends, one is lustful. 
 </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And how, friends, is one free from lust? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Herein, friends, a monk, seeing an object with the 

      eye, is not attached to objects that charm, nor averse from objects that displease.... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Tasting a savour with the tongue...with mind cognizing a
      mind-state, he is not attached to mind-states that charm, nor is he averse from
      mind-states that displease, but dwells with mindfulness of the body, his thought is
      boundless. So that he realizes in its true nature that <br>
      emancipation of heart, that emancipation of wisdom, wherein those evil, unprofitable
      states that have arisen come to cease without remainder. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">This monk, friends, is called 'not lustful after 

      objects cognizable by the eye... not lustful after <br>
      mind-states cognizable by mind.' Thus dwelling, friends, if Mara come upon him by way of
      the eye, of the tongue,... of the mind, Mara gets no access, gets no 
 opportunity....
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Moreover, friends, so dwelling a monk conquers 

      objects, objects do not conquer him. He conquers sounds, scents, savours, tangibles,
      mind-states. They do not conquer him. Such a monk, friends, is called, 
 'conquerer of
      objects, sounds, scents, savours, tangibles and mind-states,'; He is conquerer, not
      conquered. He conquers those evil, unprofitable states, passion-fraught, inciting to lust,
      leading to rebirth, states unhappy, whose 
 fruit is pain, rebirth, decay and death.
      Thus, friends, is one free from lust.
