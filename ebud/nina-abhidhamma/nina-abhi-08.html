    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-ooOoo-</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">I</font><font face="Times New Roman">f we want to
    know ourselves we should not merely know the moments we have akusala cittas or kusala
    cittas but other moments as well. When we see something ugly, we dislike what we see. At
    the moment of dislike there is akusala citta rooted in dosa (aversion). Before there is
    dislike, however, there must be moments of merely seeing the object. At these moments
    there are not yet akusala cittas, but cittas which are without 'root' (in Pali: hetu). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are six cetasikas which are hetu or 'root'. Three of
    these hetus are akusala; they are : lobha (attachment), dosa (aversion) and moha
    (ignorance). Three hetus are sobhana (beautiful); they are: alobha (greedlessness or
    generosity), adosa (non-hate or lovingkindness) and amoha (panna or wisdom). The citta or
    cetasika which is accompanied by a hetu is sahetuka. For example, dosa-mula-citta is
    sahetuka; moha and dosa are the hetus which arise with dosa-mula-citta. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Cittas without hetu are ahetuka cittas. There are many
    ahetuka cittas arising in a day. Whenever we see, hear, smell, taste or receive
    impressions through the body-sense, there are ahetuka cittas before cittas with hetu
    (wholesome cittas or unwholesome cittas) arise. We are inclined to pay attention only to
    the moments of like and dislike, but we should know other moments as well; we should know
    ahetuka cittas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are altogether eighteen types of ahetuka citta.
    Fifteen types of ahetuka citta are vipakacittas and three types are kiriyacittas (cittas
    which are 'inoperative', neither cause nor result). Seven of the ahetuka vipakacittas are
    akusala vipakacittas (result of unwholesome deeds) and eight of them are kusala <br>
    vipakacittas (result of wholesome deeds). When an unpleasant object impinges on the
    eye-sense, seeing-consciousness only experiences what appears through the eyes; there is
    no dislike yet of the unpleasant object. Seeing-consciousness is an ahetuka vipakacitta.
    Cittas which dislike the object arise later on; these are seen. The citta which pays
    attention to the shape and form of something and knows what it is, does not experience an
    object through the eye-door but through the mind-door; it has a different characteristic.
    When one uses the word 'seeing' one usually means: paying attention to the shape and form
    of something and knowing what it is, but there must also be a kind of citta which merely
    sees visible object, and this citta does not know anything else. What we see we can call
    'visible object' or 'colour' ; what is meant is: what appears through the eyes. When there
    is hearing, we can experience that hearing has a characteristic which is different from
    seeing; the citta which hears experiences sound through the ears. Only in experiencing the
    different characteristics of realities over and over again, will we come to know them as
    they are. People may think that there is a self which can see and hear at the same time,
    but through which door can the self be experienced? Taking realities for self is wrong
    view. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and receiving
    impressions through the body-sense do not arise without there being conditions for their
    arising; they are the result of kamma. Eye-sense, ear-sense, smelling-sense, tasting-
    sense and body-sense are rupas which are produced by kamma as well; they are the corporal
    result of kamma. Only the mental result of kamma is called vipaka, and thus only citta and
    cetasika (mental factors arising with the citta) can be vipaka. Rupa is not vipaka. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha taught that everything which arises must have
    conditions for its arising. When we see something unpleasant there must be a condition for
    it: it is the result of akusala kamma. Akusala vipaka cannot be the result of kusala
    kamma. Seeing something pleasant is kusala vipaka; this can only be the result of kusala
    kamma. The vipakacitta which arises when there is an unpleasant or pleasant impression
    through one of the five senses is ahetuka. At that moment there are no akusala hetus
    (unwholesome roots) or sobhana hetus (beautiful roots) arising with the citta. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The ahetuka vipakacitta which sees an unpleasant or a
    pleasant object through the eyes is seeing- consciousness, in Pali: cakkhu-vinnana (cakkhu
    means eye). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The ahetuka vipakacitta which hears an unpleasant or a
    pleasant object through the ears is hearing- consciousness, in Pali: sota-vinnana (sota
    means ear). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The ahetuka vipakacitta which smells an unpleasant or a
    pleasant object through the nose is smelling-consciousness, in Pali: ghana-vinnana (ghana
    means nose). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The ahetuka vipakacitta which experiences an unpleasant or
    a pleasant taste through the tongue is tasting- consciousness, in Pali: jivha-vinnana
    (jivha means tongue). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The ahetuka vipakacitta which experiences an unpleasant or
    a pleasant object through the body-sense is body-consciousness, in Pali: kaya-vinnana
    (kaya means body) . </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are two kinds of ahetuka vipaka experiencing an
    object through each of the five doors: one is akusala vipaka and one is kusala vipaka.
    Thus there are five pairs of ahetuka vipakacittas which arise depending on the five
    sense-doors. There are also other kinds of ahetuka vipakacitta which will be dealt with
    later on. The ten ahetuka vipakacittas which are the 'five pairs' are called in Pali:
    dvi-panca-vinnana (two times five vinnana). They are: </font><ol>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Cakkhu-vinnana (seeing-consciousness): <br>
        - akusala vipaka, accompanied by upekkha (indifferent feeling)<br>
        -kusala vipaka, accompanied by upekkha <br>
        <br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Sota-vinnana (hearing-consciousness): <br>
        - akusala vipaka, accompanied by upekkha <br>
        - kusala vipaka, accompanied by upekkha <br>
        </font><br>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Ghana-vinnana (smelling-consciousness): <br>
        - akusala vipaka, accompanied by upekkha <br>
        - kusala vipaka, accompanied by upekkha <br>
        </font><br>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Jivha-vinnana (tasting-consciousness): <br>
        - akusala vipaka, accompanied by upekkha <br>
        - kusala vipaka, accompanied by upekkha <br>
        </font><br>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Kaya-vinnana (body-consciousness): <br>
        - akusala vipaka, accompanied by dukkha vedana (bodily painful feeling) <br>
        - kusala vipaka, accompanied by sukha vedana (bodily pleasant feeling) </font></li>
    </ol>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The ahetuka vipakacittas which see, hear, smell and taste
    are invariably accompanied by upekkha (indifferent feeling), no matter whether they are
    akusala vipaka or kusala vipaka. The citta which dislikes the object may arise afterwards.
    This citta is sahetuka (with hetus or roots) and it is accompanied by unpleasant feeling.
    Or the citta which likes the object may arise; this citta which is also sahetuka may be
    accompanied by pleasant feeling or by indifferent feeling. We are inclined to think that
    the dvi-panca-vinnanas can occur at the same time as like or dislike of the object, but
    this is not so. Different cittas arise at different moments and the feelings which
    accompany the cittas are different too; none of these realities should be taken for self. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The feeling arising with the body-consciousness which
    experiences an impression through the body-sense cannot be indifferent; it arises either
    with bodily painful feeling or with bodily pleasant feeling. When an unpleasant bodily
    impression is experienced the feeling which accompanies the body-consciousness is
    dukkha-vedana (bodily painful feeling). When a pleasant bodily impression is experienced
    the feeling which accompanies the body-consciousness is sukha-vedana (bodily pleasant
    feeling). Bodily unpleasant feeling and bodily pleasant feeling are nama which can arise
    only with the body-consciousness which experiences an object through the body-sense. Both
    bodily feeling and mental feeling are nama, but they arise because of different conditions
    and at different moments. For example, we may have bodily pleasant feeling when we are in
    comfortable surroundings, but in spite of that, we may still be worried and also have
    moments of mental unpleasant feeling; these feelings arise at different moments. Bodily
    pleasant feeling is the result of kusala kamma. The mental unpleasant feeling which arises
    when we are unhappy is conditioned by our accumulation of dosa (aversion) ; it is akusala.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The whole day there are impressions received through the
    body-sense, which is a kind of rupa. Bodily impressions can be received all over the body
    and thus the door of the body-sense can be at any place of the body. Whenever we touch
    hard or soft objects, when cold or heat contacts the body, and when we move, bend or
    stretch, there are unpleasant or pleasant impressions received through the body-sense. One
    may wonder whether at each moment there is a bodily impression, bodily pleasant or bodily
    unpleasant feeling arises. One may notice the coarse bodily feelings, but not the subtle
    bodily feelings. For example, when something is a little too hard, too cold or too hot,
    there is dukkha-vedana (bodily painful feeling) arising with the body consciousness which
    experiences the object through the body-sense. One may not notice the subtle bodily
    feelings if one has not learned to be aware of realities. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The arahat, when he experiences an unpleasant impression
    or a pleasant impression through the body-sense, only has bodily unpleasant feeling or
    bodily pleasant feeling arising with the body-consciousness. He has no akusala cittas or
    kusala cittas after the vipakacitta; he has kiriyacittas ('inoperative' cittas: The deeds
    which the arahat performs are neither kusala nor akusala. So he will not be born again.).
    We read in the 'Kindred Sayings' (IV, Salayatana-vagga, Kindred Sayings about Feeling,
    Book I, par.6) that the Buddha said to the monks: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'The untaught manyfolk, monks, feels feeling that is
      pleasant, feeling that is painful and feeling that is neutral. The well-taught Ariyan
      disciple, monks, feels the same three feelings. ' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now herein, monks, what is the distinction, what is the
      specific feature, what is the difference between the well-taught Ariyan disciple and the
      untaught manyfolk?' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'For us, lord, things are rooted in the Exalted One....' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'The untaught manyfolk, monks, being touched by feeling
      that is painful, weeps and wails, cries <br>
      aloud, knocks the breast, falls into utter bewilderment. For he feels a twofold feeling,
      bodily and mental ... Touched by that painful feeling he feels repugnance for it. Feeling
      that repugnance for the painful feeling, the lurking tendency to repugnance fastens on
      him. Touched by the painful feeling, he delights in pleasant feeling. Why so? The untaught
      manyfolk, monks, knows of no refuge from painful feeling save sensual pleasure. Delighting
      in that sensual pleasure, the lurking tendency to sensual pleasure fastens on him....' </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Is this not real life? Touched by painful feeling, we
    delight in pleasant feeling; we believe that pleasant feeling is real happiness. we do not
    see life as it really is: dukkha. We wish to close our eyes to sickness, old age and
    death, to 'lamentation and despair', to the impermanence of all conditioned realities. We
    expect happiness in life and when we have to suffer we think that pleasant feeling might
    cure us of suffering and we cling to it. In the Buddha's teaching of the 'Dependent
    Origination' it is said that feeling conditions craving. Not only pleasant feeling and
    indifferent feeling condition craving, also painful feeling conditions craving, since one
    wishes to be liberated from painful feeling. Furthermore we read in the sutta: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'....If he feels feeling that is pleasant, he feels it as
      one in bondage. If he feels feeling that is painful, he feels it as one in bondage. If he
      feels feeling that i s neutral, he feels it as one in bondage. This untaught manyfolk,
      monks, is called 'in bondage to birth, death, <br>
      sorrow and grief, woe, lamentation and despair. He is in bondage to dukkha. So I declare. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">But, monks, the well-taught Ariyan disciple, when touched
      by painful feeling, weeps not, wails not, cries not aloud, knocks not the breast, falls
      not into utter bewilderment. He feels but one feeling, the bodily, not the mental... If he
      feels a feeling that is pleasant, he feels it as one freed from bondage. If he feels a
      feeling that is painful, he feels it as one that is freed from bondage. If he feels a
      neutral feeling, he feels it as one that is freed from bondage. This well-taught Ariyan <br>
      disciple, monks, is called 'freed from the bondage of birth, old age, from sorrow and
      grief, from woe, lamentation and despair, freed from the bondage of dukkha.' So I
      declare....' </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Feelings arise because of conditions and fall away again.
    They are impermanent <br>
    and they should not be taken for self. We read in the 'Kindred Savings' (lV
    Salayatana-vagga, Kindred Sayings on Sense, Third Fifty, par. 130, Haliddaka): </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once the venerable Kaccana the Great was staying among the
      folk of Avanti, at Osprey's Haunt, on a sheer mountain crag. Then the housefather
      Haliddakani came to the venerable Kaccana the Great. Seated at one side he said this: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'lt has been said by the Exalted One, sir, &quot;Owing to
      diversity in elements arises diversity of contact. Owing to diversity of contact arises
      diversity of feeling.&quot; Pray, sir, how far is this so?' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Herein, housefather, seeing a pleasant object with the
      eye, a monk, at the thought &quot;This is such <br>
      and such,&quot; comes to know of eye-consciousness that is pleasant to experience. Owing
      to contact that is pleasant to experience arises pleasant feeling. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">When with the eye he sees an object that is displeasing, a
      monk, at the thought &quot;This is such and <br>
      such,&quot; comes to know of eye-consciousness that is unpleasant to experience. Owing to
      contact that is unpleasant to experience arises unpleasant feeling. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">When with the eye he sees an object that is of indifferent
      effect, a monk, at the thought &quot;This is such and such,&quot; comes to know of
      consciousness that is neutral. Owing to contact that is neutral to experience arises
      feeling that is neutral. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">So also, housefather, hearing a sound with the ear,
      smelling a scent with the nose, tasting a savour with the tongue, contacting a tangible
      with the body, cognizing a pleasing mind-state with the mind... a mind-state that is
      displeasing... a mind-state that is indifferent in effect.... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, housefather, owing to diversity in elements arises
      diversity of contact. Owing to diversity of contact arises diversity of feeling.' </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we are mindful of realities which appear through the
    different doorways we will know from experience many different namas and rupas; we will
    know different types of citta and different kinds of feeling. We will know that all these
    realities are only conditioned elements and not self. We will know from experience that
    there are not only cittas accompanied by lobha, dosa and moha, and cittas accompanied by
    wholesome roots, but also cittas which are ahetuka, cittas without roots. One may not find
    it interesting to know more about seeing, hearing and the other realities appearing
    through the different doorways. However, in order to see things as they are, it is
    essential to know that the citta which, for example, experiences sound, has a
    characteristic which is different from the citta which likes or dislikes the sound and
    that these cittas arise because of different conditions. What the Buddha taught can be
    proved by being mindful of realities. </font></p>
