    </font></h2>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-ooOoo-</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he Buddha spoke about everything
    which is real. What he taught can be proved by our own experience. However, we do not
    really know the most common realities of daily life: the mental phenomena and physical
    phenomena which appear through eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind. It seems that
    we are mostly interested in the past or the future. However, we will find out what life
    really is if we know more about the realities of the present moment, and if we are aware
    of them when they appear. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha explained that citta (consciousness) is a
    reality. We may doubt whether cittas are real. How can we prove that there are cittas?
    Could it be that there are only physical phenomena and not mental phenomena? There are
    many things in our life we take for granted such as our homes, meals. clothes, or the
    tools we use every day. These things do not arise by themselves. They are brought about by
    a thinking mind, by citta. Citta is a mental phenomenon; it knows or experiences
    something. Citta is not like a physical phenomenon which does not experience anything. We
    listen to music which was written by a composer. It was citta which had the idea for the
    music; it was citta which made the composer's hand move in order to write down the notes.
    His hand could not have moved without citta. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Citta can achieve many different effects. We read in the
    'Atthasalini'; (a commentary to the Dhammasangani, which is the first book of the
    Abhidhamma) Book I, Part II, Analysis of Terms, 64: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">How is consciousness (i.e.mind ) capable of producing a
      variety or diversity of effects in action? <br>
      There is no art in the world more variegated than the art of painting. In painting, the
      painter's masterpiece is more artistic than the rest of his pictures. An artistic design
      occurs to the painters of masterpieces that such and such pictures should be drawn in such
      and such a way. Through this artistic design there arise operations of the mind (or
      artistic operations) accomplishing such <br>
      things as sketching the outline, putting on the paint, touching up, and embellishing...
      Thus all classes of arts in the world, specific or generic, are achieved by the mind. And
      owing to its capacity thus to produce a variety or diversity of effects in action, the
      mind, which achieves all these arts, is itself artistic like the arts themselves. Nay, it
      is even more artistic than the art itself, because the latter cannot execute every design
      perfectly. For that reason the Blessed One has said, 'Monks, have you seen a masterpiece
      of painting?' 'Yes, Lord.' 'Monks, that masterpiece of art is designed by the mind.
      Indeed, monks, the mind is even more artistic than that masterpiece.'</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We then read about the many different things which are
    accomplished by citta: good deeds such as deeds of generosity and bad deeds such as deeds
    of cruelty and deceit are accomplished by citta and these deeds produce different results.
    There is not just one type of citta, but many different types of cittas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Different people react differently to what they
    experience, thus, different types of citta arise. What one person likes, another dislikes.
    We can also notice how different people are when they make or produce something. Even when
    two <br>
    people plan to make the same thing the result is quite different. For example, when two
    people make a painting of the same tree, the paintings are not at all the same. People
    have different talents and capacities; some people have no difficulty with their studies,
    whereas others are incapable of study. Cittas are beyond control; they have each their own
    conditions for their arising. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Why are people so different from one another? The reason
    is that they have different experiences in life and thus they accumulate different
    inclinations. When a child has been taught from his youth to be generous he accumulates
    generosity. People who are angry very often accumulate a great deal of anger. We all have
    accumulated different inclinations, tastes and skills. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Each citta which arises falls away completely and is
    succeeded by the next citta. How then can there be accumulations of experiences in life,
    accumulations of good and bad inclinations? The reason is that each citta which falls away
    is succeeded by the next citta. Our life is an uninterrupted series of cittas and each
    citta conditions the next citta and this again the next, and thus the past can condition
    the present. It is a fact that our good cittas and bad cittas in the past condition our
    inclinations today. Thus, good and bad inclinations are accumulated. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We all have accumulated many impure inclinations and
    defilements (in Pali:kilesa). Kilesa is for instance greed (lobha), anger (dosa) and
    ignorance (moha). There are different degrees of defilements: there are subtle defilements
    or latent tendencies, medium defilements and gross defilements. Subtle defilements do not
    appear with the citta, but they are latent tendencies which are accumulated in the citta.
    At the time we are asleep and not dreaming there are no akusala cittas but there are
    unwholesome latent tendencies. When we wake up akusala cittas arise again. How could they
    appear if there were not in each citta accumulated unwholesome latent tendencies? Even
    when the citta is not akusala there are unwholesome latent tendencies so long as they have
    not been eradicated by wisdom. Medium defilement is different from subtle defilement since
    it arises with the citta. Medium defilement arises with cittas rooted in lobha, dosa and
    moha. Medium defilement is, for example, attachment to what one sees, or ears or
    experiences through the body-sense, or aversion towards the objects one experiences.
    Medium defilement does not condition ill deeds. Gross defilement conditons unwholesome
    actions (akusala kamma) through body, speech and mind, such as killing, slandering or the
    desire to take away other people's possessions. Kamma (intention) is a mental phenomenon
    and thus it can be accumulated. People accumulate different defilements and different
    kammas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Different accumulations of kamma are the condition for
    different results in life. This is the law of kamma and vipaka, of cause and result. We
    see that people are born into different circumstances. Some people live in agreeable
    surroundings and they have many pleasant experiences in their lives. Other people may
    often have disagreeable experiences; they are poor or they suffer from ill health. When we
    hear about children who suffer from malnutrition, we wonder why they have to suffer while
    other children receive everything they need. The Buddha taught that everyone receives the
    result of his own deeds. A deed or kamma of the past can bring its result later on,
    because akusala kamma and kusala kamma are accumulated. When there are the right
    conditions the result can be brought about in the form of vipaka. When the word 'result'
    is used, people may think of the consequences of their deeds for other people, but
    'result' in the sense of vipaka has a different meaning. Vipakacitta is a citta which
    experiences something unpleasant or something pleasant and this citta is the result of a
    deed we did ourselves. We are used to thinking of a self which experiences unpleasant <br>
    and pleasant things. However, there is no self; there are only cittas which experience
    different objects. Some cittas are cause; they can motivate good deeds or bad deeds which
    are capable of bringing about their appropriate results. Some cittas are result or vipaka.
    When we see something unpleasant, it is not self which sees; it is a citta,
    seeing-consciousness, which is the result of an unwholesome deed (akusala kamma) we
    performed either in this life or in a past life. This kind of citta is akusala vipaka.
    When we see something pleasant, it is a citta which is kusala vipaka the result of a
    wholesome deed we performed. Every time we experience an unpleasant. object through one of
    the five senses, there is akusala vipaka Every time we experience a pleasant object
    through one of the five senses there is kusala vipaka. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">lf one is being hit by someone else, the pain one feel is
    not the vipaka (result) of the deed performed by the other person. The person who is being
    hit receives the result of a bad deed he performed himself; for him there is akusala
    vipaka through the body-sense. The other person's action is only the proximate cause of
    his pain. As regards the other person who performs the bad deed, it is his akusala citta
    which motivates that deed. Sooner or later he will receive the result of his own bad deed.
    When we have more understanding of kamma and vipaka we will see many events of our life
    more clearly. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The 'Atthasalini' (Book I, Analysis of Terms, Part II, 65)
    explains that kamma of different people causes different results at birth and all through
    life. Even bodily features are the rest of kamma. We read: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">...ln dependence on the difference in kamma appears the
      difference in the destiny of beings without legs with two legs, four legs, many legs,
      vegetative, spiritual. with perception, without perception, with neither perception nor
      without perception. Depending on the difference in kamma appears the difference in the
      births of beings, high and low, base and exalted, happy and miserable. Depending on the
      difference in kamma appears the difference in the individual features of beings as
      beautiful or ugly, high-born or low-born, well-built or deformed. Depending on the
      difference in kamma appears the difference in the worldly conditions of beings <br>
      as gain and loss, fame and disgrace, blame and praise, happiness and misery.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Further on we read: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">By kamma the world moves, by kamma men Live, and by kamma
      are all beings bound As by its pin the rolling chariot wheel.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha taught that everything arises because of
    conditions; it is not by chance that people are so different in bodily features and
    characters, and that they live in such different circumstances. Even the difference in
    bodily features of animals is due to different kamma. Animals have cittas too; they may
    behave badly or they may behave well. Thus they accumulate different kammas which produce
    different results. lf we understand that each kamma brings about its own result, we will
    know that there is no reason to be proud if we are born into a rich family or if we
    receive praise, honour or other pleasant things. When we have to suffer we will understand
    that suffering is due to our own deeds. Thus we will be less inclined to blame other
    people for our unhappiness or to be jealous when others receive pleasant things. When we
    understand reality we know that it is not self who receiver something pleasant or who has
    to suffer; it is only vipaka a citta which arises because of conditions and which falls
    away immediately. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We see that people who are born into the same
    circumstances still behave differently. For example, among people who are born into rich
    families, some are stingy, others are not. The fact that one is born into a rich family is
    the result of kamma. Stinginess is conditioned by one's accumulated defilements. There are
    many different types of conditions which play their parts in the life of each person.
    Kamma causes one to be born into certain circumstances and one's accumulated tendencies
    condition one's character. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One may have doubts about past lives and future lives,
    since one only experiences the present life. However, in the present life we notice that
    different people experience different results. These results must have their causes in the
    past. The past conditions the present and the deeds we perform now will bring about their
    results in the future. In understanding the present we will be able to know more about the
    past and the future. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Past, present and future lives are an unbroken series of
    cittas. Each citta which arises falls away immediately to be succeeded by the next citta.
    Cittas do not last, but there isn't any moment without citta. If there were moments
    without citta the body would be a dead body. Even when we are sound asleep there is citta.
    Each citta which arises falls away but it conditions the next citta and even so the last
    citta of this life conditions the first citta of the next life, the rebirth-
    consciousness. Thus we see that life goes on and on. We are moving in a cycle, the cycle
    of birth and death. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next citta cannot arise until the previous citta has
    passed away. There can be only one citta at a time, but cittas arise and fall away so
    rapidly that one has the impression that there can be more than one citta at a time. We
    may think that we can see and hear at the same time, but in reality each of these cittas
    arises at a different moment. We can verify through our own experience that seeing is a
    type of citta which is different from hearing; these cittas arise because of different
    conditions and experience different objects. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A citta is that which experiences something; it
    experiences an object. Each citta must experience an object, there cannot be any citta
    without on object. Cittas experience different objects through the six doors of eyes,
    ears, nose, tongue, body-sense and mind. Seeing is a citta experiencing that which appears
    through the eyes. We can use the word 'visible object' for the object which is seen but it
    is not necessary to name it 'visible object'. When visible object contacts the eye-sense
    there are conditions for seeing. Seeing is different from thinking about what we see ; the
    latter is a type of citta which experiences something through the mind-door. Hearing is a
    citta which is different from seeing; it has different conditions and it experiences a
    different object. When sound contacts the ear-sense, there are conditions for a citta
    which experiences sound. There have to be the right conditions for the arising of each
    citta. We cannot smell through the ears and taste with the eyes. A citta which smells
    experiences odour through the nose. A citta which tastes experiences flavour through the
    tongue. A citta which experiences a bodily impression experiences this through the
    body-sense. Through the mind-door citta can experience all kinds of objects. There can be
    only one citta at a time and citta can experience only one object at a time. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We may understand in theory that a citta which sees has a
    characteristic which is different from a citta which hears, and that citta is different
    from a physical phenomenon which does not experience anything. Knowing this may seem quite
    simple to us, but theoretical knowledge is different from knowing the truth by one's own
    experience. Theoretical knowledge is not very deep; it cannot eradicate the concept of
    self. Only in being aware of phenomena as they appear through the six doors, will we know
    the truth by our own experience. This kind of understanding can eradicate the concept of
    self. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The objects which we experience are the world in which we
    live. At the moment we see, the world is visible object. The world of visible object does
    not last, it falls away immediately. When we hear, the world is sound, but it falls away
    again. We are absorbed in and infatuated by the objects we experience through eyes, ears,
    nose, tongue, body-sense and mind-door, but not one of these objects lasts. What is
    impermanent should not be taken for self. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the 'Gradual Savings' (Book of the Fours, Ch.V,par. 5,
    Rohitassa) we read that Rohitassa, a deva, asked the Buddha about reaching the world's
    end. He said to the Buddha: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Pray, lord, is it possible for us, by going, to know, to
      see, to reach world's end, where there is no more being born or growing old, no more
      dying, no more falling (from one existence) and rising up (in another)?' </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Your reverence, where there is no more being born or
      growing old, no more dying, no more falling from one existence and rising up in another, I
      declare that that end of the world is not by going to be known, seen or reached.' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'It is wonderful, lord! It is marvellous, lord, how well
      it is said by the Exalted One: &quot;Where there is no more being born...  that end of
      the world is not by going to be known, seen or reached!&quot; ' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Formerly, lord, I was the hermit called Rohitassa,
      Bhoja's son, one of psychic power, a sky-walker...  The extent of my stride was as the
      distance between the eastern and the western oceans. To me, lord, possessed of such speed
      and of such a stride, there came a longing thus: I will reach world's end by going.' 'But,
      lord, not to speak of (the time spent over) food and drink, eating, tasting and calls of
      nature, not to speak of struggles to banish sleep and weariness, though my life-span was a
      hundred years, though I lived a hundred years, though I travelled a hundred years, yet I
      reached not world's end but died ere that. Wonderful indeed, lord! Marvellous it is, lord,
      how well it has been said by the Exalted One: &quot;Your reverence, where there is no more
      being born...  that end of the world is not by going to be known, seen or reached.&quot;
      ' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'But, your reverence, I declare not that there is any
      making an end of ill without reaching world's end. Nay, your reverence, in this very
      fathom-long body, along with its perceptions and thoughts, I proclaim the world to be,
      likewise the origin of the world and the <br>
      making of the world to end, likewise the practice going to the ending of the world. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Not to be reached by going is world's end. <br>
      Yet there is no release for man from ill. <br>
      Unless he reach world's end -Then let a man <br>
      Become world-knower, wise, world-ender, <br>
      Let him be one who lives the holy life. <br>
      Knowing the world's end by becoming calmed. <br>
      He longs not for this world or another';. <br>
      (In Pali: Brahmacariya.)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha taught people about the 'world' and the way to
    reach the end of the world, that is, the end of suffering. The way to realize this is
    knowing the world, that is, knowing 'this very fathom-long body, along with its
    perceptions and thoughts', knowing oneself. </font></p>
