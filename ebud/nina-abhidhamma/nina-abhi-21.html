    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">W</font><font face="Times New Roman">e would like
    to have more wholesomeness in our life, but often we are unable to do wholesome deeds, to
    speak in a wholesome way or to think wholesome thoughts. Our accumulated defilements
    hinder us in the performing of kusala. We learn from the Buddhist teachings that there are
    'hindrances' (nivarana), which are akusala cetasikas, arising with akusala cittas. We all
    have these hindrances. They are: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- sensuous desire, in Pali: kamacchandha <br>
      - ill-will, in Pali: vyapada <br>
      - torpor and languor, in Pali: thina and middha <br>
      - restlessness and worry, in Pali: uddhacca and kukkucca <br>
      - doubt, in Pali: vicikiccha</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kamacchandha or sensuous desire is the cetasika which is
    lobha (attachment). It is attachment to the objects we can experience through the
    sense-doors and the mind-door. We all have kamacchandha in different forms and
    intensities. Because of economic progress and technical inventions there is more
    prosperity in life. One can afford more things which make life pleasant and comfortable.
    This, however, does not bring contentedness; on the contrary, we are not satisfied with
    what we have and we are forever looking for more enjoyment and happiness. There is
    kamacchandha with our deeds, words and thoughts. Even when we think that we are doing good
    deeds and helping others, kamacchandha can arise. Kamacchandha makes us restless and
    unhappy. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Vyapada or ill-will is the cetasika which is dosa. Vyapada
    can trouble us many times a day; we feel irritated about other people or about things
    which happen in life. Vyapada prevents us from kusala. When there is vyapada we cannot
    have lovingkindness and compassion for other people. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thina and middha are translated as 'torpor' and 'languor',
    or as 'sloth' and 'torpor'. Thina and middha cause us to have lack of energy for kusala.
    The 'Visuddhimagga' (XIV, 167) states concerning thina and middha : </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">... Herein, stiffness (thina) has the characteristic of
      lack of driving power. Its function is to remove energy. It is manifested as subsiding.
      Torpor (middha) has the characteristic of unwieldiness. Its function is to smother. It is
      manifested as laziness, or it is manifested as nodding and sleep. The proximate cause of
      both is unwise attention to boredom, sloth, and so on.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Don't we all have moments in a day when there is laziness
    and lack of energy to perform kusala? When, for example, we are listening to the preaching
    of Dhamma or reading the scriptures, there are opportunities for kusala cittas. Instead,
    we may feel bored and we lack the energy for kusala. It may happen that we see someone
    else who needs our help, but we are lazy and do not move. Then we are hindered by thina
    and middha. Thina and middha make the mind unwieldy (Vis XIV 105, where the hindrances are
    mentioned as being specifically obstructive to jhana.). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Uddhacca is translated as 'agitation' or 'excitement' and
    kukkucca as 'worry' or 'flurry'. Uddhacca arises with each and every type of akusala
    citta. It prevents the citta from wholesomeness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As regards kukkucca, worry, the 'Visuddhimagga' (XIV, 174)
    states: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">...It has subsequent regret as its characteristic. Its
      function is to sorrow about what has and what has not been done, It is manifested as
      remorse. Its proximate cause is what has and what has not been done. It should be regarded
      as slavery.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we have done something wrong or we have not done the
    good deed we should have done, we might be inclined to think about it again and again. We
    may ask ourselves why we acted in the way we did, but we cannot change what is past
    already. While we worry we have akusala cittas; worry makes us enslaved. Uddhacca and
    kukkucca prevent us from being tranquil. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As regards vicikiccha, doubt, there are many kinds of
    doubt. One may have doubts about the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, or doubt about the
    Eightfold Path. Doubt is akusala and a hindrance to the performing of Kusala. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All of the hindrances are obstructions to the performing
    of kusala. Is there a way to eliminate them? Samatha or the development of calm is a way
    to temporarily eliminate the hindrances. The calm which is developed in samatha has to be
    wholesome calm, it cannot arise with akusala citta. There is a degree of calm with each
    kusala citta but it is hard to know the characteristic of calm precisely, because there
    are bound to be akusala cittas very shortly after the kusala cittas. In order to develop
    the calm which is temporary freedom from the hindrances, right understanding (panna) is
    indispensable. If one merely tries to concentrate on a meditation subject without right
    understanding of kusala and akusala and of the characteristic of calm, calm cannot grow.
    The panna of samatha does not eradicate defilements, but it knows the characteristic of
    calm and it knows how it can be developed by means of a suitable meditation subject.
    Akusala citta is likely to arise time and again, also when one applies oneself to samatha.
    One may be attached to silence and then there is akusala citta instead of the calm of
    samatha. Or one may think that when there is no pleasant feeling nor unpleasant feeling
    but indifferent feeling there is calm. However, indifferent feeling can arise with kusala
    citta as well as with akusala citta; lobha-mula-citta can be accompanied by indifferent
    feeling and moha-mula-citta is invariably accompanied by indifferent feeling. Thus, when
    there is indifferent feeling it may seem that one is calm, but there is not necessarily
    the wholesome calm of samatha. The panna of samatha must be very keen in order to
    recognize the defilements which arise, even when they are more subtle. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We read in the scriptures about people who could attain
    jhana if they cultivated the right conditions for it. Before the Buddha's enlightenment
    jhana was the highest form of kusala people could attain. Jhana, which is sometimes
    translated as absorption, is a high degree of calm. At the moment of jhanacitta one is
    free from sense-impressions and from the defilements which are bound up with them. The
    attainment of jhana is extremely difficult, not everybody who develops samatha can attain
    it. However, even if one has no intention to cultivate jhana there can be conditions for
    moments of calm in daily life if there is right understanding of the characteristic of
    calm and of the way to develop it. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the cultivation of samatha one develops five cetasikas
    which can eliminate the hindrances; they are the jhana-factors. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first jhana-factor is vitakka, which is translated
    into English as 'applied thinking'. Vitakka is a mental factor (cetasika) which arises
    with many kinds of citta ; it can arise with kusala citta as well as with akusala citta.
    When the wholesome kind of vitakka is developed in samatha it is one of the jhana-factors.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The 'Visuddhimagga' (lV, 88) states concerning vitakka: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">... Herein, applied thinking (vitakkana) is applied
      thought (vitakka); hitting upon, is what is meant. It has the characteristic of directing
      the mind onto an object (mounting the mind on its object). Its function is to touch and
      strike-- for the meditator is said, in virtue of it, to have the object touched at by
      applied thought, struck by applied thought. It is manifested as the leading of the mind
      onto an object...</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Vitakka, when it is a jhana-factor, is opposed to thina
    and middha (sloth and torpor). In 'thinking' of the meditation-subject vitakka helps to
    inhibit thina and middha temporarily. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another jhana-factor is vicara, which is translated as
    'sustained thinking'. This cetasika arises with different kinds of citta, but when it is
    developed in samatha, it is a jhana-factor. The 'Visuddhimagga' (IV, 88) states concerning
    vicara: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">... Sustained thinking (vicarana) is sustained thought
      (vicara); continued sustainment (anusancarana), is what is meant. It has the
      characteristic of continued pressure on (occupation with) the object. Its function is to
      keep conascent (mental) states (occupied) with that. It is manifested as keeping
      consciousness anchored (on that object).</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In samatha, vicara keeps the citta anchored on the
    meditation subject. When we continue to think of wholesome subjects such as the Buddha's
    virtues or his teachings there is no vicikiccha or doubt. Vicara helps to inhibit doubt. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another jhana-factor is piti, translated as 'rapture',
    'enthusiasm' or 'happiness'. Piti arises also with akusala cittas, but when it is
    developed in samatha it is a jhana-factor. The 'Visuddhimagga' (IV, 94) states concerning
    piti: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">...It refreshes (pinayati), thus it is happiness (piti).
      It has the characteristic of endearing (sampiyayana). Its function is to refresh the body
      and the mind; or its function is to pervade (thrill with rapture). It is manifested as
      elation. But it is of five kinds as minor happiness, momentary happiness, showering
      happiness, uplifting happiness, and pervading (rapturous) happiness.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the 'Visuddhimagga' (IV, 99) the jhana-factor
    piti is the 'pervading happiness' which is the root of absorption and comes by growth into
    association with absorption. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When piti is developed in samatha it inhibits the
    hindrance which is ill-will (vyapada). However, keen understanding is needed in order to
    know whether there is akusala piti which arises with attachment or kusala piti. Even when
    one thinks that there is wholesome enthusiasm about a meditation subject, there may be
    clinging. The jhana-factor piti takes an interest in the meditation subject without
    clinging. Wholesome piti which delights in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha or in
    another meditation subject refreshes the mind and then there is no aversion, no boredom as
    to kusala. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another jhana-factor is sukha. This jhana-factor is not
    bodily pleasant feeling (sukha vedana), but it is somanassa or mental happy feeling. Sukha
    which is developed in samatha is happy feeling about a meditation subject. However, as we
    know, happy feeling arises also with attachment. Panna should know precisely when happy
    feeling is akusala and when it is kusala. The jhana-factor which is wholesome sukha
    inhibits the hindrances which are restlessness and worry (uddhacca and kukkucca). When
    there is wholesome happy feeling about a meditation subject there is no restlessness and
    no worry. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Piti and sukha are not the same. Sukha, which is
    translated as happiness, bliss, ease or joy, is happy feeling. Piti, which is translated
    as joy, rapture, zest, and sometimes also as happiness, is not feeling; it is not
    vedanakkhandha, but sankharakkhandha (the khandha which is all the cetasikas, except
    vedana and sanna). When reading the English translations, we have to find out from the
    context which cetasika is referred to, piti or sukha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The 'Visuddhimagga' (IV, 100) states concerning the
    difference between happiness (piti) and bliss (sukha): </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And wherever the two are associated, happiness (piti) is
      the contentedness at getting a desirable object, and bliss (sukha) is the actual
      experiencing of it when got. Where there is happiness there is bliss (pleasure); but where
      there is bliss there is not necessarily happiness. Happiness is included in the
      sankharakkhandha; bliss is included in the vedanakkhandha (feeling). If a man exhausted in
      a desert saw or heard about a pond on the edge of a wood, he would have happiness; if he
      went into the wood's shade and used the water, he would have bliss...</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The jhana-factor which is samadhi or concentration is the
    cetasika which is ekaggata cetasika. This cetasika arises with every citta and its
    function is to focus on an object. Each citta can have only one object and ekaggata
    cetasika focuses on that one object. Ekaggata cetasika or samadhi can: be kusala as well
    as akusala. Samadhi when it is developed. in samatha is wholesome concentration on a
    meditation subject.) Together with samadhi there must be right understanding which knows
    precisely when the citta is kusala citta and when akusala citta and which knows how to
    develop calm, otherwise the right concentration of samatha will not grow. If one tries
    very hard to concentrate without there being right understanding there may be attachment
    to one's effort to become concentrated, or, if one cannot become concentrated, aversion
    may arise. Then calm cannot grow. If there is right understanding there are conditions for
    samadhi to develop. The 'Visuddhimagga' (XIV, 139) states concerning samadhi: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">It puts (adhiyati) consciousness evenly (samam) on the
      object, or it puts it rightly (samma) on it, or it is just the mere collecting (samadhana)
      of the mind, thus it is concentration (samadhi). Its characteristic is non-wandering, or
      its characteristic is non-distraction. Its function is to conglomerate conascent states as
      water does bath powder. It is manifested as peace. Usually its proximate cause is bliss.
      It should be regarded as steadiness of the mind, like the steadiness of a lamp's flame
      when there is no draught.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Samadhi inhibits kamacchandha (sensuous desire). When
    there is right concentration on a subject of meditation, one is at that moment not
    hindered by kamacchandha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Summarizing the five jhana-factors, necessary for the
    attainment of the first stage of jhana, they are: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- vitakka,which is translated as applied thinking. <br>
      - vicara,which is translated as sustained thinking. <br>
      - piti,which is translated as enthusiasm, rapture or happiness. <br>
      - sukha,which is translated as happy feeling or bliss. <br>
      - samadhi, which is concentration. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The jhana-factors have to be developed in order to
    temporarily eliminate the hindrances. For the person who wants to develop the
    jhana-factors and attain jhana a great deal of preparation is required. We read in the
    'Visuddhimagga' (II, 1; III, 1) that the person who wants to cultivate samatha should be
    well established in sila (morality), which is purified by such qualities as fewness of
    wishes, contentment, effacement, seclusion, energy, and, modest needs. In observing some
    of the ascetic practices (as described in Ch. II of the 'Visuddhimagga'), which pertain
    mostly to the monk with regard to the use of his robes, his almsfood and his place of
    dwelling, virtue will become more perfected. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Buddha's time laypeople too could attain jhana, if
    they would lead a life which was compatible with its development (An example is Nanda's
    mother, about whom we read in the 'Gradual Sayings', Book of the Sevens, Ch. V, par, 10.),
    One should lead a secluded life and many conditions have to be fulfilled. Jhana is quite
    incompatible with sense-desires. One has to be 'quite secluded from sense-desires...' in
    order to attain the first jhana, as we read in many suttas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The 'Visuddhimagga' (IV, 81) explains: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">When absoluteness is introduced thus 'quite secluded from
      sense desires', what is expressed is this: sense desires are certainly incompatible with
      this jhana: when they exist, it does not occur, just as when there is darkness, there is
      no lamplight; and it is only by letting go of them that it is reached just as the further
      bank is reached by letting go of the near bank. That is why absoluteness is introduced. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus we see that the development of jhana is not for
    everyone. Jhana cannot be attained if one leads a 'worldly life', full of sense-pleasures,
    instead of a life of 'fewness of wishes, seclusion, modest needs'. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The 'Visuddhimagga' (III, 129) also states that one should
    sever any impediments to the development of samatha. Among them are one's dwelling,
    travelling and sickness. These can be hindrances to samatha. One should avoid living in a
    monastery which, for various reasons, is unfavourable to the development of samatha. Thus,
    even before one starts to develop samatha, many conditions have to be fulfilled. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For the development of samatha one has to apply oneself to
    a suitable subject of meditation. There are forty meditation subjects which can condition
    calm and they are the following: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">10 kasina exercises, which are, for example, coloured
      disks, a piece of earth, light. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">10 loathsome subjects (in Pali: asubha), the 'cemetery
      meditations'. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">10 recollections, comprising the recollection of the
      Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha, virtue, generosity, deities, and also the recollections
      which are: mindfulness of death, mindfulness of the body, mindfulness of breathing and the
      recollection of peace (nibbana). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The perception of repulsiveness in nutriment. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The definition of the four elements (earth, water, fire
      and wind). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">4 brahma-viharas (divine abidings) comprising:
      lovingkindness (metta), compassion (karuna), altruistic joy (mudita) and equanimity
      (upekkha) which, in this case, is not upekkha vedans or neutral feeling, but the wholesome
      cetasika which is tatramajjhattata. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">4 meditation subjects for the development of the
      arupa-jhanas (immaterial jhanas), which will be mentioned later on. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Not all subjects are suitable for everybody, it depends on
    the individual which subject is a means for him to become calm. If there is right
    understanding of the way to become calm by means of a suitable meditation subject calm can
    grow, even in our daily life. Metta and karuna, for instance, can and should be developed
    in our daily life, when we are in the company of other people and then there are kusala
    cittas instead of akusala cittas. Recollection on the Dhamma includes also reflection on
    the teachings and this is beneficial for everybody; it helps one to begin to understand
    one's life. While we reflect with kusala citta on the teachings or on one of the other
    meditation subjects, there are moments of calm if we do not cling to calm. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the 'Visuddhimagga' it is explained how one can develop
    higher degrees of calm by means of a meditation subject. It is explained (Vis. III, 119)
    that meditation subjects are learned by sight, by touch and by hearsay (words), depending
    on the nature of the subject. As regards the subjects which are learned by sight (such as
    nine of the kesinas and the 'ten cemetery-meditations'), the 'Visuddhimagga' (IV, 31)
    states that in the beginning one has to look closely at the meditation subject and later
    on one acquires a 'mental image' ('sign', in Pali: nimitta) of it; one no longer needs to
    look at the original object. At first the mental image is still unsteady and unclear, but
    later on it appears 'a hundred times, a thousand times more purified...' The original
    object, for example a coloured disk or a piece of earth, could have flaws, but the
    perfected mental image which one acquires when one is more advanced, does not have the
    imperfections of the original object one was looking at in the beginning. This perfected
    mental image is called the 'counterpart sign' (patibhaga nimitta). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the moment the 'counterpart sign' arises, there is a
    higher degree of calm and concentration is more developed. This stage is called 'access
    concentration' (upacara samadhi). The citta is not jhanacitta, it is still kamavacara
    citta (of the sense-sphere), but the hindrances do not arise at the moment of 'access
    concentration'. However, the jhana-factors are not developed enough yet for the attainment
    of jhana and now one has to cultivate the right conditions in order to attain jhana.
    'Access concentration' is already very difficult to attain, but 'guarding the sign' which
    has to be done in order to attain jhana is also very difficult. One has to 'guard the
    sign' (nimitta) in order not to lose the perfected mental image one has developed. The
    conditions for guarding the sign are, among others, the right dwelling-place, suitable
    food, avoidance of aimless talk. One should ' balance' the 'five faculties' (indriyas)
    which are the following cetasikas: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">- saddha (confidence in wholesomeness) <br>
      - viriya (energy) <br>
      - sati (mindfulness) <br>
      - samadhi (concentration) <br>
      - panna (wisdom) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Confidence should be balanced with wisdom so that one has
    not confidence uncritically and groundlessly. Concentration should be balanced with
    energy, because if there is too much energy and not enough concentration, there is a
    danger of becoming agitated and then one cannot attain jhana. If there is concentration
    but not enough energy there will be idleness and jhana cannot be attained either. All five
    indriyas should be balanced. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From the foregoing examples we see that samatha cannot be
    cultivated without a basic understanding of the realities taught in the Abhidhamma which
    are in fact the realities of daily life, and without careful consideration of them. One
    should know precisely when the citta is kusala citta and when it is akusala citta. One
    should know which realities the jhana-factors are and one should realize as regards
    oneself whether the jhana-factors are developed or not. One should know whether the
    cetasikas which are the five indriyas (faculties) are developed or not, whether they are
    balanced or not. If there is not the right understanding of all these different factors
    and conditions necessary for the attainment of 'access concentration' and of jhana, one is
    in danger of taking for 'access concentration' what is not 'access concentration' and
    taking for jhana what is not jhana. Neither 'access concentration' nor jhana can be
    attained without having cultivated the right conditions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Not all meditation subjects lead to jhana, some have only
    'access concentration' as their result, such as the recollections of the Buddha, the
    Dhamma and the Sangha. Some meditation subjects lead only to the first stage of rupa-jhana
    {Both rupa-jhana (material jhana) and arupa-jhana (immaterial where the meditation subject
    is no longer dependent on materiality) developed in different stages of jhana. When one is
    more advanced, can attain a higher stage of jhana. Arupa-jhana is more refined than
    rupa-jhana }, some to all stages of rupa-jhana. The meditation subject which is
    'mindfulness of breathing' can lead to all stages of rupa-jhana. This meditation subject
    which is considered by many to be relatively easy, is one of the most difficult. One has
    to be mindful of one's in-breath and out-breath where they touch the tip of the nose or
    the upper-lip. This meditation subject is not learnt by sight, but by touch : the
    in-breath and the out-breath are the 'sign' (nimitta) one has to continue one's attention
    to. We read in the 'Visuddhimagga' (VIII, 208): </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">For while other meditation subjects become clearer at each
      higher stage, this one does not: in fact, as he goes on developing it, it becomes more
      subtle for him at each higher stage, and it even comes to the point at which it is no
      longer manifest. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Further on (Vlll, 210, 211) we read: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">... This was why the Blessed One said: 'Bhikkhus, I do not
      say of one who is forgetful, who is not fully aware, (that he practises) development of
      mindfulness of breathing.' (Middle Length Sayings III, No. 118, 84) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although any meditation subject, no matter what, is
      successful only in one who is mindful and fully aware, yet any meditation subject other
      than this one gets more evident as he goes on giving it his attention. But this
      mindfulness of breathing is difficult, difficult to develop, a field in which only the
      minds of Buddhas, Pacceka Buddhas, and Buddhas' sons are at home. It is no trivial matter,
      nor can it be cultivated by trivial persons. In proportion as continued attention is given
      to it becomes more peaceful and more subtle. So strong mindfulness and understanding are
      necessary here. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mindfulness of breathing is very difficult, 'it is no
    trivial matter'. When one continues to be mindful of breathing, the in-breaths and
    out-breaths become more and more subtle and thus harder to notice. We just read in the
    quotation that strong mindfulness and understanding are necessary here. Not only in
    vipassana, but also in samatha, mindfulness (sati) and understanding (panna are necessary
    but the object of awareness in samatha is different from the object of awareness in
    vipassana. In samatha the object of awareness is the meditation subject and the aim is to
    develop calm. In vipassana the object of awareness is any nama or rupa which appears at
    the present moment through one of the six doors, in order to eradicate the wrong view of
    self and eventually all defilements. Through samatha the latent tendencies of defilements
    are not eradicated ; when there are conditions akusala cittas arise again. We read in the
    'Gradual Sayings' (Book of the Sixes, Ch. VI, par. 6, Citta Hatthisariputta) that even the
    monk who can attain jhana, may 'disavow the training' and return to the layman's life. We
    read that when the Buddha stayed near Varanasi in the Deer Park at Isipatana, a number of
    'elders' had a talk on Abhidhamma. Citta Hatthisariputta interrupted their talk from time
    to time. Maha Kotthita said to him: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Let not the venerable Citta Hatthisariputta constantly
      interrupt the elders' Abhidhamma talk ; the venerable Citta should wait until the talk is
      over!' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And when he had thus spoken, Citta's friends said : 'The
      venerable Maha Kotthita should not censure the venerable Citta Hatthisariputta. A wise man
      is the venerable Citta and able to talk to the elders on Abhidhamma.' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'It is a hard thing, sirs, for those who know not another
      person's ways of thought. Consider, sirs, a person who, so long as he lives near the
      Master or a fellow-teacher in the brahman life, is the most humble of the humble, the
      meekest of the meek, the quietest of the quiet ; and who, when he leaves the Master or his
      fellow-teachers, keeps company with monks, nuns, lay-disciples, men and women, rajahs,
      their ministers, course-setters or their disciples. Living in company, untrammeled, rude,
      given over to gossip, passion corrupts his heart ; and with his heart corrupted by
      passion, he disavows the baining and returns to the lower life. . .</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Consider again a person who, aloof from sensuous
      appetites... enters and abides in the first jhana. Thinking: 'I have won to the first
      jhana', he keeps company ...living in company, untrammeled, rude, given over to gossip,
      passion corrupts his heart ; and with his heart corrupted by passion, he disavows the
      training and returns to the lower life...'</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The same is said about the other stages of jhana. We then
    read that Citta Hatthisariputta disavowed the training and returned to the lower life. But
    not long after that he 'went forth' (became a monk) again. We read: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And the venerable Citta Hatthisariputta, living alone,
      secluded, earnest, ardent, resolved, not long after, entered and abode in that aim above
      all of the brahman life--realizing it here and now by his own knowledge--for the sake of
      which clansmen rightly go forth from home to the homeless life: and he knew: 'Birth is
      destroyed, the brahman life is lived, done is what was to be done, there is no more of
      this.' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And the venerable Citta Hatthisariputta was numbered among
      the arahats.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even if one can attain the highest stage of jhana, one's
    heart can still become 'corrupted by passion', as we read in the sutta. When Citta
    Hatthisariputta had attained arahatship, he had realized the 'aim above all of the brahman
    life'. The hindrances could not arise any more. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Through vipassana, hindrances are eradicated in the
    successive stages of enlightenment. The sotapanna (who has attained the first stage of
    enlightenment) has eradicated the hindrance which is doubt (vicikiccha); the anagami (who
    has attained the third stage of enlightenment) has eradicated the sensuous desire
    (kamacchandha), ill-will (vyapada) and worry (kukkucca); the arahat has eradicated sloth
    and torpor (thina and middha) and restlessness (uddhacca), he has eradicated all
    defilements. </font></p>
