    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-ooOoo-</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha discovered the truth of all phenomena. He knew
    the characteristic of each phenomenon by his own experience. Out of compassion he taught
    other people to see reality in many different ways, so that they would have a deeper
    understanding of the phenomena in and around themselves. When realities are classified by
    way of paramattha dhammas (absolute realities), they are classified as: citta, cetasika,
    rupa, nibbana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Citta, cetasika and rupa are conditioned realities
    (sankhara dhammas). They arise because of conditions and fall away again; they are
    impermanent. One paramattha dhamma, nibbana, is an unconditioned reality (visankhara
    dhamma); it does not arise and fall away. All four paramattha dhammas are anatta, not
    self. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Citta, cetasika and rupa which are conditioned realities,
    can be classified by way of the five khandhas. Khandha means 'group' or 'aggregate'. They
    are: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Rupakkhandha, which are all physical phenomena. <br>
      2. Vedanakkhandha, which is feeling (vedana). <br>
      3. Sannakkhandha, which is perception (sanna). <br>
      4. Sankharakkhandha, comprising fifty cetasikas. <br>
      5. Vinnanakkhandha, comprising all cittas. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fifty-two kinds of cetasika are classified as three
    khandhas: a cetasika which is feeling (vedana) is classified as one khandha, the
    vedanakkhandha; a cetasika which is perception (sanna) is classified as one khandha, the
    sannakkhandha; as regards the other tiny cetasikas, they are classified all together as
    one khandha, the sankharakkhandha. For example, in sankharakkhandha are included the
    following cetasikas: 'intention' (cetana), attachment (lobha), aversion (dosa), ignorance
    (moha), lovingkindness (metta), generosity (alobha) and wisdom (panna). Sankharakkhandha
    is sometimes translated as 'activities' or ' mental formations'. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As regards citta, all cittas are one khandha:
    vinnanakkhandha. The Pali terms vinnana, mano and citta are three terms for the same
    reality: that which has the characteristic of knowing or experiencing something. When
    citta is classified as khandha the word vinnana is used. Thus, the five khandhas are
    grouped as one rupakkhandha, and four namakkhandha. Three namakkhandhas are fifty-two
    cetasikas; the other namakkhandha is eighty-nine or one hundred and twenty-one cittas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nibbana is not a khandha; it is void of khandha (in Pali:
    khandha-vimutti). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The ' Visuddhimagga' (XX,96) explains about the arising
    and falling away of nama and rupa: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is no heap or store of unarisen nama-rupa (existing)
      prior to its arising. When it arises it does not come from any heap or store; and when it
      ceases. it does not go in any direction. There is nowhere any depositor in the way of a
      heap or store or hoard of what has ceased. But just as there is no store, prior to its
      arising, of the sound that arises when a lute is played, nor does it come from any store
      when it arises, nor does it go in any direction when it ceases, nor does it persist as a
      store when it has ceased, but on the contrary, not having been, it is brought into being
      owing to the lute, the lute's neck, and the man's appropriate effort, and having been, it
      vanishes - - so too all material and immaterial states (rupa and nama), not having been,
      are brought into being, having been, they vanish. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The khandhas are real; we can experience them. We
    experience Rupakkhandha when, for example, we feel hardness. It does not stay; it arises
    and falls away. Not only rupas of the body, but the other physical phenomena are
    rupakkhandha as well. For example, sound is rupakkhandha; it arises and falls away, it is
    impermanent. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Vedanakkhandha (feeling) is real; we can experience
    feelings. Vedanakkhandha comprises all kinds of feeling. Feeling can be classified in
    different ways. Sometimes feelings are classified as threefold: pleasant feeling,
    unpleasant feeling, neutral feeling. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes they are classified as fivefold: pleasant
    feeling, unpleasant feeling and indifferent feeling, bodily pleasant feeling, bodily
    painful feeling. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Bodily feeling is feeling which has body-sense, the rupa
    which has the capacity to receive bodily impressions, as condition. The feeling itself is
    nama, but it has rupa (body-sense) as condition. When an object contacts the body-sense,
    the feeling is either painful or pleasant; there is no indifferent bodily feeling. When
    the bodily feeling is unpleasant it is akusala vipaka (the result of an unwholesome deed),
    and when the bodily feeling is pleasant it is kusala vipaka (the result of a wholesome
    deed). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since there are many different moments of feeling arising
    and falling away it is difficult to distinguish them from each other. For instance, we are
    inclined to confuse bodily pleasant feeling which is vipaka and the pleasant feeling which
    may arise shortly afterwards together with attachment to that pleasant bodily feeling. Or
    we may confuse bodily pain and unpleasant feeling which may arise afterwards together with
    aversion. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When there is bodily pain, the painful feeling is vipaka,
    it accompanies the vipakacitta which experiences the object impinging on the body-sense.
    Unpleasant (mental) feeling may arise afterwards; it is not vipaka, but accompanies the
    akusala citta. It arises because of our accumulated dosa (aversion). Though 'bodily'
    feeling and 'mental' feeling are both nama, they are entirely different kinds of feelings,
    arising because of different conditions. When there are no more conditions for dosa there
    can still be bodily painful feeling, but there is no longer (mental) unpleasant feeling.
    The arahat may still have akusala vipaka as long as his life is not terminated yet, but he
    has no aversion. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We read in the 'Kindred Sayings' (I, Sagatha-vagga, the
    Marasuttas, Ch. II, par. 3, The Splinter): </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus have I heard: The Exalted One was once staying at
      Rajagaha, in the Maddakucchi, at the Deer-preserve. Now at that time his foot was injured
      by a splinter. Sorely indeed did the Exalted One feel it, grievous the pains he suffered
      in the body, keen and sharp, acute, distressing and unwelcome. He truly bore them, mindful
      and deliberate, nor was he cast down.... </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Feelings are sixfold when they are classified by way of
    the six doors: there is feeling which arises through the eyes, the ears, the nose, the
    tongue, the body-sense and the mind. All these feelings are different; they arise because
    of different conditions. Feeling arises and falls away together with the citta it
    accompanies and thus at each moment feeling is different. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We read in the 'Kindred Sayings' (IV, Salayatana-vagga,
    Part II, Kindred Sayings about Feeling, par. 8, Sickness II) that the Buddha said to the
    monks: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">... Monks, a monk should meet his end collected and
      composed. This is our instruction to you. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">...Now, monks, as that monk dwells collected, composed,
      earnest, ardent, strenuous, there arises in him feeling that is pleasant, and he thus
      understands: 'There is arisen in me this pleasant feeling. Now that is owing to something,
      not without cause. It is owing to this contact. Now this contact is impermanent,
      compounded, arisen owing to something. Owing to this impermanent contact which has so
      arisen, this pleasant feeling has arisen : How can that be permanent?' Thus he dwells
      contemplating the impermanence in contact and pleasant feeling, contemplating their
      transience, their waning, their ceasing, the giving of them up. Thus as he dwells
      contemplating their impermanence.. the lurking tendency to lust for contact and pleasant
      feeling is abandoned in him. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">So also as regards contact and painful feeling...contact
      and neutral feeling.... </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are still many more ways of classifying feelings. If
    we know about different ways of classifying feelings it will help us to realize that
    feeling is only a mental phenomenon which arises because of conditions. We are inclined to
    cling to the feeling which has fallen away instead of being aware of the reality of the
    present moment as it appears through eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body-sense or mind. In the
    passage of the 'Visuddhimagga' which was quoted above (XX, 96) nama and rupa are compared
    to the sound of a lute which does not come from any 'store' when it arises, nor goes in
    any direction when it ceases, nor persists as a 'store' when it has ceased. However, we
    cling so much to feelings that we do not realize that the feeling which has fallen away
    does not exist any more, that it has ceased completely. Vedanakkhandha (feeling) is
    impermanent. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sannakkhandha (perception) is real; it can be experienced
    whenever we remember something. There is sanna with every moment of citta. Each citta
    which arises experiences an object and sanna which arises with the citta remembers and
    'marks' that object so that it can be recognized. Even when there is a moment that one
    does not recognize something citta still experiences an object at that moment and sanna
    which arises with the citta 'marks' that object. Sanna arises and falls away with the
    citta; sanna is impermanent. As long as we do not see sanna as it really is: only a mental
    phenomenon which falls away as soon as it has arisen, we will take sanna for self. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sankharakkhandha (the fifty cetasikas which are not vedana
    or sanna) is real; it can be experienced. When there are beautiful mental factors (sobhana
    cetasikas) such as generosity and compassion, or when there are unwholesome mental factors
    such as anger and stinginess, we can experience sankharakkhandha. All these phenomena
    arise and fall away: sankharakkhandha is impermanent. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Vinnanakkhandha (citta) is real; we can experience it when
    there is seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, receiving impressions through the body-sense
    or thinking. Vinnanakkhandha arises and falls away; it is impermanent. All sankhara
    dhammas (conditioned phenomenal), that is, the five khandhas, are impermanent. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes the khandhas are called the 'groups of grasping'
    (in Pali: upadanakkhandha). The upadanakkhandhas are the khandhas which are the objects of
    clinging. Those who are not arahats still cling to the khandhas. We take the body for
    self; thus we cling to rupakkhandha. We take mentality for self; thus we cling to
    vedanakkhandha, to sannakkhandha, to sankharakkhandha and to vinnanakkhandha. If we cling
    to the khandhas and if we do not see them as they are, we will have sorrow. As long as the
    khandhas are still 'objects of clinging' (upadanakkhandha) for us, we are like people
    afflicted by sickness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We read in the 'Kindred Sayings' (III, Khandha-vagga, the
    First Fifty, par. I, Nakulapitar) that the housefather Nakulapitar, who was an old, sick
    man, came to see the Buddha at Crocodile Haunt in the Deerpark. The Buddha said to him
    that he should train himself thus: 'Though my body is sick, my mind shall not be sick. '
    Later on Sariputta gave him a further explanation of the Buddha's words: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Herein, housefather, the untaught many-folk... who are
      unskilled in the worthy doctrine, untrained in the worthy doctrine - - these regard body
      as the self, they regard the self as having body, body as being in the self, the self as
      being in the body. 'I am the body', they say, 'body is mine', and are possessed by this
      idea; and so, possessed by this idea, when body alters and changes, owing to the unstable
      and changeful nature of the body, then sorrow and grief, woe, lamentation and despair
      arise in them. They regard feeling (vedana) as the self... They regard perception (sanna)
      as the self... They regard the activities (sankharakkhandha) as the self... They regard
      consciousness (vinana) as the self... That, housefather, is how body is sick and mind is
      sick too. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And how is body sick, but mind not sick? Herein,
      housefather, the well taught ariyan disciple... regards not body as the self... He regards
      not feeling (vedana) as the self... He regards not perception (sanna) as the self... He
      regards not the activities (sankharakkhandha) as the self... He regards not consciousness
      (vinnana) as the self... As he is not so possessed, when consciousness alters and changes
      owing to the unstable and changeful nature of consciousness, sorrow and grief, woe,
      lamentation and despair do not arise in him. Thus, housefather, body is sick, but mind is
      not sick. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As long as we are still clinging to the khandhas we are
    like sick people, but we can be cured of our sickness if we see the khandhas as they are.
    The khandhas are impermanent and thus they are dukkha (unsatisfactory). We read in the
    'Kindred Savings' (III, Khandha-vagga, Last Fifty, par. 104, Suffering) that the Buddha
    taught the 'Four Noble Truths' to the monks. He said: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Monks, I will teach You dukkha, the arising of dukkha, the
      ceasing of dukkha, the way leading to the ceasing of dukkha. Do you listen to it. (In the
      English translation 'dukkha' is sometimes translated as 'suffering', sometimes as 'ill'.
      Here the English text has the word 'suffering'.) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And what, monks, is dukkha? It is to be called the five
      khandhas of grasping. What five? The rupakkhandha of grasping, the vedanakkhandha of
      grasping, the sannakkhandha of grasping, the sankharakkhandha of grasping, the
      vinnanakkhandha of grasping. This, monks, is called dukkha. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And what, monks, is the arising of dukkha? It is that
      craving... that leads downward to rebirth... the craving for feeling, for rebirth, for no
      rebirth... This, monks, is called the arising of dukkha. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And what, monks, is the ceasing of dukkha? It is the utter
      passionless ceasing, the giving up, the abandonment of, the release from, the freedom from
      attachment to that craving... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">This, monks, is called the ceasing of dukkha. And what,
      monks, is the way going to the ceasing of dukkha? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is this Ariyan Eightfold Path... This, monks, is the
      way going to the ceasing of dukkha. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As long as there is still clinging to the khandhas there
    will be the arising of the khandhas in rebirth, and this means sorrow. If we develop the
    Eightfold Path we will learn to see what the khandhas really are. Then we are on the way
    leading to the ceasing of dukkha, which means: no more birth, old age, sickness and death.
    <br>
    Those who have attained the last stage of enlightenment, the stage of the arahat, will be,
    after their life-span is over, free from the khandhas. </font></p>
