    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-ooOoo- </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">W</font><font face="Times New Roman">e are born,
    we die and then we are born again. It is beyond control in which plane of existence we
    will be reborn; it depends on the kamma which produces the patisandhi-citta
    (rebirth-consciousness) after the cuti-citta (dying-consciousness) has fallen away. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At this moment we are living in the human plane. Human
    life, however, is very short. When this life is over we do not know in which plane we will
    be reborn. Most people do not like to think of the shortness of human life; they are
    absorbed in what they experience through the sense-doors and on account of these
    experiences they are happy or unhappy. However, we should realize that happiness and
    unhappiness are only mental phenomena which arise because of conditions and fall away
    again. Our whole life is a sequence of phenomena which arise and fall away again. 
 </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many religions teach about heaven and hell. In what
    respect are the Buddhist teachings different? Do we just have to believe in heaven and
    hell? Through the Buddhist teachings we learn to study realities, to study cause and
    effect in life. Each cause brings about its appropriate result. People perform good and
    bad deeds and these deeds bring different results; they can cause births in different
    planes of existence. The plane of existence is the place where one is born. Birth in a
    woeful plane is the result of a bad deed and birth in a happy plane is the result of a
    good deed. Since the deeds of beings are of many different degrees of kusala and 

    akusala, the results are of many different degrees as well. There are different woeful
    planes and different happy planes of existence. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The animal world is a woeful plane. We can see how animals
    devour one another and we find that nature is cruel. The animal world is not the only
    woeful plane. There are different hell planes. The akusala vipaka in hell is more intense
    than the sufferings which can be experienced in the human plane. The descriptions of hells
    in the Buddhist teachings are not merely allegories; the experience of unpleasant things
    through eyes, ears, nose, tongue and body-sense is akusala vipaka and akusala vipaka is
    reality. Life in a hell plane is not permanent ; when one's lifespan in a hell plane is
    over there can be rebirth in another plane. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Apart from the animal plane and the hell planes, there are
    other woeful planes. Birth in the plane of petas (ghosts) is the result of akusala kamma,
    conditioned by lobha. Beings in that plane have a deformed figure and they are always
    hungry and thirsty. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Furthermore, there is the plane of asuras (demons). The
    objects which are experienced in the asura plane are not as enjoyable as the objects which
    can be experienced in the human plane. There are four classes of woeful planes in all. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Birth as a human being is a happy rebirth. In the human
    plane there is opportunity for the cultivation of kusala. One can study Dhamma and learn
    to develop the way leading to the end of defilements and the end of birth and death. Birth
    in the human plane is kusala vipaka, but during one's lifespan in this plane there are
    both kusala vipaka and akusala vipaka. Each person experiences different results in life:
    there is gain and loss, honour and dishonour, praise and blame, happiness and misery. Each
    person is born into the family which is the right condition for him to experience the
    results of his deeds. It is due to one's kamma that one experiences pleasant and
    unpleasant things through eyes, ears, nose, tongue and body-sense. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Other happy planes, apart from the human plane, are the
    heavenly planes. In the heavenly planes there is more kusala vipaka than in the human
    plane and less akusala vipaka. There are several heavenly planes and although life in a
    heavenly plane lasts a very long time, it is not permanent. The woeful planes, the human
    plane and the six heavenly planes which are 'deva planes', are sensuous planes of
    existence. Sensuous planes of existence are planes where there is seeing, hearing,
    smelling, tasting, the experience of bodily impressions and other kamavacara cittas
    (cittas which are of the sensuous plane of consciousness). There are eleven classes of
    sensuous planes of existence in all. 
 </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who see the disadvantages of sense-impressions may
    cultivate jhana ; they can be reborn in higher heavenly planes which are not sensuous
    planes. Those who attain rupa-jhana can be reborn in rupa-brahma planes where there are
    less sense-impressions. There are sixteen rupa-brahma planes in all. One of them is the
    asanna-satta plane where there is only rupa, not nama. Those who have attained the highest
    stage of rupa- jhana and who wish to have no consciousness at all, can be reborn without
    citta; for them there is only a body. These beings have seen the disadvantages of
    consciousness; even happiness is a disadvantage, since it does not last. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who see the disadvantages of rupa cultivate
    arupa-jhana. Those who attain arupa-jhana can be reborn in arupa-brahma planes where there
    are no rupas. There are four arupa-brahma planes. Beings born in these planes have only
    nama, not rupa. People may wonder how there can be beings which only have rupa or beings
    which only have nama. If we can experience different characteristics of nama-elements and
    rupa- elements as they appear one at a time and if we have realized that they are only
    elements which arise because of conditions, not a being or a person, not self, we will
    have no doubt that, when there are the appropriate conditions, there can be rupa without
    nama and nama without rupa. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> 
 
 
 
 There are thirty-one planes of
    existence in all, namely: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">4 woeful planes 
 <br>
      the human plane 
 
 
 
 
} 
 11 sensuous planes <br>
      6 deva
      planes 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">16 rupa-brahma planes <br>
      4 arupa-brahma planes </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As we have seen, the fact that beings are born in
    different planes of existence is due to their accumulated kamma. Plane of existence is the
    place where one is born. It is not plane of citta. What plane of citta a citta belongs to,
    depends on the object (arammana) the citta experiences. We learnt about different planes
    of citta, namely: 
 </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">kamavacara cittas (sensuous plane of citta or
      kama-bhumi) 
 <br>
      rupavacara cittas (plane of rupa-jhanacittas) <br>
      arupavacara cittas (plane of arupa-jhanacittas) <br>
      lokuttara cittas (plane of cittas experiencing nibbana) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As regards the kamacara cittas, they can be classified as
    asobhana cittas (cittas not accompanied by sobhana cetasikas) and kama-sobhana cittas
    (cittas of the sensuous plane of citta, accompanied by sobhana cetasikas). In which planes
    of existence do they arise? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kamavacara citta arise in thirty planes of existence, they
    do not arise in the asanna-satta plane, where there is no nama, only rupa. Even in the
    arupa-brahma planes there are kamavacara cittas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As regards kama-sobhana cittas, they can arise even in
    woeful planes. Furthermore, they arise in the human plane, in the heavenly planes, in the
    rupa-brahma planes and in the arupa-brahma planes. They arise in thirty planes of
    existence, the asanna-satta plane excepted. Not all types however, arise in all planes of
    existence. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Asobhana cittas can arise in thirty planes of existence,
    but not all types arise in all planes. Lobha-mula-cittas (cittas rooted in attachment) can
    arise in thirty planes; even in the rupa-brahma planes and in the arupa- brahma planes,
    lobha-mula-cittas can arise. Dosa-mula-cittas (cittas rooted in aversion) arise in the
    eleven sensuous planes of existence. They do not arise in the rupa-brahma planes or in the
    arupa-brahma planes. As long as beings live in the rupa-brahma 
 planes and in the
    arupa-brahma planes there are no conditions for dosa. Moha-mula-cittas (cittas rooted in
    ignorance) arise in thirty planes of existence ; all those who are not arahats have moha
    and thus moha-mula-cittas arise in all planes of existence except in the asanna-satta
    plane. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As we have seen, not only akusala cittas, but also ahetuka
    cittas are asobhana cittas (cittas which are not accompanied by sobhana cetasikas). As
    regards the asobhana cittas which are ahetuka, the ahetuka cittas which arise in a process
    of cittas experiencing an object through one of the sense-doors, can arise only in the
    planes where there are sense-impressions. Seeing-consciousness and hearing-consciousness
    arise in the eleven sensuous planes of existence (the four woeful planes, the human being
    plane and the six heavenly planes which are sensuous planes: 
 the deva planes) and
    they arise also in fifteen rupa-brahma planes, thus they arise in twenty-six planes of
    existence. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Smelling-consciousness, tasting-consciousness and
    body-consciousness arise only in the eleven sensuous planes. Thus, they do not arise in
    the rupa-brahma planes or in the arupa-brahma planes. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Panca-dvaravajjana-citta
    (five-sense-door-adverting-consciousness), sampaticchana-citta (receiving- consciousness)
    and santirana-citta (investigating-consciousness) arise in all planes where there are
    sense- impressions, thus they arise in twenty-six planes (in the eleven sensuous planes
    and in fifteen rupa- brahma planes; the rupa-brahma plane which is the asanna-satta plane
    is excepted). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The mano-dvaravajjana-citta
    (mind-door-adverting-consciousness) arises in all planes where there is nama, thus it
    arises in thirty planes. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">People are inclined to speculate about the place where
    they will be reborn. Would we like to be reborn in the human plane? We cling to life in
    the human plane and we do not always realize the many moments of akusala vipaka we are
    bound to receive in this world: we are threatened by calamities such as war and hunger,
    there is sickness, old age and death. Some people would like to be reborn in a heavenly
    plane; they like to experience pleasant things through the senses. One may wish for
    rebirth in a heavenly plane, but whether or not this will happen depend on one's kamma.
    Birth is result, it does not take place without cause. If one performs many good deeds one
    cultivates the cause which will bring a pleasant result; but there is no way to know when
    the result will take place, this is beyond control. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Are we afraid of death? Most people want to prolong their
    lives. They fear death because they feel uncertain of the future. If one is not an ariyan
    there may be rebirth in hell. We do not like to think of rebirth in a woeful plane, but
    there may be deeds performed in the past which can still cause rebirth in hell. Even the
    Buddha was in one of his former lives born in hell. It is useless to think of
    hell 
with aversion and fear, but the thought of hell is helpful when it reminds us to
    cultivate kusala at this moment, instead of akusala. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We read in the 'Kindred Sayings' (V, Maha-vagga, Kindred
    Sayings on Stream-Winning, Ch.VI, par. 4, Visiting the sick) that the Buddha spoke to
    Mahanama about the way a wise lay-follower who is sick should be admonished by another
    wise lay-follower. We read: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">A wise lay-disciple, Mahanama, who is sick... should be
      admonished by another wise lay-disciple with the four comfortable assurances, thus: 'Take
      comfort, dear sir, in your unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, to the Dhamma, to the
      Sangha...Take comfort, dear sir, in your possession of the virtues dear to the Ariyans...'
      A wise lay-disciple, Mahanama, who is sick... should be admonished by another wise
      lay-disciple with these four comfortable assurances. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then, supposing he has longing for his parents, he should
      thus be spoken to: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">If he say: 'I have longing for my parents', the other
      should reply: 'But, my dear sir, your are subject to death. Whether you feel longing for
      your parents or not, you will have to die. It were just as well for you to abandon the
      longing you have for your parents.' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">If he should say: 'That longing for my parents is now
      abandoned,' the other should reply: 'Yet, my dear sir, you still have longing for your
      children. As you must die in any case, it were just as well for you to abandon that
      longing for your children.' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">If he should say: 'That longing for my children is now
      abandoned,' the other should reply: 'Yet, my dear sir, you still have longing for the five
      human pleasures of sense.' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then, if he say, 'That longing for the five human
      pleasures of sense is now abandoned,' the other should reply: 'My friend, the heavenly
      delights are more excellent than the five human pleasures of sense. It were well for you,
      worthy sir, to remove your thoughts from them and fix them on the Four Deva Kings.' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Suppose the sick man say, 'My thoughts are removed from
      human pleasures of sense and fixed upon the Four Deva Kings,' then let the other say:
      'More excellent than the Four Deva Kings and more choice are the Suite of the
      Thirty-three... the Creative Devas... the Devas who rejoice in the work of other devas...
      the latter are more excellent and choice than the former... so it were better for you to
      fix your thoughts on the Brahma World.' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then if the sick man's thoughts are so fixed, let the
      other say: 'My friend, even the Brahma World is impermanent, not lasting, prisoned in a
      person. Well for you, friend, if you raise your mind above the Brahma World and fix it on
      cessation from the person-pack. (The five 
 khandhas of clinging.)' 
 </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And if the sick man says he has done so, then, Mahanama, I
      declare that there is no difference between the lay-disciple who thus avers and the monk
      whose heart is freed from the asavas, that is, between the release of the one and the
      release of the other.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is a danger to be subject to birth. No rebirth at all
    in any plane of existence is to be preferred to birth even in the highest heavenly plane.
    If one wants to have no more rebirth one should know the Four Ariyan Truths; realizing
    these leads to the end of rebirth. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The First Ariyan Truth is the truth of dukkha. If we could
    experience, for instance, that seeing at this moment, hearing, attachment or any other
    nama or rupa which appears now is only an element which arises and falls away, we would
    have more understanding of the truth of dukkha. What arises and falls away cannot give
    satisfaction, it is dukkha.<b> </b>The Second Ariyan Truth is the truth of the origin of
    dukkha. Craving is the origin of dukkha.<b> </b>Through the development of the Eightfold
    Path there will be less craving, less clinging to nama and rupa. When finally there is no
    more craving, there will be an end to rebirth, which is the end of dukkha. The Third
    Ariyan Truth is the extinction of dukkha, which is nibbana, and the Fourth Ariyan Truth is
    the Path leading to the extinction of dukkha, which is the Eightfold Path. 
 </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We read in the 'Maha-parinibbana-sutta' (Dialogues of the
    Buddha II, No. 16, Ch.II, 1, 2): </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Exalted One proceeded with a great company of the
      monks to Kotigama; and there he stayed in the village itself. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And at that place the Exalted One addressed the monks, and
      said: 'It is through not understanding and grasping Four Ariyan Truths, O monks, that we
      have had to run so long, to wander so long in this weary path of rebirth, both you and I!'
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'And what are these four?' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'The Ariyan truth about dukkha; the Ariyan truth about the
      cause of dukkha; the Ariyan truth about the cessation of dukkha; and the Ariyan truth
      about the path that leads to that cessation. But when these Ariyan truths are grasped and
      known the craving for future life is rooted out, that which leads to renewed becoming is
      destroyed, and then there is no more birth!'
