    <h2 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800000">THE FUNCTION OF JAVANA </font></h2>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-ooOoo- </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">W</font><font face="Times New Roman">hen we see,
    hear, smell, taste, experience an object through the body-sense or through the mind-door,
    there is not only one citta experiencing the object through the appropriate doorway, but a
    series or process of cittas. A rupa which impinges on one of the senses is experienced by
    a series of cittas. When that sense-door process is over, the object is experienced by
    cittas through the mind-door. Sense-door processes and mind-door processes arise and fall
    away continuously. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We may not know that both in a sense-door process and in a
    mind-door process there are akusala cittas or kusala cittas arising. Because of our
    accumulated ignorance we do not clearly know our akusala cittas and kusala cittas and we
    do not recognize our more subtle defilements. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In a sense-door process the object is experienced first by
    cittas which are not kusala cittas or akusala cittas ; it is experienced by kiriyacittas
    and by vipakacittas. The sense-door-adverting-consciousness (panca- dvaravajjana-citta) is
    an ahetuka kiriyacitta (a kiriya-citta without beautiful roots or unwholesome roots). It
    is succeeded by one of the dvi-panca-vinnanas (the five pairs, which are :
    seeing-consciousness, hearing-consciousness etc.) and this citta is ahetuka vipaka. Then
    there are two more ahetuka vipakacittas : the sampatic-chana-citta which receives the
    object and the santirana-citta which investigates the object. The santirana-citta is
    succeeded by the votthapana-citta (determining-consciousness) which is an ahetuka
    kiriyacitta. The votthapana-citta determines the object and is then succeeded by kusala
    cittas or by akusala cittas. In the case of those who are arahats there are no kusala
    cittas or akusala cittas succeeding the votthapana-citta but kiriyacittas. When the cittas
    of the sense-door process have fallen away, cittas of the mind-door process experience the
    object. First there are bhavanga-cittas and then the mano- dvaravajjana- citta arises
    which has the function of adverting to the object through the mind-door. The mano-
    dvaravajjana-citta is succeeded by kusala cittas or by akusala cittas in the case of those
    who are not arahats. The mano-dvaravajjana-citta is not kusala or akusala, it is an
    ahetuka kiriyacitta. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since cittas arise and fall away very rapidly it is hard
    to know the different cittas which arise. Often we might not even know when we have kusala
    cittas or akusala cittas. For example, after there has been seeing we may not realize when
    there is attachment to the object, when there is aversion towards it, or when there is
    ignorance of realities. If we study the Dhamma we will learn about our more subtle
    defilements. Ignorance of our akusala cittas is dangerous. If we do not realize when we
    have akusala cittas we will continue accumulating akusala. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The kusala cittas or akusala cittas which arise perform a
    function ; they perform the function of javana or 'running through the object'. In the
    sense-door process the votthapana-citta has determined the object already when the
    javana-cittas arise and in the mind-door process the mano-dvaravajjana-citta has adverted
    to the object already when the javana-cittas arise. Thus, the kusala cittas or akusala
    cittas which follow have as their only function to 'run through' the object. Usually there
    are seven cittas in succession which perform the function of javana. If the first
    javana-citta is kusala, the succeeding six cittas are also kusala cittas ; if the first
    javana-citta is akusala, the succeeding six cittas are also akusala cittas. Do we realize
    it when javana-cittas are cittas rooted in lobha, dosa or moha, or when they are kusala
    cittas? We are ignorant most of the time, even of javana-cittas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are fifty-five kinds of citta which can perform the
    function of javana. Twelve akusala cittas (eight lobha-mula-cittas, two dosa-mula-cittas
    and two moha-mula-cittas), eight kamavacara kusala cittas, which are called maha-kusala
    cittas (Kamavacara cittas are cittas which are of the sensuous plane of consciousness, not
    jhanacittas or lokuttara cittas.), eight maha-kiriyacittas of the arahat (kiriyacittas
    which are not ahetuka, but accompanied by sobhana hetus). The arahat has maha-kiriyacittas
    instead of maha-kusala cittas since he does not accumulate any more kamma.
    Maha-kiriyacittas are of the sensuous plane of consciousness; they are not jhanacittas or
    lokuttara cittas. Arahats also have kamavacara citta ; they see, hear or think of objects
    experienced through the senses. However, on account of what is experienced no kusala
    cittas or akusala cittas arise. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For the arahat there is also an ahetuka kiriyacitta
    performing the function of javana, which may arise when he smiles : the hasituppada-citta </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who attain rupa-jhana (fine material jhana) can have
    five types of rupavacara kusala cittas performing the function of javana, since there are
    five stages of rupa-jhana. Arahats who attain rupa-jhana can have five types of rupavacara
    kiriyacittas which perform the function of javana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For those who attain arupa-jhana (immaterial jhana) there
    can be four types of arupavacara kusala cittas performing the function of javana, since
    there are four stages of arupa-jhana Arahats who attain arupa-jhana can have four types of
    Arupavacara kiriyacittas performing the function of javana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who directly experience nibbana have lokuttara
    cittas. There are eight lokuttara cittas, four of which are magga-cittas
    ('path-consciousness', 'magga' means path) and four of which are lokuttara vipakacittas,
    called phala-cittas (' fruit-consciousness', 'phala' means fruit. There are four pairs of
    lokuttara cittas since there are four stages of enlightenment). Vipakacittas of other of
    consciousness cannot perform the function of javana, the function of javana. Thus, all
    eight lokuttara cittas perform the function of javana. Summarising the fifty-five cittas
    which can perform the function of javana. </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>[colectively known as 12 akusala cittas] </em><br>
      8 lobha-mula-cittas (cittas rooted in attachment) <br>
      2 dosa-mula-cittas (cittas rooted in aversion) <br>
      2 moha-mula-citta (citta rooted in ignorance) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">8 maha-kusala cittas (kamavacara kusala cittas) <br>

      4 phala-cittas (lokuttara vipakacittas) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is useful to know that when akusala cittas arise on
    account of an object, there arise not just one, but seven akusala cittas in one process
    and this process of cittas can be followed by other processes with akusala javana-cittas.
    Each time we dislike something there are processes of cittas which experience the object,
    and in each of these processes there are seven akusala javana-cittas. Many akusala cittas
    may arise on account of something we dislike or are attached to. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is no self who can prevent akusala cittas from
    arising ; when they arise in the sense-door process the votthapana-citta has determined
    the object already, and when they arise in the mind-door process the
    mano-dvaravajjana-citta has adverted to the object already. When the first javana-citta
    has arisen it has to be succeeded by the following javana-cittas. The first javana-citta
    conditions the second one and this again the following one ; the third, the fourth, the
    fifth, the sixth javana-cittas are the same. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Processes with kusala javana-cittas and processes with
    akusala javana-cittas can arise shortly one after the other. For instance, people have the
    intention to offer food to the monks. However, when one has bought the ingredients for the
    food one is going to offer, one may find the cost rather high. At that moment there may be
    cittas with stinginess and then the javana-cittas are akusala cittas. Thus we see that
    accumulated defilement can appear at any time when there are conditions, even if one has
    the intention to do a good deed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is during the time of the javana-cittas that we
    accumulate wholesomeness or unwholesomeness. It is not possible to control javana-cittas,
    but knowing the conditions for wholesomeness will help us to have fewer akusala cittas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha, out of compassion, taught people the way to
    have less akusala. He encouraged them to perform all kinds of kusala, no matter whether it
    is dana (generosity) sila (morality) or bhavana (mental development). He taught the
    development of the wisdom which can eradicate all kinds of akusala. There are different
    degrees of panna. If panna merely knows what is kusala and what is akusala, it is not of
    the degree that it can eradicate akusala. When panna has not been developed to the degree
    of 'insight-wisdom', there is still a concept of self who cultivates wholesomeness and
    abstains from ill deeds. When there is the concept of self, defilements cannot be
    eradicated. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The person who is not an ariyan may be able to observe the
    five precepts, but there is a difference between him and the ariyan who observes them. The
    non-ariyan may transgress them when there are conditions for it while for the ariyan there
    aren't any more conditions for transgressing them. Moreover, the ariyan who observes sila
    does not take the observing of sila for self any more, since he has eradicated the latent
    tendency towards wrong view. Thus his sila is purer. He is on the way leading to the
    eradication of all defilements. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we are not mindful of realities, we take the objects
    we experience for self. When panna realizes the objects which are experienced as nama and
    rupa, elements which do not last, there is less opportunity for akusala javana-cittas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the 'Visuddhimagga' (I, 55) we read about the 'Elder'
    Maha-Tissa : </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">...It seems that as the Elder was on his way
      Cetiya-pabbata to Anuradhapura for alms, a certain daughter-in-law of a clan, who had
      quarrelled with her husband and had set out early from Anuradhapura all dressed up and
      tricked out like a celestial nymph to go to her relatives' home, saw him on the road, and
      being low-minded, she laughed a loud laugh. (Wondering) 'What is that?&quot;, the Elder
      looked up, and finding in the bones of her teeth the perception of foulness, he reached
      Arahantship. Hence it was said : 'He saw the bones that were her teeth, And kept in mind
      his first perception ; And standing on that very spot, The Elder became an Arahant.' But
      her husband who was going after her saw the Elder and asked 'Venerable sir, did you by any
      chance see a woman?' The Elder told him : 'Whether it was a man or woman That went by I
      noticed not ; But only that on this high road There goes a group of bones.'</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Maha-Tissa was not absorbed in the object he experience,
    nor entranced by the details. He realized when he perceived the woman's teeth the
    'foulness of the body' and he did not take what he perceived for 'self'. The perception of
    the 'foulness of the body' reminds us not to see the self in the body, but to realize
    bodily phenomena as rupas which do not stay. Maha-Tissa saw things as they are ; the panna
    arising at that moment was to the degree that it could eradicate all defilements. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are countless javana-cittas in a day with lobha,
    dosa and moha, and therefore we should not be heedless, but we should be as mindful as we
    are able to. We read in the 'Kindred Sayings' (IV, Salayatana-vagga, Kindred Sayings on
    Sense, Second Fifty, par. 97, Dwelling heedless) : </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">At Savatthi was the occasion (of this discourse)... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'I will teach you, monks, of the one who dwells heedless,
      and of the one who dwells earnest. Do you listen to it. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And how, monks, does one dwell heedless? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">In him, monks, who dwells with the faculty of sight
      uncontrolled, the heart is corrupted by objects cognizable by the eye. In him whose heart
      is corrupted there is no delight. Without delight there is no joy. Where joy is not, there
      is no calm. Without calm one dwells in sorrow. The sorrowful man's heart is not composed.
      When the heart is not composed, one has not clear ideas. Through not having clear ideas he
      is reckoned as one who dwells heedless. (And it is the same with regard to the faculties
      of taste, touch and mind). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And how, monks, does one dwell in earnest? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">In him, monks, who dwells with the faculty of sight
      controlled the heart is not corrupted by objects cognizable by the eye. In him whose heart
      is not corrupted delight is born. In one delighted joy is born. When one is joyful the
      body is calmed. He whose body is calmed feels at ease. Composed is the heart of him who is
      at ease. When the heart is composed one's ideas are clear. Through having clear ideas one
      is reckoned as one who dwells earnest. (And it is the same with regard to the faculty of
      taste, touch and mind.) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, monks, is one a dweller in earnestness.' </font></p>
