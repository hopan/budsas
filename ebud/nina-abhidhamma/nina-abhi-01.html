    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-ooOoo-</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he Buddha's teachings, contained in
    the 'Tipitaka' (Three Baskets) are: the Vinaya (Book of Discipline for the monks) , the
    Suttanta (Discourse) , the Abhidhamma. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All three parts of the Tipitaka can be an inexhaustible
    source of inspiration and encouragement to the practice, leading to the eradication of
    wrong view and eventually of the other defilements. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In all three parts of the Tipitaka we are taught about
    'dhamma' , about everything which is real. Seeing is a dhamma, it is real. Colour is a
    dhamma, it is real. Feeling is a dhamma, it is real. Our defilements are dhammas, they are
    realities. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the Buddha attained enlightenment he clearly knew all
    dhammas as they really are. He taught Dhamma to us in order that we also may know
    realities as they are. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Without the Buddha's teaching we would be ignorant of
    reality. We are inclined to take for permanent what is impermanent, for pleasant what is
    sorrowful, for self what is not self. The aim of all three parts of the Tipitaka is to
    teach people the development of the way leading to the end of defilements. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Vinaya contains the rules for the monks for the living
    to perfection of the 'brahman life'. The goal of the 'brahman life' is the eradication of
    all defilements. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Not only the monks, but also laypeople should study the
    Vinaya. We read about the instances that monks deviated from their purity of life; when
    there was such a case, a rule was laid down in order to help them to be watchful. When we
    read the Vinaya we are reminded of our own lobha (attachment), dosa (aversion) and moha
    (ignorance), they are realities. As long as they are not eradicated they can arise any
    time. We are reminded how deeply rooted defilements are and what they can lead to. When
    one considers this, one is urged to develop the Eightfold Path which leads to the
    eradication of wrong view, jealousy, stinginess, conceit and all other defilements. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Suttanta, Dhamma is explained to different people
    at different places. The Buddha taught about all realities appearing through the six
    doors, about cause and effect, about the practice leading to the end of all sorrow. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As regards the Abhidhamma, this is an exposition of all
    realities in detail. 'Abhi' literally means 'higher', thus ' Abhidhamma' means 'higher
    dhamma'. The form of this part of the Tipitaka is different, but the aim is the same: the
    eradication of wrong view and eventually of all defilements. Thus, when we study the many
    enumerations of realities, we should not forget the real purpose of the study. The theory
    (pariyatti) should encourage us to the practice (patipatti) which is necessary for the
    realization of the truth (pativedha). While we are studying the different namas and rupas
    and while we are pondering over them, we can be reminded to be aware of nama and rupa
    appearing at that moment. In this way we will discover more and more that the Abhidhamma
    is about everything which is real, that is, the worlds appearing through the six doors. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This book is meant as an introduction to the study of the
    Abhidhamma. I hope that the reader, instead of being discouraged by the many enumerations
    and by the Pali terms which are used, will develop a growing interest in the realities to
    be experienced in and around himself. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Miss Sujin Boriharnwanaket has been of immense assistance
    and inspiration to me in my study of the Abhidhamma. She encouraged me to discover for
    myself that the Abhidhamma is about realities to be experienced through eyes, ears, nose,
    tongue, body-sense and mind-door. Thus I learnt that the study of the Abhidhamma is a
    process which continues all through life. I hope that the reader will have a similar
    experience and that he will be full of enthusiasm and gladness every time he studies
    realities which can be experienced! </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I have quoted many times from the suttas in order to show
    that teaching contained in the Abhidhamma is no different from the teaching in the other
    parts of the Tipitaka. For the quotations I have mostly used the English translation of
    the 'Pali Text Society' (Translation Series). For the quotations from the 'Visuddhimagga'
    (Path of Purity) I have used the translation by Bhikkhu Nanamoli (Colombo, Sri
    Lanka,1964). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I have added some questions after the chapters which may
    help the reader to ponder over what he has read. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The venerable Phra Dhammadharo Bhikkhu gave me most
    helpful corrections and suggestions for the text of this book. Due to his effort the
    editing and printing of this book has been made possible. </font></p>

    DHAMMAS </font></h2>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>here are two kinds of reality:
    mental phenomena (nama) and physical phenomena (rupa). Nama experiences something; rupa
    does not experience anything. Seeing is, for example, a type of nama; it experiences
    visible object. Visible object itself is rupa; it does not experience anything. What we
    take for self are only nama and rupa which arise and fall away. The 'Visuddhimagga' ('Path
    of Purity', a commentary) explains (Ch. XVIII, 25): </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">For this has been said: <br>
      - 'As with the assembly of parts.<br>
      The word &quot;chariot&quot; is countenanced, <br>
      So, When the khandhas are present, <br>
      'A being' is said in common usage' <br>
      (Kindred Sayings I, 135). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The five khandhas (aggregates) are nothing else but nama
      and rupa. (See Ch.2.) ... So in many hundred suttas there is only mentality-materiality
      which is illustrated, not a being, not a person. Therefore, just as when the component
      parts (of a chariot) such as axles, wheels, frame, poles... <br>
      are arranged in a certain way, there comes to be the mere conventional term 'chariot', yet
      in the ultimate sense, when each part is examined, there is no chariot, ...so too,...
      there comes to be the mere conventional term 'a being', 'a person', yet in the ultimate
      sense, when each component is examined, there is no being as a basis for the assumption '
      I am' or ' I ' ; in the ultimate sense there is only mentality-materiality. The vision of
      one who sees in this way is called correct vision. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All phenomena in and around ourselves are only nama and
    rupa which arise and fall away; they are impermanent. Nama and rupa are absolute
    realities, in Pali: paramattha dhammas. We can experience their characteristics when they
    appear, no matter how we name them. Those who have developed 'insight' can experience them
    as they really are: impermanent and not self. The more we know different namas and rupas
    by experiencing their characteristics, the more we will see that 'self' is only a concept;
    it is not a paramattha dhamma. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nama and rupa are different types of realities. If we do
    not distinguish them from each other and learn the characteristic of each we will continue
    to take them for self. For example, hearing is nama; it has no form or shape. Hearing is
    different from ear-sense, but it has ear-sense as a necessary condition. The nama which
    hears experiences sound. Ear-sense and sound are rupas, which do not experience anything;
    they are entirely different from the nama which hears. If we do not learn that hearing,
    ear-sense and sound are realities which are altogether different from each other, we will
    continue to think that it is self which hears. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The 'Visuddhimagga' (XVIII, 34) explains: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Furthermore, nama has no efficient power, it cannot occur
      by its own efficient power... It does not eat, it does not drink, it does not speak, it
      does not adopt postures. And rupa is without efficient power; it cannot occur by its own
      efficient power. For it has no desire to eat, it has no desire to drink, it has no desire
      to speak, it has no desire to adopt postures. But rather it is when supported by rupa that
      nama occurs; and it is when supported by nama that rupa occurs. When nama has the desire
      to eat, the desire to drink, the desire to speak, the desire to adopt a posture, it is
      rupa that eats, drinks, speaks and adopts a posture....</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Furthermore (XVIII, 36) we read: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And just as men depend upon <br>
      A boat for traversing the sea, <br>
      So does the mental body need <br>
      The matter-body for occurrence. <br>
      And as the boat depends upon <br>
      The men for traversing the sea, <br>
      So does the matter-body need <br>
      The mental body for occurrence. <br>
      Depending each upon the other <br>
      The boat and men go on the sea. <br>
      And so do mind and matter both <br>
      Depend the one upon the other.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are two kinds of conditioned nama: citta
    (consciousness) and cetasika (mental factors arising together with consciousness). They
    are namas which arise because of conditions and fall away again. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As regards citta, citta knows or experiences an object.
    Each citta must have its object of knowing, in Pali: arammana. The citta which sees has
    what is visible as its object. The citta which hears (hearing-consciousness) has sound as
    its object. There isn't any citta without an object (arammana). Even when we are sound
    asleep, citta experiences an object. There are many different types of citta which can be
    classified in different ways. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some cittas are akusala (unwholesome), some are kusala
    (wholesome). Akusala cittas and kusala cittas are cittas which are causes. They can
    motivate unwholesome or wholesome deeds through body, speech or mind. Some cittas are
    vipakacittas, the result of unwholesome or wholesome deeds. Some cittas are kiriyacittas
    neither cause nor result. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Cittas can be classified by way of jati' (literally means
    'birth' or 'nature'). There are four jatis: akusala, kusala, vipaka, kiriya. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is important to know which jati a citta is. We cannot
    develop wholesomeness in our life if we take akusala for kusala or if we take akusala for
    vipaka. For instance, when we hear unpleasant words, the moment of experiencing the sound
    (hearing-consciousness) is akusala vipaka, the result of an unwholesome deed we performed
    ourselves. But the aversion which may arise very shortly afterwards is not vipaka, but it
    arises with akusala citta. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another way of classifying citta is by plane of
    consciousness (bhumi). There are four different planes of consciousness: kamavacara citta,
    rupavacara citta, arupavacara citta, lokuttara citta. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The sensuous plane of consciousness (kamavacara cittas) is
    the plane of sense-impressions, for examples: seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and
    receiving impressions through the body-sense. There are other planes of citta which do not
    experience sense-impressions. Those who cultivate samatha (tranquil meditation) and attain
    absorption (jhana), have jhanacittas. The jhanacitta is another plane of citta; it does
    not experience sense-impressions. The lokuttara citta ('supramundane' consciousness) is
    the highest plane of consciousness because it is the citta which directly experiences
    nibbana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are still other ways of classifying citta and if we
    consider the different intensities of citta there are many more differences between
    cittas. For instance, akusala cittas, which are rooted in lobha (attachment), dosa
    (aversion) and moha (ignorance), can be of many different intensities. Sometimes they may
    motivate deeds, sometimes they may not, depending on the degree of akusala. Kusala cittas
    too are of many different intensities. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are altogether eighty-nine or one hundred and
    twenty-one types of citta. The classification by way of a hundred and twenty-one types
    includes the cittas of the ariyans who cultivated both jhana (absorption) and vipassana
    and who could experience nibbana with absorption. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second paramattha dhamma is cetasika which is nama. As
    we have seen, citta experiences an object: seeing has what is visible as its object,
    hearing has sound as its object, thinking has what is thought about as its object.
    However, there is not only citta, there are also mental factors, cetasikas, which
    accompany a citta. One can think of something with aversion, with a pleasant feeling, with
    wisdom. Aversion, feeling and wisdom are mental phenomena which are not citta; they are
    cetasikas which accompany different cittas. There is only one citta at a time, but there
    are several cetasikas (at least seven) arising together with the citta and falling away
    together with the citta, citta never arises alone. For example, feeling, in Pali: vedana,
    is a cetasika which arises with every citta. Citta only knows or experiences its object;
    it does not feel. Vedana, however, has the function of feeling. Feeling is sometimes
    pleasant, sometimes unpleasant. When we do not have a pleasant or an unpleasant feeling,
    there is still feeling: at that moment the feeling is neutral or indifferent. There is
    always feeling; there isn't any moment of citta without feeling. For example, when
    seeing-consciousness arises, feeling (vedana) arises together with the citta. The citta
    which sees perceives only visible object; there is not yet like or dislike. The feeling
    which accompanies this type of citta is indifferent feeling. After seeing-consciousness
    has fallen away, other cittas arise and there may be cittas which dislike the object. The
    feeling which accompanies this type of citta is unpleasant feeling. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The function of citta is to cognize an object; citta is
    the 'chief in knowing'. Cetasikas share the same object with the citta, but they each have
    their own specific quality and function. There are altogether fifty-two kinds of cetasika.
    There are seven kinds of cetasika which arise with every citta; the other kinds do not
    arise with every citta. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Perception, in Pali: sanna, is a cetasika which arises
    with every citta. In the 'Visuddhimagga' (XIV,130) we read about sanna that it has the
    characteristic of perceiving: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">...Its function is to make a sign as a condition for
      perceiving again that 'this is the same', as carpenters, etc., do in the case of timber...
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Citta only experiences an object; it does not 'mark' its
      object. It is sanna (perception) which marks the object which is experienced so that it
      can be recognized later on. Whenever we remember things it is sanna and not self which
      remembers. It is sanna which, for example, remembers that this colour is red, that this is
      a house, or that this is the sound of a bird </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Cetana, (intention), is another kind of cetasika which
      arises with every citta. There are types of cetasika which do not arise with every citta.
      Akusala (unwholesome) cetasikas arise only with akusala cittas. Sobhana (beautiful)
      cetasikas arise with wholesome cittas. (See Ch.19) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lobha (attachment), dosa (aversion) and moha (ignorance)
    are akusala cetasikas which arise only with akusala cittas. For example, when we see
    something beautiful, cittas with attachment to what we have seen may arise. The cetasika
    which is lobha arises with the citta at that moment. Lobha has the function of attachment
    or clinging. There are several other akusala cetasikas which arise with akusala cittas,
    such as conceit (mana), wrong view (ditthi) and envy (issa). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sobhana (beautiful) cetasikas accompanying wholesome
    cittas are, for example alobha (generosity), adosa (lovingkindness), panna (or amoha).
    When we are generous, alobha and adosa arise with the kusala citta, sanna may arise too
    with the kusala citta; and there are other kinds of sobhana cetasikas arising with the
    wholesome citta as well. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although citta and cetasika are both nama, they each have
    different qualities. One may wonder how cetasikas can be experienced. When we notice a
    change in citta, a characteristic of cetasika can be experienced. For instance, when
    akusala cittas with stinginess arise after kusala cittas with generosity have fallen away,
    we can notice a change. Stinginess and generosity are cetasikas which can be experienced;
    they have different characteristics. We may notice as well the change from attachment to
    aversion, from pleasant feeling to unpleasant feeling. Feeling is a cetasika we can
    experience, because feeling is sometimes predominant and there are different kinds of
    feeling. We can experience that unpleasant feeling is different from pleasant and neutral
    feeling. These different cetasikas arise with different cittas and they fall away
    immediately, together with the citta they accompany. If we know more about the variety of
    citta and cetasika, it will help us to see the truth. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are not only mental phenomena, there are also
    physical phenomena. Physical phenomena (rupa) are the third paramattha dhamma. There are
    altogether twenty-eight classes of rupa. There are four principal rupas or 'Great
    Elements', in Pali: maha-bhuta-rupa. They are: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. 'Element of Earth' or solidity (to be experienced as
      hardness or softness) <br>
      2. 'Element of Water' or cohesion <br>
      3. 'Element of Fire' or temperature (to be experienced as heat or cold) <br>
      4. 'Element of Wind' or motion (to be experienced as motion or pressure) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These 'Great Elements' arise together with all the other
    kinds of rupa, in Pali: upada-rupa. Rupas never arise alone. They arise in 'groups' or
    'units'. There have to be at least eight kinds of rupa arising together. For example,
    whenever the rupa which is temperature arises, solidity, cohesion, motion and other rupas
    arise as well. Upada-rupas are, for examples, the physical sense-organs of eye-sense,
    ear-sense, smelling-sense, tasting-sense and body-sense, and the sense-objects of visible
    object, sound, odour and flavour. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Different characteristics of rupa can be experienced
    through eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body-sense and mind. These characteristics are real
    since they can be experienced. We use conventional terms such as 'body' and 'table'; both
    have the characteristic of hardness which can be experienced through touch. In this way we
    can prove that the characteristic of hardness is the same, no matter whether it is in the
    body or in the table. Hardness is a paramattha dhamma; 'body' and 'table' are not
    paramattha dhammas but only concepts. We take it for granted that the body stays and we
    take it for self, but what we call 'body' are only different rupas arising and falling
    away. The conventional term 'body' may delude us about reality. We will know the truth if
    we learn to experience different characteristics of rupa when they appear. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Citta, cetasika and rupa only arise when there are the
    right conditions, they are conditioned dhammas (in Pali: sankhara dhamma). Seeing cannot
    arise when there is no eye-sense and when there is no visible object. Sound can only arise
    when there are the right conditions for its arising. When it has arisen it falls away
    again. Everything which arises because of conditions has to fall away again when the
    conditions have ceased. One may think that sound stays, but what we take for a long,
    lasting moment of sound is actually many different rupas succeeding one another. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fourth paramattha dhamma is nibbana. Nibbana is the
    end of defilements. Nibbana can be experienced through the mind-door if one follows the
    right Path leading towards it: the development of the wisdom which sees things as they
    are. Nibbana is nama. However, it is not citta or cetasika. Nibbbna is the nama which does
    not arise and fall away; it is the nama which is an unconditioned reality (in
    Pali:visankhara dhamma). It does not arise, because it is unconditioned and therefore it
    does not fall away. Citta and cetasika are namas which experience an object; nibbana is
    the nama which does not experience an object, but nibbana itself can be the object of
    citta and cetasika which experience it, Nibbana is not a person, it is not-self; it is
    anatta. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Summarizing the four paramattha dhammas, they are: </font></p>

      </tr>
    </table>
    </center></div><p><font face="Times New Roman">When we study Dhamma it is essential to
    know which paramattha dhamma such or such reality is. If we do not know this we may be
    misled by conventional terms. We should, for example know that what we call 'body' are
    actually different rupa-paramattha dhammas, not citta or cetasika. We should know that
    nibbana is not citta or cetasika, but the fourth paramattha dhamma. Nibbana is the end of
    all conditioned realities. When an arahat, passes away, there is no more rebirth for him. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All conditioned dhammas: citta, cetasika and rupa, are
    impermanent (anicca). All conditioned dhammas are 'dukkha' since they are impermanent. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All dhammas are anatta, not-self (in Pali: sabbe dhamma
    anatta). Thus, the conditioned dhammas are impermanent and dukkha. But all dhammas, that
    is, the four paramattha dhammas, nibbana included, have the characteristic of anatta,
    not-self. </font></p>
