    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-ooOoo-</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">C</font><font face="Times New Roman">ittas are of
    different kinds. They can be classified as akusala cittas (unwholesome cittas), kusala
    cittas (wholesome cittas), vipakacittas (cittas which are result) and kiriyacittas (cittas
    which are neither cause nor result). These kinds of cittas arise in a day, yet we know so
    little about them. Most of the time we do not know whether the citta is akusala, kusala,
    vipaka or kiriya. If we learn to classify our mind we will have more understanding of
    ourselves and of others. We will have more compassion and lovingkindness towards others,
    even when they behave in a disagreeable way. We do not like the akusala cittas of others;
    we find it unpleasant when they are stingy or speak harsh words. However, do we realize at
    which moments we ourselves have akusala cittas? When we dislike other people's harsh
    words, we ourselves have akusala cittas with aversion at that moment. Instead of paying
    attention to the akusala cittas of others we should be aware of our own akusala cittas. If
    one has not studied the Abhidhamma which explains realities in detail, one may not know
    what is akusala. People may take what is unwholesome for wholesome and thus accumulate
    unwholesomeness without knowing it. If we know more about different types of citta we can
    see for ourselves which types arise more often and thus we will know ourselves better. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We should know the difference between kusala and akusala.
    The 'Atthasalini' (Book I, Part I, Ch.1, 38) speaks about the meaning of the word 'kusala'.
    The word 'kusala' has many meanings; it can mean 'of good health', 
 'faultless',
    'skillful', 'productive of happy results'. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we perform dana (generosity), sila (morality) and
    bhavana (mental development), the citta is kusala. All different kinds of wholesomeness
    such as the appreciation of other people';s good deeds, helping others, politeness,
    paving respect, observing the precepts, studying and teaching Dhamma, samatha (tranquil
    meditation) and vipassana (development of '
insight';), are included in dana, sila
    or bhavana. Kusala is '
productive of happy results'; each good deed will bring a
    pleasant result. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The 'Atthasalini' (Book I, Part I, Ch.I, 39) states about
    akusala: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Akusala' means 'not kusala'. Just as the opposite to
      friendship is enmity, or the opposite to greed, etc,. is disinterestedness, etc., so
      'akusala' is opposed to 'kusala'...</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Unwholesome deeds will bring unhappy results. Nobody
    wishes to experience an unhappy result, but many people are ignorant about the cause which
    brings an unhappy result, about akusala. They do not realize when the citta is unwholesome
    and they do not always know when they perform unwholesome deeds. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we study the Abhidhamma we learn that there are three
    groups of akusala cittas. They are: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Lobha-mula-cittas, or cittas rooted in attachment
      (lobha) <br>
      2. Dosa-mula-cittas, or cittas rooted in aversion (dosa) <br>
      3. Moha-mula-cittas, or cittas rooted in ignorance (moha) 
</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Moha (ignorance) arises with every akusala citta. Akusala
    cittas rooted in lobha (attachment) actually have two roots: moha and lobha. They are
    named lobha-mula-cittas', since there is not only moha, which arises with every akusala
    citta, but lobha as well. Lobha-mula-cittas are thus named after the root which is lobha.
    Akusala cittas rooted in dosa (aversion) have two roots as well: moha and dosa. They are
    named 'dosa-mula-cittas' after the root which is 'dosa'. There is more than one type of
    citta in each of the three classes of akusala cittas because there is such a great variety
    of cittas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As regards lobha-mula-cittas, there are eight different
    types. When we know more about the characteristic of lobha and realize when it arises we
    may notice that we have different types of lobha-mula-cittas. Lobha is the paramattha
    dhamma (absolute reality) which is cetasika (mental factor arising with the citta); it is
    a reality and thus it can be experienced. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lobha is 'clinging' or 'attachment'. The 'Visuddhimagga'
    (XIV, 162) states: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">....lobha has the characteristic of grasping an object,
      like birdlime (lit. 'monkey lime'). Its function is sticking, like meat put in a hot pan.
      It is manifested as not giving up, like the dye of lampblack. Its proximate cause is
      seeing enjoyment in things that lead to bondage. Swelling with the current of craving, it
      should be regarded as taking (beings) with it to states of loss, as a swift-flowing river
      does to the great ocean. 
</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lobha is sometimes translated as 'greed' or 'craving'; it
    can be translated by different words, since there are many degrees of lobha. Lobha can be
    coarse, medium or subtle. Most people can recognize lobha when it is very obvious, but not
    when it is of a lesser degree. For example, we can recognize lobha when we are inclined to
    eat too much of a delicious meal, or when we are attached to alcoholic drinks and
    cigarettes. We are attached to people and we suffer when we lose those who are dear to us
    through death. Then we can see that attachment brings sorrow. Sometimes attachment is very
    obvious, but there are many degrees of lobha and often we may not know that we have lobha.
    Cittas arise and fall away very rapidly and we may not realize it when lobha arises on
    account of what we experience in daily life through the six doors, especially if the
    degree of lobha is not as intense as greed or lust. Every time there is a pleasant sight,
    sound, odour, taste or impression through the body-sense, lobha is likely to arise. It
    arises countless times a day. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lobha arises when there are conditions for its arising; It
    is beyond control. In many suttas the Buddha speaks about lobha points out the dangers of
    it and the way to overcome lobha. The pleasant objects which can be experienced through
    the five senses are in several suttas called the 'five strands of sense-pleasures'. We
    read in the 'Maha-dukkhakkhandha -sutta'; ('Greater Discourse on the Stems of
    Anguish', Middle Length Saying I, No. 13) that the Buddha, when he was staying near
    Savatthi, in the Jeta Grove, said to the monks: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And what, monks, is the satisfaction in pleasures of these
      senses? These five, monks, are the strands of sense-pleasures. What five? Material shapes
      cognisable by the eye, agreeable, pleasant, liked, enticing, connected with sensual
      pleasures, alluring. Sounds, cognisable by the ear... Smells, cognisable by the
      nose... . Tastes, cognisable by the tongue...  Touches, cognisable by the body,
      agreeable, pleasant, liked, enticing, connected with sensual pleasures, alluring. These,
      monks, are the five strands of sense pleasures. Whatever pleasure, whatever happiness
      arises in consequence of these five strands of sense-pleasures, this is the satisfaction
      in sense-pleasures. 
</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The satisfaction in sense-pleasures in not true happiness.
    Those who do not know the Buddha's teachings may think that attachment is wholesome,
    especially when it arises with a pleasant feeling. They may not know the difference
    between attachment and lovingkindness (metta), phenomena which may both arise with a
    pleasant feeling. However, a citta accompanied by pleasant feeling is not necessarily
    kusala citta. When we learn more about akusala cittas and kusala cittas and when we are
    mindful of their characteristics, we will notice that the pleasant feeling which may arise
    with lobha-mula-citta (a citta rooted in attachment) is different from the pleasant
    feeling which may arise with kusala citta. Feeling (vedana) is a cetasika which arises
    with every citta. When the citta is akusala, the feeling is also akusala, and when the
    citta is kusala, the feeling is also kusala. We may be able to know the difference between
    the characteristic of the pleasant feeling arising when we are attached to an agreeable
    sight or sound, and the characteristic of the pleasant feeling arising when we are
    generous. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha pointed out that lobha brings sorrow. When we
    have to part from people who are dear to us or when we lose the things we enjoy, we have
    sorrow. If we are attached to a comfortable life we may have aversion when we have to
    endure hardship or when things do not turn out the way we want them to be. We read in the
    'Greater Discourse on the Stems of Anguish' which was quoted above, that the Buddha spoke
    to the monks about the sorrow due to pleasures of the senses: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And what, monks, is the peril in sense-pleasures? In this
      case, monks, a young man of family earns his living by some craft... He is afflicted by
      the cold, he is afflicted by the heat, suffering from the touch of gadflies, mosquitos,
      wind, sun, creeping things, dying of hunger and thirst. This, monks, is a peril in
      pleasures of the senses that is present, a stem of ill.... </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">If, monks, this young man of family rouses himself, exerts
      himself, strives thus, but if these possessions  
do not come to his hand, he grieves,
      mourns,  
laments, beating his breast and wailing, he falls into disillusionment, and
      thinks: 'Indeed my exertion is vain, indeed my striving is fruitless.' This too, monks, is
      a peril in the pleasures of the senses that is present.... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And again, monks, when sense-pleasures are the cause...
      kings dispute with kings, nobles dispute with nobles, brahmans dispute with brahmans,
      householders dispute with householders, a mother disputes with her son, a son disputes
      with his mother, a father disputes with his son, a son disputes with his father, a brother
      disputes with a brother, a brother disputes with a sister, a sister disputes with a
      brother, a friend disputes with a friend. Those who enter into quarrel, contention,
      dispute and attack one another with their hands and with stones and with sticks and with
      weapons, these suffer dying then and pain like unto dying. This too, monks, is a peril in
      the pleasures of the senses that is present...</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We then read about many more perils in pleasures of the
    senses, and about the bad results they will cause in the future. The Buddha also explained
    about the satisfaction and peril in 'material shapes'. We read: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'And what, monks, is the satisfaction in material shapes?
      Monks, it is like a girl in a noble's family or a brahman's family or a householder's
      family who at the age of fifteen or sixteen is not too tall, not too short, not too thin,
      not too fat, not too dark, not too fair - - is she, monks, at the height of her beauty and
      loveliness at that time?' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Yes, Lord.' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Monks, whatever happiness and pleasure arise because of
      beauty and loveliness, this is satisfaction in material shapes. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And what, monks is peril in material shapes? As to this,
      monks, one might see that same lady after a time, eighty or ninety or a hundred years old,
      aged, crooked as a rafter, bent, leaning on a stick, going along palsied, miserable, youth
      gone, teeth broken, hair thinned, skin wrinkled, stumbling along, the limbs discoloured...
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">....And again, monks, one might see that same lady, her
      body thrown aside in a cemetery - dead <br>
      for one, two or three days, swollen, discoloured, decomposing. What would you think,
      monks? That that which was former beauty and loveliness has vanished, a peril has
      appeared?' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Yes, Lord.' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'This too, monks, is a peril in material shapes....'</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What the Buddha told the monks may sound crude to us, but
    it is reality. We find it difficult to accept life as it really is: birth, old age,
    sickness and death. We cannot bear to think of our own body or the body of someone who is
    dear to us as being a corpse. We accept being born, but we find it difficult to accept the
    consequences of birth, which are old age, sickness and death. We wish to ignore the
    impermanence of all conditioned things. When we look into the looking-glass and when we
    take care of our body we are inclined to take it for something which stays and which
    belongs to ourselves. However, the body is only rupa, elements which fall away as soon as
    they have arisen. There is no particle of the body which lasts. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Taking the body for self is a form of wrong view, in Pali:
    ditthi. Ditthi is a cetasika which can arise with lobha-mula-cittas (cittas rooted in
    attachment). There are eight types of lobha-mula-citta and of these types four are
    accompanied by ditthi. When lobha-mula-citta with ditthi arises there is wrong view at
    that moment. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are different kinds of ditthi. The belief in a
    'self' is one kind of ditthi. When we take mental phenomena or physical phenomena for
    'self' there is ditthi. Some people believe that there is a self which exists in this life
    and which will continue to exist after this lifespan is over. This is the
    '
eternity-belief';. Others believe in a self which, existing only in this life,
    will be annihilated after this lifespan is over. This is the 'annihilation- belief'.
    Another form of ditthi is the belief that there is no kamma which produces vipaka, that
    deeds do not bring their results. There have always been people in different countries who
    think that they can be purified of their imperfections merely by ablution in water or by
    prayers. It is their belief that the results of ill deeds they committed can thus be
    warded off. They do not know that each deed can bring about its own result. We can only
    purify ourselves of imperfections if the wisdom is cultivated. If one thinks that deeds do
    not bring about their appropriate results one may easily be inclined to believe that the
    cultivation of wholesomeness is useless. This kind of belief may lead to ill deeds and to
    the corruption of society. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of the eight types of lobha-mula-citta four types arise
    with wrong view (ditthi); they are called in Pali: ditthigata-sampavutta (sampayutta
    means: associated with). Four types of lobha-mula-dtta arise without wrong view; they are
    ditthigata-vippayutta (vippayutta means: dissociated from). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As regards the feeling which accompanies the lobha
    mula-citta, lobha-mula-cittas can arise either with pleasant feeling or with indifferent
    feeling, never with unpleasant feeling. The lobha is more intense when it arises with
    pleasant feeling. Of the four types of lobha-mula-citta which are accompanied by ditthi,
    two types arise with pleasant feeling(somanassa), they are somanassa-sahagata (accompanied
    by pleasant feeling) ; two types arise with indifferent feeling (upekkha, they are
    upekkha-sahagata. For example, when one clings to the view that there is a self which will
    continue to exist, the citta can be accompanied by pleasant feeling or by indifferent
    feeling. Of the four lobha-mula-cittas arising without ditthi, two types are accompanied
    by pleasant feeling (somanassa-sahagata) and two types are accompanied by indifferent
    feeling (upekkha-sahagata). Thus, of the eight types of lobha-mula-citta, four types arise
    with pleasant feeling and four types arise with indifferent feeling. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In classifying lobha-mula-cittas there is yet another
    distinction to be made. Lobha-mula-cittas can be 'asankharika' (unprompted) or
    'sasankharika' (prompted). Asankharika is sometimes translated as 'not induced',
    'unprompted' or 'spontaneous'; sasankharika is translated as 'induced' or 'prompted'. The
    'visuddhimagga' states about lobha-mula-citta that it is sasankharika 'when it is with
    consciousness which is sluggish and urged on'. The lobha-mula-cittas which are
    sasankharika can be prompted by the advice or request of someone else, or they arise
    induced by one's own previous consideration. Even when they are 'prompted' by one's own
    consideration, they are sasankharika; the cittas are 'sluggish and urged on'. Thus, when
    lobha is asankharika it is more intense than when it is sasankharika. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of the four lobha-mula-cittas arising with ditthi, two
    types are asankharika and two types are sasankharika. As regards the lobha-mula-cittas
    arising without ditthi, two types are asankharika and two types are sasankharika. Thus, of
    the eight lobha-mula-cittas, four types are asankharika and four types are sasankharika. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is useful to learn the Pali terms and their meaning,
    because the English translation does not render the meaning of realities very clearly. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The eight types of lobha-mula-citta are: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, with wrong view,
      unprompted. (Somanassa-sahagatam ditthigata -sampayuttam, asankharikam ekam) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, with wrong view,
      prompted. (Somanassa-sahagatam, ditthigata -sampayuttam, sasankharikam ekam) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, without wrong view,
      unprompted. (Somanassa-sahagatam, ditthigata-vippayuttam , asankharikam ekam ) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, without wrong view,
      prompted. (Somanassa-sahagatam, ditthigata -vippayuttam, sasankharikam ekam) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">5. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, with wrong view,
      unprompted. (Upekkha-sahagatam, ditthigata -sampayuttam, asankharikam ekam) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">6. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, with wrong view,
      prompted. (Upekkha-sahagatam, ditthigata -sampayuttam, sasankharikam ekam) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">7. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, without wrong view,
      unprompted. (Upekkha-sahagatam, ditthigata -vippayuttam, asankharikam ekam) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">8. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, without wrong view,
      prompted. (Upekkha-sahagatam, ditthigata -vippayuttam, sasankhhrikam ekam) 
</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As we have seen, lobha-mula-cittas can be asankharika
    (unprompted) or sasankharika (prompted). The 'Atthasalini' 225 gives an example of
    lobha-mula-cittas, accompanied by ditthi, which are sasarikharika (prompted). A son of a
    noble family marries a woman who has wrong views and thus he associates with people who
    have wrong views. Gradually he accepts those wrong views and then they are pleasing to
    him. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lobha-mula-cittas without ditthi which are sasankharika
    arise, for example, when one, though at first not attached to alcoholic drink, takes
    pleasure in it after someone else persuades one to drink. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As we have seen, lobha-mula-cittas can be accompanied by
    pleasant feeling or by indifferent feeling. Lobha-mula-cittas without ditthi, accompanied
    by pleasant feeling, can arise for example, when we enjoy ourselves when seeing a
    beautiful colour or hearing an agreeable sound. At such moments we can be attached without
    taking what we see or hear for 'self'. When we enjoy beautiful clothes, go to the cinema,
    or laugh and talk with others about pleasurable things there can be many moments of
    enjoyment without the idea (of self) but there can also be moments with ditthi, moments of
    clinging to a '
self'. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lobha-mula-cittas without ditthi, accompanied by
    indifferent feeling may arise, for example, when we like to stand up, or like to take hold
    of different objects. Since we generally do not have happy feeling with these actions,
    there may be lobha with indifferent feeling at such moments. Thus we see that lobha often
    motivates the most common actions of our daily life. </font></p>
