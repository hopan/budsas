    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">T</font><font face="Times New Roman">he Buddha
    spoke about realities as elements in order to remind us that they are impermanent and not
    self. When we speak about elements we usually think of the elements in chemistry or
    physics which have each their own characteristics. In chemistry and physics matter is
    analysed into elements, but it may seem strange to us to regard the eye or seeing as
    elements. We are not used to consider them as elements because we are inclined to take
    them for 'self'. 
 </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What we take for self are only nama-elements and
    rupa-elements which arise because of their appropriate conditions and then fall away
    again. Eyesense is only an element which has its own characteristic and is devoid of self
    ; it is rupa which arises because of conditions and then falls away again. Seeing is only
    an element which has its own characteristic and is devoid of self ; it is nama which
    arises because of conditions and falls away again. 
 </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">ln the Buddha's teachings realities are classified as
    elements, some of which are rupa and some of which are nama. When they are classified as
    eighteen elements; they are as follows: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The five senses: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. 
 eye-element (cakkhu-dhatu) <br>
      2. 
 ear-element (sota-dhatu) <br>
      3. 
 nose-element (ghana-dhatu) <br>
      4. 
 tongue-element (jivha-dhatu) <br>
      5. 
 body-element (kaya-dhatu) which is the body-sense </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The five objects (experienced through the five senses): </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">6. 
 visible object-element (rupa-dhatu) <br>
      7. 
 sound-element (sadda-dhatu) <br>
      8. 
 smell-element (gandha-dhatu) <br>
      9. 
 taste-element (rasa-dhatu) <br>
      10. 
 element of tangible objects (photthabba-dhatu), </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">comprising the following three kinds of rupa: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>earth-element</b> 
 (solidity), appearing as
      hardness or softness <br>
      <b>fire-element</b> 
 (temperature), appearing as heat or cold <br>
      <b>wind-element</b>, appearing as motion or pressure </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The dvi-panca-vinnanas (experiencing the five sense
    objects): </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">11. 
 seeing-consciousness-element 

      (cakkhu-vinnana-dhatu) 
 <br>
      12. 
 hearing-consciousness-element (sota-vinnan-adhatu) 
 <br>
      13. 
 smelling-consciousness-element (ghana-vinnana-dhatu) 
 <br>
      14. 
 tasting-consciousness-element (jivha-vinnana-dhatu) <br>
      15. 
 body-consciousness-element (kaya-vinnana-dhatu) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Three more elements: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">16. 
 mano-dhatu or mind-element <br>
      17. 
 dhamma-dhatu <br>
      18. 
 mano-vinnana-dhatu or mind-consciousness-element 
 </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The five elements which are the five sense-doors are rupa
    and the five elements which are the objects experienced through the sense-doors are rupa
    as well. The five elements which are the dvi-panca-vinnanas, experiencing these objects,
    are nama. There are two cittas which are cakkhu-vinnana-dhatu, since seeing-consciousness
    can be kusala vipaka or akusala vipaka. It is the same with the other panca-vinnanas. Thus
    there are 'five pairs' of citta which are panca-vinnana-dhatu. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The element which is mano-dhatu or mind-element is nama.
    Mano-dhatu comprises the panca- dvaravajjana-citta
    (five-sense-door-adverting-consciousness) and the two types of sampaticchana-citta
    (receiving-consciousness) which are kusala vipaka and akusala vipaka. Thus three kinds of
    citta are mano-dhatu. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dhamma-dhatu comprises both nama and rupa. Dhamma-dhatu is
    the cetasikas, the subtle rupas (sukhuma-rupas) and nibbana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mano-vinnana-dhatu or mind-consciousness-element is nama.
    It comprises all cittas which are not the dvi-panca-vinnanas and not mano-dhatu. For
    example, santirana- citta (investigating-consciousness), mano-dvaravajjana-citta
    (mind-door-adverting-consciousness) and the cittas performing the function of javana such
    as lobha-mula-citta are mano-vinnana-dhatu. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Panca-vinnana-dhatu (seeing-consciousness-element, etc.),
    the mano-dhatu (mind-element) and the mano-vinnana-dhatu (mind-consciousness-element) are:
    vinnana-dhatu (consciousness-element). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dhamma-dhatu is not identical with dhammarammana
    (mind-objects). Cittas are included in dhammarammana, but not in dhamma-dhatu, since
    dhamma-dhatu is: cetasikas, subtle rupas and nibbana. When cittas are classified as
    elements they are the seven classes of vinnana-dhatu, namely: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Panca-vinnana-dhatu (which are five classes), mano-dhatu
    (mind-element), mano-vinnana-dhatu (mind-consciousness-element). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Concepts and conventional terms (pannatti) which are
    included in dhammarammana are not dhamma-dhatu, because they are not paramattha dhammas.
    Only paramattha dhammas are classified as elements. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes the Buddha spoke about six elements ; or he
    classified realities as two elements. There are many different ways of classifying
    realities, but no matter in which way realities are classified, as khandha, by way of
    arammana (objects), or in any other way, we should remember the purpose of classifying
    realities : realizing that what we take for self are only nama-elements and rupa-elements.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the 'Satipatthana-sutta' (Discourse on the Applications
    of Mindfulness, Middle Length Sayings I, No.10) we read in the section about mindfulness
    of the body, that the Buddha spoke about the body in terms of elements. The text states: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And again, monks, a monk reflects on this body according
      to how it is placed or disposed in respect of the elements, thinking: 'In this body there
      is the element of extension (solidity), the element of cohesion, the element of heat, the
      element of motion.' Monks, even as a skilled cattle-butcher, or his apprentice, having
      slaughtered a cow, might sit displaying its carcass at a cross-roads, even so, monks, does
      a monk reflect on this body itself according to how it is placed or disposed in respect of
      the elements, thinking: 'In this body there is the element of extension, the element of
      cohesion, the 
 element of heat, the element of motion'. Thus he fares along
      contemplating the body in the body internally...and he fares along independently of and
      not grasping anything in the world. It is thus too, monks, that a monk fares along
      contemplating the body in the body... </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The 'Visuddhimagga' (XI, 30) states: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">What is meant? Just as a butcher, while feeding the cow,
      bringing it to the shambles, keeping it tied up after bringing it there, slaughtering it,
      and seeing it slaughtered and dead, does not lose the perception 'cow' so long as he has
      not carved it up and divided it into parts ; but when he has divided it up and is sitting
      there, he loses the perception 'cow' and the perception 'meat' occurs ; he does not think
      'I am selling cow' or 'They are carrying cow away', but rather he thinks 'I am selling
      meat' or 'They are carrying meat away'; so too this bhikkhu, while still a foolish
      ordinary person--both formerly as a layman and as one gone forth into homelessness--, does
      not lose the perception 'living being' or 'man' or 'person' so long as he does not, by
      resolution of the compact into elements, review this body, however placed, however
      disposed, as consisting of elements. But when he does review it as consisting of elements,
      he loses the perception 'living being' and his mind establishes itself upon elements....</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It may not be appealing to see the body as elements. We
    think of people as 'this man' or 'that woman'. We are not used to analysing what we take
    for a 'person' in the way we analyse matter, as we do, for example in physics. One might
    find it crude to think of a body carved up as a cow is carved up by a butcher. However, if
    we consider the body as it is, there are only elements. Isn't it true that there are
    solidity, cohesion, temperature and motion? Are these realities 'self', or are they
    elements devoid of 'self'? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Do the four elements of solidity, cohesion, temperature
    and motion have anything to do with our daily life? These elements arise all the time.
    Temperature can appear either as heat or cold; do we not feel heat or cold very often?
    When we are stung by an insect we can experience the characteristic of heat. We can feel
    impact of hardness or softness on our body when we are lying down, sitting, walking or
    standing. Is that not daily life? If we are mindful of the characteristics of the elements
    more often, we will see things as they are. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha reminded people of the truth in many different
    ways. Sometimes he spoke about the body as a corpse in different stages of dissolution. Or
    he spoke about the 'parts of the body' and he explained how the body is full of
    impurities, in order to remind people that what we take for our body are only elements
    which are devoid of beauty, which are dukkha, impermanent and not self. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We read in the 'Satipatthana-sutta', in the section about
    mindfulness of the body: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Monks, it is like a double-mouthed provision bag that is
      full of various kinds of grain such as hill-paddy, paddy, kidneybeans, peas, sesame, rice;
      and a keen-eyed man, pouring them out, were to reflect: 'That's hill-paddy, that's paddy,
      that's kidneybeans, that's peas, that's sesame, that's rice.' Even so monks, does a monk
      reflect on precisely this body itself, encased in skin and full of various impurities,
      from the soles of the feet up and from the crown of the head down...</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Not only the body, but also the mind should be considered
    as elements. There is nothing in our life which is not an element. Our past lives were
    only elements and our future lives will only be elements. We are inclined to think of our
    future life and wish for a happy rebirth. We should, however, realize that there is no
    self which in the future will have another existence ; there are and will be only
    elements. We have learned to classify citta in different ways and this reminds us that
    cittas are only elements. Not only cittas are elements, but cetasikas too are elements. We
    are attached to happy feeling and we dislike unpleasant feeling. Feelings, however, are
    only elements, which arise because of conditions. When we are tired or sick we take
    tiredness and sickness for self and we have aversion. Why do we not accept unpleasant
    things as they come to us, since they are only elements? One might not be inclined to see
    realities as elements, but it is the truth. One might not like to remember that things are
    impermanent, that birth is followed by ageing, sickness and death, but it is the truth.
    Why do we not want to see the truth? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the 'Discourse on the Manyfold Elements' (Middle Length
    Sayings III, 115) we read that the Buddha, while he was staying in the Jeta Grove, in
    Anathapindika's monastery, said to the monks that fears, troubles and misfortunes occur to
    the fool, not to the wise man. He said to the monks: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'...Monks, there is not fear, trouble, misfortune for the
      wise man. Wherefore, monks, thinking, 'Investigating, we will become wise', this is how
      you must train yourselves, monks.' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">When this had been said, the venerable Ananda spoke thus
      to the Lord: 'What is the stage at which it suffices to say, revered sir: 'Investigating,
      the monk is wise'?' 'Ananda, as soon as a monk is skilled in the elements and skilled in
      the (sense) fields and skilled in conditioned genesis and skilled in the possible and the
      impossible, it is at this stage, Ananda, that it suffices to say, 'Investigating, the monk
      is wise.'' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'But, revered sir, at what stage does it suffice to say,
      'The monk is skilled in the elements'?' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'There are these eighteen elements, Ananda: the element of
      eye, the element of material shape, the element of visual consciousness; the element of
      ear, the element of sound, the element of auditory consciousness ; the element of nose,
      the element of smell, the element of olfactory consciousness ; the element of tongue, the
      element of taste, the element of gustatory consciousness; the element of body, the element
      of touch, the element of bodily consciousness; the element of mind, the element of
      mind-objects, the element of mental consciousness. When, Ananda, he knows and sees these
      eighteen elements, it is at this stage that it suffices to say, 'The monk is skilled in
      the elements.' ' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Might there be another way also, revered sir, according
      to which suffices to say, 'The monk is skilled in the elements'?' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'There might be, Ananda. There are these six elements,
      Ananda: the element of extension, the element of cohesion, the element of radiation, the
      element of mobility, the element of space, the element of consciousness. When, Ananda, he
      knows and sees these six elements, it is at this stage that it suffices to say, 'The monk
      is skilled in the elements.'' 'Might there be another way also, revered sir, according to
      which it suffices to say, 'The monk is skilled in the elements'?' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'There might be, Ananda. There are these six elements,
      Ananda: the element of happiness, the element of anguish, the element of gladness, the
      element of sorrowing, the element of equanimity, the element of ignorance. When, Ananda,
      he knows and sees these six elements, it is at this stage that it suffices to say, 'The
      monk is skilled in the elements.''</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha then explained still other ways of being
    skilled in the elements and further on we read that Ananda asked again : </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Might there be another way also, revered sir, according
      to which it suffices to say, 'The monk is skilled in the elements'?' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'There might be, Ananda. There are these two elements,
      Ananda: the element that is constructed and the element that is unconstructed. When,
      Ananda, he knows and sees these two elements, it is at this stage that it suffices to say,
      'The monk is skilled in the element. 
</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The element which is constructed is all conditioned
    realities (the five khandhas), and the element which is unconstructed is nibbana. Also
    nibbana is an element, it is devoid of self. Nibbana is not a person, it is anatta. We
    read in this sutta about the monk who knows and sees the elements. Knowing and seeing the
    elements does not mean only knowing them in theory and thinking about them. One knows and
    sees the elements when panna realizes nama and rupa as they are: only elements, not self.
    This knowledge will lead to the end of 'fears, troubles and misfortunes'. </font></p>
