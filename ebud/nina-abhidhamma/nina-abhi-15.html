    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">A</font><font face="Times New Roman">n object
    which impinges on one of the senses can be visible object, sound, smell, taste or an
    impression through the body-sense. Each one of these objects is rupa. They arise and fall
    away, but they do not fall away as rapidly as nama. Rupa lasts as long as seventeen
    moments of citta. When rupa impinges on one of the senses, the panca-dvaravajjana-citta
    (five-sense-door-adverting-consciousness), does not arise immediately. First there have to
    be bhavanga-cittas and they are: the atita-bhavanga (past bhavanga), the bhavanga-calana
    (vibrating bhavanga) and the bhavangupaccheda (arrest-bhavanga or last bhavanga-citta
    before the stream of <br>
    bhavanga-cittas is arrested). These bhavanga-cittas do not experience the rupa which has
    contacted one of the senses. The panca-dvaravajjana-citta, which is a kiriyacitta, adverts
    to the object which has impinged on one of the senses. It is succeeded by the
    dvi-panca-vinnana (seeing-consciousness, hearing-consciousness, etc. ) which is vipaka,
    the result of a good deed or an ill deed. There is, however, not only one moment of vipaka
    in a process, but several moments. The dvi-panca-vinnana is succeeded by
    sampaticchana-citta (receiving-consciousness) which is vipaka and this citta is succeeded
    by santirana-citta (investigating- consciousness) which is also vipaka. The
    santirana-citta is succeeded by the votthapana-citta (determining- consciousness) which is
    kiriyacitta. This citta is succeeded by seven javana-cittas which are, in the case of
    non-arahats, akusala cittas or kusala cittas. All cittas, starting with the
    panca-dvaravajjana-citta, experience the object which has impinged on one of the senses. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As we have seen, rupa lasts as long as seventeen moments
    of citta. 
 If the rupa which has impinged on one of the senses arose at the same time
    as the atita-bhavanga, then that rupa will not have fallen away yet when the seventh
    javana-citta has fallen away; only fifteen moments of citta have passed since the
    atita-bhavanga arose. Thus there could be two more cittas in that process which directly
    experience the object. After the javana- cittas two vipaka-cittas may arise which
    experience the object and these are the tadarammana-cittas (or tadalambana-cittas) They
    perform the function of tadalambana or tadarammana, which is sometimes translated as
    'registering' or 'retention'. Tadarammana literally means 'that object'; the citta 'hangs
    on' to that object. When the tadarammana-cittas have fallen away the sense-door process
    has run its full cruise. If the rupa which impinges on one of the senses has arisen before
    the atita-bhavanga, the process cannot run its full course, because the rupa falls away
    before the tadarammana-cittas can arise. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Only in the sense-door process kamma can, after the
    javana-cittas produce the tadarammana-cittas which 'hang on' to the object. For those who
    are born in rupa-brahma planes where there are less conditions for sense-impressions, and
    for those who are born in arupa-brahma planes where there are no sense- impressions, there
    are no tadarammana-cittas. [Birth in a rupo-brahma plane is the result of rupa
    vacarakusala citta (rupa-jhanacitta) and birth in an arupa-brahma plane is the result of
    arupavacara kusala citta (arupa- hanacitta).] </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Summarizing the cittas which succeed one another when rupa
    impinges on one of the senses and becomes the object of cittas of a sense-door process: </font></p>

      17. Tadarammana-citta (registering-consciousness) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The tadarammana-citta experiences an object not only
    through the five sense-doors, but also through the mind-door. In the sense-door process
    tadarammana-citta can arise only when the object has not fallen away yet. If
    tadarammana-cittas arise in the sense-door process they can arise also in the succeeding
    mind-door process. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The tadarammana-citta is a vipakacitta which can
    experience an object through six doors. If the object is visible object, which, in the
    eye-door process, is experienced by citta through the eye-door, then the
    tadarammana-cittas of that process also experience the object through the eye-door. The
    tadarammana-cittas of the mind-door process succeeding the eye-door process experience
    that object through the mind-door. If the object which contacts the sense-door is
    unpleasant, all vipakacittas of that process and thus also the tadarammana-cittas, if they
    arise, are akusala vipaka. The tadarammana-cittas of the mind-door process succeeding that
    sense-door process are also akusala vipaka. If the object which contacts the sense-door is
    pleasant, all vipakacittas of that process, tadarammana-cittas included, are kusala
    vipaka. It is the same with the tadarammana cittas of the subsequent mind-door process. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The function of tadarammana can be performed by eleven
    different kinds of citta: by three ahetuka vipakacittas (unaccompanied by roots or hetus)
    and by eight sahetuka vipakacittas (accompanied by sobhana hetus). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If the tadarammana-citta is ahetuka, the function of
    tadarammana is performed by santirana-citta. As we have seen, santirana-citta, which is
    always ahetuka vipaka, can perform more than one function. 
 Santirana-citta performs
    the function of santirana (investigating) when it arises in the sense-door process and
    succeeds sampaticchana-citta. Apart from the function of, santirana, santirana-citta can
    perform the functions of patisandhi (rebirth), bhavanga, cuti (dying) and, moreover, it
    can perform the function of tadarammana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As stated before, there are three kinds of
    santirana-citta: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Santirana-citta which is akusala vipaka, accompanied by
      upekkha (indifferent feeling). <br>
      2. Santiana-citta which is kusala vipaka, accompanied by upekkha. <br>
      3. Santirana-citta which is kusala vipaka, accompanied by somanassa (pleasant feeling). </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Only the first and the second kind of santirana-citta
    (santirana-citta which is akusala vipaka, and santirana-citta which is kusala vipaka,
    accompanied by upekkha) can perform the functions of patisandhi, bhavanga and cuti. The
    function of santirana (investigating) can be performed by all three kinds of
    santirana-citta. As we have seen, santirana-citta accompanied by somanassa performs the
    function of santirana when the object is extraordinarily pleasant. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All the time cittas arise and fall away, performing
    different functions. The last function of citta in life is the function of cuti (dying).
    When we say in conventional language that a person has died, the cuti-citta
    (dying-consciousness), which is the last citta of that life, has fallen away. The
    cuti-citta is succeeded by the patisandhi-citta (rebirth-consciousness) of the following
    life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Death is unavoidable. Everybody, no matter whether he is
    in one of the hell planes, in the human-being plane or in one of the heavenly planes has
    to have cuti-citta. We read in the teachings about birth, old age, sickness and death. Old
    age is mentioned immediately after birth, before sickness is mentioned. The reason is that
    as soon as we are born, we are already ageing, we are already on our way to death. We read
    in the 'Khuddaka Nikaya' ('sutta-Nipata', 'Woven Cadences';, Ch.lll, The Great
    Chapter, par. 8, The Dart, vs. 574-583, I use the translation by E.M. Hare.): </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">How insignificant is man's lot here, <br>
      How brief, obscure, how troubled, fraught with ill! <br>
      there is no means whereby man shall not die: <br>
      Death follows on decay: such is life's course. <br>
      The early ripening fruit hazards the fall: <br>
      Ever death's hazard haunts the lives of men. <br>
      Just as the potter's earthen vessel end <br>
      In shards, so too man's life. Young and mature, <br>
      The fool and sage, come all within the power <br>
      Of death: death is for all the common lot; <br>
      And of death's victims passing to yond world, <br>
      No father saves his son, no kith his kin. <br>
      See! while they crowd and gaze and weep, their kin <br>
      Are one by one, as ox to slaughter, borne. <br>
      Thus smitten is the world by old age and death, <br>
      The wise world-plight discern, lamenting not. <br>
      Thou knowest not the 'whence' or 'whither' way <br>
      And, seeing neither course, grievest in vain!</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If one is not wise, one grieves, but for those who
    cultivate the Eightfold Path, there will be less sorrow. For him who has attained the
    stage of the arahat, there will be cuti-citta, but it will not be succeeded by
    patisandhi-citta. Then there is an end to birth, old age, sickness and death. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We read in the 'Gradual Sayings' (Book of the Threes, Ch.
    VII, par. 62, Terror, V and VI): 
 </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Monks, these three terrors part mother and son. What
      three? 
 </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">A mother cannot bear to see her son grow old. She says, 'I
      am growing old. Let not my son grow old.' The son likewise cannot bear to see his mother
      grow old. He says, 'I am growing old. Let not my mother grow old.' And it is the same with
      regard to getting sick and dying. These are the three terrors that part mother and son. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">But, monks, there is a way, there is a practice that leads
      to the abandoning, to the overpassing of these three terrors that part mother and son, a
      way which joins mother and son. What is that way, what is that practice which so leads?. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is just this Eightfold Way, to wit: Right view,.....
      right concentration, That is the way, that is the practice... ..</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If one is not an arahat yet, there will be a
    patisandhi-citta succeeding the cuti-citta, Before the cuti-citta arises, there are only
    five javana-citta instead of seven and these are the last javana-cittas of that lifespan.
    If kusala kamma will produce the patisandhi-citta of the next life these last
    javana-cittas are kusala cittas and if akusala kamma will produce the patisandhi-citta of
    the next life 
 they are akusala cittas. These javana-cittas can experience a pleasant
    or unpleasant object through one of the sense-doors or through the mind-door and this
    object is conditioned by the kamma which will produce the patisandhi-citta (See ch.10) .
    One may remember previous kamma, or one may experience a sign or symbol of it, or else one
    may experience a sign or symbol of the place of one's rebirth. These javana-cittas may or
    may not be followed by tadarammana-cittas. The cuti-citta has only the function of being
    the dying-moment of that life. The cuti-citta is vipakacitta produced by the kamma which
    produced the patisandhi-citta and the bhavanga-cittas of the life which is just ending; it
    is of the same type as these cittas and it experiences the same object. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the cuti-citta has fallen away the patisandhi-citta
    of the following life arises, which citta may be of a different type, depending on the
    kamma which produces it. This patisandhi-citta experiences the same object as the last
    javana-cittas arising before the cuti-citta of the previous life. The patisandhi-citta,
    all bhavanga-cittas and the cuti-citta of the next life experience that object. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The same types of citta which can perform the functions of
    patisandhi and bhavanga, can perform the function of cuti. Since there are nineteen types
    of citta which can perform the function of patisandhi (See ch.ll) and the function of
    bhavanga, there are nineteen types of citta which can perform the function of cuti. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If someone suffers great pains before he dies because of
    an accident or sickness, the last javana-cittas arising before the cuti-citta will not
    necessarily be akusala cittas. There may be akusala cittas with aversion when he feels the
    pain, but the last javana-cittas may be kusala cittas. There may be 'wise attention'
    (yoniso manasikara) preceding the cuti-citta. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We read in the 'Gradual Sayings' (Book of the Sixes, Ch.
    VI, par. 2, Phagguna) that the Buddha visited the venerable Phagguna who was very ill.
    Phagguna had attained the second stage of enlightenment (the stage of the sakadagami; he
    was not yet completely freed from the 'five lower fetters';. We read in the sutta that
    the Buddha said to Phagguna: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'I hope, Phagguna, you're bearing up, keeping going; that
      Your aches and pains grow less, not more; that there are signs of their growing less, not
      more?' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Lord, I can neither bear up nor keep going; my aches and
      pains grow grievously more, not less; and there are signs of their growing more, not less.
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lord, the violent ache that racks my head is just as
      though some lusty fellow chopped at it with a sharp-edged sword; Lord, I can neither bear
      up nor keep going; my pains grow more, not less....' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">So the Exalted one instructed him, roused him, gladdened
      him and comforted him with Dhamma-talk, then rose from his seat and departed. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now not long after the Exalted One's departure, the
      venerable Phagguna died; and at the time of his death his faculties were completely
      purified. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then went the venerable Ananda to the Exalted One, saluted
      him, and sat down at one side. So seated, he said: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Lord, not long after the Exalted One left, the venerable
      Phagguna died; and at that time his faculties were completely purifiedl </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'But why, Ananda, should not the faculties of the monk
      Phagguna have been completely purified? The monk's mind, Ananda, had not been wholly freed
      from the five lower fetters: but, when he heard that Dhamma teaching, his mind was wholly
      freed. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are these six advantages, Ananda, in hearing Dhamma
      in time, in testing its goodness in time. What six? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Consider, Ananda, the monk whose mind is not wholly freed
      from the five lower fetters, but, when dying, is able to see the Tathagata: the Tathagata
      teaches him Dhamma, lovely in the beginning, lovely in the middle, lovely in the end, its
      goodness, its significance; and makes known the brahman-life(1), wholly fulfilled,
      perfectly pure. When he has heard that Dhamma teaching, his mind is wholly freed from the
      five lower fetters(2) . This Ananda, is the first advantage in hearing Dhamma in time.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(<em>1. In Pali: 
 brahma-cariya: pure or holy life.
      This term is used for the life of the monks and for the life of laypeople who observe
      eight precepts. However it is also used with regard to all those who develop the Eightfold
      Path. The goal of the 'brahma-cariya' is the eradication of all defilements.) </em></font></p>
      <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">(2. Those who have attained the third stage of

    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Or...  though not just able to see the Tathagata, sees
      his disciple, who teaches him Dhamma... and makes known the brahman-life... Then is his
      mind wholly freed from the five lower fetters. This, Ananda, is the second advantage... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Or.., though not able to see the Tathagata or his
      disciple, continues to reflect in mind on Dhamma, as heard, as learnt, ponders on it,
      pores over it. Then is his mind wholly freed from the five lower fetters. This, Ananda, is
      the third advantage in testing its goodness in time... '  
  
</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The same is said with regard to the monk who has attained
    the third stage of enlightenment (the stage of the anagami), and who, has the opportunity
