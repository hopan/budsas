    PATISANDHI-CITTA </font></h2>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-ooOoo-</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">W</font><font face="Times New Roman">e see many
    different beings in this world, men and animals, all with different appearances and
    different characters. They must have been different from the first moment of their lives,
    from the moment of the patisandhi-citta or rebirth-consciousness. One may wonder how many
    different types of patisandhi-citta there are. On the other hand, beings who are born in
    this world also have things in common. We share the same world and we receive impressions
    through the senses, no matter whether we are rich or poor. On account of the objects which
    we experience through the six doors, kusala cittas and akusala cittas arise. All these
    cittas, arising in our daily life, are kamavacara cittas or cittas of the
    'sense-sphere';. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One could divide human beings as regards their birth into
    two classes: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Those who are born with a patisandhi-citta which is
      ahetuka kusala vipaka (which means that the kusala vipakacitta is not accompanied by
      beautiful roots: by alobha or generosity, by adosa or kindness, or by panna or wisdom) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. Those who are born with a patisandhi-citta which is
      sahetuka kusala vipaka (kusala vipaka accompanied by beautiful roots) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When a human being is born with a patisandhi-citta which
    is ahetuka, his birth is the result of kamavacara kusala kamma, but the degree of the
    kusala kamma is less than the kusala kamma which produces a sahetuka patisandhi-citta.
    People who are born with an ahetuka patisandhi-citta are handicapped from the first moment
    of life. Eye-sense or ear-sense does not develop or they have other defects. However, when
    we see someone who is handicapped we cannot tell whether there was at the first moment of
    his life an ahetuka patisandhi-citta or a sahetuka patisandhi-citta. We cannot tell
    whether someone was handicapped from the first moment of his life or whether he became
    handicapped later on, even while he was still in his mother's womb and thus we do not know
    which type of patisandhi-citta he was born with. The fact that a person is handicapped has
    not happened by chance; it is due to one's kamma. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is only one type of patisandhi-citta which is
    ahetuka kusala vipaka, but there are many degrees of this vipaka. The kamma which produces
    this vipakacitta can cause birth in different kinds of surroundings: in unpleasant
    surroundings, though not in woeful planes, and in pleasant surroundings. It can even cause
    birth in the lowest heavenly plane. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is also an ahetuka patisandhi-citta which is akusala
    vipaka. This type of citta does not arise in the human plane, but in a woeful plane. Only
    one type of patisandhi-citta is akusala vipaka, but it is of many degrees. There are many
    varieties of akusala kamma and thus there must be many varieties of unhappy rebirth. The
    unhappy rebirth we can see in this world is birth as an animal. There are three more
    classes of woeful planes, which we cannot see; they are the world of the 'petas' (ghosts),
    the world of 'asuras' (demons), and the hell planes. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The function of patisandhi can be performed by different
    types of vipakacittas produced by different kammas. It depends on kamma as to which type
    of vipakacitta performs the function of patisandhi-citta in the case of such and such a
    being. Two ahetuka vipakacittas which perform the function of patisandhi are santirana
    akusala vipakacitta and santirana kusala vipakacitta. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When santirana-citta arises in a process of cittas
    experiencing an object through one of the five senses, the santirana-citta performs the
    function of investigating (santirana) the object. As we have seen, santirana-citta is an
    ahetuka vipakacitta. The same type of citta can perform more than one function, but at
    different moments. Santirana-citta can also perform the function of patisandhi. When the
    santirana-citta performs the function of patisandhi it does not arise in a sense-door
    process and it does not investigate an object. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As we have seen (Ch.9), there are three kinds of
    santirana-citta: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Santirana-citta which is akusala vipaka, accompanied by
      upekkha (indifferent feeling) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. Santirana-citta which is kusala vipaka, accompanied by
      upekkha </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. Santirana-citta which is kusala vipaka, accompanied by
      somanassa (pleasant feeling) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The santirana-citta which is akusala vipaka, accompanied
    by upekkha, can perform the function of patisandhi in woeful planes. This means that the
    type of patisandhi-citta arising in woeful planes is of the same type as the akusala
    vipakacitta which is santirana-citta performing the function of investigating in a
    sense-door process of cittas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The santirana-citta which is kusala vipaka accompanied by
    upekkha, can, apart from the function of investigating in a sense-door process, also
    perform the function of patisandhi in human and heavenly planes. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Santirana-citta which is kusala vipaka accompanied by
    somanassa does not perform the function of patisandhi. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Akusala kamma and kusala kamma of different beings can
    produce nineteen different types of patisandhi-citta in all, arising in different planes
    of existence. One of these types is akusala vipaka and eighteen types are kusala vipaka.
    Of the types of citta which are kusala vipaka, one type is ahetuka kusala vipaka and
    seventeen types are sahetuka kusala vipaka (accompanied by beautiful roots). There are
    many degrees of each of these nineteen types of patisandhi-citta because kamma can be of
    many degrees. It is due to kamma that people are born ugly or beautiful and that they are
    born in unpleasant or in pleasant surroundings. The fact that one is born into miserable
    circumstances does not mean that one's next birth will also be in miserable circumstances.
    It all depends on the kamma one has accumulated. As regards people who are born into happy
    circumstances, if akusala kamma produce results, their next birth may be an unhappy one. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We read in the 'Gradual Sayings' (Book of the Fours, Ch.
    IX, pal. 5, Darkness): </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Monks, these four persons are found existing in the
      world. What four? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">He who is in darkness and bound for darkness; he who is in
      darkness but bound for light; he who is in light but bound for darkness; he who is in
      light and bound for light. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And how, monks, is a person in darkness bound for
      darkness? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this case a certain person is born in a low family, the
      family of a scavenger or a hunter or a basket-weaver or wheel-wright or sweeper, or in the
      family of some wretched man hard put to it to find a meal or earn a living, where food and
      clothes are hard to get. Moreover, he is ill-favoured, ugly, dwarfish, sickly, purblind,
      crooked, lame or paralysed, with never a bite or sup, without clothes, vehicle, without
      perfumes or flower-garlands, bed, dwelling or lights. He lives in the practice of evil
      with body, speech and thought; and so doing, when body breaks up, after death, he is
      reborn in the waste, the way of woe, the downfall, in hell. Thus, monks, is the person who
      is in darkness and bound for darkness. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And how, monks, is a person in darkness but bound for
      light? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this case a certain person is born in a low family...
      without bed, dwelling or lights. He lives in the practice of good with body, speech and
      thought...and so doing, when body breaks up, after death he is reborn in the happy bourn,
      in the heaven-world. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And how, monks, is a person in light but bound for
      darkness? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this case a certain person is born in a high family...
      And that man is well-built, comely and charming, possessed of supreme beauty of form. He
      is one able to get clothes, vehicle, perfumes and flower-garlands, bed, dwelling and
      lights. But he lives in the practice of evil with body, speech and thought. So doing, when
      body breaks up, after death he is reborn in the waste, the way of woe, the downfall, in
      hell. Thus, monks, is the person who is in light but bound for darkness. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And how, monks, is a person who is in light and bound for
      light? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this case a person is born in a high family...able to
      get clothes...bed, dwelling and lights. He lives in the . practice of good with body,
      speech and thought. So doing, when body breaks up after death, he is reborn in the happy
      bourn, in the heaven-world. Thus, monks, is one who is in light and bound for light. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">These, monks, are the four persons found existing in the
      world.'; </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The patisandhi-citta which is sahetuka vipaka (with
    beautiful roots) is the result of kusala kamma which is of a higher degree than the kusala
    kamma producing an ahetuka patisandhi-citta. There are eight different types of sahetuka
    vipakacittas which can perform the function of patisandhi. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">People are born with characters which are different; they
    are born with different degrees of wisdom or without wisdom. The patisandhi-cittas of
    people are different. When the patisandhi-citta is sahetuka, it is always accompanied by
    alobha (non-greed or generosity) and adosa (non-aversion or kindness), but not always by
    wisdom. It can be accompanied by wisdom or it can be without wisdom, depending on the
    kamma which produces it. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Apart from the difference in the number of roots (two
    hetus or three hetus) which accompany the sahetuka patisandhi-citta there are other
    differences. Kusala kamma which produces the patisandhi-citta can be kamma performed by
    kusala citta with somanassa or with upekkha, by kusala citta which is asankharika
    (unprompted) or sasankharika (prompted). Thus we see that several factors determine the
    degree of kusala kamma which produces its result accordingly. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus the sahetuka patisandhi-cittas which are the results
    of kamavacara kusala kammas (kusala kammas of the 'sense-sphere') can be classified as
    eight different types in all. Summing them up, they are: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, with wisdom,
      unprompted (Somanassa-sahagatam, nana- sampayuttam, asankharikam ekam) [Nana is wisdom
      (panna)] </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, with wisdom, prompted
      (Somanassa-sahagatam, nana- sampayuttam, sasankharikam ekam) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, without wisdom,
      unprompted (Somanassa-sahagatam-nana-vippayuttam, asankharikam ekam) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, without wisdom,
      prompted (Somanassa-sahagatam, nana-vippayuttam, sasankharikam ekam) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">5. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, with wisdom,
      unprompted (Upekkha-sahagatam, nana-sampayuttam, asankharikam ekam) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">6. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, with wisdom,
      prompted (Upekkha-sahagatam, nana-sampayuttam, sasankharikam ekam) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">7. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, without wisdom,
      unprompted (Upekkha-sahagatam, nana-vippayuttam, asarikharikam ekam) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">8. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, without wisdom,
      prompted (Upekkha-sahagatam, nana-vippayuttam, sasarikharikam ekam) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is useful to know more details about patisandhi-citta,
    because it can help us to understand why people are so different. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The eight types of sahetuka patisandhi-citta which are the
    results of kamavacara kusala kammas do not arise only in the human plane, but they also
    arise in those heavenly planes of existence which are kama-bhumi or 'sensuous' planes of
    existence. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are thirty-one classes of planes of existence in
    all. Eleven planes are kama-bhumis (or kama-lokas), of which one is the plane of human
    beings, six are heavenly planes and four are woeful planes. Beings born in one of the
    kama-bhumis have kamavacara cittas; they receive sense impressions. There are also other
    heavenly planes which are not kama-bhumi. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If one is born in one of the kama-bhumis and cultivates
    jhana (absorption) one can, besides kamavacara cittas, also have rupa-jhanacittas and
    arupa-jhanacittas. (For the difference between rupa-jhana and arupa-jhana see Ch XXII.) If
    one cultivates the Eightfold Path one can have lokuttara cittas (cittas which directly
    experience nibbana). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When one attains jhana, the kusala kamma one performs at
    that moment is not kamavacara kusala kamma; at the moment of jhana there are no
    sense-impressions. The kusala kamma which is jhana does not produce result in the same
    lifespan one attains it, but it can produce result in the form of the patisandhi-citta of
    the next life. In that case there are jhanacittas arising shortly before death and the
    patisandhi-citta of the next life experiences the same object as those jhanacittas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The result of a rupavacara kusala citta (kusala citta
    which Is rupa-jhanacitta) is birth in a heavenly plane which is not kamabhumi but a
    rupa-brahma-plane (fine-material world). The result of an arupavacara kusala citta (kusala
    citta which is arupa-jhanacitta) is birth in a heavenly plane which is an arupa-brahma
    plane (immaterial world). There are different rupa-brahma planes and arupa-brahma planes. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are five stages of rupa-jhana and thus there are
    five types of rupavacara kusala citta which can produce five types of rupavacara
    vipakacitta. There are four stages of arupa-jhana and thus there are four types of
    arupavacara kusala citta which can produce four types cf arupavacara vipakacitta.
    Altogether there are nine types of patisandhi-citta which are the results of the different
    types of jhanacittas. They are sahetuka vipakacittas (accompanied by beautiful roots) and
    they are always accompanied by panna. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Summarizing the nineteen types of patisandhi-citta, they
    are : </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1 akusala vipaka santirana-citta (ahetuka, result of
      akusala kamma) <br>
      1 kusala vipaka santirana-citta (ahetuka, result of kamavacara kusala kamma) <br>
      8 maha-vipakacittas (sahetuka, results of kamavacara kusala kamma) <br>
      5 rupavacara vipakacittas (sahetuka, results of rupa-jhanacittas) <br>
      4 arupavacara vipakacittas (sahetuka, results of arupa-jhanacittas) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We do not know which of our deeds will produce the
    patisandhi-citta of our next life. We do both good deeds and bad deeds; any one of these
    deeds or even a deed performed in a former life can produce the patisandhi-citta of the
    next life. The Buddha encouraged people to perform many kinds of kusala kamma. Each good
    deed is very valuable; it is certain to bear its fruit sooner or later. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We read in the 'Itivuttaka' ('As it was said', the Ones,
    Ch. III, par. 6, 'Khuddaka Nikaya') that the Buddha said to the monks: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Monks, if beings knew, as I know, the ripening of sharing
      gifts they would not enjoy their use without sharing them, nor would the taint of
      stinginess obsess the heart and stay there. Even if it were their last bit, their last
      morsel of food, they would not enjoy its use without sharing it, if there were anyone to
      receive it....' </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kusala kamma can cause a happy rebirth, but the end of
    birth is to be preferred to any kind of rebirth. If one cultivates the Eightfold Path and
    attains arahatship there will be no more rebirth. The dying-consciousness (cuti-citta) of
    the arahat is not succeeded by a patisandhi-citta. The Buddha often reminded people of the
    dangers of birth and encouraged them to be mindful, in order to attain the 'deathless'
    which is nibbana. We read in the 'Gradual Savings' (Book of the Eights, Ch -VIII, par. 4)
    that the Buddha, when he was staying at Nadika, in the Brick Hall, said to the monks: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Mindfulness of death, monks, when made become, when
      developed is very fruitful, of great advantage, merging and ending in the deathless. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And how, monks, is it so.... Take the case of a monk who,
      when the day declines and night sets in, reflects thus: 'Many indeed are the chances of
      death for me. A snake or scorpion or a centipede might bite me and might cause my death;
      that would be a hindrance to me. I might stumble and fall; the food I have eaten might
      make me ill; bile might convulse me; phlegm choke me; winds (within me) with their
      scissorlike cuts give me ache; or men or non-humans might attack me and might cause my
      death. That would be a hindrance to me.'; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Monks, that monk must reflect thus: 'Are there any evil
      and wrong states within me that have not been put away and that would be a hindrance to me
      were I to die tonight? If, monks, on consideration he realize that there are such
      states... then to put away just those evil and wrong states, an intense resolution,
      effort, endeavour, exertion, struggle, mindfulness and self-possession must be made by
      that monk. Monks, just as a man whose turban is on fire, or whose hair is burning would
      make an intense resolution, effort, endeavour, exertion, struggle, mindfulness and
      self-possession to put out his (burning) turban or hair; even so, monks, an intense
      resolution, effort, endeavour, exertion, struggle, mindfulness and self-possession must be
      made by that monk to put away just those evil and wrong states. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">But if that monk, on review, realize that there are no
      such states within him that have not been put away which would be a hindrance to him, were
      he to die that night--then let that monk live verily in joy and gladness, training himself
      day and night in the ways of righteousness. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Take the case, monks, of a monk who reflects
      likewise...  when the night is spent and day breaks. He must reflect in the same way... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Monks, mindfulness of death when so made become so
      developed is very fruitful, of great advantage, merging and ending in the deathless.' </font></p>
