    LIFE </font></h2>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-ooOoo- </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">T</font><font face="Times New Roman">here are
    many different types of citta and they can be classified by way of four jatis:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">kusala cittas (wholesome cittas) <br>
      akusala cittas (unwholesome cittas) <br>
      vipakacittas (cittas which are result) <br>
      kiriyacittas (cittas which are neither cause nor result) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, they can also be classified by way of sobhana,
    asobhana. </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. 
 sobhana cittas, cittas accompanied by sobhana
      (beautiful) cetasikas. 
<br>
      2. 
 asobhana cittas, cittas unaccompanied by sobhana cetasikas. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Both akusala cittas and ahetuka cittas are asobhana
    cittas, they are not accompanied by sobhana cetasikas. As we have seen, there are twelve
    types of akusala citta. They are: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">8 types of lobha-mula-citta (cittas rooted in attachment) <br>
      2 types of dosa-mula-citta (cittas rooted in aversion) <br>
      2 types of moha-mula-citta (cittas rooted in ignorance) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As regards ahetuka cittas, they are cittas which are not
    accompanied by any hetus (roots). When the citta is ahetuka there are no sobhana cetasikas
    arising with the citta and thus ahetuka cittas are asobhana. As we have seen, there are
    eighteen types of ahetuka citta. Summarizing them, they are : 
 </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">10 dvi-panca-vinnanas, which are ahetuka vipakacittas (the
      five pairs which are seeing, hearing, etc. ) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">2 
 sampaticchana-cittas, which are ahetuka
      vipakacittas (one kusala vipaka and one akusala vipaka). 
 
 
 
</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">3 
 santirana-cittas, which are ahetuka vipakacittas
      (one akusala vipaka, one kusala vipaka, 
accompanied by upekkha, and one kusala
      vipaka, accompanied by somanassa). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1 
 panca-dvaravajjana-citta (five-sense-door-
       
adverting-consciousness) which is ahetuka kiriyacitta. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1 
 mano-dvaravajjana-citta
      (mind-door-adverting-consciousness) which is ahetuka kiriyacitta. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1 
 hasituppada-citta, an ahetuka kiriyacitta which
      can produce the smile of the arahat. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, there are thirty asobhana cittas: twelve akusala
    cittas and eighteen ahetuka cittas. 
 </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are also sobhana cittas arising in our life, cittas
    which are accompanied by sobhana cetasikas. Three among the sobhana cetasikas are hetu,
    root. They are : alobha, adosa and amoha or panna. Sobhana cittas are always accompanied
    by alobha and adosa and they may or may not be accompanied by panna. Thus, sobhana cittas
    are sahetuka, accompanied by hetus. When we perform dana (generosity), observe sila
    (morality) or apply ourselves to bhavana (which comprises samatha, vipassana and the study
    or teaching of Dhamma), there are kusala cittas, accompanied by sobhana cetasikas. Thus
    kusala cittas are among the sobhana cittas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The kusala cittas which perform dana, observe sila or
    apply themselves to bhavana are cittas belonging to the lowest plane of consciousness, the
    sensuous plane ; they are kamavacara cittas. Kamavacara cittas are the cittas we have in
    daily life, when, for example, we are seeing, thinking or wishing for something. Sometimes
    kamavacara cittas arise with sobhana hetus (beautiful roots), sometimes with akusala
    hetus, and sometimes without any hetus. Dana, sila or bhavana is performed by kamavacara
    kusala cittas: these kinds of kusala kamma can be performed in daily life, where there are
    impressions through the six doors. Kamavacara kusala cittas are called 'maha-kusala
    cittas' ('maha' means 'many' or 'great'). 
 </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For those who attain jhana (absorption, developed in
    samatha or tranquil meditation) there is at that moment no seeing, hearing or any other
    sense-impression ; then the citta is not kamavacara citta, but it is of a higher plane of
    consciousness. The jhanacittas can be rupavacara cittas (rupa-jhanacittas) or arupavacara
    cittas (arupa-jhanacittas). However, while one is developing samatha the cittas are
    maha-kusala cittas before one attains jhana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the citta directly experiences nibbana, the citta is
    lokuttara bhumi (lokuttara plane of consciousness). However, lokuttara kusala cittas
    (magga-cittas) are preceded by maha-kusala cittas in the process of cittas during which
    enlightenment is attained. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We would like to have kusala cittas more often. We may
    think that the circumstances of our life or other people prevent us from kusala. However,
    if we know the conditions for the cultivation of kusala, there will be more kusala cittas
    in our life. Through the study of the Dhamma we will learn how to cultivate kusala. If we
    have not studied Dhamma we may think that we are performing kusala, while we have, on the
    contrary, akusala cittas. For example, we may think that when giving something away, there
    are only kusala cittas. However, lobha-mula-cittas may also arise. We may give something
    to friends and expect them to be kind to us in return. This is not kusala, but lobha. When
    we study Dhamma we learn that the pure way of giving is giving without expecting anything
    in return. We should find out why we are giving. Do we, deep in our hearts, wish for
    something in return? Or do we want to have less defilements? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">People have different accumulations and because of these
    accumulations kusala cittas or akusala cittas arise. For example, when people visit a
    temple and see others presenting gifts to the monks, they may, because of their different
    accumulations, react in different ways. Some people may appreciate someone else's good
    deeds; others may not be interested at all. If one would only know the value of kusala and
    realize that appreciating the good deeds of others is a way of dana (generosity), one
    would use more opportunities to cultivate wholesomeness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If the Buddha had not attained enlightenment and taught
    Dhamma we would not have any means of knowing ourselves thoroughly ; we would not have a
    precise knowledge of our kusala cittas and akusala cittas and of the conditions through
    which they arise. The Buddha taught people how to cultivate wholesomeness and to eradicate
    defilements and thus, living according to the precepts and performing other kinds of
    wholesomeness is the way to pay respect to him. We read in the 'Maha-Parinibbana-sutta'
    (Dialogues of the Buddha II, No. 16, Ch.V, 137, 138) that before the Buddha passed away,
    the twin Sala trees, which were full of flowers although it was not the season, dropped
    their flowers all over his body, heavenly Mandarava-flowers and sandalwood-powder
    descended on his body and heavenly music sounded out of reverence for him. The Buddha said
    to Ananda: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Now it is not thus, Ananda, that the Tathagata is rightly
      honoured, reverenced, venerated, held sacred or revered. But the monk or the sister, the
      devout man or the devout woman, who continually fulfills all the greater and the lesser
      duties, who is correct in 
 life, walking according to the precepts- - it is he who
      rightly honours, reverences, venerates, holds sacred, and reveres the Tathagata with the
      worthiest homage. Therefore, Ananda, be constant in the fulfillment of the greater and of
      the lesser duties, and be correct in life, walking according to the precepts ; and thus,
      Ananda, should it be taught.'</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We all have in our daily life opportunities for dana and
    sila. As regards bhavana, this comprises samatha, vipassana, studying Dhamma or explaining
    it to others. Not only the monks, but also laypeople can study and teach Dhamma. We read
    in the 'MahaParinibbana-sutta' (Ch. III, l12, l13) that the Buddha told Ananda that Mara,
    the Evil One, had said to the Buddha after his enlightenment that it was now the time for
    him to pass away. The Buddha said: 
 </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And when he had thus spoken, Ananda, I addressed Mara, the
      Evil One, and said:- -'I shall not pass away, O Evil One! 
 
 until not only the
      monks and sisters of the Order, but also the laydisciples of either sex shall have become
      true hearers, wise and well trained, ready and learned, carrying the teachings in their
      memory, masters of the lesser corolaries that follow from the larger doctrine, 

      correct in life, walking according to the precepts-- until they, having thus themselves
      learned the doctrine, shall be able to tell others of it, preach it, make it known,
      establish it, open it, minutely explain it and make it clear-- until they, when others
      start vain doctrine easy to be refuted by the truth, shall be able in refuting it to
      spread the wonderworking truth abroad! I shall not die until this pure religion of mine
      shall have become successful, prosperous, widespread, and popular in all its full extent--
      until, in a word, it shall have been well proclaimed among men!'</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fact that we are able to perform wholesome deeds in
    our lives is due to conditions, it is not due to a self. We read in the 'Tenfold Series'
    (Dialogues of the Buddha III, No. 34, Ch. IV, 276) about factors which are helpful : </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Four... that help much: -- four 'wheels', to wit, the
      orbit of a favourable place of residence, the orbit of association with the good, perfect
      adjustment of one's self, the cycle of merit wrought in the past.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As regards a favourable place of residence, living in a
    Buddhist country can be a helpful condition for kusala cittas. Then one has the
    opportunity to visit temples and to listen to the preaching of Dhamma. The Dhamma can
    change our life and it is the condition for the performing of wholesome deeds, for dana,
    sila and bhavana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As regards 'association with the good', this means
    association with the right friend in Dhamma. If one, even though living in a Buddhist
    country, does not meet the right friend in Dhamma who can help in the search for the
    truth, one lacks the condition which is most helpful for the cultivation of wisdom and the
    eradication of defilements. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Perfect adjustment of one's self' is 'adjusting oneself'
    with kusala as the goal. There are many degrees of kusala. If one develops the wisdom of
    the Eightfold Path by being mindful of nama and rupa, there will be less clinging to the
    concept of self. If there is mindfulness of nama and rupa while performing wholesome
    deeds, one will come to realize that no self, no person performs these deeds. Thus kusala
    kamma will become purer and eventually defilements will be eradicated. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The accumulation of kusala in the past is the fourth
    factor which is helpful. If we haven't accumulated kusala in the past how can we do good
    deeds in the present? The kusala kammas which were accumulated in the past are the
    condition for us to go to the right place and meet the right people. It is kamma which
    causes one to be born in a Buddhist Country or to live in a Buddhist country. The kusala
    accumulated in the past conditions our study and practice of the Dhamma at the present
    time. If we consider the factors in our life which are the conditions for kusala we will
    better understand that it is not self which performs good deeds. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Abhidhamma we learn that there are eight types of
    maha-kusala cittas, kusala cittas of the sensuous plane of consciousness. Why isn't there
    only one type? The reason is that each type has its own conditions through which it
    arises. If we know about these different types and if we can be aware of them when their
    characteristics present themselves, it will help us not to take them for self. Four types
    of maha-kusala cittas arise with somanassa (pleasant feeling) and four types arise with
    upekkha (indifferent feeling). We would like to have kusala cittas with somanassa, because
    we cling to somanassa. However, one cannot force somanassa to arise. Sometimes we perform
    dana with somanassa, sometimes with upekkha. It depends on conditions whether somanassa or
    whether upekkha arises with the maha-kusala citta. Four types are accompanied by wisdom :
    four types are not accompanied by wisdom. We may, for example, help others without panna
    or with panna. When we realize that helping is kusala, or when we are aware of the nama or
    rupa appearing at that moment, there is panna arising with the maha-kusala citta. Four
    types are asankharika (unprompted, spontaneous, not induced by someone else or by one's
    own consideration) and four types are sasankharika (prompted, by someone else or by
    self-inducement) The eight types of maha-kusala cittas are the following: . </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, with wisdom,
      unprompted (Somanassa-sahagatam, 
 nana-sampayuttum, asankharikam
      ekam) 
 
 
 
</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, with wisdom, prompted
      (Somanassa-sahagatam, nana-sampayuttam, sasankharikam ekam)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, without wisdom,
      unprompted (Somanassa-sahagatam, nana-vippayuttam, asankharikam ekam)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. Accompanied by pleasant feeling, without wisdom,
      prompted (Somanassa-sahagatam, nana-vippayuttam, sasankharikam
      ekam) 
 
 
 
 
</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">5. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, with wisdom,
      unprompted (Upekkha-sahagatam,

      ekam) 
 
 
 
</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">6.

 with
      wisdom, prompted (Upekkha-sahagatam, nana-sampayuttam, sasankharikam

</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">7.

      <p><font face="Times New Roman">8. Accompanied by indifferent feeling, without 

      wisdom, prompted (Upekkha-sahagatam, nana-vippayuttam, sasankhaikam
      ekam) 
 
 
 
 
</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Maha-kusala cittas are not the only kind of kamavacara
    sobhana cittas (beautiful cittas which are of the sensuous plane of consciousness).
    Maha-kusala cittas are cittas which are cause; they can motivate kusala kamma through
    body, speech or mind which is capable of bringing results. There are also
    maha-vipakacittas, which are results of kusala kamma performed with maha-kusala cittas.
    Maha-vipakacittas are sobhana (beautiful) cittas as well, arising with sobhana cetasikas.
    People's deeds are not the same and thus the results cannot be the same. People are born
    with different patisandhi-cittas (rebirth-consciousness). Patisandhi-cittas are
    vipakacittas ; they are the result of kamma. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As we have seen before (Ch, 11), human beings can be born
    with a patisandhi-citta which is ahetuka kusala vipaka (and in this case they are
    handicapped from the first moment of life), or with a patisandhi-citta which is sahetuka
    kusala vipaka, accompanied by sobhana hetus. In the case of human beings, and of beings
    born in other sensuous planes of existence, the patisandhi-citta which is sahetuka
    vipakacitta is maha-vipakacitta, the result of kamavacara kusala kamma (kamma performed by
    kusala cittas of the sensuous plane of consciousness). Apart from maha-vipakacitta there
    are other types of sahetuka vipakacitta which are not the result of kamavacara kusala
    kamma but of jhanacitta. These types will be dealt with later on. 
 </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As regards maha-vipakacittas, there are eight types. They
    can be accompanied by somanassa or by upekkha, they can be with panna or without panna,
    they can be asankharika (unprompted) or sasankharika (prompted). They are classified in
    the same way as the eight types of maha-kusala cittas mentioned above. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The bhavanga-citta (life-continuum) and the cuti-citta
    (dying-consciousness) are the same type of citta as the first citta in one's life, the
    patisandhi-citta. If the patisandhi-citta is maha-vipakacitta, the bhavanga-citta and the
    cuti-citta of that life are the same type of maha-vipakacitta. Thus the functions of
    patisandhi, bhavanga and cuti can be performed by maha-vipakacitta. Moreover, the function
    of tadarammana (registering) can also be performed by maha-vipakacitta. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we see a beautiful sight or experience pleasant
    objects through the other sense-doors, the citta is vipakacitta, the result of kusala
    kamma ; however, that kind of vipakacitta is ahetuka vipaka (arising without hetu), not
    maha-vipaka. The functions of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and receiving impressions
    through the body-sense, of sampaticchana and of santirana cannot be performed by
    maha-vipakacittas ; these functions are performed by ahetuka vipakacittas.
    Tadarammana-citta (registering-consciousness), however, which is a vipakacitta arising
    after the javana-cittas, can either be ahetuka vipakacitta or maha-vipakacitta. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are still other kinds of kamavacara sobhana cittas :
    the maha-kiriyacittas. The arahat has maha-kiriyacittas instead of maha-kusala cittas.
    When we experience a pleasant object lobha may arise and when we experience an unpleasant
    object dosa may arise. The arahat has equanimity towards pleasant objects or unpleasant
    objects ; he has no defilements. Since he cannot accumulate any more akusala kamma or
    kusala kamma, he has maha-kiriyacittas (inoperative cittas). For the arahat, there are,
    instead of maha-kusala cittas, maha-kiriyacittas performing the function of javana after
    the votthapana-citta (determining-consciousness) and the mano-dvaravajjana-citta
    (mind-door-adverting-consciousness). One may wonder whether the arahat can have
    maha-kiriyacittas which are nana-vippayutta (not accompanied by wisdom). Arahats can have
    maha-kiriyacittas which are nana-vippayutta, 
 because panna does not necessarily
    accompany the maha-kiriyacittas when they are not preaching or discussing Dhamma. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The arahat has kiriyacittas which are sobhana cittas and
    also kiriyacittas which are asobhana cittas. The panca-dvaravajjana-citta
    (five-sense-door-adverting-consciousness), the mano-dvaravajjana-citta and the
    hasituppada-citta (smile-producing-consciousness of the arahat) are asobhana kiriyacittas.
    These types of citta are not accompanied by sobhana cetasikas, they are ahetuka. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are eight types of maha-kiriyacittas in all. They
    are accompanied by somanassa or by upekkha, they are accompanied by panna or not
    accompanied by panna, they are asankharika or sasankharika. They are classified in the
    same way as the eight types of maha-kusala cittas. 
 </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Altogether there are fifty-four cittas which are
    kama-bhumi (Bhumi is plane, in this case, plane of citta, not plane of existence.), or
    kamavacara cittas, cittas of the sensuous plane of consciousness. They are: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">12 akusala cittas <br>
      18 ahetuka cittas 
 
 
 
 
  
}30 sobhana cittas </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">8 maha-kusala cittas <br>
      8 maha-vipakacittas 
 
 
}24 sobhana cittas <br>
      8 maha-kiriyacittas 
 </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are also sobhana cittas which are not kama-sobhana
    cittas, namely : </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">the sobhana cittas which are rupa-bhumi (rupavacara
      cittas, for those who attain rupa-jhana) <br>
      the sobhana cittas which are arupa-bhumi (arupavacara cittas, for those who attain
      arupa-jhana) <br>
      the sobhana cittas which are lokuttara-bhumi, for those who attain enlightenment</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Only kamavacara cittas (cittas of the kama-bhumi or
    sensuous plane of consciousness) can be asobhana cittas. Cittas which are rupa-bhumi,
    arupa-bhumi and lokuttara-bhumi can only be sobhana cittas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who do not attain jhana or attain enlightenment
    cannot have the cittas of the other bhumis, but they can verify the truth of the Buddha's
    teachings as regards the kama-bhumi. We can find out for ourselves whether it is helpful
    to perform dana, observe sila and cultivate bhavana. We can find out whether the
    cultivation of these ways of kusala helps us to have less akusala cittas. Sometimes it is
    the right moment for dana, sometimes for sila or for bhavana. Vipassana, however, one can
    cultivate while performing dana, observing sila, cultivating samatha, or while one is
    studying or teaching Dhamma, and also at those moments when there is no opportunity for
    dana, sila or the other ways of kusala. Even if mindfulness of nama and rupa has not yet
    been accumulated much, one can find out whether it is a condition for having less akusala
    cittas and less attachment to the concept of self. In being mindful we can verify the
    truth of the Buddha's teachings. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We read in the 'Gradual Sayings' (Book of the Sevens, Ch.
    VIII, par. 9, The message): </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Now the venerable Upali came to the Exalted One, saluted
      and sat down at one side. So seated, he said: 'Well were it for me, lord, if the Exalted
      One were to expound Dhamma briefly to me, so that, having heard it, I might abide
      resolute, alone, secluded, earnest and zealous.' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'The doctrines, Upali, of which you may know; 'These
      doctrines lead one not to complete weariness (of the world), nor to dispassion, nor to
      ending, nor to calm, nor to knowledge, nor to the awakening, nor to the cool' -- regard
      them definitely as not Dhamma, not the discipline, not the word of the Teacher. But the
      doctrines of which you may know : 'These doctrines lead one to complete weariness,
      dispassion, ending, calm, knowledge, the awakening, the cool'-- regard them unreservedly
      as Dhamma, the discipline, the word of the Teacher.'</font></p>
