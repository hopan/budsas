    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">T</font><font face="Times New Roman">he Buddha
    pointed out the dangers of being infatuated by the objects we experience through the six
    doors. He taught people to develop the wisdom which knows the realities experienced
    through the six doors as nama and rupa, phenomena which are impermanent and not self. What
    is impermanent 
 is 'dukkha', it cannot be happiness. When we come to know things as
    they are, we will be less infatuated by objects. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We read in the 'Kindred Sayings' (IV, Salayatana-vagga,
    Kindred Sayings on Sense, Second Fifty, Ch. III, par. 81, A brother) about the purpose of
    the Buddha's teachings. The text states: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then a number of monks came to see the Exalted One....
      Seated at one side those monks said to the Exalted One:- - </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Now here, lord, the wandering sectarians thus question
      us: 'What is the object, friend, for which the holy life is lived under the rule of Gotama
      the recluse?' Thus questioned, lord, 'we thus make answer to those wandering sectarians :
      'It is for the full knowledge of dukkha that the holy life is lived under the rule of the
      Exalted One. Pray, lord, when, thus questioned, we so make answer, do we state the views
      of the Exalted One, without misrepresenting the Exalted One by stating an untruth? Do we
      answer in accordance with his teaching, so that no one who agrees with his teaching and
      follows his views could incur reproach?' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Truly, monks, when thus questioned, You thus make answer,
      you do state my views.. in stating that it is for the full knowledge of dukkha that the
      holy life is lived under my rule. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">But if, monks, the wandering sectarians should thus
      question you : 'But what, friend, is that dukkha, for the full knowledge of which the holy
      life is lived under the rule of Gotama the recluse?'- - thus questioned you should answer
      thus: 'The eye, friend, is dukkha. For the full knowledge of that the holy life is
      lived... Objects...that pleasant or unpleasant or indifferent feeling that arises through
      mind-contact,- - that also is dukkha. Fully to know that, the holy life is lived under the
      rule of the Exalted One.' Thus questioned, monks, by those wandering sectarians, thus
      should You make answer.'</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In being aware of nama and rupa which appear, such as
    seeing, visible object, feeling or thinking, we can prove the truth of the Buddha's
    teachings by ourselves ; we can prove that the objects experienced through the six doors
    are impermanent and not self. The truth will not be known if one follows other people
    blindly or if one speculates about the truth. We read in the 'Kindred Sayings' (IV,
    Salayatana-vagga, Third Fifty, Ch. V, par. 152, Is there a method?) that the Buddha said: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'ls there, monks, any method, by following which a monk,
      apart from belief, apart from inclination, apart from hearsay, apart from argument as to
      method, apart from reflection on reasons, apart from delight in speculation, could affirm
      insight thus : 'Ended is birth, lived is the righteous life, done is the task, for life in
      these conditions there is no hereafter?' 'For us, lord, things have their root in the
      Exalted One... Well indeed were it if the meaning of this that has been spoken were to
      manifest itself in the Exalted One. Hearing it from him the monks will remember it.' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'There is indeed a method, monks, by following which a
      monk....could affirm insight...And what is that method? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Herein, monks, a monk, seeing an object with the eye,
      either recognizes within him the existence of lust, malice and ignorance, thus : 'I have
      lust, malice and ignorance', or recognizes the non-existence of these qualities within
      him, thus: 'I have not lust, malice and ignorance.' Now as to that recognition of their
      existence or non-existence within him, are these conditions, I ask, to be understood by
      belief, or by inclination, or hearsay, or argument as to method, or reflection on reasons,
      or delight in speculation?' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Surely not, lord.' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Are not these states to be understood by seeing them with
      the eye of wisdom?' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Surely, lord.' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Then, monks, this is the method by following which, apart
      from belief... a monk could affirm insight thus: 'Ended is birth...for life in these
      conditions there is no hereafter.&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The same is said with regard to the ear-door, the door of
      the nose, the door of the tongue, the body-door and the mind-door.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we study the Abhidhamma we should keep in mind the
    purpose of the Buddha's teachings : the eradication of defilements through the wisdom
    which realizes phenomena appearing through the six doors as they are. Through this method
    there will be an end to the cycle of birth and death. We should remember that the
    Abhidhamma is not a theoretical textbook but an exposition of realities appearing in daily
    life. We learn about nama and rupa ; we learn about cittas which each have their own
    function in the sense-door process and in the mind-door process. There are sense-door
    processes and mind-door processes time and again, and objects are experienced during these
    processes of citta. If there is awareness of characteristics of nama and rupa when they
    appear, the panna is developed which can eradicate defilements. This kind of wisdom is
    deeper than any kind of theoretical knowledge. 
 </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nama and rupa which arise and fall away are conditioned
    realities, they arise because of different conditions. Through the study of the Abhidhamma
    we learn about different conditions for nama and rupa. Each reality which arises is
    dependent on several conditions. For instance, seeing is vipaka, produced by kamma.
    Visible object conditions seeing by being its object (arammana). lf there is no visible
    object there cannot be seeing. Eye-sense, the kind of rupa in the eye (pasada-rupa) which
    is able to receive visible object, is another condition for seeing. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The rupa which is eye-sense can be the door (in Pali :
    dvara) for seeing. A door or 'dvara' is the means through which citta experiences an
    object. There is eye-sense arising and falling away all the time; throughout our life it
    is produced by kamma. However, eye-sense is not a door all the time, because there is not
    all the time the experience of visible object. Eye-sense is a door only when citta
    experiences visible object. It is the same with the pasada-rupas which are the other
    sense-organs. They are doors only when they are the means through which citta experiences
    an object. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The eye-door is the means through which citta experiences
    visible object. Not only the cittas which are cakkhu-dvaravajjana-citta
    (eye-door-adverting-consciousness) and cakkhu-vinnana (seeing-consciousness) experience
    the object through the eye-door, the other, cittas of that process, which are
    sampaticchana-citta (receiving-consciousness), santirana-citta
    (investigating-consciousness), votthapana-citta (determining- consciousness), the
    javana-cittas and the tadarammana-cittas are also dependent on the same door, in order to
    experience the object. After the rupa which is experienced by these cittas has fallen
    away, the object can be experienced through the mind-door (mano-dvara). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Cittas arising in a process which experience an object
    through one of the six doors are vithi-cittas (vithi means: way, course, process).
    Vithi-cittas are named after the door through which they experience an object. For
    example, the cittas which experience an object through the eye-door are called
    cakkhu-dvara-vithi-cittas (cakkhu-dvara means eye-door) ; the cittas which experience an
    object through the ear-door ; (sota-dvara) are called sota-dvara-vithi-cittas; the cittas
    which experience an object through the mind-door (mano-dvara) are called
    mano-dvara-vithi-cittas. 
 </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In between the different processes of citta there have to
    be bhavanga-cittas (life-continuum). Bhavanga-cittas are not vithi-cittas. 
 They are
    not part of the process of cittas experiencing objects which time and again throughout our
    life experiencing on the six doors. They experience an object without being dependent on
    any doorway. As we have seen (Ch. 15), the patisandhi-citta, the bhavanga-cittas and the
    cuti-citta of one life experience the same object as the last javana-cittas which arose
    before the cuti-citta of the previous life. The patisandhi-citta, the bhavanga-citta and
    the cuti-citta are vithi-vimutti-cittas (vithi-vimutti means: process-freed), thus, they
    are different from the cittas arising in sense-door processes and mind-door processes. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is useful to classify citta by way of dvara (doorway).
    If one only classifies citta by way of function (kicca), but not by dvara, one may not
    know which citta is referred to. For example, the panca-dvaravajjana-citta
    (five-sense-door-adverting-consciousness) has the function of avajjana (adverting). If one
    does not know that this citta performs the function of adverting through the five
    sense-doors, one may confuse it with the mano-dvaravajjana-citta
    (mind-door-adverting-consciousness) which also perform the function of avajjana. The
    mano-dvaravajjana-citta, however, performs the function of avajjana only through the
    mind-door. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some cittas perform their function only through one door.
    For example, the two types of citta which are sota-vinnana (hearing-consciousness, which
    can be kusala vipaka or akusala vipaka), only perform their functions through one door,
    the ear-door. Some cittas perform their function through more than one door.
    Sampaticchana-citta (receiving..consciousness) performs its function through five doors,
    depending on the doorway which is contacted by the object. Santirana-citta has different
    functions performed through different doorways ; it also performs functions without being
    dependent on any doorway and this is the case when it performs the function of patisandhi,
    bhavanga and cuti. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Citta should also be classified according to feeling. For
    example, santirana-citta can be accompanied by upekkha (indifferent feeling) and by
    somanassa (pleasant feeling). Santirana-citta which is accompanied by somanassa can
    perform the function of santirana (investigating) through five doors and the function of
    tadarammana (registering, occurring after the javana-cittas) through six doors. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When santirana-citta is accompanied by upekkha (and in
    that case it can be kusala vipaka or akusala vipaka), it can perform five functions: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. 
 The function of santirana through five doors. <br>
      2. 
 The function of tadarammana through six doors.<br>
      3. 
 The function of patisandhi, without being dependent on any
      door. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 <br>
      4. 
 The function of bhavanga, without being dependent on any
      door. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 <br>
      5. 
 The function of cuti, without being dependent on any
      door. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the processes of citta the doorway (dvara) is the means
    through which citta experiences its object. The physical base (vatthu) is another factor
    which conditions citta by being its place of origin. In the planes of existence where
    there are nama and rupa, cittas do not arise independently of the body ; a citta which
    arises has a rupa as its place of origin. When there is seeing, could seeing arise outside
    the body? When there is hearing or thinking, could these cittas arise without the body?
    This would not be possible. Where does seeing arise? It could not arise on our arm or in
    our ear. It needs the eye as its physical base. The cakkhup- pasada-rupa, the rupa in the
    eye which can receive visible object, is the physical base for the citta which sees. The
    physical base or vatthu is not the same as dvara or doorway. Although the
    cakkhuppasada-rupa is both dvara and vatthu for seeing-consciousness, dvara and vatthu
    have different functions. The eye-door (cakkhu-dvara) is the means through which cittas of
    the eye-door process experience an object. The cakkhu-vatthu (eye-base) is the physical
    base, the place of origin for seeing- consciousness. The cakkhu-vatthu is the base only
    for seeing-consciousness, not for the other cittas of that process. The other cittas of
    that process have another vatthu The vatthu for hearing-consciousness is the
    sotappasada-rupa for smelling-consciousness the ghanappasada-rupa, for tasting-
    consciousness the jivhappasada-rupa, for body-consciousness the kayappasada-rupa. 
 </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a sixth vatthu which is not one of the
    pasada-rupas. This is the hadaya-vatthu or heart-base. The hadaya-vatthu is a kind of rupa
    which is the place of origin for the cittas which are not among the panca-vinnanas
    (seeing, hearing, etc.) since these cittas have the pasada-rupa as their place of origin.
    The hadaya-vatthu is different from the mind-door. The mind-door is a citta, the
    bhavangupaccheda-citta, which is the last bhavanga-citta arising before the mano-
    dvaravajjana-citta (mind-door-adverting-consciousness). The hadaya-vatthu is rupa, not
    nama. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When sound contacts the ear-sense, the
    panca-dvara-vajjana-citta (five-sense-door adverting- consciousness) which arises, has as
    its place of origin the hadaya-vatthu, but the hearing-consciousness has the
    sotappasada-rupa as its vatthu. All succeeding cittas of that process, however, have the
    hadaya-vatthu as their place of origin. All cittas of the mind-door process too have the
    hadaya-vatthu as their place of origin. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Vithi-vimutti-cittas which experience an object without
    dependence on any door, also have a physical place of origin. Although they are not
    dependent on any doorway, they could not, in the planes where there are both nama and
    rupa, arise without a vatthu. A new life begins when the patisandhi-citta arises; however,
    there is not only nama, there has to be rupa as well. The hadaya-vatthu is the rupa which
    is the vatthu of the patisandhi-citta. All bhavanga-cittas and the cuti-citta have the
    hadaya-vatthu as their physical base. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The five kinds of pasada-rupa are the vatthus of the
    panca-vinnanas. As regards the vatthu of the two types of kaya-vinnana
    (body-consciousness, which can be kusala vipaka or akusala vipaka), this can arise all
    over the body. Any part of the body which has sensitivity, can be vatthu for the
    kaya-vinnana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The vatthu is the place of origin not only of citta, but
    also of cetasikas arising together with the citta. Thus, except in the planes of existence
    where there is only nama there has to be rupakkhandha as well when the four namakkhandhas
    arise. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is useful to classify citta by way of kicca (function),
    arammana (object), dvara (doorway), vatthu, and in many other ways. In this way we will
    have a clearer understanding of citta. We should, however, remember that this kind of
    understanding is not yet the wisdom which eradicates lobha, dosa and moha. In the 'Kindred
    Sayings' (V, Khnadha-vagga, Kindred Sayings about Radha, Ch.I, par. 4, To be understood)
    we read:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">At Savatthi .</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">As he thus sat at one side the Exalted One thus addressed
      the venerable Radha:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">-- 'I will show you the things to be understood, and the
      understanding, and the person who has understood. Do you listen to it.' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Exalted One thus spoke: 'And what, Radha, are the
      things to be understood? Body, Radha, is a thing to be understood: so is feeling,
      perception, the activities. Consciousness is a thing to be understood. These, Radha, are
      the things to be understood. And what, Radha, is understanding? The destruction of lust,
      the destruction of hatred, the destruction of ignorance,--this, Radha, is called
      'understanding'. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And who, Radha, is the person who has understood? 'Worthy'
      should he be called, that venerable one of such and such a name, of such and such a clan -
      - that, Radha, is the meaning of 'the person who has understood'.'</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes the Buddha reminded people of the purpose of the
    teachings in a longer discourse, sometimes in a shorter discourse, but one has to be often
    reminded of the goal. What is the purpose of understanding, if it does not lead to the
    eradication of defilements? </font></p>
