    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-ooOoo-</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">W</font><font face="Times New Roman">e may know
    when we have akusala cittas rooted in lobha (attachment) or akusala cittas rooted in dosa
    (aversion), but do we know when we have akusala cittas rooted in moha (ignorance)? What is
    the characteristic of moha? We may think someone ignorant who does not have much
    education, who does not speak foreign languages, who does not know anything about history
    or politics. We call someone ignorant who does not know what is happening in the world. Is
    that the kind of ignorance which should be eradicated? If that were true it would mean
    that there is more wholesomeness in one's life if one speaks foreign languages or if one
    knows about history and politics. We can find out that this is not true. 
 </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In order to understand the characteristic of moha we
    should know what we are ignorant of when there is moha. There is the world of concepts
    which in our daily, ordinary language are denoted by conventional terms and there is the
    world of paramattha dhammas or ultimate realities. When we think of the concept which in
    conventional language is denoted by 'world', we may think of people, animals and things
    and we call them by their appropriate names. But do we know the phenomena in ourselves and
    around themselves as they really are: only nama and rupa which do not stay? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The world of paramattha dhammas is real. Nama and rupa are
    paramattha dhammas. The namas and rupas which appear in our daily life can be directly
    experienced through the five sense-doors and through the mind-door, no matter how we name
    them. This is the world which is real. When we see, there is the world of visible object.
    When we 
 hear, there is the world of sound. When we experience an object through
    touch there is the world of tangible object. Visible object and seeing are real. Their
    characteristics can be directly experienced; it does not matter whether we call them
    'visible object' and 'seeing', or whether we do not name them at all. But when we cling to
    concepts which are denoted by conventional terms such as 'tree' or 'chair', we do not
    experience any 
 characteristic of reality. What is real when we look at a tree? What
    can be directly experienced? Visible object is a paramattha dhamma, a reality; it is a
    kind of rupa which can be directly experienced through the eyes. Through touch hardness
    can be experienced; this is a kind of rupa which can be directly experienced through the
    body-sense, it is real. 'Tree' is a concept or idea of which we can think, but it is not a
    paramattha dhamma, not a reality which can be directly experienced. Visible object and
    hardness are paramattha dhammas and they can be directly experienced, no matter how one
    names them. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The world experienced through the six doors is real out it
    does not last; it is impermanent. When we see, there is the world of the visible, but it
    falls away immediately. When we hear, there is the world of sound, but it does not last
    either. It is the same with the world of smell, the world of flavour, the world of
    impressions through the body-sense and the world of objects experienced through the
    mind-door. However, we only seem to know the world of conventional terms, because
    ignorance and wrong view have been accumulated for so long. Ignorance of paramattha
    dhammas is the kind of ignorance which should be eradicated; it brings sorrow. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The world in the sense of paramattha dhammas is in the
    teachings called 'the world in the ariyan sense'. The ariyan has developed the wisdom
    which sees things as they are ; he truly knows 'the world'. We read in the 'Kindred
    Sayings' (IV, Salayatana-vagga, Kindred Sayings on Sense, Second Fifty, Ch. IV, par. 84,
    Transitory) that Ananda said to the Buddha:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">' &quot;The world! The world&quot; is the saying, lord.
      Pray,  
how far, lord, does this saying go?' 
</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">' What is transitory by nature, Ananda, is called
      &quot;the world&quot; in the ariyan sense. And what, Ananda, is transitory by nature? The
      eye, Ananda, is transitory by nature... objects... tongue... mind is transitory by
       
 nature, mind-states, mind-consciousness, mind-contact, whatsoever 

      pleasant 
 feeling, 
 unpleasant 
 feeling 
 or indifferent 

      feeling 
 which arises owing to mind-contact, that also is transitory by nature. What
      is thus transitory, Ananda, is called 
 &quot;the world&quot; in the ariyan sense.' </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Someone may think that he can truly know himself without
    knowing the world as it appears through the six doors. He may think that he knows his
    anger and attachment, but, in fact, he has not experienced them as they are: only
    different types of nama and not self. As long as he takes realities for self he does not
    really know himself and he cannot eradicate defilements. He clings to an idea, to the
    concept of self; he has not directly experienced any characteristic of reality. It is
    difficult to know when there are lobha, dosa and moha and it is difficult to be aware also
    of the more subtle degrees of akusala. When one starts to develop 'insight' one realizes
    how little one knows oneself. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When there is moha we live in darkness. It was the
    Buddha';s great compassion which moved him to teach people Dhamma. Dhamma is the light
    which can dispel darkness. If we do not know Dhamma we are ignorant about the world, about
    ourselves; we are ignorant about good and ill deeds and their results; we are ignorant
    about the eradication of defilements. 
 </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The study of the Abhidhamma will help us to know more
    about the characteristic of moha. The 'Atthasalini' (Book II, Part IX, Ch.1, 249) states
    about Moha: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Delusion' (moha) has the characteristic of blindness or
      opposition to knowledge; the essence of non- penetration or the function of covering the
      intrinsic nature of the object; the manifestation of being opposed to right conduct or
      causing blindness; the proximate cause of unwise attention; and it should be regarded as
      the root of all akusala.... </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There 
 are 
 many 
 degrees 
 of 

    moha. 
 When 
 we 
 study Dhamma 
 we 
 become 
 less 

    ignorant 
 about 
 realities; 
 we understand more about paramattha Dhammas,
    about kamma and vipaka. However, this does not mean that we can already eradicate moha.
    Moha cannot be eradicated merely by thinking about 
 the 
 truth; 
 it can
    only be 
 eradicated by developing the wisdom which knows 'the world in the ariyan
    sense' : eye-sense, visible object, 
 seeing-consciousness, ear-sense, sound,
    hearing-consciousness, and all realities appearing through the six doors. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we study the Abhidhamma we learn that moha arises
    with all akusala cittas. Lobha-mula-cittas have moha and lobha as roots; dosa-mula-cittas
    have moha and dosa as roots. There are two types of akusala citta which have moha as their
    only root, these are moha-mula-cittas. One type of moha-mula-citta is moha-mula-citta
    accompanied by doubt (in Pali: vicikiccha), and one type is moha-mula-citta accompanied by
    restlessness (in Pali: uddhacca). The feeling which accompanies moha-mula-cittas is always
    indifferent feeling (upekkha). When the citta is moha-mula-citta there is no like or
    dislike; one does not have pleasant or unpleasant feeling. Both types of moha-mula-citta
    are asankharika (unprompted). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The characteristic of moha should not be confused with the
    characteristic of ditthi (wrong view), which only arises with lobha-mula-citta. When
    ditthi arises one takes, for example, what is impermanent for permanent, or one clings to
    the concept of self. Moha is not wrong view, but it is ignorance of realities. Moha
    conditions ditthi, but the characteristic of moha is different from the characteristic of
    ditthi. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The two types of moha-mula-citta are: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Arising with indifferent feeling, accompanied by doubt
      (Upekkha-sahagatam., vicikiccha- <br>
       
sampayuttam) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. Arising with indifferent feeling, accompanied by
      restlessness (Upekkha-sahagatam, uddhacca- 
 sampayuttam) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When one has the type of moha-mula-citta which is
    accompanied by doubt, one doubts about the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. One doubts
    whether the Buddha really discovered the truth, whether he taught the Path leading to the
    end of defilements, whether there are other people who can become enlightened as well. One
    doubts about past and future lives, about kamma and vipaka. There are many degrees of
    doubt. When we start to develop insight we may have doubt about the reality of the present
    moment; we doubt whether it is nama or rupa. For example, when there is hearing, there is
    sound as well but there can be awareness of only one reality at a time, since only one
    object at a time can be experienced by a citta. We may doubt whether the reality which
    appears at the present moment is the nama which hears or the rupa which is sound. Nama and
    rupa arise and fall away so rapidly and when a precise understanding of their different
    characteristics has not been developed one does not know which reality appears at the
    present moment. There will be doubt about the world of paramattha dhammas until panna
    (wisdom) clearly knows the characteristics of nama and rupa as they appear through the six
    doors. 
 </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The 'Atthasalini' (Book II, Part IX, Ch. III, 259) states
    about doubt: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here doubt means exclusion from the cure (of
       
 knowledge). Or, one investigating the intrinsic nature 
 by means of it suffers
      pain and fatigue (kicchati)- - thus 
 it is doubt. It has shifting about as
      characteristic, mental 
 wavering as function, indecision or uncertainty in grasp
       
 as manifestation, unsystematic thought as proximate 
 cause, and it should be
      regarded as a danger to 
 attainment. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Doubt is different from wrong view (ditthi). When there is
    ditthi one clings, for example, to the concept that phenomena are permanent or one takes
    them for self. When vicikiccha (doubt) arises, one wonders whether the mind is different
    from the body or not, whether phenomena are permanent or impermanent. There is no other
    way to eradicate doubt but by developing the panna (wisdom) which sees realities as they
    are. People who have doubts about the person and the teachings of the Buddha may think
    that doubt can be cured by studying historical events. They want to find out more details
    about the time the Buddha lived and about the places where he moved about; they want to
    know the exact time the texts were written down. They cannot be cured of their doubt by
    studying historical events; this does not lead to the goal of the Buddha's teachings which
    is the eradication of defilements. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">People in the Buddha's time too were speculating about
    things which do not lead to the goal of the teachings. They were wondering whether the
    world is finite or infinite, whether the world is eternal or not eternal, whether the
    Tathagata (the Buddha) exists drier his parinibbana or not. We read in the 'Lesser
    Discourse to Malunkya (Middle Length Sayings II, no. 63) that Malunkyaputta was displeased
    that the Buddha did not give explanations with regard to speculative views. He wanted to
    question the Buddha on these views and if the Buddha should not give him an explanation
    with regard to these views he would leave the order. 
 
 
 He spoke to the
    Buddha about this matter and the Buddha asked him whether he had ever said to
    Malunkyaputta: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Come you, Malurikyaputta, fare the Brahma-faring under me
      and I will explain to you either that the world is eternal or that the world is not
      eternal... or that the Tathagata is...  is not after dying...  both is and is not
      after dying... neither is nor is not after dying? </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We read that Malunkyaputta answered: 'No, revered
    Sir.'; The Buddha also asked him whether he (Maunkyaputta) had said that he would
    'fare the Brahma-faring' under the Lord if the Lord should give him an explanation with
    regard to these views and again Maunkyaputta answered: 'No, revered sir.' The Buddha then
    compared his situation with the case of a man who is pierced by a poisoned arrow and who
    will not draw out the arrow until he knows whether the man who pierced him is a noble, a
    brahman, a merchant or a worker; until he knows the name of the man and his clan; until he
    knows his outward appearance; until he knows about the bow, the bowstring, the material of
    the shaft, the kind of arrow. However, he will pass away before he knows all this. It is
    the same with the person who only wants to 'fare the Braham-faring' under the Lord if
    explanations with regard to speculative views are given to him. We read that the Buddha
    said: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'The living of the Brahma-faring, Malunkyaputta, could not
      be said to depend on the view that the world is eternal. Nor could the living of the
      Brahma-faring, Malunkyaputta, be said to depend on the view that the world is not eternal.
      Whether there is the view that the world is eternal or whether there is the view that the
      world is not eternal, there is birth, there is aging, there is dying, there are grief,
      sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair, the destruction of which I lay down here and
      now.... </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Wherefore, Malunkyaputta, understand as not explained what
      has not been explained by me, and understand as explained what has been explained by me.
      And what, Malunkyaputta, has not been explained by me? That the world is eternal.. that
      the world is not eternal has not been explained by me.. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And why, Malunkyaputta, has this not been explained by me?
      It is because it is not connected with the goal, it is not fundamental to the
      Brahma-faring, and does not conduce to turning away from, nor to dispassion, stopping,
      calming, super-knowledge, awakening, nor to nibbana. Therefore it has not been explained
      by me, Malunkyaputta. And what has been explained by me, Malunkyaputta? 'This is dukkha'
      has been explained by me, Malunkyaputta. 'This is the arising of dukkha' has been
      explained by me. 'This is the stopping of dukkha' has been explained by me. 'This is the
      course leading to the stopping of dukkha' has been explained by me. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And why, Malunkyaputta, has this been explained by me? It
      is because it is connected with the goal, it is fundamental to the Brahma-faring, and
      conduces to turning away from, to dispassion, stopping, calming, super-knowledge,
      awakening and nibbana... ' </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Doubt cannot be cured by speculating about matters which
    do not lead to the goal; it can only be cured by being aware of the nama and rupa which
    present themselves now. Even when there is doubt it can be realized as only a type of nama
    arising because of conditions and not self. Thus the reality of the present moment will be
    known more clearly. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second type of moha-mula-citta is accompanied by
    indifferent feeling, arising with restlessness (upekkha-sahagatam, uddhacca-sampayuttam) .
    Uddhacca is translated 'restlessness' or 'excitement'. Uddhacca arises with all akusala
    cittas. When there is uddhacca there is no sati (mindfulness) with the citta. Sari arises
    with each wholesome citta; it 'remembers' what is wholesome. There is sati not only in
    vipassana, but also when one performs dana (generosity) observes sila (morality), applies
    oneself to studying 
 or teaching the Buddha's teachings or cultivates samatha. Sati
    in vipassana is aware of a characteristic of nama or rupa. 
 </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When there is uddhacca, the citta cannot be wholesome; one
    cannot at that moment apply oneself to dana, sila or bhavana. Uddhacca distracts the citta
    from kusala. Uddhacca is restlessness with regard to kusala. Thus, uddhacca is different
    from what we in conventional language mean by restlessness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Uddhacca arises also with the moha-mula-citta which is
    accompanied by doubt, since it arises with each akusala cilia. The second type of
    moha-mula-citta, however, is called uddhacca-sampayutta; it is different from the first
    type of moha-mula-citta which is called vicikiccha-sampayutta. 
 </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second type of moha-mula-citta, the moha-mula-citta
    which is uddhacca-sampayutta, arises countless times a day, but it is difficult to know
    its characteristic. If one has not cultivated vipassana one does not know this type of
    citta. When one is forgetful of realities and 'day-dreaming', there is not necessarily
    this type of citta. When we are 'day-dreaming' there is not only the second type of
    moha-mula-citta (uddhacca- sampayutta), but also lobha-mula-cittas (cittas rooted in
    attachment) or dosa-mula-cittas (cittas rooted in aversion). When one is forgetful of
    realities and the akusala citta is not rooted in lobha or dosa, and the citta is not
    accompanied by doubt, then there is the second type of moha-mula-citta accompanied by
    uddhacca. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Moha-mula-citta can arise on account of what we experience
    through the five sense-doors and through the mind-door. When, for example, we have heard
    sound, moha-mula-citta may arise. When the second type of moha-mula-citta which is
    uddhacca-sampayutta arises, there is ignorance and forgetfulness with regard to the object
    which is experienced at that moment. We may not see the danger of this type of citta,
    since it is accompanied by indifferent feeling. However, all kinds of akusala are
    dangerous. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Moha is dangerous, it is the root of all akusala. When we
    are ignorant of realities we accumulate a great deal of akusala. Moha conditions lobha;
    when we do not know realities as they are we become absorbed in the things we experience
    through the senses. Moha also conditions dosa; when we do not know realities we have
    aversion when we experience unpleasant things. Moha accompanies each akusala citta and it
    conditions all ten kinds of akusala kamma-patha which are accomplished through body,
    speech and mind. Only when there is mindfulness of the realities which appear through the
    six doors, the panna is developed which can eradicate moha. 
 </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The sotapanna ('streamwinner', who has attained the first
    stage of enlightenment) has eradicated the type of moha-mula-citta which is accompanied by
    vicikiccha (doubt); he has no more doubts about paramattha dhammas, he knows the 'world in
    the ariyan sense';. He has no doubts about the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. He
    has no doubts about the Path leading to the end of defilements. The sotapanna, the
    sakadagami ('once-returner', who has attained the second stage of enlightenment) and the
    anagami <br>
    ('non-returner', who has attained the third stage of enlightenment) still have the type of
    moha-mula-citta accompanied by uddhacca (restlessness). Only the arahat has eradicated all
    akusala. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ignorance is not seeing the true characteristic of
    realities, not knowing the 'four Noble Truths'. Out of ignorance one does not see the
    first Noble Truth, the Truth of dukkha : one does not realize nama and rupa as impermanent
    and dukkha. One does not know the second Noble Truth: the origin of dukkha which is
    craving. Because of clinging to nama and rupa there is no end to the cycle of birth and
    death and thus there is no end to dukkha. One does not know the Noble Truth of the
    'ceasing of dukkha', which is nibbana. One does not know the Noble Truth of 'the way
    leading to the ceasing of dukkha' which is the Elghtfold Path. The '
Eightfold Path'
    is developed through vipassana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We read in the 'Kindred Sayings' (lV, Salayatana-vagga,
    Kindred Sayings about Jambukhadaka, par. 9) that the wanderer asked Sariputta: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">' &quot;Ignorance, ignorance!&quot; is the saying, friend
      Sariputta. Pray, what is ignorance?'  
 </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'
Not understanding about dukka, friend, not
      understanding about the arising of dukkha, the ceasing of dukkha, the way leading to the
      ceasing of dukkha- - this, friend, is called &#147;ignorance&#148;'
 </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&#147;But is there any way, friend, any approach to the
      abandoning of this ignorance? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'
There is indeed away, friend, to such
      abandoning.'; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'
And what, friend, is that way, that approach
      to 
 the abandoning of this ignorance?'; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'
It is this ariyan Eightfold Path, friend... ';
      </font></p>
