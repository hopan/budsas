    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>&quot;The gift of Truth excels all
    other gifts&quot; </em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I was the first reader of the<em><strong> Life of the
    Buddha</strong></em> written by Mrs. Radhika Abeysekera. She presents the Dhamma to
    children in a very attractive way. On the day I was in Winnipeg, I understood the value of
    her voluntary gift of Dhamma (Dhammadana) to the children.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The results of her Dhammadana resolved my questions about
    the Dhamma knowledge and disciplined behaviour of the children of the Winnipeg Buddhist
    community.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To teach the life story of the Lord Buddha would not take
    much time in modern times. Let the children study it in detail later, when they understand
    the Dhamma better. Radhika presents in brief the points of the Dhamma that the beginner
    needs to know in more detail later.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Her attempt to attract children by giving them an idea of
    the correct path is more helpful than detailing the life story of the Lord Buddha. When
    children understand the facts of the teaching, they will eventually be persuaded to read
    for themselves the other necessary parts of the life story of the Lord Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The important points of the Dhamma which should be known
    by children are well expressed using few words in this book. When children ask more about
    the Lord Buddha, then their parents should draw them to know more. That is the easy way to
    teach Dhamma to children.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the beginning of her writing career. Let us hope
    she continues to write more books to reintroduce our children to Buddhism. We appreciate
    her silent mission in the Dhammadana that excels all other gifts. May all beings be well
    and happy!</font></p>

    <h3><a name="Preface"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Preface</font></a></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we first came to Winnipeg, Manitoba, there was no
    facility available to send our children to learn the teachings of the Buddha. In May of
    1989, the Vietnamese community, which had just purchased a temple, very generously gave us
    permission to use their new temple. Due to the Dharma Daana of the Vietnamese community,
    for the first time in the history of Winnipeg, Manitoba, we were able to organise a Vesak
    celebration with Attangasila (observing the 8 precepts) and Bhakthi Gita (devotional
    songs) by the children. As part of the celebration I told the Sri Lankan children the
    story of Angulimala. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Both our children (ages 6 &amp; 3 ) were fascinated by the
    story. Realising that they were ready for the teachings of the Buddha I started the Full
    Moon (Poya) Day Program. The Poya Day Program consisted of a Gilanpassa puja followed by a
    class for the children. As the other Sri Lankans in Winnipeg too could benefit by the
    program, it was open to all interested persons.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This book is the result of my Poya day classes. Our
    congregation grew from six children and a handful of adults to ten children and about
    fifteen adults. Now the children had acquired a fair knowledge of the teachings of the
    Buddha. However, they had no permanent record of what I taught them. I was afraid that as
    quick as they were to absorb the teachings of the Buddha, they would forget. In addition,
    our son, who is an avid reader, was asking me for more and more information about the
    teachings of the Buddha. Though I had many excellent books in both Sinhala and English,
    most of them were too advanced for him to read and understand on his own. This first book
    summarizes some of what I have taught in class. I intend to document the rest of what I
    have taught in subsequent books.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To benefit most from this book, a child should have some
    formal teaching of Buddhism. However, to make the book interesting to first-time readers,
    I have included all of the subjects that my class found most interesting. The brief
    description of the heavens and the life span in them resulted in many questions from the
    children, and led to the talk on the 31 planes of existence. It was also their questions
    that led to the class on rebirth, kamma and the advent of the Maithreya Buddha. It is
    hoped that the first-time readers too would be inspired to question, read and find out
    more about the teachings of the Buddha after reading this book.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many people helped directly and indirectly in the
    production of this book. First, it is thanks to the Vietnamese community of the Chan Dao
    Buddhist Association that we Sri Lankans have a place to worship. May they all partake in
    the merits of this gift of Dhamma. I also would like to thank Venerable Piyatissa (Mahaa
    Thero) of the New York Buddhist Vihara for checking the book for the accuracy of its
    material and writing the foreword. The </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Venerable Piyatissa has been a great help to us since we
    came to North America, and helped us to celebrate Vesak in Winnipeg in 1990. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I also want to thank Sarath, my husband, who helped to
    edit and publish this book, and our son, Chamal, who read the book many times to ensure
    that it can be read and understood by a child of eight. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the second edition of The Life of the Buddha. My
    good friend, Adrienne Bouchard Langlois, has offered her expertise in editing the contents
    of this second edition. It was also her inspiration that led to the use of technology in
    reproducing the pictures used in this book. Her encouragement and effort are a constant
    source of inspiration in my work. Her valuable contribution to this second edition is
    gratefully acknowledged.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">May you all partake in the merit of this Dhamma Daana. </font></p>

    <h3><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><a name="[01]">[01]</a>. Invitation of
    the Gods</font></h3>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Our Bodhisatta (1) was born in Tusita Heaven
    (2) as a Deva (3) by the name of Svetaketu. The Devas in Tusita Heaven were happy. The
    time had come for the Bodhisatta to be born in the world for the last time. The Devas
    invited the Bodhisatta to be born on earth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Bodhisatta looked down at the world to make sure that
    the five requirements necessary for His final birth in the world were met. These five
    requirements are as follows:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. The right time - The life span of human beings at a
    time a Buddha is born is between 100 and 100,000 years. If the life span is very short,
    human beings want to enjoy their short life to the fullest and tend to be very fond of
    material things. If the life span is very long, they tend to forget the impermanence of
    life. At this time the Bodhisatta found that the life span was one hundred and twenty
    years.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. The right continent - All Buddhas are born in India
    (known as Jumbudipa at the time of the Buddha). This is because the people of India are
    spiritually more advanced than people in other countries, and so are more ready for a
    Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. The right area - The city of Kapilavatthu was chosen as
    the city of the future Buddha, as there was a just and good king and many righteous people
    living there.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. The right caste - A Buddha is always born in a high
    caste - Either a royal caste or a priestly caste. This is necessary, as often persons born
    in a low caste are not accepted by society.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">5. The right mother - The mother of a Buddha has to be
    very pure. She is a person who has resolved to be a mother of a Buddha and observed the
    five precepts for many countless past lives. The chosen mother was Queen Mahaa Maayaa,
    wife of King Suddhodana of Kapilavatthu.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Bodhisatta saw that the five requirements were met.</font></p>
    <hr align="left" width="25%" size="1">
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>(1). Bodhisatta - One on his way to perfection. This
      is the name given to a person who is trying to be a Buddha. </em></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>(2). Tusita Heaven - One of the seven happy planes of
      life. The Devas in the Tusita Heaven have a life span of 576,000,000 human years. All
      Bodhisattas who have completed the ten perfections await the right time for their last
      birth in Tusita Heaven. The next Buddha, the Maithreya Buddha, is at present a Deva by the
      name of Natha in the Tusita Heaven.</em></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>(3). Devas - Heavenly beings known in English as gods
      or divine beings. </em></font></p>

    Maayaa's dream</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One night Queen Mahaa Maayaa had a dream. She dreamt that
    the Devas from the four directions of the earth took her to Lake Anotatta on top of the
    Himalayan mountain. She was bathed in the lake and dressed in heavenly clothes and
    ornaments. A white baby elephant carrying a white lotus flower in its trunk trumpeted, and
    after circling around her three times, entered her body.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next morning she told King Suddhodana of her dream. He
    consulted some wise men who, on hearing the dream said, &quot;The Queen will have a wise
    and noble baby boy.&quot; The king and queen were very happy for they had no children and
    were longing for a child.</font></p>

    <h3><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><a name="[03]">[03]</a>. The birth of a
    Prince</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the custom of that time, Queen Mahaa Maayaa
    decided to visit her mother so that she could be with her at the time of the birth of her
    baby.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the way she stopped at the Lumbini Pleasure Garden to
    rest. Under a sweet-scented Sal tree, on a full moon day in the month of May, in the year
    623 B.C., the Prince was born.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The baby Prince took seven steps, and a lotus flower burst
    through the ground to receive His feet. He made the following announcement:</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><em>&quot;Aggo hamasmi lokassa -
    &quot;I am the Chief in the world<br>
    Jettho hamasmi lokassa - There is no equal to me<br>
    Settho hamasmi lokassa - I am Supreme<br>
    Ayamanthima jathi - This is my last birth<br>
    Natthi dani punabbhavo. - &quot; No rebirth for me.&quot;</em></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is said in the Anagata Vamsa that the next Buddha,
    Maithreya, will make a similar announcement at His birth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The ministers took the Queen and the baby back to
    Kapilavatthu and King Suddhodana. Many wise men came to see the baby. They said that one
    day the Prince would either be a King of the world or a Supreme Buddha. The baby Prince
    was named Siddhaartha Gotama. Siddhaartha means &quot;wish fulfilled&quot; and Gotama was
    His family name.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Seven days after the birth of the Prince, Queen Mahaa
    Maayaa died. She was born as a Deva by the name of Matu-deva putta in the Tusita Heaven.
    Her sister, Mahaa Prajaapathi Gotami, took care of the Prince.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Every year there was a big festival at the time the rice
    fields were ploughed. One day King Suddhodana took the little Prince to the ploughing
    festival. The Prince fell asleep. Seeing that the Prince was sleeping, His maids joined in
    the festivities of the day.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When they came back they found the Prince deep in
    meditation. He was meditating on His breathing in and breathing out. This meditation is
    known as breathing meditation (Aanaapaana Sati Meditation). This form of meditation is
    very important, as it was this meditation that was later used by the Buddha to attain
    enlightenment (*).</font></p>

    <h3><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><a name="[05]">[05]</a>. The story of the
    swan</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Prince grew up to be a kind and gentle boy. One day He
    was walking in a grove when a swan that had been shot down fell near Him. The Prince
    picked up the swan, pulled out the arrow, and placed some soothing herbs on its wound. He
    then carried it back to the palace. His cousin, Devadatta, ran after Him to claim the
    bird, as it was he who had shot it down. Prince Siddhaartha refused to give Devadatta the
    bird.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Devadatta, angry at not getting the bird he had shot,
    complained to King Suddhodana. After listening to the young Princes, the King decided to
    have their dispute settled in court. At first the jury were angry that a children's petty
    dispute should be brought to court. However, King Suddhodana insisted on their settling
    the dispute saying, &quot;These are our future rulers. It is best that this should be
    settled in court.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Devadatta gave his side of the story first, saying that he
    had shot down the bird, and that as such, the bird belonged to him. Prince Siddhaartha
    agreed that it was Devadatta who had shot down the bird, but said that it was He who had
    saved its life by applying soothing herbs. Prince Siddhaartha said, &quot;If the bird had
    died, then it would have belonged to you. I saved its life by attending to it. Life
    belongs to the saviour of life, not to the destroyer.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After listening to Prince Siddhaartha's defence, the jury
    agreed with him that life belongs to its saviour, not to its destroyer. The bird was given
    to Prince Siddhaartha. </font></p>

    obedient, kind and generous. The gentle Prince was liked by all.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It was time for the Prince to be married. Prince
    Siddhaartha chose His own cousin, Princess Yasodharaa, as His bride. She too, wanted to
    marry Him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At first Princess Yasodharaa's father, King Suprabuddha,
    did not want his daughter to marry Prince Siddhaartha. He knew that some wise men had said
    that one day the Prince would give up His wealth and royal position and become a Buddha.
    He did not want Prince Siddhaartha to give up his daughter and kingdom. However, Princess
    Yasodharaa wanted to marry Him and no other. The Prince and Princess were married with
    great ceremony. Both Prince Siddhaartha and Princess Yasodharaa were sixteen years old at
    the time of their marriage. They were very happy together.</font></p>

    <h3><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><a name="[07]">[07]</a>. The four signs</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Prince and Princess led an idyllic life together. King
    Suddhodana made sure that they had every luxury. He did not want the Prince to see or feel
    any sorrow, for he did not want Prince Siddhaartha to give up His kingdom and become a
    Buddha. King Suddhodana wanted his son to be the next king.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day when the Prince was out riding with Channa, His
    charioteer, He saw a very old man. The man was very feeble, hunched over, and could hardly
    walk. Having never seen old age before, the Prince inquired from Channa as to what had
    happened to the man. He then found out from Channa about old age and that it would someday
    happen to all of us. The kind-hearted Prince was very sad and thoughtful about this
    new-found information.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On another day when He was out with Channa He saw a very
    sick man in great pain. The Prince, who had never seen such grave sickness, inquired from
    Channa as to what was wrong with the man. He was even sadder when He heard about sickness
    and pain and that it could happen to anyone.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Prince was again out with Channa when He saw the
    funeral of a man. The dead man's friends and relatives were crying and carrying him for
    his burial. Having never faced death before, the young Prince was horrified to find that
    death was something we all had to face.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For many days the young Prince was disturbed by these
    sights: Old age, Sickness, and Death, common to all living beings. &quot;Was there any way
    he could stop this life of old age, sickness and death that all mankind had to face? Was
    there any way that he could deliver mankind from pain and sorrow?&quot; The young Prince
    pondered these questions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The sad and thoughtful Prince was again out with Channa
    when He saw an ascetic, a person who had renounced the world and all his belongings and
    taken the life of a monk. What serenity, what peace of mind! The ascetic's face looked
    calm, free from worries. This, then, must be the answer, thought Prince Siddhaartha. He
    made up His mind to give up all of His wealth and kingdom to become an ascetic. He decided
    that He wanted to find a way to end this sorrow of old age, sickness and death, so that He
    could help mankind. </font></p>

    <h3 align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><a name="[08]">[08]</a>. The
    Great Renunciation</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Prince Siddhaartha was twenty-nine years old. It was a
    full moon day in the month of July. The Prince had decided that this was the day when He
    would leave the palace and become an ascetic, when the news came that Princess Yasodharaa
    had given birth to a baby boy. The first word that the Prince said when he heard of the
    birth of His son was &quot;Raahu&quot;. Raahu means an obstacle. The baby prince would
    make Prince Siddhaartha's decision to leave the palace and His loved ones even more
    difficult. An obstacle to His leaving had arisen. The baby was named Raahula, by his
    grandfather.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Prince Siddhaartha went to His wife's sleeping chamber to
    look at her and His new-born son. Both were asleep. The princess's hand was covering the
    baby's face. The Prince knew that His wife would wake up if He tried to move her hand to
    see the baby's face. It would then be very difficult for Him to leave. &quot;I must leave
    quietly and find a way to end this recurring life of old age, sickness, and death,&quot;
    thought the Prince. &quot;I must find this happiness for mankind, my wife, and son. Then I
    will come back to see my son.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Prince took one last look at His beloved wife and son.
    He then called Channa, His charioteer, and left the palace on His horse Kanthaka. He
    crossed the river Anomaa and handed all His jewellery and rich clothes to Channa. He asked
    Channa to take them back to His family and tell them that He had gone to find a way to end
    death.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Deva king Sakka handed Him the robes and bowl of an
    ascetic. His faithful horse Kanthaka did not want to leave Him. The sorrow of parting was
    too great for it. Kanthaka died of a broken heart and was born as a Deva in the Taavatimsa
    Heaven (1). Channa went back to break the news of the Great Renunciation to the king.
    After the renunciation Prince Siddhaartha was known as the ascetic Gotama.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All Bodhisattas must be married and have a child in their
    last birth before enlightenment. It has been so with all the Buddhas of the past and will
    be so with all the Buddhas of the future. Otherwise, because a supreme Buddha is such a
    perfect being, so God-like, He would be mistaken for a God (Brahma). They in the Brahma
    world (2) do not marry. The Buddha, however, is above all Gods. He is the perfect being,
    teacher of Gods and humans, and incomparable.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>(1). Taavatimsa Heaven - One of the seven happy planes
      of life also known as the Heaven of the thirty-three Devas. It was in this Heaven that the
      Buddha taught the Higher Teachings (Abhidhamma) for three months. </em></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>(2). Brahma world - There are sixteen happy planes of
      life where the beings have pleasures, but not the pleasures of the senses. Usually, those
      who have achieved the spiritual levels of the mental absorptions (Jhaanas) are born in
      these planes of life. </em></font></p>

    <h3 align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><a name="[09]">[09]</a>. The
    ascetic Gotama</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The ascetic Gotama went to two well-known teachers to seek
    a way to defeat death. They were Alaara Kalaama and Uddaka Raamaputta. Very soon the
    ascetic Gotama had mastered all the knowledge of His teachers. However, neither of them
    could teach Him the way to end the cycle of birth and death.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The ascetic Gotama left the two teachers and was joined by
    five of His friends who were also searching for the truth. They were Kondanna, Bhaddiya,
    Vappa, Mahaanaama and Assaji. Together the friends gave up sensual gratification and tried
    to find the truth through self- mortification. At this time in India it was thought that
    the way to purify one's mind was through self-mortification. That is, by giving up eating,
    drinking and even breathing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The ascetic Gotama tried all of this. His body wasted away
    due to lack of food. His beautiful golden skin became darkened and withered. His hair fell
    out for lack of nourishment. He had by now reduced the amount of food He ate to one
    mustard seed per day. He was so weak He could hardly move. The Devas said, &quot;Surely
    the ascetic Gotama has passed away.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The ascetic Gotama realised that He would not reach His
    goal through self-mortification. Slowly, He started to take nourishment again. He decided
    to follow the middle path: to avoid the luxuries He had as a prince and also to avoid the
    extreme sacrifice of His body. His five friends left Him, thinking that the ascetic Gotama
    had given up His holy life and search for the Truth.</font></p>

    Sujaataa's wish</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The ascetic Gotama set off on His own and reached the
    river Neranjara. He started to meditate under a tree.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this area there lived a noble lady by the name of
    Sujaataa. She had taken a vow to the Deva whom she believed lived in this tree, and had
    prayed for a good son. On having her prayer answered, she prepared a dish of milk rice and
    went to the tree to offer it to the Deva. On seeing the ascetic so calm and beautiful she
    offered it to Him, thinking that He was the Deva. She said, &quot;May your wishes be
    fulfilled just as mine have been.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The ascetic Gotama ate the food, put the bowl into the
    river, and tested His mind-power by saying, &quot;If I attain the supreme knowledge of
    enlightenment today, may this bowl float upstream.&quot; The bowl floated upstream. This
    encouraged Him further.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thereafter He went to Gaya and sat under a tree to
    meditate, determined to achieve the supreme knowledge on that day</font></p>

    Enlightenment</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It was a full moon day in the month of May. Remembering
    how, as a small boy, He had meditated on breathing in and breathing out at the ploughing
    festival and reached the first mental absorption (Jhaana), the ascetic Gotama decided to
    use this form of meditation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Maara, the feeling of desire and attachment, seeing that
    the ascetic Gotama was about to achieve the supreme knowledge, tried to tempt Him with
    images of His wife and other pleasures. However, the ascetic Gotama was determined and
    continued His meditation. Finally, He attained the Supreme knowledge known as
    enlightenment. He attained it in three stages by realising the Four Noble Truths.</font></p>

    <h3 align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><a name="[12]">[12]</a>. The
    seven weeks after enlightenment</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the first week after enlightenment the Gotama Buddha
    meditated on His new-found knowledge and enjoyed His new-found happiness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the second week He paid respect to the Tree that had
    given Him shade during His long struggle for enlightenment, by standing at attention and
    gazing motionless at it. The Tree is now known as the Bodhi Tree: The Tree of Knowledge. A
    sapling from this original tree is now in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. It is the oldest
    documented tree in the world. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the third week, seeing that the Devas were still in
    doubt as to whether He had attained enlightenment, He created a golden bridge with His
    powers and meditated while walking up and down on it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the fourth week he created a jewelled chamber and
    meditated on the higher teachings (Abhidhamma). At this time His mind and body were so
    pure and perfect that an aura of six colours emanated from His person. They were blue,
    yellow, red, white, orange and a mixture of the five. Today the Buddhist flag is made up
    of these colours.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Each colour represents one noble quality of the Buddha as
    follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><em>Blue - confidence<br>
      Yellow - holiness<br>
      Red - wisdom<br>
      White - purity<br>
      Orange - absence of desire<br>
      Mixed - all of these qualities</em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the fifth week the beautiful daughters of Maara -
    Tanhaa, Rathi and Ragaa - tried to disturb His concentration by dancing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the sixth week He was meditating under the Mucalinda
    tree when there was a heavy rain. Mucalinda, the king of serpents, coiled round the body
    of the Buddha seven times and held his large hood over the Buddha's head so that He would
    not get wet.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the seventh week the Buddha was meditating under the
    Raajaayatana tree when two merchants by the name of Tapassu and Bhallika offered him rice
    cake. This was the Lord Buddha's first meal after enlightenment. The two merchants took
    refuge in the Buddha and the Dhamma, and became the first lay disciples of the Gotama
    Buddha.</font></p>

    first sermon</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The compassionate Gotama Buddha decided that He should
    teach His new-found knowledge to mankind so that they too could defeat the cycle of birth
    and death.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He saw that His first two teachers, Alaara Kalaama and
    Uddaka Raamaputta, had passed away. He chose His five friends next, and went to Isipatana
    where they were residing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the five friends saw the Buddha they decided to
    ignore him. They thought that the ascetic Gotama had given up the holy life, as He had
    moved away from extreme self-mortification. However, they could not ignore the radiance of
    His presence.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It was the full moon day in the month of July. At the deer
    park in Isipatana, the Buddha delivered His first sermon after enlightenment. Dhammachakka
    is the name given to His first sermon. The meaning of Dhammachakka is &quot;The
    establishment of wisdom&quot;. However, it is often referred to as the &quot;Wheel of
    truth&quot;. After hearing it His friend Kondanna reached the first stage of spiritual
    development known as Sotaapatti (1).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Dhammachakka sutta is very important, as in this first
    sermon the Buddha taught us about the Four Noble Truths and the Middle Path.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Middle Path is what the Buddha followed to attain
    enlightenment. He gave up the extreme of wealth and luxuries He had had as a Prince and
    the extreme self-mortification of torturing His body by withholding the necessities for
    life. Instead, He used the Middle Path. He catered to the needs of His body rather than to
    the wants of His mind. This Middle Path that leads to the end of suffering is comprised of
    the Noble Eightfold Path - namely:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">1. Right Understanding<br>
      2. Right Thinking<br>
      3. Right Speech<br>
      4. Right Action<br>
      5. Right Livelihood<br>
      6. Right Effort<br>
      7. Right Mindfulness<br>
      8. Right Concentration</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Following The Eightfold Noble Path leads to the
    understanding of the Four Noble Truths which results in Nibbaana. The Four Noble Truths
    are: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Dukkha - That which is difficult to endure - suffering
      or dissatisfaction <br>
      2. Cause of Dukkha - craving and attachment<br>
      3. End to Dukkha - Nibbaana (no more rebirth)<br>
      4. The way to end Dukkha - following the Eightfold Noble Path. </font></p>

    <h3 align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><a name="[14]">[14]</a>. The
    teachings of the Buddha</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">During the next forty-five years the Buddha preached His
    new-found knowledge to help mankind and the Devas. He was known as Satthaa Devamanussaanam
    - teacher of Devas and humans. Some special features of the teachings of the Buddha are as
    follows: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. The Buddha wanted us to study, investigate and
    understand His teachings, only accepting them when we found them to be moral and conducive
    to the well-being and happiness of mankind. The Buddha said, &quot;Do not accept anything
    on mere hearsay, tradition, rumours, inference, preconceived notions, supposition, or
    because it seems acceptable. Do not accept anything because the ascetic who taught it is
    respected by all ...&quot;.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism appeals more to the intellect than the emotion.
    It is concerned more with the character of the devotees than with their numerical
    strength. When the millionaire Upaali visited the Buddha with the idea of condemning His
    teachings, the Buddha patiently taught him the Dhamma. Impressed with His teachings,
    Upaali wished to join His followers. However, the Lord Buddha advised him saying, &quot;It
    is well for a distinguished man like you to make a thorough investigation.&quot; Upaali,
    overwhelmed with joy at this unexpected statement said, &quot;If I had become a follower
    of any other teacher they would have proclaimed the fact that I, Upaali the millionaire,
    had changed teachers. The more pleased am I.&quot; Upaali became a Buddhist by conviction
    but the Buddha with His boundless compassion advised him to support his former religious
    teacher as before.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. The Buddha advised us that at no time should we ever
    insult or condemn the religion of another. Intolerance is the greatest enemy of religion.
    Denouncing unfair criticism of other faiths the Buddha states, &quot;It is as a man who
    looks up and spits at heaven. The spittle does not soil the heaven, but comes back and
    soils his own person.&quot; On another occasion the Buddha said, &quot;If you find truth
    in any religion, accept that truth.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. The ordinary precepts that Buddhists follow are not
    commandments but modes of discipline (sikkhaapada) that they take of their own accord. In
    Buddhism we are not forced or commanded to do anything. We follow the teachings of the
    Buddha of our own free will because we understand and believe in them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. Buddhism teaches non-violence. In the Dhammapada (Law
    Verses) the Buddha said:</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>&quot;All fear the rod,<br>
    Life is dear to all. <br>
    Feeling for others as for yourself<br>
    You should neither slay,<br>
    Nor cause others to slay.&quot;</em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Following, understanding and accepting the teachings of
    the Buddha, Buddhists take the first precept 'paanaatipaataa veramani sikkhaapadam
    samaadiyaami' which means 'I undertake to observe the precept of abstaining from
    destroying living beings'. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To the unique credit of Buddhism, it must be said that
    throughout the peaceful march of 2600 years, no drop of blood has been shed in the name of
    the Buddha, and no mighty monarch has wielded his powerful sword to spread the Dhamma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">5. The Buddha taught us to be compassionate to all living
    beings. In the Karaniya Metta Sutta the Buddha said:</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>&quot;As a mother protects her only
    child,<br>
    Even at the risk of her own life,<br>
    Let one cultivate boundless thoughts of loving kindness.<br>
    Towards all living beings.&quot;</em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">6. The Buddha taught us that we must show love and
    kindness to our enemies and those we do not like. He did not believe in revenge and an eye
    for an eye. In the Dhammapada the Buddha said:</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>&quot;Conquer anger by loving kindness.<br>
    Conquer evil by good.<br>
    Conquer the stingy by liberality.<br>
    Conquer the liar by truthfulness.&quot;</em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">7. The Buddha advocated equality for all mankind. He
    attempted to abolish slavery and the degrading caste system in Indian society. He
    declared: </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>&quot;By birth is not one an outcaste,<br>
    By birth is not one a brahmin.<br>
    By deeds is one an outcaste,<br>
    By deeds is one a brahmin (1).&quot;</em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the Buddha's teaching, caste or colour do not
    prevent one from becoming a Buddhist or joining the order of the Sangha (Buddhist monks).
    Fishermen and scavengers, together with warriors and brahmins were freely admitted to the
    order of the Sangha and given positions of high rank.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Upaali the barber was chief disciple in matters pertaining
    to the discipline of the Sangha (Vinaya). Sunita, who was honoured by kings as an Arahanth
    (2), was a scavenger. Rajjumala and Punnaa were slave girls.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">8. The Buddha also raised the status of women
    by starting the order of the Nuns. He saw the good in both men and women. Gender is no
    barrier to spiritual development and religious service. At that time in Indian society
    women were often treated as inferior to men. When Queen Mallikaa gave birth to a baby
    girl, the Buddha comforted the distraught King Pasenadi by saying, </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>&quot;A female child may prove even
    better than a male offspring.&quot; </em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">9. Rebirth and kamma are also integral parts of Buddhism.
    According to the teachings of the Buddha, life does not end at death. One is reborn
    instantaneously. Though many great teachers of the East advocate rebirth, it is not a
    belief exclusively for the East. Many great men in the West believe in rebirth. Among its
    advocates we have scientists like Thomas Huxley, who was responsible for introducing
    science to the 19th century British school system, Professor Gustaf Stromberg, the famous
    Swedish astronomer, Professor Julian Huxley, the distinguished British scientist,
    philosophers like Pythagoras and Plato, poets like Shelley, Tennyson and Wordsworth, and
    American industrialist Henry Ford.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Our life is a result of our kamma. We are not brought to
    this world by anyone but ourselves. It is the result of a cause. The cause is delusion
    (avijja). To understand this theory, we need to develop our minds through meditation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kamma means action. Vipaka means results. Good actions
    cause good results. Bad actions cause bad results. The Buddha said, &quot;Whether you are
    in the sea, the air, or in a cave, you cannot hide from the effects of your bad
    kamma.&quot; That is the Law of Kamma. It must be stressed, however, that it is the
    intention behind the action and not just the action alone that sets off the reaction
    (vipaka). As Buddhists we refrain from bad actions and perform good actions because we
    know that one day, either in this birth or in a future birth, the effects of our actions
    will come back to us. We know that not even the Buddha can save us from the effects of our
    bad actions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As Buddhists, we understand that due to the Law of Kamma,
    bad things can happen to a good person just as good things can happen to a bad person. We
    see the bigger picture. We go back into our past lives and understand that these are the
    results of our past bad actions. As such, we do not blame any divine powers for our
    misfortunes. Knowing that we are now paying for the results of our past bad actions, we
    take heed and ensure that we improve and not make the same mistake again. We learn from
    our misfortunes by doing good and avoiding bad actions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">10. The Buddha taught us that you are your own saviour. No
    all-powerful God can help us to attain Nibbaana. No God can help us to escape from the
    effects of our own actions. As such, you make your own destiny. Mind is supreme. In
    Buddhism we learn to control our minds and our destiny. We rely on no one but ourselves.
    The Buddhas show us how. They are our teachers. It is up to us to follow Their teachings
    of the Noble Eightfold Path, to control and purify our minds through meditation and attain
    our own salvation. The teachings of all Buddhas can be summed up in three lines:</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>&quot;Do no evil, Do good,
    Purify the mind.&quot;</strong></em></font></p>

    Parinibbaana of the Lord Buddha</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha was eighty years old. The time was near for the
    passing away (parinibbaana) of the Lord Buddha. The Buddha had advised Venerable Aananda,
    His attending monk, that He would be passing away in three months. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha proceeded to walk to the city of Kusinaaraa. On
    the way a man by the name of Pukkusa heard His Dhamma (1) and offered Him two golden
    robes. As directed by the Buddha he robed the Buddha with one and Venerable Aananda with
    the other. When the Buddha was robed Venerable Aananda was surprised to see that the skin
    of the Holy One was exceedingly bright, so that the golden robe appeared dull in
    comparison. The Buddha informed Aananda that the Tathaagata's (2) skin becomes clear and
    exceedingly bright on two occasions: the night on which He attains Buddhahood and the
    night on which He passes away. He then announced that on the third watch of the night He
    would pass away in the Sala grove of the Mallas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It was a full moon day in the month of May. The Lord
    Buddha reached the Sal garden of the Mallas and saw that the twin Sal trees were in full
    bloom even though it was out of season. He then said, &quot;It is not thus that the
    Tathagata is respected, venerated, honoured and revered. Whenever a Bhikku or Bhikkuni,
    Upaasaka or Upaasikaa lives in accordance with the Teachings, conducts himself dutifully
    and acts righteously, it is he who respects, reverences, venerates, honours and reveres
    the Tathaagata with the highest homage.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha then lay down on a couch prepared by Aananda,
    on His right side with His head facing north. At this time, Subhadda, a wandering ascetic,
    came to Him to clear up a doubt. Happy with the Buddha's teachings, he took refuge in the
    Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, and requested permission to be a monk. He was the last
    personal disciple of the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Just before the Buddha passed away many disciples came to
    pay their respects to Him. One monk, however, did not come. Instead, he remained in his
    abode, deep in meditation. On being asked the reason for his absence the monk said,
    &quot;Lord, I knew that Your Reverence would pass away shortly and I thought that the best
    way to honour the Teacher was by attaining Arahantship before the passing away of Your
    Reverence.&quot; The Buddha, pleased with his reply, said: &quot;Excellent, excellent! He
    who loves me should act as this monk. He honours me best who practises my teaching
    best.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Finally, the Buddha addressed His disciples and said these
    words: &quot;Subject to change are all component things. Strive on with diligence.&quot;
    These were His last words. It was the full moon day in the month of May in the year 543
    B.C. In the third watch of the night the Blessed One passed away.</font></p>

    What they say about Him and Buddhism</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is now over two thousand five hundred years since the
    passing away of the Lord Buddha. The teachings of the Buddha remain true, a monument to
    His greatness. This is what some well- known persons, who have studied His teachings, say
    about Him and His teachings.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The religion of the future will be a cosmic
    religion. It should transcend a personal God and avoid dogmas and theology. Covering both
    the natural and the spiritual, it should be based on a religious sense arising from the
    experience of all things, natural and spiritual, and a meaningful unity. Buddhism answers
    this description. If there is any religion that would cope with modern scientific needs,
    it would be Buddhism.&quot; -- Prof. Albert Einstein</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Buddhist or no Buddhist, I have examined every one
    of the great religious systems of the world; and in none of those have I found anything to
    surpass in beauty and comprehensiveness the Noble Eightfold Path of the Buddha. I am
    content to shape my life according to that path.&quot; -- Prof. Rhys Davids</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Alone of all the great world religions, Buddhism
    made its way without persecution, censorship or inquisition. In all these respects its
    record is enormously superior to that of Christianity, which made its way among people
    wedded to materialism and which was able to justify the bloodthirsty tendencies of its
    adherents by an appeal to the savage bronze-age literature of the Old Testament.&quot; --
    Aldous Huxley</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Of the great religions of history, I prefer
    Buddhism, especially in its earliest forms, because it has had the smallest element of
    persecution.&quot; -- Lord Bertrand Russell</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;To go to Him for refuge, to sing His praise, to do
    Him honour and to abide in His Dhamma is to act with understanding.&quot; -- Poet of
    ancient India</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Indian pacifism finds its complete expression in the
    teaching of the Buddha. Buddhism teaches ahimsa or harmlessness towards all beings. It
    forbids even laymen to have anything to do with the manufacture and sale of arms, with the
    making of poisons and intoxicants, with soldiering or the slaughtering of animals.&quot;
    -- Aldous Huxley </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In Gotama the Buddha we have a mastermind from the
    East second to none so far as the influence on the thought and life of the human race is
    concerned, and sacred to all as the founder of a religious tradition whose hold is hardly
    less wide and deep than any other. He belongs to the history of the world's thought, to
    the general inheritance of all cultivated men, for, judged by intellectual integrity,
    moral earnestness and spiritual insight, he is undoubtedly one of the greatest figures of
    history.&quot; -- Sri Radhakrishnan (Gotama The Buddha)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The Greatest Man ever born.&quot; -- Great Poet
    Tagore</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In the Buddha you see clearly a man, simple, devout,
    lonely, battling for light, a vivid human personality, not a myth. He too gave a message
    to mankind universal in character. Many of our best modern ideas are in closest harmony
    with it. All the miseries and discontents of life are due, He taught, to selfishness.
    Before a man can become serene he must cease to live for his senses or himself. Then he
    merges into a greater being. Buddhism in different language called men to
    self-forgetfulness 500 years before Christ. In some ways He was nearer to us and our
    needs. He was more lucid upon our individual importance in service than Christ and less
    ambiguous upon the question of personal immortality.&quot; -- H. G. Wells (Three Greatest
    Men in History)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><br WP="BR2">
    &quot;The more I know Him the more I love Him.&quot; -- Fausboll (Danish scholar)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I know nothing more grand in this world than the
    figure of the Buddha. It is the perfect embodiment of spirituality in the visible
    domain.&quot; -- Count Kaiserling (Travel Diary of a Philosopher)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The Buddhist moral code is one of the most perfect
    which the world has ever known.&quot; -- Prof. Max Muller </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The scriptures of the Saviour of the World,<br>
    Lord Buddha - Prince Siddaartha styled on earth - <br>
    In Earth and Heavens and Hells Incomparable,<br>
    All-honoured, Wisest, Best, most Pitiful (Compassionate);<br>
    The Teacher of Nirvaana and the Law.&quot; -- Sir Edwin Arnold (The Light of Asia)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;May the Dhamma last as long as my sons and grandsons
    and the sun and the moon will be, and may the people follow the Path of the Dhamma, for if
    one follows the path, happiness in this and in the other world will be attained.&quot; --
    Emperor Asoka of India</font></p>
