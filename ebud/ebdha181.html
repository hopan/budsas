  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he quality of our
    lives is conditioned by the quality of our actions. Buddhism teaches us to have a firm
    conviction in human potential. It says that we are creatures that possess the wonderful
    ability to take responsibility for what we think, do, and say, and to make our lives
    expressions of wisdom and compassion, rather than selfishness, fear, and greed. </font><p><font
    face="Times New Roman">We can develop the power and skill to refrain from acts of body,
    speech, and mind that cause ourselves and others pain. We can learn to perform those acts
    of body, speech, and mind that lead to happiness and peace. We can purify our minds. Thus
    Buddhism is concerned with the nature of our lives and the means by which we can eradicate
    the discontent and hollowness which so afflicts them. Consequently the teachings of
    Buddhism are not to be seen as dogmas to be adhered to, but tools to be used to develop
    our inherent potential. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism is a religion that considers wisdom, rather than
    faith, to be the single most important virtue. The Buddha said that if we look at
    ourselves very closely and honestly, we find a well of disease and conflict within our
    mind. He said that the underlying root of that pain is our ignorance of and the
    fundamental misconceptions that we cherish about the true nature of our existence. The way
    to true happiness thus lies in remedying our wrong ideas about the way things are, and for
    this task we need a wisdom founded on generosity and morality and fortified by a calm
    clarity of mind. In Buddhist perspective our lives have dignity and meaning to the extent
    that they incline towards and testify to truth. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>GENEROSITY</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On its most basic level, our wrong understanding of life,
    characterised by a tenacious clinging to the sense of &quot;me&quot; and &quot;mine&quot;,
    manifests externally as selfishness and possessiveness. The first level of Buddhist
    practice entails undermining our foolishness by countering its expressions. We develop a
    generous heart. The Buddha encouraged us to give, wisely and selflessly, not seeking for
    any kind of reward. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He spoke of three kinds of giving: the giving of material
    things to those deserving of it, e.g., food to mendicant monks, alms to the poor; the
    giving of forgiveness to those that have wronged us; and lastly and most excellently, the
    giving of truth, gladly sharing any worldly knowledge or spiritual understanding that we
    have acquired. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Generosity, apart from eroding selfish concern, gives a
    joy and lightness to the mind and creates bonds of love and friendship within a society.
    The less grasping at things we have, the more we can open up to the world around us and
    contribute positively to it. </font></p>
    <h4><font face="Times New Roman">MORALITY</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Morality, the second aspect of Buddhist training, is also
    deeply concerned with the things we do and the things we say. Action and speech that
    proceeds from unwholesome mental states harms both ourselves and others. In Buddhism,
    morality is defined as the will to refrain from all such words and deeds. By not
    reinforcing the power of ne.g.ative emotions through internal repression or outward
    expression, but by simply observing and calmly enduring through them, the hold of the
    afflictions over us is weakened, and we be.g.in to free ourselves from them. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The training in morality consists of a commitment to
    certain precepts as guiding principles in one's daily life. For lay Buddhists these
    precepts are five in number, namely: </font><ol>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">to refrain from taking life </font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">to refrain from stealing </font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">to refrain from sexual misconduct </font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">to refrain from false speech </font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">to refrain from use of intoxicants. </font></li>
    </ol>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These precepts are not commandments or to be blindly
    obeyed but are tools to be skilfully used to harmonise the way we live with spiritual
    truths. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although framed ne.g.atively the precepts naturally
    engender virtues of kindness, honesty, contentment, truthfulness, and heedfulness. One who
    keeps the precepts purely finds feelings of guilt and self-reproach supplanted by those of
    well-being and self-respect. One's mind inclines toward peace and clarity. Morality is
    thus the firm basis for all spiritual endeavour and can be seen to provide the
    indispensable foundation for an intelligent and caring society. </font></p>
    <h4><font face="Times New Roman">MEDITATION</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third aspect of Buddhism is meditation, the
    development of mental calm and insight. In their normal state, our minds are scattered and
    out of control. We find it hard to stop thinking even for a moment. The tremendous energy
    of the mind is thus never harnessed and put to good use. Meditation is a way to focus the
    mind, so as to enable it to withdraw from its usual preoccupations, and penetrate the
    truth of our existence. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Meditation is not merely a means of relaxation, nor is it
    a technique to escape from stressful responsibility into blissful trance. It is rather a
    precise means for sharpening, strengthening, and ultimately purifying the mental
    faculties. Initially one concentrates the mind on a particular object, just as to tame a
    wild animal, one might tie it to a post. There are many possible objects to use for this
    purpose. One that many people find useful is the sensation of the breath at the tip of the
    nostrils, but whatever object is employed, the important point is to maintain a close,
    alert, and continual awareness of it. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At first, of course, we can't. Concentration is difficult.
    It goes against the grain of our distraction. But with patience, perseverance, and good
    humour, it is not impossible. When the mind strays away from the object one gently but
    firmly brings it back again - again and again and again. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Eventually the concentration becomes more or less
    effortless and the mind bright and firm. Here, fore.g.oing the initial object, one merely
    maintains a sharp, bare awareness of whatever is arising consciousness - be it a physical
    sensation, a feeling, a thought, a perception, or whatever - staying with the changing
    nature of each phenomenon rather than its content. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If the mind has been sufficiently stabilised by
    concentration one is able to maintain an equanimous gaze on the present reality and a
    direct non-conceptual appreciation of the true nature of our existence be.g.ins to grow.
    As we come to realise the changing, unstable, and inconsequential nature of all that goes
    to make up our lives, our wrong ideas and assumptions about ourselves fall away and our
    grasping attachment to things is completely undermined. It is here that true peace and
    liberation, the highest achievement of human beings and the goal of Buddhism, is finally
    achieved./.</font></p>
