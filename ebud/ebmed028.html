<blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When you go to study meditation with any group or teacher
    who is experienced in a particular form of meditation, you
    should first make your heart confident that your teacher is
    fully experienced in that form of meditation, and be
    confident that the form of meditation he teaches is the right
    path for sure.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, show respect for
    the place in which you are to meditate.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only then
    should you begin practicing.</p>
    <p>Teachers in the past used to require a <strong>dedication
    ceremony</strong> as a means of inspiring confidence before
    you were to study meditation.&nbsp;&nbsp; They would have you
    make an offering of five pairs of beeswax candles and five
    pairs of white flowers -- this was called the five khandha --
    or eight pairs of beeswax candles and eight pairs of white
    flowers -- this was called the eight khandha -- or one pair
    of beeswax candles each weighing 15 grams and an equal number
    of white flowers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then they would teach you their
    particular form of meditation.&nbsp;&nbsp; This ancient
    custom has its good points.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many other
    ceremonies as well, but I won't go into them.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I'll mention only a very simple, easy-to-follow ceremony a
    little further on.</p>
    <p>Only after you have inspired confidence in your heart as
    already mentioned should you go to the teacher experienced in
    that form of meditation.&nbsp;&nbsp; If he is experienced in
    repeating <em><strong>&quot;samma araham&quot;</strong></em>,
    he will teach you to repeat <em><strong>samma araham, samma
    araham, samma araham</strong></em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he'll
    have you visualize a bright, clear jewel two inches above
    your navel, and tell you to focus your mind right there as
    you continue your repetition, without letting your mind slip
    away from the jewel.&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, you take the
    jewel as the focal point of your mind.</p>
    <p>If you go to a teacher experienced in meditating on <strong>the
    rising and falling of the abdomen</strong>, he will have you
    meditate on rising and falling, and focus your mind on the
    different motions of the body.&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, when
    you raise your foot, you think raising.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you
    place your foot, you think placing, and so on; or else he
    will have you focus continually on being preoccupied with the
    phenomenon of arising and passing away in every motion or
    position of the body.</p>
    <p>If you go to a teacher experienced in <strong>psychic
    powers</strong>, he will have you repeat <em><strong>&quot;na
    ma ba dha, na ma ba dha&quot;</strong></em>, and focus the
    mind on a single object until it takes you to see heaven and
    hell, deities and brahmas of all sorts, to the point where
    you get carried away with your visions.</p>
    <p>If you go to a teacher experienced in <strong>breath
    meditation</strong>, he will have you focus on your
    in-and-out breath, and have you keep your mind firmly
    preoccupied with nothing but the in-and-out breath.</p>
    <p>If you go to a teacher experienced in meditating on <strong>buddho</strong>,
    he will have you repeat <em><strong>&quot;buddho, buddho,
    buddho&quot;</strong></em>, and have you keep the mind firmly
    in that meditation word until you are fully skilled at
    it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he will have you contemplate <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>
    and what it is that is saying <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Once you see that they are two separate things, focus on what
    is saying <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; As
    for the word <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>, it will
    disappear, leaving only what it is that was saying <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    You then focus on what it is that was saying <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>
    as your object.</p>
    <p>People of our time -- or of any time, for that matter --
    regardless of how educated or capable they may be (I don't
    want to criticize any of us as tending to believe in things
    whose truth we haven't tested, because after all we all want
    to know and see the truth) and especially those of us who are
    Buddhists:&nbsp;&nbsp; Buddhism teaches causes and effects
    which are entirely true, but why is it that we have to fall
    for the claims and advertisements which we hear
    everywhere?&nbsp;&nbsp; It must be because people at present
    are impatient, and want to see results before they have
    completed the causes, in line with the fact that we are
    supposed to be in an atomic age.</p>
    <p>Buddhism teaches us to penetrate into the heart and mind,
    which are mental phenomena.&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the body, it
    is a physical phenomenon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Physical phenomena have
    to lie under the control of mental phenomena.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When we begin to practice meditation and train the mind to be
    quiet and untroubled, I can't see that we are creating any
    problems at that moment for anyone at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we
    keep practicing until we are skilled, then we will be calm
    and at peace.&nbsp;&nbsp; If more and more people practice
    this way, there will be peace and happiness all over the
    world.&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the body, we can train it to be
    peaceful only as long as the mind is in full
    control.&nbsp;&nbsp; The minute mindfulness lapses, the body
    will get back to its old affairs.&nbsp;&nbsp; So let's try
    training the mind by repeating <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <hr align="left" width="25%">
    <h3><font color="#800080">Preliminary Steps to Practicing
    Meditation</font></h3>
    <p>Before practicing meditation on the word <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>,
    you should start out with the preliminary steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I.e., inspire confidence in your mind, as already mentioned,
    and then bow down three times, saying:</p>
    <p><strong>Araham samma-sambuddho bhagava</strong> -- The
    Blessed One is pure and fully self-awakened.<br>
    <strong>Buddham bhagavantam abhivademi</strong> -- To the
    Blessed, Awakened One, I bow down.<br>
    (Bow down once.)</p>
    <p><strong>Svakkhato bhagavata dhammo</strong> -- the Dhamma
    is well-taught by the Blessed One.<br>
    <strong>Dhammam namassami</strong> -- To the Dhamma, I bow
    down.<br>
    (Bow down once.)</p>
    <p><strong>Supatipanno bhagavato savaka-sangho</strong> --
    The Community of the Blessed One's disciples have conducted
    themselves rightly.<br>
    <strong>Sangham namami</strong> -- To the Community, I bow
    down.<br>
    (Bow down once.)</p>
    <p><strong>Namo tassa bhagavato arahato samma-sambuddhassa.</strong>
    (Three times).</p>
    <p>(Think of the virtues of the Buddha, the foremost teacher
    of the world, released from suffering and defilement of every
    sort, always serene and secure.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then bow down
    three times.)</p>
    <p>Note:&nbsp;&nbsp; These preliminary steps are simply an
    example.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's nothing wrong with chanting more
    than this if you have more to chant, but you should bow down
    to the Buddha as the first step each time you meditate,
    unless the place in which you are meditating is unconducive.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <hr align="left" width="25%">
    <h3><font color="#800080">Practicing Meditation</font></h3>
    <p>Now, sit in meditation, your right leg on top of left,
    your hands palm-up in your lap, your right hand on top of
    your left.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sit straight.&nbsp;&nbsp; Repeat the
    word <em><strong>buddho</strong></em> in your mind, focusing
    your attention in the middle of your chest, at the
    heart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't let your attention stray out ahead
    or behind.&nbsp;&nbsp; Be mindful to keep your mind in place,
    steady in its one-pointedness, and you will enter into a
    state of concentration.</p>
    <p>When you enter into concentration, the mind may go so
    blank that you don't even know how long you are
    sitting.&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time you come out of
    concentration, many hours may have passed.&nbsp;&nbsp; For
    this reason, you shouldn't fix a time limit for yourself when
    sitting in meditation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let things follow their
    own course.</p>
    <p>The mind in true concentration is the mind in a state of <strong>one-
    pointedness</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the mind hasn't reached
    a state of one-pointedness, it isn't yet in concentration,
    because the true heart is only one.&nbsp;&nbsp; If there are
    many mental states going on, you haven't penetrated into the
    heart.&nbsp;&nbsp; You've only reached the mind.</p>
    <p>Before you practice meditation, you should first learn the
    difference between <strong>the heart</strong> and <strong>the
    mind</strong>, for they aren't the same thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The mind is what thinks and forms perceptions and ideas about
    all sorts of things.&nbsp;&nbsp; The heart is what simply
    stays still and knows that it is still, without forming any
    further thoughts at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; Their difference is like
    that between a river and waves on the river.</p>
    <p>All sciences and all defilements are able to arise because
    the mind thinks and forms ideas and strays out in search of
    them.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will be able to see these things
    clearly with your own heart once the mind becomes still and
    reaches the heart.</p>
    <p>Water is something clean and clear by its very
    nature.&nbsp;&nbsp; If anyone puts dye into the water, it
    will change in line with the dye.&nbsp;&nbsp; But once the
    water is filtered and distilled, it will become clean and
    clear as before.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an analogy for the heart
    and the mind.</p>
    <p>Actually, the Buddha taught that the mind is identical
    with the heart.&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is no heart, there is no
    mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; The mind is a condition.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    heart itself has no conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp; In practicing
    meditation, no matter what the teacher or method:&nbsp;&nbsp;
    If it's correct, it will have to penetrate into the heart.</p>
    <p>When you reach the heart, you will see all your
    defilements, because the mind gathers all defilements into
    itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; So now how you deal with them is up to
    you.</p>
    <p>When doctors are going to cure a disease, they first have
    to find the cause of the disease.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only then can
    they treat it with the right medicine.</p>
    <p>As we start meditating longer and longer, repeating <em><strong>buddho,
    buddho, buddho</strong></em>, the mind will gradually let go
    of its distractions and restlessness, and gather in to stay
    with <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will
    stay firm, with <em><strong>buddho</strong></em> its sole
    preoccupation, until you see that the state of mind which
    says <em><strong>buddho</strong></em> is identical with the
    mind itself at all times, regardless of whether you are
    sitting, standing, walking or lying down.&nbsp;&nbsp; No
    matter what your activity, you will see the mind bright and
    clear with <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once
    you have reached this stage, keep the mind there as long as
    you can.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't be in a hurry to want to see this
    or be that -- because desire is the most serious obstacle to
    the concentrated mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once desire arises, your
    concentration will immediately deteriorate, because the basis
    of your concentration -- <em><strong>buddho</strong></em> --
    isn't solid.&nbsp;&nbsp; When this happens, you can't grab
    hold of any foundation at all, and you get really
    upset.&nbsp;&nbsp; All you can think of is the state of
    concentration in which you used to be calm and happy, and
    this makes the mind even more agitated.</p>
    <p>Practice meditation the same way farmers grow
    rice.&nbsp;&nbsp; They're in no hurry.&nbsp;&nbsp; They
    scatter the seed, plow, harrow, plant the seedlings, step by
    step, without skipping any of the steps.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then
    they wait for the plants to grow.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even when they
    don't yet see the rice appearing, they are confident that the
    rice is sure to appear some day in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Once the rice appears, they are convinced that they're sure
    to reap results.&nbsp;&nbsp; They don't pull on the rice
    plants to make them come out with rice when they want
    it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyone who did that would end up with no
    results at all.</p>
    <p>The same holds true with meditation.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can't
    be in a hurry.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can't skip any of the
    steps.&nbsp;&nbsp; You have to make yourself firmly confident
    that, &quot;This is the meditation word which will make my
    mind concentrated for sure.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't have any
    doubts as to whether the meditation word is right for your
    temperament, and don't think that, &quot;That person used
    this meditation word with these or those results, but when I
    use it, my mind doesn't settle down.&nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn't
    work for me at all.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, if the mind
    is firmly set on the meditation word you are repeating, then
    no matter what the word, it's sure to work -- because you
    repeat the word simply to make the mind steady and firm,
    that's all.&nbsp;&nbsp; As for any results apart from that,
    they all depend on each person's individual potential and
    capabilities.</p>
    <p>Once in the Buddha's time there was a monk sitting in
    meditation near a pond who saw a heron diving down to catch
    fish and eat them.&nbsp;&nbsp; He took that as his meditation
    subject until he succeeded in becoming an
    arahant.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've never seen a heron eating fish
    mentioned as a subject in any of the meditation manuals, but
    he was able to use it to meditate until he attained
    arahantship -- which illustrates what I have just said.</p>
    <p>When the mind is intent on staying within the bounds of
    its meditation word <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>, with
    mindfulness in control, it is sure to grow out of its
    rebelliousness.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to train and restrain it,
    because we are looking for peace and contentment for the
    mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ordinarily, the mind tends to be
    preoccupied with looking for distraction, as I have already
    explained, and for the most part it strays off to this sort
    of distraction:&nbsp;&nbsp; When we start meditating <em><strong>buddho,
    buddho, buddho</strong></em>, as soon as we focus the mind on
    <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>, it won't stay
    there.&nbsp;&nbsp; It'll run out to think of whatever work we
    are about to start or have left undone.&nbsp;&nbsp; It thinks
    about doing this and doing that until it gets all worked up,
    afraid that the work won't come out well or won't
    succeed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The work we've been assigned by other
    people or which we're doing on our own will be a waste of
    time or will cause us to lose face if we don't do as we've
    been told....</p>
    <p>This is one of the distractions which prevent new
    meditators from attaining concentration.&nbsp;&nbsp; You have
    to pull your mind back to <em><strong>buddho, buddho, buddho</strong></em>,
    and tell yourself, &quot;Thoughts of this sort aren't the
    path to peace; the true path to peace is to keep the mind
    with <em><strong>buddho</strong></em> and nothing
    else&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- and then keep on repeating <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>,
    <em><strong>buddho, buddho</strong></em> ...</p>
    <p>After a moment, the mind will go straying out again, this
    time to your family -- your children, your wife or
    husband:&nbsp;&nbsp; How are they getting along?&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Are they healthy?&nbsp;&nbsp; Are they eating
    well?&nbsp;&nbsp; If you're far apart, you wonder about where
    they're staying, what they're eating.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who
    have left home think about those at home.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those
    at home think about those who have gone far away -- afraid
    that they aren't safe, that other people will molest them,
    that they have no friends, that they're lonely -- thinking in
    108 different ways, whatever the mind can imagine, all of
    which exaggerate the truth.</p>
    <p>Or if you're still young and single, you think about
    having fun with your friends -- the places you used to go
    together, the good times you had, the things you used to do
    -- to the point where you actually say something or laugh out
    loud.&nbsp;&nbsp; This sort of defilement is the worst of the
    bunch.</p>
    <p>When you are meditating <em><strong>buddho, buddho, buddho</strong></em>,
    your defilements see that the situation is getting out of
    hand and that you'll escape from their control, so they look
    for things to tie you down even more tightly all the
    time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Never from the day of your birth have you
    ever practiced concentration at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; You've
    simply let the mind follow the moods of the
    defilements.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only now have you begun to practice,
    so when you repeat <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>, <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>,
    <em><strong>buddho</strong></em> to get the mind to settle
    down with <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>, it's going to
    wriggle away in the same way that fish try to wriggle back
    into the water when they're tossed up on land.&nbsp;&nbsp; So
    you have to pull the mind back to <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Buddho</strong></em> is something cool and
    calm.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's the path for giving rise to peace and
    contentment -- the only path that will release us from the
    suffering and stress in this world.</p>
    <p>So you pull the mind back to <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This time it begins to settle down.&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as
    you feel that it's staying put, you begin to get a sense that
    when the mind stays put, it is rested and at ease in a way
    different from when it's not still, when it's restless and
    upset.&nbsp;&nbsp; You make up your mind to be careful and
    alert to keep the mind in that state
    and.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oops.&nbsp;&nbsp; There it
    goes again.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it's taking your financial
    interests as an excuse, saying that if you don't do this or
    search for that, you'll miss out on a really great
    opportunity.&nbsp;&nbsp; So you focus your mind on that
    instead of your meditation word.&nbsp;&nbsp; As for where <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>
    has gone, you haven't the least idea.&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time
    you realize that <em><strong>buddho</strong></em> has
    disappeared, it's already too late -- which is why they say
    that the mind is restless, slippery and hard to control, like
    a monkey which can never sit still.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, after you've been sitting in meditation a long
    time, you begin to worry that your blood won't be flowing
    properly, that your nerves will die from lack of blood, that
    you'll grow numb and end up paralyzed.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you're
    meditating far from home or in a forest, it's even
    worse:&nbsp;&nbsp; You're afraid that snakes will bite you,
    tigers will eat you, or ghosts will haunt you, making all
    kinds of scary faces.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your fear of death can
    whisper to you in all sorts of way, all of which are simply
    instances of you yourself scaring yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    truth is nothing at all like what you imagine.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Never from the day of your birth have you ever seen a tiger
    eat even a single person.&nbsp;&nbsp; You've never once seen
    a ghost -- you don't even know what it would look like, but
    you fashion up pictures to scare yourself.</p>
    <p>The obstacles to meditation mentioned here are simply
    examples.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are actually many, many
    more.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who meditate will find this out for
    themselves.</p>
    <p>If you hold <em><strong>buddho</strong></em> close to the
    heart, and use your mindfulness to keep the mind with nothing
    but <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>, no dangers will come
    your way.&nbsp;&nbsp; So have firm faith in <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>.&nbsp;
    &nbsp; I guarantee that there will be no dangers at all --
    unless you've done bad kamma in the past, which is something
    beyond anyone's power to protect you from.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even
    the Buddha himself can't protect you from it.</p>
    <p>When people begin meditating, their confidence tends to be
    weak.&nbsp;&nbsp; No matter what their meditation subject,
    these sorts of defilements are sure to interfere, because
    these defilements form the basis of the world and of the
    mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; The minute we meditate and make the mind
    one-pointed, the defilements see that we're going to get away
    from them, so they come thronging around so that we won't be
    able to escape from the world.</p>
    <p>When we see how really serious and harmful they are, we
    should make our minds forthright and our confidence solid and
    strong, telling ourselves that we've let ourselves be
    deceived into believing the defilements for many lifetimes;
    it's time now that we be willing to believe the Buddha's
    teachings and take <em><strong>buddho</strong></em> as our
    refuge.&nbsp;&nbsp; We then make mindfulness solid, and fix
    the mind firmly in <strong>buddho</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; We
    give our lives to <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>, and won't
    let our minds slip away from it.&nbsp;&nbsp; When we make
    this sort of commitment, the mind will drop straight into
    one-pointedness and enter concentration.</p>
    <p>When you first enter concentration, this is what it's
    like:&nbsp;&nbsp; You'll have no idea at all of what
    concentration or one-pointedness of mind is going to feel
    like.&nbsp;&nbsp; You are simply intent on keeping
    mindfulness firmly focused on one object -- and the power of
    a mind focused firmly on one object is what will bring you to
    a state of concentration.&nbsp;&nbsp; You won't be thinking
    at all that concentration will be like this or like that, or
    that you want it to be like this or like that.&nbsp;&nbsp; It
    will simply take its own way, automatically.&nbsp;&nbsp; No
    one can force it.</p>
    <p>At that moment you will feel as if you are in another
    world (the world of the mind), with a sense of ease and
    solitude to which nothing else in the world can
    compare.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the mind withdraws from
    concentration, you will regret that that mood has passed, and
    you will remember it clearly.&nbsp;&nbsp; All that we say
    about concentration comes from the mind which has withdrawn
    from that state.&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as it is still gathered
    in that state, we aren't interested in what anyone else says
    or does.</p>
    <p>You have to train the mind to enter this sort of
    concentration often, so as to become skilled and adept, but
    don't try to remember your past states of concentration, and
    don't let yourself want your concentration to be like it was
    before -- because it won't be that way, and you will just be
    making more trouble for yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Simply
    contemplate <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>, <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>,
    and keep your mind with your mental repetition.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    What it does then is its own business.</p>
    <p>After the mind has first attained to concentration, it
    won't be the same way the next time around, but don't worry
    about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever it's like, don't worry about
    it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just make sure that you get it
    centered.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the results come out in many
    different ways, your understanding will broaden and you'll
    come to develop many different techniques for dealing with
    the mind.</p>
    <p>What I've mentioned here is simply to be taken as an
    example.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you follow these instructions,
    don't give them too much weight, or they will turn into
    allusions to the past, and your meditation won't get
    anywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp; Simply remember them as something to
    use for the sake of comparison after your meditation has
    begun to progress.</p>
    <p>No matter what method you use -- <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>,
    <em><strong>rising &amp; falling</strong></em> or <em><strong>samma
    araham</strong></em> -- when the mind is about to settle down
    in concentration, you won't be thinking that the mind is
    about to settle down, or is settling down, or anything at
    all.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will settle down automatically on its
    own.&nbsp;&nbsp; You won't even know when you let go of your
    meditation word.&nbsp;&nbsp; The mind will simply have a
    separate calm and peace which isn't in this world or another
    world or anything of the sort.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's no one and
    nothing at all, just the mind's own separate state, which is
    called the world of the mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; In that state there
    won't be the word 'world' or anything else.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    conventional realities of the world won't appear there, and
    thus no insight of any sort will arise in there at
    all.&nbsp;&nbsp; The point is simply that you train the mind
    to be centered, and then compare it to the state of mind
    which isn't centered so that you can see how they differ, how
    the mind which has attained concentration and then withdraws
    to contemplate matters of the world and the Dhamma differs
    from the mind which hasn't attained concentration.</p>
    <p>The heart and the mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's talk some more
    about the heart and mind so that you'll
    understand.&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, we're talking about
    training the mind in concentration:&nbsp;&nbsp; If you don't
    understand the relationship between the heart and the mind,
    you won't know where or how to practice concentration.</p>
    <p>Everyone born -- human or animal -- has a heart and mind,
    but the heart and mind have different duties.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    mind thinks, wanders and forms ideas of all sorts, in line
    with where the defilements lead it.&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the
    heart, it's simply what knows.&nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn't form
    any ideas at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's neutral -- in the middle
    -- with regard to everything.&nbsp; &nbsp; The awareness
    which is neutral:&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the heart.</p>
    <p>The heart doesn't have a body.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a mental
    phenomenon.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's simply awareness.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    You can place it anywhere at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn't lie
    inside or outside the body.&nbsp;&nbsp; When we call the
    heart-muscle the heart, that's not the true
    heart.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's simply an organ for pumping blood
    throughout the body so as to keep it alive.&nbsp;&nbsp; If
    the heart-muscle doesn't pump blood throughout the body, life
    can't last.</p>
    <p>People in general are always talking about the
    heart:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;My heart feels happy... sad...
    heavy... light... down...&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything is a
    matter of the heart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Abhidhamma experts, however,
    speak in terms of the mind:&nbsp;&nbsp; the mind in a
    wholesome state, the mind in an unwholesome state, the mind
    in a neutral state, the mind on the level of form, the mind
    on the formless level, the mind on the transcendent level and
    so on, but none of them know what the real heart and mind are
    like.</p>
    <p>The mind is what thinks and forms ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp; It
    has to make use of the six senses as its tools.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As soon as the eye sees a visual object, the ear hears a
    sound, the nose smells an aroma, the tongue tastes a flavor,
    the body comes into contact with a tactile sensation -- cold,
    hot, hard or soft -- or the intellect thinks of an idea in
    line with its defilements, good or bad:&nbsp;&nbsp; If any of
    these things are good, the mind is pleased; if they're bad,
    it's displeased.&nbsp;&nbsp; All of this is an affair of the
    mind, or of defilement.&nbsp;&nbsp; Aside from these six
    senses, there's nothing the mind can make use of.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In the texts they are analyzed into the six faculties, the
    six elements, the six forms of contact, and all sorts of
    other things, but all these things lie within the six
    senses.&nbsp;&nbsp; So these are characteristics of the
    mind:&nbsp;&nbsp; that which can never sit still.</p>
    <p>When you train the mind -- or, in other words, practice
    concentration -- you have to get control over the mind which
    is wriggling after the six senses, as already explained, and
    make it stop still with one thing:&nbsp;&nbsp; its meditation
    word, <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't let
    it go straying out ahead or behind.&nbsp;&nbsp; Make it stay
    still, and know that it's staying still:&nbsp;&nbsp; That's
    the heart.&nbsp;&nbsp; The heart has nothing to do with any
    of the six senses, which is why it's called the heart.</p>
    <p>When people in general talk about the heart of something,
    they are referring to its center.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even when they
    talk about their own hearts, they point to the center of the
    chest.&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, the heart doesn't lie in any
    particular place at all -- as I have already explained --
    although it lies right in the center of everything.</p>
    <p>If you want to understand what the heart is, you can try
    an experiment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Breathe in deeply and hold your
    breath for a moment.&nbsp;&nbsp; At that point there won't be
    anything at all except for one thing:&nbsp;&nbsp; neutral
    awareness.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the heart, or 'what
    knows'.&nbsp;&nbsp; But if you try to catch hold of the heart
    in this way, you can't hold on to it for very long -- only as
    long as you can hold your breath -- but you can give it a try
    just to see what the true heart is like.</p>
    <p>(Holding the breath can help reduce physical
    pain.&nbsp;&nbsp; People who are suffering from great pain
    have to hold their breath as one way -- fairly effective --
    of relieving their pain.)</p>
    <p>Once you realize that the heart and mind have different
    duties and characteristics like this, you'll find it easier
    to train the mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, the heart and the
    mind are really the same thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Buddha
    said, the mind is identical with the heart.&nbsp;&nbsp; When
    we practice concentration, it's enough just to train the
    mind; once the mind is trained, that's where we'll see the
    heart.</p>
    <p>Once the mind has been fully trained by using mindfulness
    to keep it with <em><strong>buddho</strong></em> as its only
    preoccupation, it won't go straying after different things,
    and instead will gather into oneness.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    meditation word will disappear without your being aware of
    it, and you will feel a sense of peace and ease which nothing
    else can equal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who have never experienced
    this ease before, when they first experience it, won't be
    able to describe it, because no one else in the world has
    ever experienced that kind of peace and ease.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Even though other people have experienced it, it's not the
    same.&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason, you find it hard to
    describe -- although you can describe it to
    yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you try to describe it to others,
    you have to use similes and analogies before they'll
    understand you.&nbsp;&nbsp; Things of this sort are
    personal:&nbsp;&nbsp; Only you can know them for yourself.</p>
    <p>In addition, if you have developed a lot of potential in
    previous lifetimes, all sorts of amazing things can
    happen.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, you may gain knowledge of
    heavenly beings or hungry ghosts.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may learn
    about your own past and future, and that of other
    people:&nbsp;&nbsp; In that particular lifetime you were like
    this; in the future you'll be like that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even
    though you didn't intend to know these things, when the mind
    attains concentration it can know on its own in a very
    amazing way.</p>
    <p>This sort of thing is something which really fascinates
    beginning meditators.&nbsp;&nbsp; When it happens to them,
    they like to brag to other people.&nbsp;&nbsp; When those
    people try to meditate, but don't get the knowledge or
    abilities, they become discouraged, thinking that they don't
    have the merit or potential to meditate, and they begin to
    lose faith in the practice.</p>
    <p>As for those who see these sorts of things, when that
    knowledge or ability deteriorates -- because they've been
    carried away by external things, and haven't taken the heart
    as their foundation -- they won't be able to grab hold of
    anything at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; When they think of the things
    they used to know, their minds become even more stirred
    up.&nbsp;&nbsp; People who like to brag will take the old
    things they used to see and talk about them in glowing
    terms.&nbsp;&nbsp; Avid listeners really love to listen to
    this sort of thing, but avid meditators are unimpressed --
    because true meditators like to listen only to things which
    are present and true.</p>
    <p>The Buddha taught that whether his teachings will flourish
    or degenerate depends on those who practice them.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The teachings degenerate when meditators get just a little
    bit of knowledge and then go bragging to other people,
    talking about external matters with no substance at all,
    instead of explaining the basic principles of
    meditation.&nbsp;&nbsp; When they do this, they make the
    religion degenerate without their even realizing it.</p>
    <p>Those who make the religion flourish are those who speak
    about things which are useful and true.&nbsp;&nbsp; They
    don't speak just for the fun of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; They speak in
    terms of cause and effect: &quot;When you meditate like this,
    repeating the meditation word in this way, it will make the
    mind gather into one and snuff out its defilements and
    restlessness like this....&quot;</p>
    <p>When you meditate on <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>, be
    patient.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't be in a hurry.&nbsp;&nbsp; Be
    confident in your meditation word, and use mindfulness to
    keep the mind with its <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Your confidence is what will make the mind firm and
    unwavering, able to let go of all its doubts and
    uncertainties.&nbsp;&nbsp; The mind will gather in on its
    meditation word, and mindfulness will keep it solely with <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>
    at all times.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether you sit, stand, walk, lie
    down, or whatever work you do, mindfulness will be alert to
    nothing but <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; If
    your mindfulness is still weak, and your techniques still
    few, you have to hold on to <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>
    as your foundation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise your meditation
    won't progress; or even if it does progress, it won't have
    any foundation.</p>
    <p>For concentration to be strong, the mind has to be
    resolute.&nbsp;&nbsp; When mindfulness is strong and the mind
    resolute, you decide that this is what you want:&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;If I can't catch hold of <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>,
    or see <em><strong>buddho</strong></em> in my heart, or get
    the mind to stay put solely with <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>,
    I won't get up from my meditation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if my
    life will end, I don't care.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you do
    this, the mind will gather into one faster than you realize
    it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The meditation word <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>,
    or whatever it is that may have been bothering or perplexing
    you, will vanish in the flash of an eye.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even
    your body, which you have been attached to for so long, won't
    appear to you.&nbsp;&nbsp; All that remains is the heart --
    simple awareness -- cool, calm and at ease.</p>
    <p>People who practice meditation really like it when this
    happens.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next time around, they want it to
    happen again, and so it doesn't happen again.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That's because the desire keeps it from
    happening.&nbsp;&nbsp; Concentration is something very subtle
    and sensitive.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can't force it to be like this
    or that -- and at the same time you can't force the mind not
    to enter concentration either.</p>
    <p>If you're impatient, things get even more fouled
    up.&nbsp;&nbsp; You have to be very patient.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Whether or not the mind is going to attain concentration,
    you've meditated on <em><strong>buddho</strong></em> in the
    past, so you just keep meditating on <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Act as if you had never meditated on <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>
    before.&nbsp;&nbsp; Make the mind neutral and even, let the
    breath flow gently, and use mindfulness to focus the mind on <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>
    and nothing else.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the time comes for the
    mind to enter concentration, it will do it on its
    own.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can't arrange the way it will
    happen.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it were something you could arrange,
    all the people in the world would have become arahants long
    ago.</p>
    <p>Knowing how to meditate, but not doing it right; having
    done it right once, and wanting it to be that way again, and
    yet it doesn't happen: All of these things are obstacles in
    practicing concentration.</p>
    <p>In meditating on <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>, you
    have to get so that you are quick and adept.&nbsp;&nbsp; When
    a good or a bad mood strikes you, you have to be able to
    enter concentration immediately.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't let the
    mind be affected by that mood.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever you think
    of <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>, the mind gathers
    immediately:&nbsp;&nbsp; When you can do this, your mind will
    be solid and able to rely on itself.</p>
    <p>When you have practiced so that you are adept and
    experienced in this way, after a while you will find that
    your defilements and attachments to all things will gradually
    disappear on their own.&nbsp;&nbsp; You don't have to go
    clearing away this or that defilement, telling yourself that
    this or that defilement has to be removed with this or that
    teaching or this or that method.&nbsp;&nbsp; Be content with
    whatever method you find works for you.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's
    plenty enough.</p>
    <p>To have the defilements gradually disappear with the
    method I've just explained is better than trying to arrange
    things, entering the four levels of absorption, sustained
    thought, rapture and pleasure, leaving just one-pointedness
    and equanimity; or trying to arrange the first stage of the
    path to nibbana by abandoning self-identity views,
    uncertainty and attachment to precepts &amp; practices; or by
    looking at your various defilements, telling yourself,
    &quot;With that defilement, I was able to contemplate in
    such-and-such a way, so I've gone beyond that
    defilement.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have so-and-so many defilements
    left.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I can contemplate in such-and-such a
    way, my defilements will be finished&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- but
    you don't realize that the state of mind which wants to see
    and know and attain these things is a defilement fixed firmly
    in the mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you finish your contemplation,
    the mind is back in its original state, and hasn't gained
    anything at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; On top of that, if someone comes
    along and says something which goes against the way you see
    things, you start disagreeing violently, like a burning fire
    into which someone pours kerosene.</p>
    <p>So hold firmly to your meditation word, <em><strong>buddho</strong></em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Even if you don't attain anything else, at least you've got
    your meditation word as your foundation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    various preoccupations of the mind will lessen, or may even
    disappear, which is better than not having any foundation to
    hold to at all.</p>
    <p>Actually, all meditators have to hold firmly to their
    meditation word.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only then can they be said to be
    meditation with a foundation.&nbsp;&nbsp; When their
    meditation deteriorates, they'll be able to use it as
    something to hold to.</p>
    <p>The Buddha taught that people who make the effort to
    abandon defilement have to act like old-time
    warriors.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past, they'd have to build a
    fortress with strong walls, moats, gates and towers to
    protect themselves from enemy attack.&nbsp;&nbsp; When an
    intelligent warrior went out to battle and saw that he was no
    match for the enemy, he would retreat into his fortress and
    defend it so that the enemy couldn't destroy it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    At the same time, he would gather enough troops, weapons and
    food (i.e., make his concentration forthright and strong) and
    then go out to resume his fight with the enemy (i.e., all the
    forms of defilement).</p>
    <p>Concentration is a very important strength.&nbsp;&nbsp; If
    you don't have concentration, where will your discernment
    gain any strength?&nbsp;&nbsp; The discernment of insight
    meditation is not something that can be fashioned into being
    by arrangement.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, it arises from
    concentration which has been mastered until it is good and
    solid.</p>
    <p>Even those who are said to attain Awakening with &quot;<strong>dry
    insight</strong>&quot;:&nbsp;&nbsp; If they don't have any
    mental stillness, where will they get any insight? It's
    simply that their stillness isn't fully mastered.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Only when we put the matter this way does it make any sense.</p>
    <p>When your concentration is solid and steady to the point
    where you can enter and leave it at will, you will be able to
    stay with it long and contemplate the body in terms of its
    unattractiveness, or in terms of its physical
    elements.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, if you like, you can contemplate
    the people of the world until you see them all as skeletons,
    or you can contemplate the entire world as empty space....</p>
    <p>Once the mind is fully centered, then no matter whether
    you are sitting, standing, walking or lying down, the mind
    will be centered at times.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will be able to
    see clearly how your own defilements -- greed, anger and
    delusion, which arise from the mind -- arise from this and
    that cause, how they remain in this or that way, and you will
    be able to find means to abandon them with this or that
    technique.</p>
    <p>This is like the water in a lake which has been muddy for
    hundreds and hundreds of years suddenly becoming clear so
    that you can see all the things lying along the lake-bottom
    -- things which you never dreamed were there
    before.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is called insight -- seeing things
    as they truly are.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever sort of truth they
    have, that's the truth you see, without deviating from that
    truth.</p>
    <p>Forcing the mind to be still can make it let go of
    defilement, but it lets go in the same way a person cuts
    grass, cutting just the part above ground, without digging up
    the roots.&nbsp;&nbsp; The roots are sure to send up new
    shoots when rain falls again.&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, you
    do see the harm of the preoccupations which arise from the
    six senses, but as soon as you see it, you retreat into
    stillness without contemplating those preoccupations as
    carefully as you do when the mind is in
    concentration.&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, you simply want
    stillness, without wanting to spend any time in contemplation
    -- like a ground lizard which relies on its hole for
    safety.&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as it sees an enemy coming, it
    runs into its hole, escaping danger only for a while.</p>
    <p>If you want to uproot your defilements, then when you see
    that defilement springs from the six senses -- for instance,
    the eye sees a visual object or the ear hears a sound,
    contact is made which causes you to be pleased or displeased,
    happy or sad, and then you grasp onto it as your
    preoccupation, making the mind murky, disturbed and upset,
    sometimes to the point where you can't eat or sleep, and can
    even commit suicide -- when you see this clearly, make your
    concentration firm and then focus your mind exclusively on
    examining that particular preoccupation.&nbsp;&nbsp; For
    instance, if the eye sees an attractive visual object which
    makes you feel pleased, focus on examining just that sense of
    pleasure, to find out whether it arises from the eye or from
    the visual object.</p>
    <p>If you examine the visual object, you see that it's just a
    physical phenomenon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it's good or bad, it
    doesn't try to persuade you to be pleased or displeased, or
    to make you love it or hate it.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's simply a
    visual object which appears and then disappears in line with
    its own nature.</p>
    <p>When you turn to examine the eye which sees the visual
    object, you find that the eye goes looking for objects and,
    as soon as it finds one, light gets reflected into the optic
    nerves so that all kinds of visible forms appear.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The eye doesn't try to persuade you to be pleased or
    displeased, to love or to hate anything.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its duty
    is simply to see.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once it has seen a visible
    form, the form disappears.</p>
    <p>As for the other senses and their objects, attractive or
    unattractive, they should be examined in just the same way.</p>
    <p>When you contemplate in this way, you will see clearly
    that all the things in the world which become objects of
    defilement do so because of these six senses.&nbsp;&nbsp; If
    you contemplate the six senses so that you don't tag along
    after them, defilements won't arise within you.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    On the contrary:&nbsp;&nbsp; Insight and discernment will
    arise instead, all because of these same six
    senses.&nbsp;&nbsp; The six senses are the media of goodness
    and evil.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will head for a good or a bad
    destination in the next life because of the way we use them.</p>
    <p>The world seems broad because the mind isn't centered, and
    is left free to wander among the objects of the six
    senses.&nbsp;&nbsp; The world will narrow down when the mind
    has been trained in concentration so that it lies under your
    control and can contemplate the six senses exclusively within
    it.&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, when the mind is fully
    concentrated, the outer senses -- the eye seeing forms, the
    ear hearing sounds and so on -- won't appear at
    all.&nbsp;&nbsp; All that will appear are the forms and
    sounds which are mental phenomena present exclusively in that
    concentration.&nbsp;&nbsp; You won't be paying any attention
    to the outer senses at all.</p>
    <p>When your concentration is fully solid and strong, you
    will be able to contemplate this world of the mind which
    gives rise to sensory contact, perceptions, preoccupations
    and all defilements.&nbsp;&nbsp; The mind will withdraw from
    everything leaving just the heart, or simple awareness.</p>
    <p>The heart and the mind have different
    characteristics.&nbsp;&nbsp; The mind is what thinks, forming
    perceptions and preoccupations to the point of latching on
    holding them to itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; When it sees the
    suffering, harm and stress which come from holding onto all
    the defilements, it will go and withdraw from all
    preoccupations and defilements.&nbsp;&nbsp; The mind will
    then be the heart.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is how the heart and mind
    differ.</p>
    <p>The heart is what is neutral and still.&nbsp;&nbsp; It
    doesn't think anything at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is simply aware
    of its stillness.&nbsp;&nbsp; The heart is a genuinely
    neutral or central phenomenon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Neutral with no
    past, no future, no good, no evil:&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the
    heart.&nbsp;&nbsp; When we talk about the heart of anything,
    we mean its center.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the human heart, which
    is a mental phenomenon, we say lies in the center of the
    chest.&nbsp;&nbsp; But where the real heart is, we don't
    know.&nbsp;&nbsp; Try focusing your attention on any part of
    the body, and you'll feel the awareness of that
    spot.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or you can focus your attention outside the
    body -- on a post or the wall of a house, for example -- and
    that's the spot you'll be aware of.</p>
    <p>So we can conclude that the true heart is still and
    neutral awareness.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherever there is neutral
    awareness, that's where the heart is.</p>
    <p>When people in general talk about the heart, that's not
    the true heart.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's simply a set of muscles and
    valves for pumping blood throughout the body to keep it
    alive.&nbsp;&nbsp; If this pump doesn't send blood throughout
    the body, the body can't live.&nbsp;&nbsp; It'll have to
    die.&nbsp;&nbsp; The same holds true with the
    brain.&nbsp;&nbsp; The mind thinks of good and evil by using
    the brain as its tool.&nbsp;&nbsp; The nervous system of the
    brain is a physical phenomenon.&nbsp;&nbsp; When its various
    causal factors are cut off, this physical phenomenon can't
    last.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has to stop.</p>
    <p>But as for the mind, which is a mental phenomenon,
    Buddhism teaches that it continues to exist and can take
    birth again.&nbsp;&nbsp; This mental phenomenon will stop
    only when insight discerns its causal factors and uproots
    their underlying causes.</p>
    <p>None of the various subjects and sciences of the world
    have an end point.&nbsp;&nbsp; The more you study them, the
    more they fan out.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only Buddhism can teach you to
    reach an end.&nbsp; &nbsp; In the first stage, it teaches you
    to acquaint yourself with your body, to see how it is made up
    of various things (the 32 parts) put together, and what their
    duties are.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, Buddhism teaches
    you to see that the body is inherently
    unattractive.&nbsp;&nbsp; It teaches you to acquaint yourself
    with this world (the world of a human being), which is made
    up of suffering and stress, and which will ultimately have to
    fall apart by its very nature.</p>
    <p>So now that we have received this body -- even though it
    is full of foul and unattractive things, and even though it
    is made up of all kinds of suffering and stress -- we're
    still able to depend on it for a while, so we should use it
    to do good to repay our debts to the world before we leave it
    at death.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The Buddha teaches that although the nature of a person
    (this world) is to fall apart and die, the mind -- the
    overseer of this world -- must come back to be reborn as long
    as it still has defilements.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus he teaches us
    to practice concentration, which is an affair exclusively of
    the mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once we have practiced concentration,
    we will fell every sensory contact inside, just at the
    mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; We won't be concerned with out seeing and
    hearing at the eye or the ear.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, we will
    be aware of the sensory contact right at the
    mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is what it means to narrow down the
    world.</p>
    <p>The senses are the best means for taking the measure of
    your own mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; When sensory contact strikes the
    mind, does it have an impact on you?&nbsp;&nbsp; If it has a
    lot of impact, that shows that your mindfulness is weak, and
    your foundation is still shaky.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it has only a
    little impact, or no impact at all, that shows that your
    mindfulness is strong, and you are fully able to care for
    yourself.</p>
    <p>These things are like Devadatta, who created trouble for
    the Bodhisattva all along.&nbsp;&nbsp; If not for Devadatta,
    the Bodhisattva wouldn't have been able to bring his
    character to full perfection.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once his character
    had been fully perfected, he was able to gain Awakening and
    become the Buddha.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before gaining Awakening, he
    had to withstand the massive armies of temptation; and right
    after his Awakening, the three daughters of temptation came
    to test him once more.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, the people of
    the world have praised him ever since for having conquered
    defilement in this world once and for all.</p>
    <p>As long as the inner senses still exist, mental contact is
    still a preoccupation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus those who know,
    having seen the harm of these things, are willing to withdraw
    from them, leaving just the heart which is
    neutral...neutral...neutral, with no thinking, no imagining,
    no fashioning of anything at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; When this is
    the case, where will this world be formed?&nbsp;&nbsp; This
    is how the Buddha teaches us to reach the world's end.</p>
