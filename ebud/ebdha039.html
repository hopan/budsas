<LI>Buddhism is an education, not a religion. We do not worship
the Buddha, we respect him as a teacher. His teaching enable us
to leave suffering and attain true happiness.
<LI>We should treat all people with respect and sincerity. We
must be responsible for our actions and must be careful when handling
others' properties. Be conservative in speech and actions to avoid
harming others.
<LI>We should show our gratitude to those who have shown us kindness,
such as parents, teachers, and even the society. Everyone in the
society is interdependent and inter-related, we should practice
good deeds to repay them.
<LI>How many people recognize the kindness shown by parents? Usually,
people do not realize until they themselves become parents or
lose their parents. We should show our gratitude through practicing
filial piety by being responsible, considerate, and obedient to
our parents.
<LI>To be a poor, contented, and happy person is better than being
one who is rich, worried, and afflicted with greed.
<LI>True love is undiscriminating, unattaching, and unconditional.
We should show this love with all beings. This is called compassion.
<LI>If we wish to bring peace to the world, we must start by changing
our evil ways. World peace stems from inner peace.
<LI>Our goal in studying the Buddha's teachings and cultivation
is to attain complete understanding of life and the universe.
<LI>Be considerate and kind in your speech. To put down another
person is only proving your own arrogance and lack of self-confidence
to others.
<LI>Life is short and fragile. Why not cultivate kindness instead
of committing acts which cause harm to living beings?
<LI>Practicing virtue is to keep a kind heart, speak kind words,
and do kind acts to benefit others.
<LI>Wise persons do not harbor feelings of gain or loss. In this
way, they constantly dwell in the joy of possessing great peace
of mind.
<LI>The point of practicing giving and charity is to forsake greed,
hatred, ignorance, and arrogance.
<LI>When helping others, we should think about benefiting the
entire society or even the world instead of limiting our help
to just the ones we love. Expanding the boundaries of our care
for others makes our life more meaningful, full of freedom and
happiness.
<LI>The Buddha's teachings are a teaching of wisdom. Living Buddhism
is to fill our life with utmost wisdom and happiness.
<LI>In all circumstances, we must first reflect upon ourselves.
Do not give to others what you yourself do not desire. This helps
us to keep a humane and sincere heart. If we want others to smile
at us, we must first smile at others. In dealing with matters
in life, we must not seek personal gain but should work for the
public welfare.
<LI>A true Dhamma practiser does not see the faults of others.
When we think of others' faults, it becomes our own affliction.
Everyone has their good and bad sides, but we must learn to look
at the good points of others, and strive to respect all beings.
