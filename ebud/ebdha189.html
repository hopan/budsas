    <p><font FACE="Times New Roman">Taking fish and meat by itself does not make a man become
    impure. A man makes himself impure by bigotry, deceit, envy, self-exaltation,
    disparagement and other evil intentions. Through his own evil thoughts and actions, man
    makes himself impure. There is no strict rule in Buddhism that the followers of the Buddha
    should not take fish and meat. The only advice given by the Buddha is that they should not
    be involved in killing intentionally or they should not ask others to kill any living
    being for them. However, those who take vegetable food and abstain from animal flesh are
    praiseworthy.</font> </p>
    <p><font FACE="Times New Roman">Though the Buddha did not advocate vegetarianism for the
    monks, He did advise the monks to avoid taking ten kinds of meat for their self respect
    and protection. They are: humans, elephants, horses, dogs, snakes, lions, tigers,
    leopards, bears hyenas. Some animals attack people when they smell the flesh of their own
    kind. (<em>Vinaya Pitaka</em>)</font> </p>
    <p><font FACE="Times New Roman">When the Buddha was asked to introduce vegetarianism
    amongst His disciples, the Buddha refused to do so. As Buddhism is a free religion, His
    advice was to leave the decision regarding vegetarianism to the individual disciple. It
    clearly shows that the Buddha had not considered this as a very important religious
    observance. The Buddha did not mention anything about vegetarianism for the lay Buddhists
    in His Teaching.</font> </p>
    <p><font><font FACE="Times New Roman">Jivaka Komarabhacca, the doctor, discussed this
    controversial issue with the Buddha: </font>'<font FACE="Times New Roman">Lord, I have
    heard that animals are slaughtered on purpose for the recluse Gotama, and that the recluse
    Gotama knowingly eats the meat killed on purpose for him. Lord, do those who say animals
    are slaughtered on purpose for the recluse Gotama, and the recluse Gotama knowingly eats
    the meat killed on purpose for. Do they falsely accuse the Buddha? Or do they speak the
    truth? Are your declaration and supplementary declarations not thus subject to be
    ridiculed by others in any manner?</font>'</font> </p>
    <p><font>'<font FACE="Times New Roman">Jivaka, those who say: </font>'<font
    FACE="Times New Roman">Animals are slaughtered on purpose for the recluse Gotama, and the
    recluse Gotama knowingly eats the meat killed on purpose for him</font>'<font
    FACE="Times New Roman">, do not say according to what I have declared, and they falsely
    accuse me. Jivaka, I have declared that one should not make use of meat it is seen, heard
    or suspected to have been killed on purpose for a monk. I allow the monks meat that is
    quite pure in three respects: if it is not seen, heard or suspected to have been killed on
    purpose for a monk.' (Jivaka Sutta)</font></font> </p>
    <p><font><font FACE="Times New Roman">In certain countries, the followers of the Mahayana
    school of Buddhism are strict vegetarians. While appreciating their observance in the name
    of religion, we should like to point out that they should not condemn those who are not
    vegetarians. They must remember that there is no precept in the original Teachings of the
    Buddha that requires all Buddhists to be vegetarians. We must realize that Buddhism is
    known as the Middle Path. It is a liberal religion and the Buddha</font>'<font
    FACE="Times New Roman">s advice was that it is not necessary to go to extremes to practise
    His Teachings.</font></font> </p>
    <p><font FACE="Times New Roman">Vegetarianism alone does not help a man to cultivate his
    humane qualities. There are kind, humble, polite and religious people amongst
    non-vegetarians. Therefore, one should not condone the statement that a pure, religious
    man<i> must</i> practise vegetarianism.</font> </p>
    <p><font FACE="Times New Roman">On the other hand, if anybody thinks that people cannot
    have a healthy life without taking fish and meat, it does not necessarily follow that they
    are correct since there are millions of pure vegetarians all over the world who are
    stronger and healthier than the meat-eaters.</font> </p>
    <p><font FACE="Times New Roman">People who criticize Buddhists who eat meat do not
    understand the Buddhist attitude towards food. A living being needs nourishment. We eat to
    live. As such a human being should supply his body with the food it needs to keep him
    healthy and to give him energy to work. However, as a result of increasing wealth, more
    and more people, especially in developed countries, eat simply to satisfy their palates.
    If one craves after any kind of food, or kills to satisfy his greed for meat, this is
    wrong. But if one eats without greed and without directly being involved in the act of
    killing but merely to sustain the physical body, he is practising self restraint.</font>
