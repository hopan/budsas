        <p><em>(A Discourse delivered to the assembly of Western
        Monks, Novices and Lay-disciples at Bung Wai Forest
        Monastery, Ubon, on 10th October, 1977. This Discourse

        occasion of their visit from France.) </em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I am happy that you have taken this opportunity to come
    and visit Wat Pah Pong, and to see your son who is a monk
    here, however I'm sorry I have no gift to offer you. France
    already has so many material things, but of Dhamma there's
    very little. Having been there and seen for myself, there
    isn't really any Dhamma there which could lead to peace and
    tranquillity. There are only things which continually make
    one's mind confused and troubled. </p>
    <p>France is already materially prosperous, it has so many
    things to offer which are sensually enticing -- sights,
    sounds, smells, tastes and textures. However, people ignorant
    of Dhamma only become confused by them. So today I will offer
    you some Dhamma to take back to France as a gift from Wat Pah
    Pong and Wat Pah Nanachat. </p>
    <p>What is Dhamma? Dhamma is that which can cut through the
    problems and difficulties of mankind, gradually reducing them
    to nothing. That's what is called Dhamma and that's what
    should be studied throughout our daily lives so that when
    some mental impression arises in us, we'll be able to deal
    with it and go beyond it. </p>
    <p>Problems are common to us all whether living here in
    Thailand or in other countries. If we don't know how to solve
    them, we'll always be subject to suffering and distress. That
    which solves problems is wisdom and to have wisdom we must
    develop and train the mind. </p>
    <p>The subject of practice isn't far away at all, it's right
    here in our body and mind. Westerners and Thais are the same,
    they both have a body and mind. A confused body and mind
    means a confused person and a peaceful body and mind, a
    peaceful person. </p>
    <p>Actually, the mind, like rain water, is pure in its
    natural state. If we were to drop green coloring into clear
    rain water, however, it would turn green. If yellow coloring
    it would turn yellow. </p>
    <p>The mind reacts similarly. When a comfortable mental
    impression &quot;drops&quot; into the mind, the mind is
    comfortable. When the mental impression is uncomfortable, the
    mind is uncomfortable. The mind becomes &quot;cloudy&quot;
    just like the colored water. </p>
    <p>When clear water contacts yellow, it turns yellow. When it
    contacts green, it turns green. It will change color every
    time. Actually, that water which is green or yellow is
    naturally clean and clear. This is also the natural state of
    the mind, clean and pure and unconfused. It becomes confused
    only because it pursues mental impressions; it gets lost in
    its moods! </p>
    <p>Let me explain more clearly. Right now we are sitting in a
    peaceful forest. Here, if there's no wind, a leaf remains
    still. When a wind blows it flaps and flutters. The mind is
    similar to that leaf. When it contacts a mental impression,
    it, too, &quot;flaps and flutters&quot; according to the
    nature of that mental impression. And the less we know of
    Dhamma, the more the mind will continually pursue mental
    impressions. Feeling happy, it succumbs to happiness. Feeling
    suffering, it succumbs to suffering. It's constant confusion!
    </p>
    <p>In the end people become neurotic. Why? Because they don't
    know! They just follow their moods and don't know how to look
    after their own minds. When the mind has no one to look after
    it, it's like a child without a mother or father to take care
    of him. An orphan has no refuge and, without a refuge, he's
    very insecure. </p>
    <p>Likewise, if the mind is not looked after, if there is no
    training or maturation of character with right understanding,
    it's really troublesome. </p>
    <p>The method of training the mind which I will give you
    today is <strong>Kammatthana</strong>. &quot;Kamma&quot;
    means &quot;action&quot; and &quot;thana&quot; means
    &quot;base.&quot; In Buddhism it is the method of making the
    mind peaceful and tranquil. It's for you to use in training
    the mind and with the trained mind investigate the body. </p>
    <p>Our being is composed of two parts: one is the body, the
    other, the mind. There are only these two parts. What is
    called &quot;the body,&quot; is that which can be seen with
    our physical eyes. &quot;The mind,&quot; on the other hand,
    has no physical aspect. The mind can only be seen with the
    &quot;internal eye&quot; or the &quot;eye of the mind.&quot;
    These two things, body and mind, are in a constant state of
    turmoil. </p>
    <p>What is the mind? The mind isn't really and
    &quot;thing.&quot; Conventionally speaking, it's that which
    feels or senses. That which senses, receives and experiences
    all mental impressions is called &quot;mind.&quot; Right at
    this moment there is mind. As I am speaking to you, the mind
    acknowledges what I am saying. Sounds enter through the ear
    and you know what is being said. That which experiences this
    is called &quot;mind.&quot; </p>
    <p>This mind doesn't have any self or substance. It doesn't
    have any form. It just experiences mental activities, that's
    all! If we teach this mind to have right view, this mind
    won't have any problems. It will be at ease. </p>
    <p>The mind is mind. Mental objects are mental objects.
    Mental objects are not the mind, the mind is not mental
    objects. In order to clearly understand our minds and the
    mental objects in our minds, we say that the mind is that
    which receives the mental objects which <i>pop</i> into it. </p>
    <p>When these two things, mind and its object, come into
    contact with each other, they give rise to feelings. Some are
    good, some bad, some cold, some hot, all kinds! Without
    wisdom to deal with these feelings, however, the mind will be
    troubled. </p>
    <p>Meditation is the way of developing the mind so that it
    may be a base for the arising of wisdom. Here the breath is a
    physical foundation. We call it <strong>Anapanasati</strong>
    or &quot;mindfulness of breathing.&quot; Here we make
    breathing our mental object. We take this object of
    meditation because it's the simplest and because it has been
    the heart of meditation since ancient times. </p>
    <p>When a good occasion arises to do sitting meditation, sit
    cross-legged: right leg on top of the left leg, right hand on
    top of the left hand. Keep your back straight and erect. Say
    to yourself, &quot;Now I will let go of all my burdens and
    concerns.&quot; You don't want anything that will cause you
    worry. Let go of all concerns for the time being. </p>
    <p>Now fix your attention on the breath. Then breathe in and
    breathe out. In developing awareness of breathing, don't
    intentionally make the breath long or short. Neither make it
    strong or weak. Just let it flow normally and naturally.
    Mindfulness and self-awareness, arising from the mind, will
    know the in-breath and the out-breath. </p>
    <p>Be at ease. Don't think about anything. No need to think
    of this or that. The only thing you have to do is fix your
    attention on the breathing in and breathing out. You have
    nothing else to do but that! Keep your mindfulness fixed on
    the in-and out-breaths as they occur. Be aware of the
    beginning, middle and end of each breath. On inhalation, the
    beginning of the breath is at the nose tip, the middle at the
    heart, and the end in the abdomen. On exhalation, it's just
    the reverse: the beginning of the breath is in the abdomen,
    the middle at the heart, and the end at the nose tip. Develop
    the awareness of the breath: 1, at the nose tip; 2, at the
    heart; 3, in the abdomen. Then in reverse: 1, in the abdomen;
    2, at the heart; and 3, at the nose tip. </p>
    <p>Focusing the attention on these three points will relieve
    all worries. Just don't think of anything else! Keep your
    attention on the breath. Perhaps other thoughts will enter
    the mind. It will take up other themes and distract you.
    Don't be concerned. Just take up the breathing again as your
    object of attention. The mind may get caught up in judging
    and investigating your moods, but continue to practice, being
    constantly aware of the beginning, middle and the end of each
    breath. </p>
    <p>Eventually, the mind will be aware of the breath at these
    three points all the time. When you do this practice for some
    time, the mind and body will get accustomed to the work.
    Fatigue will disappear. The body will feel lighter and the
    breath will become more and more refined. Mindfulness and
    self-awareness will protect the mind and watch over it. </p>
    <p>We practice like this until the mind is peaceful and calm,
    until it is <i>one.</i> <i>One</i> means that the mind will
    be completely absorbed in the breathing, that it doesn't
    separate from the breath. The mind will be unconfused and at
    ease. It will know the beginning, middle and end of the
    breath and remain steadily fixed on it. </p>
    <p>Then when the mind is peaceful, we fix our attention on
    the in-breath and out-breath at the nose tip only. We don't
    have to follow it up and down to the abdomen and back. Just
    concentrate on the tip of the nose where the breath comes in
    and goes out. </p>
    <p>This is called &quot;calming the mind,&quot; making it
    relaxed and peaceful. When tranquillity arises, the mind <i>stops;</i>
    it <i>stops</i> with its single object, the breath. This is
    what's known as making the mind peaceful so that wisdom may
    arise. </p>
    <p>This is the beginning, the foundation of our practice. You
    should try to practice this every single day, wherever you
    may be. Whether at home, in a car, lying or sitting down, you
    should be mindfully aware and watch over the mind constantly.
    </p>
    <p>This is called mental training which should be practiced
    in all the four postures. Not just sitting, but standing,
    walking and lying as well. The point is that we should know
    what the state of the mind is at each moment, and, to be able
    to do this, we must be constantly mindful and aware. Is the
    mind happy or suffering? Is it confused? Is it peaceful?
    Getting to know the mind in this manner allows it to become
    tranquil, and when it does become tranquil, wisdom will
    arise. </p>
    <p>With the tranquil mind investigate the meditation subject
    which is the body, from the top of the head to the soles of
    the feet, then back to the head. Do this over and over again.
    Look at and see the hair of the head, hair of the body, the
    nails, teeth and skin. In this meditation we will see that
    this whole body is composed of four &quot;elements': earth,
    water, fire and wind. </p>
    <p>The hard and solid parts of our body make up the earth
    element; the liquid and flowing parts, the water element.
    Winds that pass up and down our body make up the wind
    element, and the heat in our body, the fire element. </p>
    <p>Taken together, they compose what we call a &quot;human
    being.&quot; However, when the body is broken down into its
    component parts, only these four elements remain. The Buddha
    taught that there is no &quot;being&quot; <i>per se,</i> no
    human, no Thai, no Westerner, no person, but that ultimately,
    there are only these four elements -- that's all! We assume
    that there is a person or a &quot;being&quot; but, in
    reality, there isn't anything of the sort. </p>
    <p>Whether taken separately as earth, water, fire and wind,
    or taken together labelling what they form a &quot;human
    being,&quot; they're all impermanent, subject to suffering
    and not-self. They are all unstable, uncertain and in a state
    of constant change -- not stable for a single moment! </p>
    <p>Our body is unstable, altering and changing constantly.
    Hair changes, nails change, teeth change, skin changes --
    everything changes, completely! </p>
    <p>Our mind, too, is always changing. It isn't a self or
    substance. It isn't really &quot;us,&quot; not really
    &quot;them,&quot; although it may think so. Maybe it will
    think about killing itself. Maybe it will think of happiness
    or of suffering -- all sorts of things! It's unstable. If we
    don't have wisdom and we believe this mind of ours, it'll lie
    to us continually. And we alternately suffer and be happy. </p>
    <p>This mind is an uncertain thing. This body is uncertain.
    Together they are impermanent. Together they are a source of
    suffering. Together they are devoid of self. These, the
    Buddha pointed out, are neither a being, nor a person, nor a
    self, nor a soul, nor us, nor they. They are merely elements:
    earth, water, fire and wind. Elements only! </p>
    <p>When the mind sees this, it will rid itself of attachment
    which holds that &quot;I&quot; am beautiful, &quot;I&quot; am
    good, &quot;I&quot; am evil, &quot;I&quot; am suffering,
    &quot;I&quot; have, &quot;I&quot; this or &quot;I&quot; that.
    You will experience a state of unity, for you'll have seen
    that all of mankind is basically the same. There is no
    &quot;I.&quot; There are only elements. </p>
    <p>When you contemplate and see impermanence, suffering and
    not-self, there will no longer be clinging to a self, a
    being, I or he or she. The mind which sees this will give
    rise to Nibbida, world-weariness and dispassion. It will see
    all things as only impermanent, suffering and not-self. </p>
    <p>The mind then <i>stops.</i> The mind is Dhamma. Greed,
    hatred and delusion will then diminish and recede little by
    little until finally there is only mind -- just the pure
    mind. This is called &quot;practicing meditation.&quot; </p>
    <p>Thus, I ask you to receive this gift of Dhamma which I
    offer you to study and contemplate in your daily lives.
    Please accept this Dhamma Teaching from Wat Pah Pong and Wat
    Pah Nanachat as an inheritance handed down to you. All of the
    monks here, including your son, and all the Teachers, make
    you an offering of this Dhamma to take back to France with
    you. It will show you the way to peace of mind, it will
    render your mind calm and unconfused. Your body may be in
    turmoil, but your mind will not. Those in the world may be
    confused, but you will not. Even though there is confusion in
    your country, you will not be confused because the mind will
    have <i>seen,</i> the mind is Dhamma. This is the right path,
    the proper way. </p>
    <p>May you remember this Teaching in the future. </p>
    <p>May you be well and happy. </p>
