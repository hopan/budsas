      <TD WIDTH="100%"><FONT SIZE="6">T</FONT>he Mahaparinibbana Sutta deals 
      with some important points in respect of the attitude of the theras 
      towards the Vinaya which was considered by them the lifeblood of the 
      dispensation. When the Vinaya and the Sutta rehearsals were over, Ananda 
      informed the assembly that the Buddha had enjoined the Sangha to abrogate 
      the lesser and minor rules if they so desired. The Mahaparinibbana Sutta 
      and the Cullavagga record this incident in two different ways. The Sutta 
      states this in a verb of the imperative mood while the Cullavagga uses an 
      optative, thereby revealing, as it were, Ananda's willingness as such, to 
      the abrogation of the rules in question.
      <P>The problematic situation created in the first council with reference 
      to the identity of the lesser and minor rules, clearly indicates the 
      position taken up by the theras headed by Mahakassapa who chaired the 
      first council. As recorded in the Cullavagga, altogether five charges were 
      levelled against Ananda when the rehearsal of the Dhamma-vinaya was over.
      </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>1. Ananda's failure to ask the Buddha as to the contents of lesser 
        and minor rules. <BR>
        2. Sewing the Master's garment used for the rainy season by resting his 
        feet upon it. <BR>
        3. Permitting women to worship the body of the Master and thereby 
        allowing the body to be defiled by the tears shed by them. <BR>
        4. Negligence displayed in not requesting the Master to live for an aeon 
        (kappa). <BR>
        5. Persuading the Buddha to admit womankind into the dispensation by 
        speaking on behalf of them before the Buddha. </P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>But the most striking thing is, according to Rockhill, who gives a 
      record of the first council as found in the Tibetan sources, Ananda had 
      been charged *<B><I>before</I></B>* the council proper, which was held for 
      the purpose of rehearsing the word of the Buddha and was sent away being 
      asked to attain sainthood before returning. This very Ananda without whom 
      the rehearsal of the Dhamma could not have been accomplished! Rockhill 
      gives seven charges in all. </P>
      <P>The fourth and the sixth of his list are not found in the Pali record. 
      However they are not of special significance. The reasons for not 
      providing the Buddha with pure water when He was thirsty have been 
      recorded in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta in detail, which is the fourth 
      charge levelled against Ananda in Rockhill's list. The sixth is the 
      exhibition of the secret parts of the Buddha's body, which the Buddha 
      Himself had done when He was alive, in order to dispel doubts in the mind 
      of a brahmin. </P>
      <P>What is significant is the fifth charge given in the Rockhill's list 
      which is the first in the Theravada list found in the Cullavagga. Notably, 
      the Theravadins gave precedence to a charge that dealt directly with the 
      disciplinary code. </P>
      <P>The Buddha who enjoined the disciples to regard the Dhammavinaya as the 
      Teacher when He is no more, further asked them to abrogate the lesser and 
      minor rules after His demise if they desired to do so. Could there be any 
      reason for this pronouncement? What was the purpose of it? What prompted 
      the Buddha to permit them to abrogate those rules? </P>
      <P>As found in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta when the Buddha asked Ananda to 
      levy brahmadanda to Channa, Ananda was mindful enough to beg for an 
      explanation of brahmadanda from the Buddha. But in this particular case 
      why did Ananda not inquire from the Buddha what those lesser and minor 
      rules were. The problem has to be investigated comparatively, because the 
      step taken in this regard has paved the way subsequently for lasting 
      consequences resulting in the division of the original Sangha into 
      different schools. </P>
      <P>Ananda placed the problem of lesser and minor rules just after the 
      rehearsal of Dhammavinaya. He informed the assembly that the Buddha had 
      given permission to abrogate them after the Buddha's demise if the Sangha 
      so desired. Then the question was discussed at length and ultimately, as 
      opinions differed, they came to the conclusion that they would not repeal 
      any of the lesser and minor rules. What is more relevant in this 
      connection is the different opinions expressed in regard to the rules 
      under discussion. Some of the participants went to the extent of declaring 
      that most rules other than the four defeats (Parajikas) were lesser and 
      minor rules. </P>
      <P>Were the theras who took part in the council ignorant of the rules in 
      question? Certainly it would be much more plausible to place the problem 
      in historical perspective. Jotiya Dhirasekera, approaching the problem 
      from a different angle, states: &quot;It is important to recognise the fact 
      that there seems to have existed even during the time of the Buddha, a 
      category of sikkhapadas carrying the designation of lesser and minor rules 
      or khuddanukhuddaka&quot;, which probably suggests the existence of a code of 
      discipline where rules were codified in respect of the gravity of the 
      offence involved. </P>
      <P>The second of the Sahadhammika Vagga of the pacittiya rules directly 
      deals with these lesser and minor rules which says that if any monk 
      'voices dissatisfaction' when the Patimokkha is being recited, saying what 
      is the use of these lesser and minor rules which result in remorse, 
      weariness and perplexity, commits a pacittiya offence. Evidently, when the 
      Vinayapitaka, where the above rule is included, was being recited at the 
      council, Upali who had been assigned the pre-eminent position among 
      Vinayadharas as well as Ananda along with other theras were present with 
      Thera Mahakassapa in the chair. But nobody posed the question as to what 
      were the rules intended by the phrase 'khuddanukhuddaka'. The silence on 
      the part of the participants show that they were well aware of the nature 
      of khuddanukhuddakas or lesser and minor rules. </P>
      <P>However one thing is clear from the rule. The lesser and minor rules 
      are part and parcel of the Patimokkha and that they are to be recited 
      fortnightly at the Patimokkha recital along with the rest of the rules. 
      The present Patimokkha consists of the following rules : parajikas, 
      sanghadisesa, aniyatas, nissaggiya pacittiyas, patidesaniyas, sekhiyas and 
      adhikarana samathas. </P>
      <P>As both the Mahavagga and the Cullavagga are not recited at the 
      Uposatha ceremony held fortnightly, the rules in question should be in one 
      of these groups. It is said in the Pacittiya Pali that the group of six 
      (Chabbaggiyas) are the cause of levying this Vinaya rule. Further it is 
      said that they, giving popularity to this idea in order to discourage the 
      monks, caused them to refrain from Vinaya study; but what we understand 
      from the rule is that it is a pacittiya offence to voice dissatisfaction 
      while the Patimokkha recitation is in progress. This discrepancy however 
      reveals, on the other hand, that there were some monks who wanted to leave 
      out the lesser and minor rules not only from the fortnightly recital but 
      from the Vinaya Pitaka as well. </P>
      <P>When the question of their identity arose at the end of the council, 
      Upali the Vinaya expert, should have been consulted by the theras. But 
      according to Cullavagga, Upali's opinion was not sought. The old 
      commentary embedded in the Pacittiya Pali also does not comment on the 
      phrase, 'khuddanukhuddaka'. Even Buddhaghosa in his Vinaya commentary 
      Samantapasadika dismisses the expression by merely saying <I>'with lesser 
      and minor rules (khuddakehi ca anukhuddakehi ca)'. </I>Neither the 
      Pacittiya Pali nor the Samantapasadika are helpful in getting the import 
      of the phrase clarified. </P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the same problem was placed before Nagasena by Milinda 
      some five centuries after the rehearsal, which Nagasena solved by giving a 
      very terse reply: </P>
      <P><I>&quot;O King; wrong doings are the lesser rules, wrong utterances are the 
      minor rules.&quot;</I> </P>
      <P>The most striking incident in the record of the first council is the 
      silence of the theras in regard to the Pacittiya rule. When it was being 
      rehearsed, as it seems, there was no question as to the definition of 
      lesser and minor rules at all which shows that the rules in question were 
      known to them. But the paradox is at the end of the council, when they 
      could not even come to a decision as to the identity of those rules. 
      However, it is noteworthy how Nagasena came out with a ready reply with a 
      precise definition. </P>
      <P>The Buddha's intention was to hand over the controlling power of the 
      Sangha to the Sangha themselves. He wanted to create an atmosphere 
      amicable for free administration and growth of the dispensation. Therefore 
      not only legislative but executive power as well were relegated to the 
      Sangha themselves. Nevertheless, when the Buddha was alive the Sangha had 
      no authority to levy disciplinary rules and in every way the Buddha was 
      held supreme. It was the Buddha who had the authority to levy disciplinary 
      rules when there were complaints in regard to the misconduct of individual 
      monks. Conflicting views that could arise by the account of the Cullavagga 
      and the Mahaparinibbana Sutta could be dispelled by discerning the 
      Buddha's attitude towards monastic discipline. </P>
      <P>How far is it reasonable to charge Ananda at the end of the council for 
      not inquiring from the Buddha as to what were the lesser and the minor 
      rules? Buddhaghosa, commenting upon the incident, points out: &quot;<I>The 
      import is, if the Sangha desires, let the Sangha repeal them. Why did the 
      Buddha, without directly asking them to repeal them, use these optional 
      terms? Because He foresaw the power of Mahakassapa. Indeed even the Buddha 
      though enjoining the Sangha to repeal them after His demise realised that 
      Mahakassapa would not do away with those rules in question. Hence the 
      Buddha left the problem to be decided by the Sangha&quot;.</I> He further 
      states that Thera Nagasena has replied in order to ensure that there 
      should be no opportunity for opponents. Buddhaghosa therefore concludes:
      <I>&quot;This being the case Mahakassapa suggested that they should not repeal 
      the lesser and minor rules.&quot; </I>Thereupon the assembly agreed to leave 
      them as they were. As commented upon by Buddhaghosa, what we can 
      understand is, Ananda would not have been charged at the council for the 
      question of lesser and minor rules. </P>
      <P>Dhammapala in his sub-commentary, commenting upon the problem, states 
      three opinions that could be deduced from the decision of the council: </P>
      <P>1. There shall be monks who do not like to observe the lesser and minor 
      rules but they will be prompted to think that even though the Buddha had 
      enjoined them to repeal them they are bound by them because of the 
      decision of the Sangha at the first council. </P>
      <P>2. The entire dispensation belongs to the monks themselves. It is clear 
      from the fact that even though they had been allowed by the Buddha, they 
      did not like to repeal the lesser and the minor rules. </P>
      <P>3. The monks prefer to observe these rules even though the Buddha had 
      asked them to do away with them. This is clear evidence to the magnanimity 
      of the Sangha. </P>
      <P>Now, it is clear from the above discussion that both Buddhaghosa and 
      Dhammapala do not in any measure level a charge against Ananda in regard 
      to the so-called negligence shown by him in not inquiring from the Buddha 
      as to what those rules were. If this is the case it is very difficult to 
      justify the accusation against Ananda at the first council. Indeed, with 
      the demise of the Buddha, the Thera Mahakassapa had to act responsibly 
      which he did. The enthusiasm shown by him just after the cremation is 
      commendable and he continued to put forth his effort to maintain peace and 
      unity in the order. </P>
      <P>After the demise of the Buddha, he had determined to convene a council 
      in order to conserve the doctrine and discipline and hand it over to 
      future generations undistorted and intact. A statement found in the Digha 
      Nikaya could be cited in this connection, where it is stated categorically 
      that the monks of the Buddhist order would not at any cost transgress 
      those obligatory rules levied by the Buddha. It runs thus: &quot;<I>It may 
      happen Chunda; the wanderers teaching other views than ours may declare: 
      the Sakyan recluses are inconsistent in the doctrine they hold. To them 
      thus declaring this might be replied: Brother, the Exalted One who sees, 
      Worthy, Supremely Enlightened hath taught and made known to His disciples 
      doctrines not to be transgressed so long as life shall last. Just as a 
      pillar of stone or iron, with base deep-planted, well fixed, unshaking, 
      unquivering even so are those doctrines.&quot;</I> </P>
      <P>This clearly depicts the attitude of the theras in regard to the rules 
      in question. It would actually mean that the disciples of the Buddha, 
      unlike the disciples of Niganthanataputta do not transgress the rules laid 
      down by the Master even under provocation. </P>
      <P>Even though the Buddha had not appointed a successor, the solidarity 
      seen in the community of monks after His demise was commendable. It was a 
      matter of grave concern for those who anticipated a decline in the order 
      with the demise of the Teacher. When this question was raised by the 
      brahmin Vassakara, Ananda replied: <I>&quot;O Brahmana; rules have been levied 
      by the Buddha, the Fully Enlightened, Omniscient and Perfect One for monks 
      and the recitation of the same is enjoined and we who live in each 
      locality get together and recite the rules which are obligatory. When we 
      come across anyone who has transgressed, we deal with him in accordance 
      with the Dhamma, in accordance with Vinaya. It is not that we deal with 
      him, it is the law that deals with him.&quot;</I> </P>
      <P>The Sangha depend on the laity for their sustenance. The goodwill and 
      munificence of the laity are directed towards them only when they are 
      convinced of the piety and demeanour of Sangha living up to the 
      disciplinary measures in force. Therefore the disciples who disregard the 
      discipline and live on their own accord, will undoubtedly subject 
      themselves to despise and scorn. Hence it is clear from Ananda's reply to 
      Vassakara that even Ananda had the impression that the solidarity would 
      prevail among the Sangha as long as the discipline stands as the guideline 
      for them. </P>
      <P>Nagasena, in replying to Milinda with reference to lesser and minor 
      rules, says that the Buddha's concern was the response of the theras and 
      states further: <I>&quot;The monks, the sons of Sakya, will observe an even 
      extra hundred and fifty rules with the intention of getting rid of 
      suffering. If this is the case, how could one think of repealing the 
      already levied hundred and fifty rules?&quot;</I> When we take these into 
      account it is extremely clear as to what the theras wanted to emphasise. 
      After the recital of Dhammavinaya, Mahakassapa and the theras put off the 
      question of lesser and minor rules as they could not come to a decision 
      with regard to their identity. This is what we find in the Cullavagga 
      account dealing with the first council held at Rajagaha, just three months 
      after the demise of the Buddha. Different views have been put forward in 
      regard to the apparent riddle of lesser and minor rules, a problem already 
      solved by a resolution unanimously voted for, stating the intention of not 
      repealing any of them. </P>
      <P>These views seem contradictory and meaningless, because one will not be 
      able to repeal any law if he is not aware what sort of law it is. 
      Therefore it is plausible to think that if those theras who participated 
      in the council did not know what these rules were in the real sense of the 
      phrase, they should have declared that those rules were not known to them.
      </P>
      <P>The history of Buddhism in India shows that the question of lesser and 
      minor rules subsequently contributed to the breaking away of Mahasanghikas 
      from original Sangha thereby giving birth to two different sects or 
      schools of Buddhis viz.: Theravada and Mahasanghika. Thereafter on various 
      doctrinal issues many Buddhist sects came into being and during the time 
      of Asoka in the 3rd century B.C. it is said that there were not less than 
      eighteen schools. </P>
      <P>Had the theras abrogated those lesser and minor rules at the First 
      Council, the question of the ten points practised by Vajjian monks would 
      not have arisen and the Sangha would have remained one and the theras of 
      the second council would not have taken such strict measures to prevent 
      the practice of ten points professed by the monks of the Vajjian 
      confederacy which had been governed by democratic principles. Moreover the 
      unity of the Sangha would have prevailed and the history of Buddhist 
      thought would have taken a different course. </P>
      <P>The intention of Mahakassapa is distinctly seen in this connection. To 
      put it in his own words: &quot;<I>Not to enforce new rules and not to do away 
      with those that are in force&quot;</I> was the motive of Mahakassapa, to which 
      he managed to get the consent of the other participants, too. He had been 
      commended even by the Buddha for his austere life. Evidently, by the time 
      of the Buddha's demise, what was proper and improper for the monks and 
      what were the obligatory rules for them had been known even to the lay 
      followers. Negligence in this regard therefore would naturally lead to an 
      unbecoming repercussion on the order. People would be in an uproar, that 
      the discipline existed only as long as the funeral pyre was burning. 
      Therefore it was incumbent on them to devise ways and means to win the 
      confidence of the laity at large, for the sustenance and growth of the 
      dispensation wholly depended upon the liberality of the lay followers. </P>
      <P>According to Sarvastivada, Mahisasaka and Dharmaguptaka sources, Ananda 
      reports the Buddha's request to the assembly and adds further that the 
      ill-health of the Master prevented him getting a clarification as to the 
      identity of the lesser and minor rules. The Mahasanghikas however state 
      that though the Buddha had asked Ananda to remind Him of abrogating these 
      rules before His demise Ananda had not complied with the request. Although 
      the opinions are divergent in regard to the lesser and minor rules, all 
      these schools including Theravada are unanimous in stating that the 
      intention of the Buddha was to do away with them if the Sangha desired to 
      do so. </P>
      <P>In this context it would be very interesting to note how the two works, 
      the Mahaparinibbana Sutta and the Cullavagga, refer to the abrogation of 
      the lesser and minor rules. The Buddha in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta 
      enjoined Ananda to remove or to abolish (<I>samuhanatu = sam + aahana + tu</I>, 
      from the root <I>'han'</I> to kill, imperative 3rd person singular) the 
      rules in question if the monks so desire after His demise. But Mahakassapa 
      as found in the Cullavagga categorically states that they are not to break 
      up or to extirpate (<I>samucchindeyya = sam + ud + chid + eyya</I>; from 
      the root <I>'chid'</I> to cut; optative 3rd person singular) the rules 
      already in existence. </P>
      <P>So his determination of keeping the rules as they were is clearly seen 
      in his attempt at shifting the emphasis from 'samuhanatu' to 
      'samucchindeyya'. His attitude towards the discipline is also worthy of 
      note, for he had to bear the responsibility with none to share it all 
      railing round him for guidance and patronage. Ultimately, at the end of 
      the proceedings, all agreed &quot;to establish nothing that has not been 
      prescribed and abrogate nothing that has already been established and act 
      in accordance with the rules of the order as now laid down.&quot; </P>
      <P>Now we have come to a position where we are capable of analysing a 
      statement which seems to be a factual interpolation, found in the 
      Mahaparinibbana Sutta referring to the enforcing of new rules for the 
      order. The foregoing discussion would undoubtedly throw a flood of light 
      on the matter in scrutinising new material which found its way into the 
      Sutta due to a particular preventive measure taken by the redactors of the 
      canon. The statement: &quot;<I>So long as the brethren shall establish nothing 
      that has not been prescribed and abrogate nothing that has already been 
      established&quot;</I> comes in an appropriate context in the Cullavagga, 
      because levying new rules by the monks is a situation contemplated to have 
      been, after the demise of the Teacher. Therefore evidently, the above 
      reference in the Cullavagga is befitting the context, for it was not 
      necessary to formulate rules by the monks for the order when the Buddha 
      was still living. But how far is the statement relevant to the narrative 
      of the Mahaparinibbana Sutta? The commentary on the Mahaparinibbana Sutta 
      is also not capable of dispelling our doubts arising from the context in 
      which it occurs.</P>
      <P>The Buddha in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta preaches seven conditions of 
      welfare to the Licchavis of Vesali as found in the Anguttara Nikaya. He 
      preached these conditions to the Licchavis when He was residing at the 
      Sarandada Shrine in Vesali. When the brahmin Vassakara visited the Buddha 
      at Rajagaha and intimated to the Buddha as to King Ajatasattu's intention 
      of building a fortress in order to conquer the Vajjians, the Buddha 
      questioned Ananda as to whether they were practising the seven conditions 
      of welfare He had preached to them on a previous occasion. This is found 
      in detail in the Anguttara Nikaya, but the Mahaparinibbana Sutta excludes 
      the first part of the discourse and continues the story beginning from the 
      inquiry of the Buddha. Obviously the Mahaparinibbana Sutta is not worried 
      about the first part of the discourse, only the appropriate portio having 
      been quoted and inserted in it. </P>
      <P>Some ideas pertaining to the political and social philosophies of the 
      Buddha can be seen in these seven conditions of welfare. According to 
      Mahaparinibbana Sutta when Vassakara went away, the Buddha asked Ananda to 
      assemble all the monks residing in Rajagaha and preached to them five sets 
      of seven conditions of welfare along with a set of six conditions. Though 
      the first set of seven has a direct bearing on our present discussion the 
      rest are quite out of context. Both are found in the Anguttara Nikaya as 
      well. </P>
      <P>In one of these conditions of welfare it is stated that the approval 
      given to elderly monks, who bear the burden of the order, to perform 
      procedural acts, result in the progress of individual monks who are still 
      being disciplined in the Path. This indirectly suggests that there had 
      been a considerable amount of conflicting opinions among the Sangha by 
      that time, and both the conservatives and the liberal new entrants to the 
      order were contesting each other in order to establish their own way of 
      thinking and interpretation. Probably with the demise of the Buddha there 
      might have been the temptation to effect internal changes to the 
      discipline in the order. Hence it is reasonable to think that these 
      conditions of welfare for the order must have been taken from the 
      Anguttara Nikaya and included in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta by the unknown 
      compiler of the discourse. </P>
      <P>How did the third in the first set of seven conditions of welfare of 
      the order, which reads: <I>&quot;So long as the brethren shall establish 
      nothing that has not been already prescribed and abrogate nothing that has 
      already been established and act in accordance with the rules of the order 
      as now laid down&quot;</I> find a place in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta? This 
      seems to be an anachronism. This actually is the point expressed by 
      Mahakassapa at the end of the first council held three months after the 
      Buddha's demise. On the other hand it goes against the Buddha who 
      permitted Ananda to do away with the lesser and minor rules after His 
      demise. </P>
      <P>Even during the life time of the Buddha the order of monks was taking a 
      monastic turn. The early itinerant mendicant life was gradually evolving 
      into a settled life in monasteries. King Bimbisara, with the permission of 
      the Buddha offered Veluvana in Rajagaha to the Buddha, to be used it as a 
      resort for the Buddha and the community of monks. Since then monasteries 
      were built by the laity and offered to the community. Consequently life in 
      monasteries evolved in a certain pattern and with more leisure and comfort 
      the monks took themselves to literary and religious activities and much 
      later in history to social activity as well. Forest dwelling though 
      regarded as the ideal life of a monk, in the succeeding centuries it was 
      practised less and less. Very many preferred to live in monasteries in 
      constant association with lay followers. </P>
      <P>There were of course some who resorted to forest life. Besides, the 
      theras always encouraged the initiates to take up forest dwelling. 
      Mahakassapa who had spent the greater part of his life in forests is 
      foremost among them. The attitude to forest life is clearly seen in the 
      sixth condition of welfare meant for monks: <I>&quot;So long as the brethren 
      delighted in a life in the forest so long may the brethren may be expected 
      not to decline but to prosper.&quot;</I> Moreover there was a conscious attempt 
      on the part of the theras to create an atmosphere for discipline and 
      control, for it is said in the fourth condition of welfare: &quot;So long as 
      the brethren honour and esteem, revere and support the elders of 
      experience and long standing, the fathers and leaders of the order and 
      hold it a point to listen to their words, the brethren may be expected not 
      to decline but to prosper.&quot; </P>
      <P>Therefore it could be surmised that the first set of seven conditions 
      of welfare found in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta meant for monks must have 
      been modelled on the conditions preached to the Vajjians by the Buddha. 
      Also these conditions could have been used as guidelines to overcome 
      diverse views arising in the community. The rest of the sets of conditions 
      could have been taken from the Anguttara Nikaya or from some other source 
      unknown to us and included here to make the episode a relevant whole. It 
      should be stated that a good number of these forty-one conditions of 
      welfare must have been preached by the Buddha and included in the 
      discourse in its historical development. It may be a period anterior to 
      the first schism in the community. If they had taken them from the 
      Anguttara Nikaya and interpolated them in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta, one 
      may naturally ask why those which had direct relevance to our discussion 
      have not been taken from the Anguttara Nikaya; the clarification of which 
      is to be attempted after a structural analysis of the Anguttara Nikaya.
      </P>
      <P>The fact that the theras did not tolerate changes effecting the order 
      in any way, could be seen in many instances. Mahakassapa on one occasion 
      expressed his grave concern in regard to the bare fact that there were few 
      who attained realisation when there were so many precepts whereas there 
      were many who attained realisation when there were few precepts. Yet 
      another thera, called Parapariya, totally condemned the behaviour of the 
      monks saying that they were then different in conduct. Therefore it was 
      necessary to devise ways and means to make the monks live in accordance 
      with the ancient traditions. Hence the word of the <I>&quot;theras who have 
      experience and who are long-standing, the leaders of the order&quot;</I> had to 
      be pinpointed along with the relative importance of listening to them. </P>
      <P>The points so far discussed could be summarized thus: There was a 
      decision as to what the lesser and minor rules were. This decision had 
      been taken even during the life time of the Buddha. It had been known even 
      to Ananda. Therefore he did not think of asking the Buddha for 
      clarification as to what was meant by the phrase <I>&quot;Khuddanukkhuddaka&quot;</I>. 
      Subhadda's utterance, too, could be taken as suggestive of the widespread 
      opinion that these rules had to be done away with. The theras who knew 
      what had happened to the Jain Order after the passing away of Mahavira 
      inclined to take measures to conserve the discipline intact. Therefore, 
      Ananda who intimated to the assembly what the Buddha had asked him, was 
      lingering between two worlds. He was certainly facing an embarrassing 
      situation; on the one hand his utmost respect towards the theras and on 
      the other hand the responsibility arising from the permission given to him 
      by the Buddha in regard to the rules in question tormented him. But in the 
      end he was asked to admit an offence of wrong doing which he admitted in 
      view of his respect towards the theras. </P>
      <P>Both Nagasena and Buddhaghosa looked at the problem with the 
      responsibility of upholding the tradition, whereas Dhammapala commented 
      upon the phrase very freely. Conditions of welfare meant for the order 
      also an echo of the procedure adopted at the council, must have been 
      included in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta in order to give authority to the 
      word of the theras. Nevertheless we do not know for certain whether these 
      conditions have been taken from the Anguttara Nikaya or from any other 
      source by the redactors of the canon.</P>
