  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Melvin McLeod (Editor, the Shambhala
    Sun):</strong> To begin with, maybe you could each tell me something about how you became
    a Buddhist teacher.</font><p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Sharon Salzberg
    (Co-founder of the Insight Meditation Society and author):</strong> I went to India in
    1970 to look for a meditation teacher. It was an incredible time. As Westerners there, we
    felt like a group of adventurers. We were interested in practical teachings&#151;it
    wasn&#146;t a question of becoming a Buddhist or adopting a dogma, but really bringing
    something into our lives.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Most of my early teachers were men, but I didn&#146;t feel
    much gender bias. The person who actually told me to teach was my first woman teacher,
    Dipa Ma. She had led an extraordinary life, with a tremendous amount of suffering and very
    little control over her life in an ordinary Western sense.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When she told me to teach, what she actually said was,
    &#147;You really understand suffering; therefore, you should teach.&#148; I think that
    reflected not only what she&#146;d been through in her life, and what I&#146;d been
    through in my life, but also something within her experience as a woman&#151;an
    understanding of the depths of suffering and the transformation of suffering into
    compassion that seemed unique. She was the model for me of how to take the losses, the
    tragedies and the difficulties of life, and actually use them as enrichment for my
    understanding of the dharma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Judith Simmer-Brown (Chair of the Religious
    Studies Department at Naropa University and senior teacher (acharaya) in Shambhala
    International):</strong> I learned Zen practice from Suzuki Roshi and felt completely in
    love with the absolute present quality that he had. After his death, I met Chï¿½gyam
    Trungpa Rinpoche and felt the same kind of connection with him. As time went on, Trungpa
    Rinpoche encouraged me to teach dharma and to step as fully as possible into that role. He
    always encouraged women teachers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In those days I never really thought much about women
    versus men teachers, because there were a number of both in our community. It was when my
    meditation students began to talk to me about the obstacles that they faced as women that
    I began to think about it more, and I talked to Trungpa Rinpoche about it. He had
    incredible sympathy for the situation of women. You got a kind of direct transmission from
    him that on any ultimate level, the issue of being male or female was not a problem, while
    obviously in our relative experience this was something that we all had to deal with.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As time went on, I realized I had a lot to figure out
    about what particular strengths I could bring to situations as a woman, and what support I
    could provide to both male and female students to sort out this issue of gender. I was
    helped a great deal in this by Khandro Rinpoche, a woman Tibetan teacher. There is one
    quote from her that I find very helpful, and consider a kind of slogan or koan for my life
    as a woman teacher: &#147;If being a woman is an inspiration, use it. If it is an
    obstacle, try not to be bothered.&#148; That helps keep me from being snagged by my sense
    at times that being a woman is an obstacle, and it also helps me appreciate the qualities
    as a woman that I can bring to my work as a teacher.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Barbara Rhodes (Vice School Zen Master of the Kwan
    Um School of Zen):</strong> I met the Korean Zen master Seung Sahn in 1972. I didn&#146;t
    feel any obstacle being a woman, as he didn&#146;t seem to treat anybody like a woman,
    particularly. It was more like we were all a bunch of really yang Koreans. If you&#146;ve
    met him, he&#146;s pretty yang, and there weren&#146;t a lot of women around, but I liked
    him. I really loved his teaching. He just kept stressing: Believe in yourself. Only go
    straight. Don&#146;t know. Ask yourself who are you. It was pretty much an androgynous
    practice.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At one point I asked him if there were any women Zen
    masters in Korea, and he said, &#147;Oh no, of course not. Women can&#146;t attain
    enlightenment.&#148; He said it with a really straight face and then walked into the
    kitchen. I followed him in and said, &#147;I&#146;ve been with you for two years and
    you&#146;ve always said just to believe in yourself. How can you say women can&#146;t get
    enlightened?&#148; He just stared at me and pointed his finger and he said, &#147;So
    you&#146;re a woman?&#148; In other words I had grasped man/woman concept. He was saying
    that you can&#146;t attain enlightenment if you hold on to that self identity. I really
    liked that approach.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He made a few of us dharma teachers when we were pretty
    young students&#151;we&#146;d only been practicing with him about three years. He
    didn&#146;t distinguish whether we were men or women; he just had us start teaching.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Pat O&#146;Hara (Soto priest and resident teacher
    of the Village Zendo, New York):</strong> I started reading dharma books in the late
    sixties, but as a single parent I found it extremely difficult to enter into any Buddhist
    community with a young child. It was a difficult time because I knew that I had a passion
    for the dharma, but I couldn&#146;t find a home that seemed conducive to my idea of
    mothering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Finally, when my son was old enough in the early eighties,
    I began to practice at Zen Mountain Monastery with John Daido Loori Roshi, and right off
    he started talking about my starting to teach. My attitude was, no, I&#146;m just here to
    face the wall, thank you, but he was very encouraging.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As an American teacher, he didn&#146;t have any issue of
    men versus women, and whenever the gender was vague in a koan, he encouraged us to switch
    it to female. So initially I wasn&#146;t really aware of the incredible marginalization of
    women that had occurred in the history of Buddhism, of all the women who had been
    forgotten and their names left unsaid.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then when I began to study with Taizan Maezumi Roshi, it
    was like studying with a woman. It was very peculiar. He was this wonderful feminine
    energy and we would sit in this darkened dokusan room and cry together [laughs].</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-oOo-</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Melvin McLeod:</strong> The prominence of women in
    Western Buddhism now is unique in the history of Buddhism. How did it come about?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Pat O&#146;Hara:</strong> Well, the whole feminist
    movement was going on at the same time Buddhism was coming to the West, and there had to
    be leakage back and forth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Sharon Salzberg:</strong> What I&#146;ve seen
    happening in the Theravada tradition is a kind of movement back to the people. So much of
    what was taught over the last couple of centuries didn&#146;t necessarily reflect the
    actual teachings of the Buddha. As a woman you were told to create merit so maybe in your
    next life you could be a man and get ordained and become enlightened. As Westerners began
    practicing, that idea exploded. There was the sense that if liberation is really possible,
    I want to explore it. I don&#146;t want to think about someone else doing it, or doing it
    in my next life. I want to know how I can actually transform my life now. So the movement
    toward women teachers is also a reflection of the belief that liberation is real, a real
    possibility for everyone. For most women teachers I know, there was no self-conscious
    decision to transform Buddhism. It came from wanting to change our lives, and discovering
    a tradition that said we really could.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Judith Simmer-Brown: </strong>I discovered
    feminism before I discovered Buddhism and it gave me a sense of confidence and desire for
    liberation. I very quickly saw that liberation would not come through feminism, but I
    appreciate what I learned about myself from it. It gave me an enormous yearning to be free
    from confusion.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Feminism inspired a sense of confidence among so many
    people in the seventies, and women didn&#146;t hold back spiritually. They may have held
    back in other areas, but in the spiritual movements, women really have sought liberation.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-oOo-</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Melvin McLeod</strong>: To what extent is the
    predominance of women teachers attributable to the character of the particular Buddhist
    teachers who came to the West?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Judith Simmer-Brown:</strong> I&#146;ve studied
    with quite a few Tibetan teachers and not many of them have shown the kind of
    encouragement toward women that I experienced from Trungpa Rinpoche. He encouraged women
    to overcome any sense of shyness and really step into teaching roles.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Barbara Rhodes:</strong> I&#146;ve already
    described Zen Master Seung Sahn. I don&#146;t think he has too many feminine bones in his
    body. But in Korea, the nuns just love him and most of his students there are women, the
    ones who practice seriously with him. He has actually empowered women much more than other
    Zen teachers in Korea. I have to give him credit where credit&#146;s due. He&#146;s that
    kind of a person.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Pat o&#146;Hara:</strong> Maezumi Roshi came to
    this country as a young man and just fell in love with the freedom and real thirst for the
    dharma here. He seemed very open to the new traditions, and part of it was that he
    empowered a lot of women. It&#146;s wonderful.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-oOo-</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Melvin McLeod:</strong> I&#146;m surprised,
    because it sounds like overall you haven&#146;t experienced a lot of obstacles in becoming
    teachers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Judith Simmer-Brown:</strong> I think that at
    times women face more obstacles from other Western students than from the teachers. My
    women meditation students tell me about the difficulties they&#146;ve had in many
    different settings in the Buddhist community. They can find it very difficult to hold
    their own and have confidence in a variety of situations.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Melvin McLeod:</strong> Do women teach the dharma
    in different ways than men? Are there issues you address in your teaching that are
    particularly close to your heart because you are a woman?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Sharon Salzberg: </strong>I teach so much about
    loving-kindness, and people often say to me that it&#146;s because I&#146;m a woman. I
    actually like to think not. I like to think it&#146;s more a reflection of something very
    basic in the teachings of the Buddha. Now, was I drawn to teach about love and compassion
    because I am a woman? Maybe, but look at the Dalai Lama. Compassion is what he embodies
    and teaches, and what people seem to long for. So I&#146;d say no, it&#146;s not about my
    being a woman.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Barbara Rhodes:</strong> I refer a lot in my
    dharma talks to what I learn from working as a nurse at a hospice, and from being a mother
    and a daughter. I can&#146;t help but draw on my experience of these roles, and I think if
    someone compliments me as a teacher, it&#146;s usually because they appreciate how I draw
    my hospice stories and my mother stories and my daughter stories into the teaching of Zen.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I lead a lot of meditation retreats and I feel so
    gratified that men come in for their koan interviews and there doesn&#146;t seem to be any
    thought of whether I&#146;m less than or different; there&#146;s just a nice sense of flow
    back and forth. Sometimes people do say, &#147;I&#146;m glad you&#146;re a woman,&#148;
    because maybe I spent a little more time with them, or I said, &#147;Oh you look
    sad,&#148; when one of our male teachers might not have said that. Sometimes I think
    that&#146;s a gift, but sometimes I think one of our male teachers might have given a
    sharper interview that would have been just as or more helpful.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So there is some difference. I think I have rounder
    corners than a lot of the male teachers and that can be a blessing sometimes. When my
    daughter was little, I would pick her up all the time, and I think I pick up my students
    in a way&#151;not physically, but with that same sense of patience and loving their
    weaknesses if they&#146;re vulnerable, just feeling that and going into it. But of course,
    fathers have that quality too, and people who don&#146;t have children will have those
    gifts also.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Judith Simmer-Brown:</strong> In the Tibetan
    tradition, the wisdom aspect of the teachings is associated with the feminine, which is
    depicted in the form of the dakini, while the skillful means aspect of compassion is more
    masculine. Without joining the masculine and feminine aspects we can&#146;t become fully
    enlightened, and I&#146;ve reflected a great deal about how this relates to my gender
    being female.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One thing I&#146;m aware of is how easy it is to get
    hooked on gender as concept, and yet how easy it is to ignore gender altogether. In my
    life, I&#146;m trying to identify the ways in which my gender might be helpful to wake
    things up for myself and others, and at the same time, trying to step over the ways in
    which my gender might be an obstacle&#151;getting stuck in particular states of hesitation
    or emotionality or whatever.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For instance, I have been reflecting on how emotion can be
    an obstacle for women, and yet how it is also the wisdom aspect we have to offer in many
    situations. I&#146;m interested in how emotions can be empowering for myself and for
    others&#151;really seeing emotions in an empowered way, without falling into extremes of
    emotional indulgence. I have been doing a lot of teaching on romantic love and on working
    with the emotions of intense domestic situations, such as parenting, and in this I think
    there are things in my temperament and experience as a woman that might be helpful.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-oOo-</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Melvin McLeod:</strong> What is distinct about the
    way a woman teacher relates to her female students, and what is different about the way
    she might relate to her male students?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Pat O&#146;Hara:</strong> For me it&#146;s more
    about the type of person who is drawn to a woman teacher. In particular, the kind of man
    who is drawn to a woman teacher is probably a little different than the kind of man who is
    drawn to a male teacher. I asked some men students why my teaching appealed to them, and
    most of them said they wanted something that was open to the masculine, yet without the
    martial quality of traditional Zen. They liked the softer approach I offer, particularly
    in terms of body work&#151;meditating in a position of ease as opposed to a position of
    tension, that kind of thing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Barbara Rhodes:</strong> Women will often find
    me&#133; I don&#146;t know if hard is the right word, but I&#146;ve stuck with this
    practice and it&#146;s not an easy practice. To stand for this practice is what I try to
    do as a teacher, so I think they might find me an inspiration, but also too hard.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To generalize, I think women can become overemotional
    sometimes and men can have a hard time bringing up their emotions. So if there is some
    overemotionality, maybe I can inspire a woman to move toward the center, to find the
    strength men often have to overcome emotionality. It&#146;s not that one way&#146;s better
    than the other, but I do help women to realize that it doesn&#146;t help when you&#146;re
    overemotional. And it&#146;s the same thing with men. I encourage them to cry. I know
    they&#146;re right on the verge of tears and I&#146;ll kind of bring out the Kleenex box
    and encourage it, whereas a male teacher might not.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Sharon Salzberg: </strong>I think women tend to
    bring up their life situations and the traumas they&#146;ve suffered more easily than men.
    In her very first meeting with me a woman might say, I&#146;ve had a breast cancer
    diagnosis, or my son died, or something like that. A man might also have a tremendous
    source of suffering in his life, but it will be much later before he says, this is
    weighing on me, or I don&#146;t know what I&#146;m going to do, or I feel like such a
    failure. There&#146;s not usually the same degree of vulnerability and openness expressed
    right away by a man.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Judith Simmer-Brown:</strong> It seems to me that
    initially in relationships with students there might be more sense that my gender or their
    gender is an issue. But once you get beyond the first couple of conversations it seems
    pretty irrelevant. I was talking with a woman just the other evening about her new
    pregnancy, her fear about being a mother and that kind of thing, and obviously there are
    certain life situations where gender is very relevant. But it seems the really deep issues
    of meditation practice are not so gender-oriented. To me, it seems important to get beyond
    gender-related issues to those core issues that we all share as human beings. The issues
    we&#146;re experiencing in our meditation practice are usually much more fundamental than
    these gender-related issues.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Pat O&#146;Hara:</strong> I agree with you so
    much, Judith. I remember giving a talk about not being heard and not being seen as a
    woman. After the talk, this man came up to me and said, you know, you&#146;re talking
    about me and my life. That really helped me to see that in dealing with issues of sexism
    and racism and homophobia and that kind of thing, we&#146;re talking about
    everybody&#146;s experience.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-oOo-</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Melvin McLeod: </strong>As women, what changes
    would you like to see in the way Buddhism is practiced in the West?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Pat O&#146;Hara:</strong> I feel I haven&#146;t
    been paying enough attention to the incredible pain a lot of women feel about the lack of
    a matriarchal lineage in Buddhism. Women are not often written or spoken about in
    Buddhism. In our community, we started chanting the names of women throughout Buddhist
    history, and I saw the faces of the women in the room bathed in tears. Seeing their faces
    in tears is what woke me up to how important this is to many women.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now I and other dharma sisters in the Zen tradition have a
    different attitude towards the texts, the legends and the stories&#151;a little bit more
    quizzical, a little bit more ironic. You know, how could they all be men? Come on now.
    This is a constructed quality of all these texts, and we have to know that. It changes the
    way we talk about things and it changes our attitudes towards forms and services and
    hierarchy, the whole power relationship. Everything begins to shift a little bit, I think.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Judith Simmer-Brown:</strong> I know that women
    students who find themselves visualizing deities and lineage trees that are all men feel a
    sense of incredible loneliness and a longing for lineage figures who are female. But also,
    as the institutions of Western Buddhism get larger and more complex, women are finding it
    hard to hold their own in a variety of situations. I hear a lot of stories from my
    students of struggles to be included in the service of visiting teachers and in various
    teaching situations. These kinds of stories touch me very deeply because it&#146;s easy to
    miss, especially when you&#146;re a woman teacher. But it&#146;s not necessarily that way
    for all the women in the community.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There&#146;s another thing that needs to be remembered
    about the phenomenon of women in leadership positions in American Buddhism right now.
    There&#146;s a pattern whenever you have a new religious movement that women are often
    influential at the beginning, but one or two generations later they&#146;re gone. As these
    movements become institutionalized, the structures become increasingly patriarchal and
    women are moved out. So we have women Buddhist teachers now, but that may not be true for
    our children and grandchildren.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Barbara Rhodes:</strong> In our tradition a lot of
    the centers have the same basic type of mural, which is all men. There&#146;s the Buddha
    and all these deities, who are all men with beards and mustaches and swords and shields. I
    think I&#146;m out of touch with how programmed I&#146;ve been to accept that. I&#146;ve
    been fortunate enough to have a teacher who seems to have really respected me, but
    it&#146;s good to hear what you both just said, because I forget how much this has on some
    level demoralized me and a lot of other women. I&#146;m just used to it. I need to look at
    that issue more deeply.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Sharon Salzberg:</strong> The motivation that
    brings so many people to the dharma is looking for a sense of connection. What they find
    is exclusion rather than inclusion, and that&#146;s a source of tremendous suffering and
    heartache. So it seems very important to reach into the various traditions and bring forth
    the elements that provide inclusion and connection and welcoming.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Pat O&#146;Hara:</strong> I want to say a little
    bit about hierarchy, because it comes up all the time in my tradition. I see my dharma
    sisters doing a lot of work around the teacher not always being at the apex of some
    hierarchy, but having a different role in different situations. People are working in
    groups to share the dharma, not assuming that only the teacher is going to be able to say
    the appropriate thing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I think that&#146;s a very important aspect of what women
    can bring to Buddhism. As outsiders, not part of the hierarchy, we feel that we can
    criticize it, and then we begin to live that criticism and it changes the way things are
    done. I think that&#146;s an important element also.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Judith Simmer-Brown:</strong> Hierarchy is very
    important in the tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. Yet there are ways in which hierarchy may
    not represent the genuine mandala principle of center and fringe. There can be privilege
    granted in hierarchy that is different from a true sense of spiritual authority.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I think that&#146;s an area where there may be changes,
    but it&#146;s hard to know what kind of changes they will be. It&#146;s extremely
    important for the vajrayana practitioners in American Buddhism to honor our teachers, the
    lineages, and the hierarchical forms that allow us to really understand what spiritual
    power is. And I would view the democratization of American Buddhism as a problem if we
    began to make everything the same for the sake of whatever problems we might have with
    hierarchy. But there are appropriate hierarchies and there are inappropriate hierarchies,
    and trying to figure that out is really important.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Sharon Salzberg:</strong> I agree. I think we need
    something like a hierarchy of function which doesn&#146;t demean or denigrate anyone. The
    distinction really needs to be made.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Judith Simmer-Brown:</strong> Earlier, Pat talked
    about how difficult it was for her to be member of a Buddhist community as a single parent
    with a two-year-old. I would love to see a solidly lay Buddhism in America that is much
    more receptive to the needs of families, that incorporates the whole sense of the domestic
    life, both for mothers and fathers. We need a Buddhism that is much more accommodating to
    a lay family model, one in which serious practice is still very much the foundation. Our
    centers and communities need to work with this in an ongoing way, becoming more creative
    about it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Pat O&#146;Hara:</strong> That&#146;s absolutely
    on our plate to do. Buddhism is predominently lay in this country and people have
    families, so for Buddhism to really grow we&#146;re going to have to find those forms that
    include the family. That&#146;s happening a little in different centers now, but I believe
    it will happen more.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Sharon Salzberg:</strong> And along with that we
    have to plant the seeds of a viable monastic community. Particularly for women,
    that&#146;s the container where a sense of lineage and of tradition can be passed on.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Melvin McLeod:</strong> Which relates to
    Judith&#146;s warning that women&#146;s roles can be diminished as Western Buddhism
    becomes more established.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Sharon Salzberg:</strong> I was thinking about
    that. I was thinking about the young women I know and how, because of the degree that
    feminism has seeped into our culture, they&#146;re very different than I was at that age,
    in terms of their sense of confidence in themselves, their right to be included and their
    sense of self-respect. Reflecting on what Judith said about women&#146;s roles
    diminishing, I was thinking maybe that won&#146;t happen&#151;not because of Buddhism and
    not because of institutions, but because of the actual women involved.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Judith Simmer-Brown: </strong>Maybe it won&#146;t
    happen. That would be wonderful.</font></p>
