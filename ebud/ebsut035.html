    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>For a monastic (a monk or a nun) food is to be regarded as
    medicine and not as a pleasure. In the spirit of the Middle
    Way it should be taken in just sufficient quantity to keep
    the body healthy. In the KITAGIRI SUTTA of the MAJJHIMA
    NIKAYA is found the following passage:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;Once when the Buddha was touring in the region
        of Kasi together with a large Sangha of monks he
        addressed them saying: 'I, monks, do not eat a meal in
        the evening. Not eating a meal in the evening I, monks,
        am aware of good health and of being without illness and
        of buoyancy and strength and living in comfort. Come, do
        you too, monks, not eat a meal in the evening. Not eating
        a meal in the evening you too, monks, will be aware of
        good health and..... and living in comfort.' &quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Consequently, eating only in the period from dawn until
    noon became the tradition for Buddhist monastics, but not
    without some resistance at first. In the LATUKIKOPAMA SUTTA,
    also of the MAJJHIMA NIKAYA, Venerable Udayin spoke thus to
    the Buddha:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;We, revered sir, used to eat in the evening and
        in the morning and in the afternoon. Revered sir, the
        Lord at that time addressed the monks saying: 'Please do
        you, monks, give up eating at this wrong time during the
        afternoon'. I was depressed because of this, revered sir,
        I was sorry and thought 'The Lord speaks of our giving up
        that sumptuous food which faithful laypeople give us in
        the afternoon and of our rejecting it'. &quot;</p>
        <p>Then we used to eat (just) in the morning and in the
        evening. It was at this time that the Lord addressed the
        monks saying: 'Please do you, monks, give up eating in
        the evening'. I was depressed because of this, revered
        sir, I was sorry and thought 'The Lord speaks of our
        giving up that which is reckoned as the more sumptuous of
        these two meals and of our rejecting it'.&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>But Venerable Udayin, who, by the way, was known for being
    fat, soon got over his disappointment and realized the
    benefits of restraint in eating. Moreover, he appreciated
    that as monks obtain their food mainly on almsround, going
    out for almsfood in the evening had certain disadvantages.
    The same sutta continues:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;Once, revered sir, when monks were walking for
        almsfood in the dense darkness o the night, they would
        walk into a pond at the village entrance, or they would
        stumble into the village cesspool, or they would blunder
        into a thorny hedge or stumble into a sleeping cow, and
        they would meet young men up to no good and wanton women.
        Once, revered sir, I walked for almsfood in the dense
        darkness of the night and a certain woman saw me during a
        lightening flash as she was washing a bowl and, terrified
        at seeing me she uttered a scream of horror: 'How
        terriblefor me, indeed there is a demon after me'. This
        said, I, revered sir, said to this women: 'Sister, I am
        no demon, I am a monk standing for almsfood'. She said
        'The monks father must be dead, the monks mother must be
        dead! It were better for you, monk, to have your stomach
        cut out with a sharp butchers knife than to walk for
        almsfood for the sake of your belly in the dense darkness
        of the night'.&quot;'</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>A monk or nun who eats food outside of the proper time,
    from dawn until noon, commits an offence called PACITTIYA. To
    free themselves of the offence they have to approach a fellow
    monk or nun and tell them of their misdeed. This simple
    acknowledgement is all that is required for it serves to
    heighten one's sense of duty, and of responsibility, and so
    it is a strong incentive to be more punctilious in the
    future. Thus these rules of Vinaya do not rely on punishment
    but rather urging greater mindfulness and restraint so that
    the same mistake will not be repeated.</p>
    <p>Though solid foods are disallowed outside of the morning
    period, other substances were allowed in the afternoon or
    evening, especially where there is a need such as sickness.
    Strained fruit and vegetable juices are allowable in the
    afternoon, especially for thirsty monks and nuns. Then the
    five traditional Indian 'medicines' of ghee, oil,
    butter/cheese, honey and sugar were allowed in the afternoon
    as a 'tonic', to be used for such reasons as when a monk or
    nun had been working hard, when it was very cold, or when
    they had received insufficient almsfood that morning. Clear
    meat or bean broths are allowed in the afternoon for very
    sick monks or nuns. Drinks like tea, herbal infusions,
    ginger, cocoa and coffee are also allowable in the afternoon
    as much as a monk or nun requires. Milk, however, is the
    subject of some controversy. Some monks say it is allowable
    in the afternoon, some say it isn't and our tradition says it
    'aint.</p>
    <p>Whatever is allowable and what is not and when, a good
    monk or nun always remembers the WHY of eating. The following
    verses of the Buddha are to be reflected upon whenever taking
    nourishment and they are heard recited at Bodhinyana before
    every meal by one of the monks:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong><i>&quot;Wisely reflecting we use this
        almsfood, not for fun, not for pleasure, not for
        fattening and not for beautification. But only for the
        maintenance and nourishment of this body, for keeping it
        healthy, for helping with the holy life, thinking thus: I
        will allay hunger without overeating, so that I may
        continue to live blamelessly and at ease.&quot;</i></strong></p>
