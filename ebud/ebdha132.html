  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">NAMO TASSA BHAGAVATO ARAHATO
  SAMMASAMBUDDHASSA</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">P</font><font face="Times New Roman">robably the
  most misunderstood term in Western Buddhist circles is that usually translated as
  'attachment'. Too many have got it into their head that they shouldn't be attached to
  anything. Thus jokes abound such as the one on why the houses of Buddhists have dirt in
  the corners &#150; because they don't allow even their vacuum cleaner any attachments.
  Some misguided pseudo-Buddhists criticise those living a moral life as being attached to
  their precepts and thus praise immoral action as a sign of deep wisdom. Bah! Others in
  traditional Buddhist circles create fear of deep meditation by incorrectly stating that
  you will only get attached to the Jhanas. It all goes too far. Perhaps the pinnacle of
  mischievous misinformation was said by Rajneesh who claimed &quot;I am so detached, I am
  not even attached to detachment&quot; and thus conveniently excused all his excesses. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Pali work in question is UPADANA, literally meaning 'a
  taking up'. It is commonly used indicating a 'fuel', which sustains a process, such as the
  oil in a lamp being the fuel/upadana for the flame. It is related to craving (TANHA). For
  example, craving is reaching out for the delicious cup of coffee, Upadana is picking it
  up. Even though you think that you can easily put the cup of coffee down again, though
  your hand is not superglued to the cup, it is still Upadana. You have picked it up. You
  have grasped. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Fortunately not all Upadana is un-Buddhist. The Lord
  Buddha only specified four groups of Upadana: 'taking up' the five senses, 'taking up'
  wrong views, 'taking up' the idea that liberation may be attained simply through rites and
  initiations, and 'taking up' the view of a self. There are many other things that one may
  'take up' or grasp, but the point is that only these four groups lead to rebirth, only
  these four are fuel for future existence and further suffering, only these four are to be
  avoided.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus taking up the practice of compassion, taking up the
  practice of the Five Precepts or the greater precepts of a monk or nun, and taking up the
  practice of meditation &#150; these are not un-Buddhist and it is mischievous to
  discourage them by calling them 'attachments'. Keeping the Five Precepts is, in fact, a
  letting go of coarse desires like lust, greed and violence. Practising compassion is a
  letting go of self-centredness and practising meditation is letting go of past, future,
  thinking and much else. The achievement of Jhana is no more than the letting go of the
  world of the five senses to gain access to the mind. Nibbana is the letting go once and
  for all of greed, hatred and delusion, the seeds of rebirth. Parinibbana is the final
  letting go of body and mind (the Five Khandhas). It is wrong to suggest that any of these
  stages of letting go are the same as attachment.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The path is like a ladder. One grasps the rung above and
  lets go of the rung below to pull oneself up. Soon, the rung just grasped is the rung one
  is now standing on. Now is the time to let go of that rung as one grasps an even higher
  rung to raise oneself further. If one never grasped anything, one would remain spiritually
  stupid. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To those without wisdom, letting go may often appear as
  attachment. For example a bird on the branch of a tree at night appears to be attaching
  firmly to the branch, but it has actually let go and is fully asleep. When a bird lets go
  and the muscles around its claws begin to relax they close on the branch. The more it
  relaxes, the more the claws tighten. That's why you never see a bird fall off a perch even
  when they are asleep. It may look like attachment but, in fact, it is letting go. Letting
  go often leads to stillness, not moving from where you are, which is why it is sometimes
  mistaken as attachment.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So don't be put off by well-meaning but misinformed
  L-plate Buddhists who have completely misunderstood Upadana and attachment. Attach without
  fear to your precepts, your meditation object and to the path for it will lead to Nibbana.
  And don't forget to purchase the attachments for your vacuum cleaner too! </font></p>
