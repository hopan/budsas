    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There are a lot of good things happening in the world
    today, but unfortunately there are also a lot of unpleasant
    things going on at the same time. The most obvious and
    striking failure of humanity is the inability to live in
    peace and harmony with one another. We have so many
    conflicts, so many separations of human beings according to
    race, colour, beliefs, politics and religion. There seems to
    be a never ending source of conflict and strife in human
    beings even though it is so obvious that all human beings are
    striving for happiness. Whatever we do in life, whatever we
    undertake, wherever we go it is always in the quest for
    happiness. If we really contemplate the motivation behind all
    our actions, be it study, work, relationships, involvement in
    political or religious movements, the basic motivation behind
    that action is the quest for peace and true happiness.</p>
    <p>Buddhism is primarily concerned with peace. We say that
    the Buddha was one who was at peace, and that he taught the
    path to peace. So I feel that Buddhism must have something
    very, very relevant to share with human beings especially
    about the path to peace and true happiness.</p>
    <p>In Buddhism we say that we strive to protect ourselves and
    to protect others. By protecting myself, I protect others, by
    protecting others, I protect myself. So the aim of a Buddhist
    is to create outer harmony and inner peace. We say that
    &quot;The mind is the forerunner to all things&quot;. The
    quality of the mind is that which determines the quality of
    fife, so that if we see continuous strife, confusion and
    conflict in the world, wars, discriminations and
    exploitations then that can only reflect the quality of the
    minds of human beings. So the individual minds of human
    beings must also be in a state of confusion, conflict,
    oppression and aggression, because all actions, whether good
    or bad, have &quot;mind as the forerunner&quot;. In Buddhism
    we place great emphasis on the mind. We train the mind so
    that we begin to understand the mind, and ultimately to
    liberate it.</p>
    <p>Most people are very much caught up in living in concepts,
    beliefs and ideas. We live in the world of ideas, thinking
    about life, existence, ourselves and liberation, but that is
    not the real experience of the way things are. Thinking about
    means &quot;going around&quot;, not going to the centre or
    point. The Buddha was very much concerned with the practice
    rather than theory and I think what Buddhism has to offer
    humanity today is a way of getting to know the mind, training
    the mind and liberating the mind. If Buddhism just remains in
    the realm of intellect, that is study, the accumulation of
    knowledge, ideas and concepts, logical as they may be
    intellectually, gratifying and satisfying and stimulating as
    they may be, that will still not resolve the essence of the
    problem that humanity faces today.</p>
    <p>The essence of the problem is conflict. In the realm of
    conditioned phenomena (and conditioned phenomena here refers
    to all physical, material or mental phenomena) everything
    that is created is called in Pali <i>&quot;</i><b><i>Sankhara&quot;</i></b><i>,
    </i>that which arises and passes away. As long as we abide in
    the realm of conditioned phenomena then there will always be
    a multiplicity. There will always be a never ending variety,
    a never ending multiplicity, and where there is multiplicity
    there can never be complete peace because there is always
    conflict, there is always disagreement.</p>
    <p>Peace in the world is directly related to the peace of
    individual human beings, they are not separate, but very much
    related to each other. To create inner peace within
    individual human beings is to contribute to the outer peace
    of this world, because if we have peaceful human beings, we
    will have a peaceful world. If we have human beings who are
    confused and in conflict, the world will remain in confusion
    and conflict. If Buddhism is going to have this ability to
    contribute to world peace by contributing to the individual
    human being's realisation of peace, we must really apply the
    teachings of the Buddha, we must really get to its heart.</p>
    <p>So I very much stress the importance of practising the
    teachings of the Buddha, getting to know the mind, training
    the mind. In order to liberate the mind it requires an
    approach which aims at this particular end, the true peace of
    the mind. How can we realise true peace of the mind? It's
    certainly not by believing. Belief is always in the realm of
    concept and duality and where there is duality there must be
    conflict. So I think that when we teach Buddhism and Buddhist
    meditation we should very much be stressing the essence of
    the Buddha's teaching, which is the way to peace. We should
    remember that what the Buddha taught was a path or a road. He
    did not teach the <b><i>&quot;Lokuttara Dhamma&quot;</i></b><i>
    </i>or the ultimate truth as this truth cannot be taught. All
    He could teach was the <b><i>&quot;Sammuti Dhamma&quot;</i></b><i>,
    </i>which means the conceptual or conventional Dhamma which
    he compared to a raft. This raft is to get us from this shore
    to the other -- but please remember that the raft is not the
    other shore.</p>
    <p>His Teachings are also likened to a road to be journeyed
    upon, but the road is not the destination. With rafts and
    roads there will always be a variety and if we attach to them
    as being something absolute, there will always be conflict.</p>
    <p>The Buddha was pointing towards letting go, liberation of
    the mind, not towards tying up the mind with more concepts,
    ideas and beliefs. The Buddha was very much pointing to the
    way of liberating the mind from all concepts, all views,
    opinions and all belief. He was pointing to the essence of
    mind, and the essence of mind is not a concept. The essence
    of mind is not a view, an opinion, a belief or a thought. The
    essence of mind is bright and empty, it is the knowing mind,
    the Buddha-mind -- the &quot;one who knows&quot;.</p>
    <p>This seems all very abstract in the beginning because when
    we talk about getting to know the mind, training the mind,
    liberating the mind, unless one has taken time to stop and
    question and enquire one doesn't really know what this means.
    This is why meditation is very important, but not meditation
    as a particular technique, the technique is only concerned
    with getting to know the mind and training the mind. The
    Buddha himself taught many different meditation techniques
    and we can find many, many more techniques than one finds in
    the Buddhist scriptures. The technique is just a tool to be
    used, not some thing absolute in itself.</p>
    <p>This practise of meditation, of getting to know the mind,
    of training and liberating the mind is very, very important.
    It's a way to start breaking through the concepts, of not
    just thinking about life, but beginning to actually
    experience life, experience reality.</p>
    <p>As we train the mind in this concentration then we begin
    to understand what the mind does, what the mind is, what the
    mind is doing all the time and we begin to appreciate what
    the monkey mind really is. The monkey mind is always jumping
    from one thing to another, it's the mind that is always
    conceiving and thinking, living in concepts and continually
    reacting with desire and aversion to the experiences that we
    encounter.</p>
    <p>So we begin to notice the mind, what it does, how it
    reacts, the contents of the mind. This is the first step in
    training the mind. Then we begin to discipline the mind,
    instead of just letting it run about jumping from one thing
    to another in a continuous stream of blind activity we begin
    to say .... Stop! Let's just see if we can abide in the here
    and now and stop thinking about the here and now. Try to stop
    and be present here and now using a meditation technique.</p>
    <p>Now as the mind becomes more peaceful, clear and tranquil
    through repeated training, then we can begin to reflect. What
    does it mean to reflect? It means to look closely. If we want
    to understand the nature of the world and existence where can
    we possibly look other than in this very mind. The Buddha
    said that the Dhamma is to be seen in this fathom long body
    with it's perceptions and feelings. Within this body and mind
    Dhamma is to be seen, so that when we train the mind and the
    mind is reasonably clear we can look and see everything
    within the mind. The mind is that which knows, the body can
    only offer the sense faculties of sight, heating, smelling,
    tasting and touching and the brain the facility for thinking
    and creating. What is it that knows? It is the mind that
    knows. Where is the world? It is in the mind. It is the mind
    which knows the world through the senses, there is no other
    way that we can know the world. So, if we want to understand
    the world, if we want to understand the nature of existence
    we must come and look at the nature of the mind. We must come
    and observe and enquire into the mind, we must dwell within
    and observe with a clear mind.</p>
    <p>Now this is of great benefit and of great value to
    humanity and to individual peace, because it is the way to
    resolve all duality and all conflicts because when we begin
    to look deeply and observe the mind we can begin to stop
    living in the world of concepts and stop living in the world
    of just believing. As Buddhists we are not interested in just
    believing something. The Buddha was pointing to something
    which was beyond concepts, beyond views and opinions, beyond
    just belief. He was pointing to something that can be
    experienced, the essence of the mind which can know the
    nature of all conditioned phenomena. </p>
    <p>The source of strife is that people believe conditioned
    phenomena, they take refuge in views and opinions through
    attachment. To take refuge means to &quot;hold on to&quot;,
    and what do we hold onto? The fact that there is so much
    conflict in the world can only indicate that people hold onto
    conditioned phenomena, hold on to the body as being self, my
    body. If I hold on to the opinion that I am a European, a
    male then I am at odds with the Asian, and the female. I have
    made a difference, a distinction and a separation. Or if I
    hold on to my views that we should have nuclear disarmament,
    then I am at odds again with the people who believe that
    there should not be nuclear disarmament. If I believe there
    is no God, so I am at odds with the person who says &quot;I
    believe there is a God&quot;. Now we see that the source of
    conflict and limitation here is this believing in or taking
    refuge in concepts, conditioned phenomena, <b>sankhara</b>.</p>
    <p>As a Buddhist, one who takes refuge in the Buddha,
    &quot;the one who knows&quot;, this is not a concept, an idea
    or a belief. It is a knowing in the present moment. As a
    Buddhist we take refuge in the Dhamma, not the Dhamma as the
    spoken or written word or the concepts and cultural
    peculiarities of one sect or another, but the Dhamma as the
    realisation of &quot;the way things are&quot;. The Dhamma is
    the truth of the way things are, so that now, through
    meditation, we incline towards this knowing through the mind,
    that which is peaceful and clear through the mind. We begin
    to reflect and have a new perspective on ourselves and the
    experience of life.</p>
    <p>So this is a practice which is of great relevance to us as
    individual human beings striving for true peace and
    happiness, but also of relevance to the world as a whole
    because it is the way to resolve all the conflicts, it is the
    way for humanity to get beyond the duality and begin to
    resolve the source of all conflict. Without this ability to
    turn to the depths and essence of the mind to gain a true
    perspective on this life, humanity will always be caught in
    the conceptual, there will always be multiplicity and
    duality. For Buddhist people who want to follow in the path
    of the Buddha this is something we can really offer to
    humanity today and we can offer it not just by talking about
    it, but essentially by living it.</p>
    <p>We as Buddhists have a wonderful message which is of great
    relevance, so if we as individual Buddhists can be an example
    of this, by living in this way, by practising in this way,
    then I think we will be truly a benefit to this world and to
    Buddhism.</p>
