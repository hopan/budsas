<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We are often faced with difficult choices in life when it
  seems equally disadvantageous not to say anything than to say it at all. If we seem
  apathetic about things, we run the risk of being branded a fence-sitter or a
  &quot;couldn't-be-bothered&quot; person. If we are vocal about how we feel, we run the
  risk of being called a &quot;young Turk&quot; or a &quot;blunt&quot; person. So when do we
  say what, or do we say anything at all? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Business people have this unwritten rule: not to condemn
  others if someone asked you for your opinion of so-and-so. But if so-and-so is real
  con-men, you will advice that someone who asked you to be cautious when dealing with
  so-and-so. There is no need for you to assassinate so-and-so's character, calling him a
  bloody-fool and what not. Which brings us to the next unwritten rule: if you speak ill of
  others to somebody, that somebody also knows that you are capable of speaking ill about
  him. Two simple &quot;rules&quot; in business we can safely adopt to avoid unnecessary
  trouble with others and most importantly, ourselves! </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There a multitude of reasons why we choose to say
  something unfavourable about people: self-righteousness, holier-than-thou attitude,
  resentment, taking umbrage, malevolence, deceitfulness, cunning, trickery, chicanery,
  hypocrisy, misrepresentation, character-baiting, intolerance, bigotry, dogmatism, etc. But
  it all boils down to one <em>asava</em> (canker), that is the canker of fault finding. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Acharya Buddharakkita (from the book, <em>Mind Overcoming
  Its Cankers</em>) has this to say, </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Fault-finding mirror's one's own mind. A mirror
    reflects objects, and fault-finding reflects one's own traits. There is no flaw which
    damages one's character more, and aggravates one's mental wound, the <em>asava</em>, more
    than the habit of fault-finding.&quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">During the Buddha's time, a group of monks who could stand
  it no longer complained to Him about the persistent comments of a fault-finding monk.
  After hearing them, the Master said, </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Monks, if one who strictly practises the rules of
    holy life, and who, in order to instruct others, were to point out faults, then it does
    not amount to fault finding. But if one, out of a censorious proclivity (tendency), goes
    about cavilling like this monk, for the sole purpose of seeking holes in others, such a
    person <em>never</em> achieves the ecstatic absorptions and supernormal attainments. For
    such, the cankers only grow.&quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thereafter, in conclusion, the Blessed One pronounced this
  verse: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;He who seeks other's faults,<br>
    Who is ever censorious,<br>
    His cankers only grow,<br>
    He is far from destroying cankers&quot;<br>
    </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dhammapada
    </em>253</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Pointing out the flaw <em>out of concern for
  another's well-being</em> has been praised by the Buddha. If a person wants to remove a
  defect, a lapse or blemish in us, nothing can be more praiseworthy than him or her
  pointing it out to us. For it has been said that one who points out our faults is <em>kalyanamitra</em>,
  a true friend. </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Should you find one who points out
    faults,<br>
    As though indicating a hidden treasure,<br>
    Follow such a sagacious man,<br>
    A wise person who corrects you.<br>
    It is always better and never worse,<br>
    To cultivate such an association.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Let him admonish and instruct,<br>
    And let him shield you from evil.<br>
    He indeed is dear to the good,<br>
    Though he be detestable to the evil.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Do not associate with the evil companions.<br>
    Do not seek the fellowship of the vile.<br>
    Associate with true friend.<br>
    Seek the fellowship of noble men.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dhammapada
    </em>76-78</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In the final analysis, it is our <em>cetana</em>
  (intentions) that matters. If we are really sincere about someone's welfare, then what we
  say to him or her deserves praise. But if our intention is suspect, for instance, telling
  for the sake of telling or to make others lose faith in another person, then we better not
  say anything at all. Acharya Buddharakkhita sounded this warning, </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When a portion of a hill slides down or
    cave in, it blocks the road and disrupts the traffic; even so it is with
    fault-finding.&quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Our spiritual path will exactly be like that
  if we are careless with our tongues. We will do well to remind ourselves time and again
  that it is Nibbana that we seek and not another meaningless role as a pseudo-judge of
  other people's deficiencies. </font></p>
