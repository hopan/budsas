    <p>What exactly is vipassana? </p>
    <p>Almost any book on early Buddhist meditation will tell you
    that the Buddha taught two types of meditation: samatha and
    vipassana. <i>Samatha,</i> which means tranquility, is said
    to be a method fostering strong states of mental absorption,
    called <i>jhana.</i> <i>Vipassana</i> -- literally
    &quot;clear-seeing,&quot; but more often translated as
    insight meditation -- is said to be a method using a modicum
    of tranquility to foster moment-to-moment mindfulness of the
    inconstancy of events as they are directly experienced in the
    present. This mindfulness creates a sense of dispassion
    toward all events, thus leading the mind to release from
    suffering. These two methods are quite separate, we're told,
    and of the two, vipassana is the distinctive Buddhist
    contribution to meditative science. Other systems of practice
    pre-dating the Buddha also taught samatha, but the Buddha was
    the first to discover and teach vipassana. Although some
    Buddhist meditators may practice samatha meditation before
    turning to vipassana, samatha practice is not really
    necessary for the pursuit of Awakening. As a meditative tool,
    the vipassana method is sufficient for attaining the goal. Or
    so we're told. </p>
    <p>But if you look directly at the Pali discourses -- the
    earliest extant sources for our knowledge of the Buddha's
    teachings -- you'll find that although they do use the word
    samatha to mean tranquility, and vipassana to mean
    clear-seeing, they otherwise confirm none of the received
    wisdom about these terms. Only rarely do they make use of the
    word vipassana -- a sharp contrast to their frequent use of
    the word jhana. When they depict the Buddha telling his
    disciples to go meditate, they never quote him as saying
    &quot;go do vipassana,&quot; but always &quot;go do
    jhana.&quot; And they never equate the word vipassana with
    any mindfulness techniques. In the few instances where they
    do mention vipassana, they almost always pair it with samatha
    -- not as two alternative methods, but as two qualities of
    mind that a person may &quot;gain&quot; or &quot;be endowed
    with,&quot; and that should be developed together. One
    simile, for instance (<a
    href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/samyutta/sn35-204.html">S.XXXV.204</a>),
    compares samatha and vipassana to a swift pair of messengers
    who enter the citadel of the body via the noble eightfold
    path and present their accurate report -- Unbinding, or
    nibbana -- to the consciousness acting as the citadel's
    commander. Another passage (<a
    href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/anguttara/an10-71.html">A.X.71</a>)
    recommends that anyone who wishes to put an end to mental
    defilement should -- in addition to perfecting the principles
    of moral behavior and cultivating seclusion -- be committed
    to samatha and endowed with vipassana. This last statement is
    unremarkable in itself, but the same discourse also gives the
    same advice to anyone who wants to master the jhanas: be
    committed to samatha and endowed with vipassana. This
    suggests that, in the eyes of those who assembled the Pali
    discourses, samatha, jhana, and vipassana were all part of a
    single path. Samatha and vipassana were used together to
    master jhana and then -- based on jhana -- were developed
    even further to give rise to the end of mental defilement and
    to bring release from suffering. This is a reading that finds
    support in other discourses as well. </p>
    <p>There's a passage, for instance, describing three ways in
    which samatha and vipassana can work together to lead to the
    knowledge of Awakening: either samatha precedes vipassana,
    vipassana precedes samatha, or they develop in tandem (<a
    href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/anguttara/an4-170.html">A.IV.170</a>).
    The wording suggests an image of two oxen pulling a cart: one
    is placed before the other or they are yoked side-by-side.
    Another passage (<a
    href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/anguttara/an4-94.html">A.IV.94</a>)
    indicates that if samatha precedes vipassana -- or vipassana,
    samatha -- one's practice is in a state of imbalance and
    needs to be rectified. A meditator who has attained a measure
    of samatha, but no &quot;vipassana into events based on
    heightened discernment <i>(adhipañña-dhamma-vipassana),&quot;</i>
    should question a fellow meditator who has attained
    vipassana: &quot;How should fabrications <i>(sankhara)</i> be
    regarded? How should they be investigated? How should they be
    viewed with insight?&quot; and then develop vipassana in line
    with that person's instructions. The verbs in these questions
    -- &quot;regarding,&quot; &quot;investigating,&quot;
    &quot;seeing&quot; -- indicate that there's more to the
    process of developing vipassana than a simple mindfulness
    technique. In fact, as we will see below, these verbs apply
    instead to a process of skillful questioning called
    &quot;appropriate attention.&quot; </p>
    <p>The opposite case -- a meditator endowed with a measure of
    vipassana into events based on heightened discernment, but no
    samatha -- should question someone who has attained samatha:
    &quot;How should the mind be steadied? How should it be made
    to settle down? How should it be unified? How should it be
    concentrated?&quot; and then follow that person's
    instructions so as to develop samatha. The verbs used here
    give the impression that &quot;samatha&quot; in this context
    means jhana, for they correspond to the verbal formula --
    &quot;the mind becomes steady, settles down, grows unified
    and concentrated&quot; -- that the Pali discourses use
    repeatedly to describe the attainment of jhana. This
    impression is reinforced when we note that in every case
    where the discourses are explicit about the levels of
    concentration needed for insight to be liberating, those
    levels are the jhanas. </p>
    <p>Once the meditator is endowed with both samatha and
    vipassana, he/she should &quot;make an effort to establish
    those very same skillful qualities to a higher degree for the
    ending of the mental fermentations <i>(asava</i> -- sensual
    passion, states of being, views, and ignorance).&quot; This
    corresponds to the path of samatha and vipassana developing
    in tandem. A passage in <a
    href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/majjhima/mn149.html">M.149</a>
    describes how this can happen. One knows and sees, as they
    actually are, the six sense media (the five senses plus the
    intellect), their objects, consciousness at each medium,
    contact at each medium, and whatever is experienced as
    pleasure, pain, or neither-pleasure-nor-pain based on that
    contact. One maintains this awareness in such a way as to
    stay uninfatuated by any of these things, unattached,
    unconfused, focused on their drawbacks, abandoning any
    craving for them: this would count as vipassana. At the same
    time -- abandoning physical and mental disturbances,
    torments, and distresses -- one experiences ease in body and
    mind: this would count as samatha. This practice not only
    develops samatha and vipassana in tandem, but also brings the
    37 <a
    href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/ddp/wings/index.html">Wings
    to Awakening</a> -- which include the attainment of jhana --
    to the culmination of their development. </p>
    <p>So the proper path is one in which vipassana and samatha
    are brought into balance, each supporting and acting as a
    check on the other. Vipassana helps keep tranquility from
    becoming stagnant and dull. Samatha helps prevent the
    manifestations of aversion -- such as nausea, dizziness,
    disorientation, and even total blanking out -- that can occur
    when the mind is trapped against its will in the present
    moment. </p>
    <p>From this description it's obvious that samatha and
    vipassana are not separate paths of practice, but instead are
    complementary ways of relating to the present moment: samatha
    provides a sense of ease in the present; vipassana, a
    clear-eyed view of events as they actually occur, in and of
    themselves. It's also obvious why the two qualities need to
    function together in mastering jhana. As the standard
    instructions on breath meditation indicate (<a
    href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/majjhima/mn118.html">M.118</a>),
    such a mastery involves three things: gladdening,
    concentrating, and liberating the mind. <i>Gladdening</i>
    means finding a sense of refreshment and satisfaction in the
    present. <i>Concentrating</i> means keeping the mind focused
    on its object, while <i>liberating</i> means freeing the mind
    from the grosser factors making up a lower stage of
    concentration so as to attain a higher stage. The first two
    activities are functions of samatha, while the last is a
    function of vipassana. All three must function together. If,
    for example, there is concentration and gladdening, with no
    letting go, the mind wouldn't be able to refine its
    concentration at all. The factors that have to be abandoned
    in raising the mind from stage <i>x</i> to stage <i>y</i>
    belong to the set of factors that got the mind to <i>x</i> in
    the first place (<a
    href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/anguttara/an9-34.html">A.IX.34</a>).
    Without the ability clearly to see mental events in the
    present, there would be no way skillfully to release the mind
    from precisely the right factors that tie it to a lower state
    of concentration and act as disturbances to a higher one. If,
    on the other hand, there is simply a letting go of those
    factors, without an appreciation of or steadiness in the
    stillness that remains, the mind would drop out of jhana
    altogether. Thus samatha and vipassana must work together to
    bring the mind to right concentration in a masterful way. </p>
    <p>The question arises: if vipassana functions in the mastery
    of jhana, and jhana is not exclusive to Buddhists, then what
    is Buddhist about vipassana? The answer is that vipassana <i>per
    se</i> is not exclusively Buddhist. What is distinctly
    Buddhist is (1) the extent to which both samatha and
    vipassana are developed; and (2) the way they are developed
    -- i.e., the line of questioning used to foster them; and (3)
    the way they are combined with an arsenal of meditative tools
    to bring the mind to total release. </p>
    <p>In M.73, the Buddha advises a monk who has mastered jhana
    to further develop samatha and vipassana so as to master six
    cognitive skills, the most important of them being that
    &quot;through the ending of the mental fermentations, one
    remains in the fermentation-free release of awareness and
    release of discernment, having known and made them manifest
    for oneself right in the here and now.&quot; This is a
    description of the Buddhist goal. Some commentators have
    asserted that this release is totally a function of
    vipassana, but there are discourses that indicate otherwise. </p>
    <p>Note that release is twofold: release of awareness and
    release of discernment. Release of awareness occurs when a
    meditator becomes totally dispassionate toward passion: this
    is the ultimate function of samatha. Release of discernment
    occurs when there is dispassion for ignorance: this is the
    ultimate function of vipassana (<a
    href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/anguttara/an2-29.html">A.II.29-30</a>).
    Thus both samatha and vipassana are involved in the twofold
    nature of this release. </p>
    <p>The <i>Sabbasava Sutta</i> (<a
    href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/majjhima/mn2.html">M.2</a>)
    states that one's release can be
    &quot;fermentation-free&quot; only if one knows and sees in
    terms of &quot;appropriate attention&quot; <i>(yoniso
    manasikara).</i> As the discourse shows, appropriate
    attention means asking the proper questions about phenomena,
    regarding them not in terms of self/other or being/non-being,
    but in terms of the four noble truths. In other words,
    instead of asking &quot;Do I exist? Don't I exist? What am
    I?&quot; one asks about an experience, &quot;Is this stress?
    The origination of stress? The cessation of stress? The path
    leading to the cessation of stress?&quot; Because each of
    these categories entails a duty, the answer to these
    questions determines a course of action: stress should be
    comprehended, its origination abandoned, its cessation
    realized, and the path to its cessation developed. </p>
    <p>Samatha and vipassana belong to the category of the path
    and so should be developed. To develop them, one must apply
    appropriate attention to the task of comprehending stress,
    which is comprised of the five aggregates of clinging --
    clinging to physical form, feeling, perception, mental
    fabrications, and consciousness. Applying appropriate
    attention to these aggregates means viewing them in terms of
    their drawbacks, as &quot;inconstant, stressful, a disease, a
    cancer, an arrow, painful, an affliction, alien, a
    dissolution, an emptiness, not-self&quot; (<a
    href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/samyutta/sn22-122.html">S.XXII.122</a>).
    A list of questions, distinctive to the Buddha, aids in this
    approach: &quot;Is this aggregate constant or
    inconstant?&quot; &quot;And is anything inconstant easeful or
    stressful?&quot; &quot;And is it fitting to regard what is
    inconstant, stressful, subject to change as: 'This is mine.
    This is my self. This is what I am'?&quot; (<a
    href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/samyutta/sn22-59.html">S.XXII.59</a>).
    These questions are applied to every instance of the five
    aggregates, whether &quot;past, future, or present; internal
    or external; blatant or subtle, common or sublime, far or
    near.&quot; In other words, the meditator asks these
    questions of all experiences in the cosmos of the six sense
    media. </p>
    <p>This line of questioning is part of a strategy leading to
    a level of knowledge called &quot;knowing and seeing things
    as they actually are <i>(yatha-bhuta-ñana-dassana),&quot;</i>
    where things are understood in terms of a fivefold
    perspective: their arising, their passing away, their
    drawbacks, their allure, and the escape from them -- the
    escape, here, lying in dispassion. </p>
    <p>Some commentators have suggested that, in practice, this
    fivefold perspective can be gained simply by focusing on the
    arising and passing away of these aggregates in the present
    moment; if one's focus is relentless enough, it will lead
    naturally to a knowledge of drawbacks, allure, and escape,
    sufficient for total release. The texts, however, don't
    support this reading, and practical experience would seem to
    back them up. As M.101 points out, individual meditators will
    discover that, in some cases, they can develop dispassion for
    a particular cause of stress simply by watching it with
    equanimity; but in other cases, they will need to make a
    conscious exertion to develop the dispassion that will
    provide an escape. The discourse is vague -- perhaps
    deliberately so -- as to which approach will work where. This
    is something each meditator must test for him or herself in
    practice. </p>
    <p>The <i>Sabbasava Sutta</i> expands on this point by
    listing seven approaches to take in developing dispassion.
    Vipassana, as a quality of mind, is related to all seven, but
    most directly with the first: &quot;seeing,&quot; i.e.,
    seeing events in terms of the four noble truths and the
    duties appropriate to them. The remaining six approaches
    cover ways of carrying out those duties: restraining the mind
    from focusing on sense data that would provoke unskillful
    states of mind; reflecting on the appropriate reasons for
    using the requisites of food, clothing, shelter, and
    medicine; tolerating painful sensations; avoiding obvious
    dangers and inappropriate companions; destroying thoughts of
    sensual desire, ill will, harmfulness, and other unskillful
    states; and developing the seven factors of awakening:
    mindfulness, analysis of qualities, persistence, rapture,
    serenity, concentration, and equanimity. </p>
    <p>Each of these approaches covers a wide subset of
    approaches. Under &quot;destroying,&quot; for instance, one
    may eliminate an unskillful mental state by replacing it with
    a skillful one, focusing on its drawbacks, turning one's
    attention away from it, relaxing the process of
    thought-fabrication that formed it, or suppressing it with
    the brute power of one's will (<a
    href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/majjhima/mn20.html">M.20</a>).
    Many similar examples could be drawn from other discourses as
    well. The overall point is that the ways of the mind are
    varied and complex. Different fermentations can come bubbling
    up in different guises and respond to different approaches.
    One's skill as a meditator lies in mastering a variety of
    approaches and developing the sensitivity to know which
    approach will work best in which situation. </p>
    <p>On a more basic level, however, one needs strong
    motivation to master these skills in the first place. Because
    appropriate attention requires abandoning dichotomies that
    are so basic to the thought patterns of all people --
    &quot;being/not being&quot; and &quot;me/not me&quot; --
    meditators need strong reasons for adopting it. This is why
    the <i>Sabbasava Sutta</i> insists that anyone developing
    appropriate attention must first must hold the noble ones
    (here meaning the Buddha and his awakened disciples) in high
    regard. In other words, one must see that those who have
    followed the path are truly exemplary. One must also be
    well-versed in their teaching and discipline. According to <a
    href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/majjhima/mn117.html">M.117</a>,
    &quot;being well-versed in their teaching&quot; begins with
    having conviction in their teachings about karma and rebirth,
    which provide intellectual and emotional context for adopting
    the four noble truths as the basic categories of experience.
    Being well-versed in the discipline of the noble ones would
    include, in addition to observing the precepts, having some
    skill in the seven approaches mentioned above for abandoning
    the fermentations. </p>
    <p>Without this sort of background, meditators might bring
    the wrong attitudes and questions to the practice of watching
    arising and passing away in the present moment. For instance,
    they might be looking for a &quot;true self&quot; and end up
    identifying -- consciously or unconsciously -- with the vast,
    open sense of awareness that embraces all change, from which
    it all seems to come and to which it all seems to return. Or
    they might long for a sense of connectedness with the vast
    interplay of the universe, convinced that -- as all things
    are changing -- any desire for changelessness is neurotic and
    life-denying. For people with agendas like these, the simple
    experience of events arising and passing away in the present
    won't lead to fivefold knowledge of things as they are.
    They'll resist recognizing that the ideas they hold to are a
    fermentation of views, or that the experiences of calm that
    seem to verify those ideas are simply a fermentation in the
    form of a state of being. As a result, they won't be willing
    to apply the four noble truths to those ideas and
    experiences. Only a person willing to see those fermentations
    as such, and convinced of the need to transcend them, will be
    in a position to apply the principles of appropriate
    attention to them and thus get beyond them. </p>
    <p>So, to answer the question with which we began: Vipassana
    is not a meditation technique. It's a quality of mind -- the
    ability to see events clearly in the present moment. Although
    mindfulness is helpful in fostering vipassana, it's not
    enough for developing vipassana to the point of total
    release. Other techniques and approaches are needed as well.
    In particular, vipassana needs to be teamed with samatha --
    the ability to center the mind comfortably in states of
    strong absorption, or jhana. Only then will the mind have the
    sense of stability, balance, and ease it needs to apply a
    skillful program of questioning called appropriate attention
    to all experience: exploring events not in terms of me/not
    me, or being/not being, but in terms of the four noble
    truths. The meditator pursues this program until it leads to
    a fivefold understanding of all events: in terms of their
    arising, their passing away, their drawbacks, their allure,
    and the escape from them. Only then can the mind taste
    release. </p>
    <p>This program for developing vipassana and samatha, in
    turn, needs the support of many other attitudes, mental
    qualities, and techniques of practice. This was why the
    Buddha taught it as part of a still larger program, including
    respect for the noble ones, mastery of all seven approaches
    for abandoning the mental fermentations, and all eight
    factors of the noble path. To take a reductionist approach to
    the practice can produce only reduced results, for meditation
    is a skill like carpentry, requiring a mastery of many tools
    in response to many different needs. To limit oneself to only
    one approach in meditation would be like trying to build a
    house when one's motivation is uncertain and one's tool box
    contains nothing but hammers. </p>
