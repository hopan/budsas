      Conditioned by fivefold sense-impression arises consciousness, and together with it the
      three other 'Groups of Existence', i.e. Feeling, Perception, and mental Formations. Thus

    'In me is lust'; knows when there is 'Anger' (vyaapaada) in him: 'In me is anger'; knows
    when there is 'Torpor and Sloth' (thiina-middha) in him: 'In me is torpor and sloth';

    restlessness and mental worry'; knows when there are 'Doubts' (vicikicchaa) in him: 'In me
    are doubts'. He knows when these hindrances are not in him: 'In me these hindrances are
    not'. He knows how they come to arise; knows how, once arisen, they are overcome; and he
    knows how they do not rise again in the future. </font></p>

    <blockquote>
      <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">For example, 'Lust' arises through unwise thinking on
      the agreeable and delightful. It may be suppressed by the following six methods: fixing
      the mind upon an idea that arouses disgust; contemplation of the loathsomeness of the
      body; controlling one's six senses; moderation in eating; friendship with wise and good
      men; right instruction. Lust and anger are for ever extinguished upon attainment of
      Anaagaamiiship; 'Restlessness' is extinguished by reaching Arahatship; 'Mental Worry', by
      reaching Sotapanship. </font></em></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Watching over In - and Out-breathing (aanaapaana-sati),
    practised and developed, brings the Four 'Foundations of Mindfulness' to perfection; the
    four foundations of mindfulness, practised and developed, bring the seven 'Elements of
    Enlightenment' to perfection; the seven elements of enlightenment, practised and
    developed, bring 'Wisdom and Deliverance' to perfection. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But how does Watching over In- and Out-breathing,
    practised and developed, bring the four 'Foundations of Mindfulness' (satipa.t.thaana) to
    perfection? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I. Whenever the disciple (1) mindfully makes a long
    inhalation or exhalation, or (2) makes a short inhalation or exhalation, or (3) trains
    himself to inhale or exhale whilst experiencing the whole (breath-) body, or (4) whilst
    calming down this bodily function (i.e. the breath)-at such a time the disciple dwells in
    'contemplation of the body', full of energy, comprehending it, mindful, after subduing
    worldly greed and grief. For, inhalation and exhalation I call one amongst the corporeal
    phenomena. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">II. Whenever the disciple trains himself to inhale or
    exhale (1) whilst feeling rapture (piiti), or (2) joy (sukha), or (3) the mental functions
    (cittasankhaara), or (4) whilst calming down the mental functions-at such a time he dwells
    in 'contemplation of the feelings', full of energy, clearly comprehending them, mindful,
    after subduing worldly greed and grief. For, the full awareness of In- and Out-breathing I
    call one amongst the feelings. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">III. Whenever the disciple trains himself to inhale or
    exhale (1) whilst experiencing the mind, or (2) whilst gladdening the mind, or (3) whilst
    concentrating the mind, or (4) whilst setting the mind free--at such a time he dwells in
    'contemplation of the mind', full of energy, clearly comprehending it, mindful, after
    subduing worldly greed and grief. For, without mindfulness and clear comprehension, I say,
    there is no Watching over In- and Out-breathing. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">IV. Whenever the disciple trains himself to inhale or
    exhale whilst contemplating (1) impermanence, or (2) the fading away of passion, or (3)
    extinction, or (4) detachment-at such a time he dwells in 'contemplation of the
    mind-objects', full of energy, clearly comprehending them, mindful, after subduing worldly
    greed and grief. Having seen, through understanding, what is the abandoning of greed and
    grief, he looks on with complete equanimity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Watching over In- and Out-breathing, thus practised and
    developed, brings the four Foundations of Mindfulness to perfection. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But how do the four Foundations of Mindfulness, practised
    and developed, bring the seven 'Elements of Enlightenment' (bojjhanga) to full perfection?
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Whenever the disciple dwells in contemplation of body,
    feelings, mind and mind-objects, strenuous, clearly comprehending them, mindful, after
    subduing worldly greed and grief-at such a time his mindfulness is undisturbed; and
    whenever his mindfulness is present and undisturbed, at such a time he has gained and
    develops the Element of Enlightenment 'Mindfulness' (sati-sambojjhanga); and thus this
    element of enlightenment reaches fullest perfection. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. And whenever, whilst dwelling with mindfulness, he
    wisely investigates, examines and thinks over the 'Law' (dhamma)-at such a time he has
    gained and develops the Element of Enlightenment 'Investigation of the Law'
    (dhammavicaya-sambojjhanga); and thus this element of enlightenment reaches fullest
    perfection. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. And whenever, whilst wisely investigating, examining
    and thinking over the law, his energy is firm and unshaken-at such a time he has gained
    and develops the Element of Enlightenment 'Energy' (viriya-sambojjhanga); and thus this
    element of enlightenment reaches fullest perfection. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. And whenever in him, whilst firm in energy, arises
    super-sensuous rapture-at such a time he has gained and develops the Element of
    Enlightenment 'Rapture' (piiti-sambojjhanga); and thus this element of enlightenment
    reaches fullest perfection. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">5. And whenever, whilst enraptured in mind, his spiritual
    frame and his mind become tranquil-at such a time he has gained and develops the Element
    of Enlightenment 'Tranquillity' (passaddhi-sambojjhanga); and thus this element of
    enlightenment reaches fullest perfection. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">6. And whenever, whilst being tranquillized in his
    spiritual frame and happy, his mind becomes concentrated-at such a time he has gained and
    develops the Element of Enlightenment 'Concentration' (samaadhi-sambojjhanga); and thus
    this element of enlightenment reaches fullest perfection. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">7. And whenever he looks with complete indifference on his
    mind thus concentrated-at such a time he has gained and develops the Element of
    Enlightenment 'Equanimity' (upekkhaa-sambojjhanga); and thus this element of enlightenment
    reaches fullest perfection. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The four Foundations of Mindfulness, thus practised and
    developed, bring the seven elements of enlightenment to full perfection. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And how do the seven elements of enlightenment, practised
    and developed, bring Wisdom and Deliverance (vijjaa-vimutti) to full perfection? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Herein the disciple develops the elements of
    enlightenment: Mindfulness, Investigation of the Law, Energy, Rapture, Tranquillity,
    Concentration and Equanimity, based on detachment, on absence of desire, on extinction and
    renunciation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The seven elements of enlightenment thus practised and

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Just as the elephant hunter drives a huge stake into the
    ground and chains the wild elephant to it by the neck, in order to drive out of him his
    wonted forest ways and wishes, his forest unruliness, obstinacy and violence, and to
    accustom him to the environment of the village, and to teach him such good behavior as is
    required amongst men: in like manner also should the noble disciple fix his mind firmly to
    these four Foundations of Mindfulness, so that he may drive out of himself his wonted
    worldly ways and wishes, his wonted worldly unruliness, obstinacy and violence, and win to
    the True, and realize Nibbaana. </font></p>
