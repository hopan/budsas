    <h1 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">Introduction</font></h1>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="998831"></a></font></p>
    <h2 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">BUDDHA or Enlightened One-lit. Knower or Awakened One-is
    the honorific name given to the Indian Sage, Gotama, who discovered and proclaimed to the
    world the Law of Deliverance, known to the West by the name of Buddhism. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He was born in the 6th century B.C., at Kapilavatthu, as
    the son of the king who ruled the Sakya country, a principality situated in the border
    area of modern Nepal. His persona1 name was Siddhattha, and his clan name Gotama
    (Sanskrit: Gautama). In his 29th year he renounced the splendor of his princely life and
    his royal career, and became a homeless ascetic in order to find a way out of what he had
    early recognized as a world of suffering. After a six year's quest, spent under various
    religious teachers and in a period of fruitless self-mortification, he finally attained to
    Perfect Enlightenment (<em>sammaa-sambodhi</em>), under the Bodhi tree at Gayaa (today <em>Buddh-Gayaa</em>).
    Five and forty years of tireless preaching and teaching followed and at last, in his 80th
    year, there passed away at Kusinara that 'undeluded being that appeared for the blessing
    and happiness of the world.' </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha is neither a god nor a prophet or incarnation
    of a god, but a supreme human being who, through his own effort, attained to Final
    Deliverance and Perfect Wisdom, and became 'the peerless teacher of gods and men.' He is a
    'Saviour' only in the sense that he shows men how to save themselves, by actually
    following to the end the Path trodden and shown by him. In the consummate harmony of
    Wisdom and Compassion attained by the Buddha, he embodies the universal and timeless ideal
    of Man Perfected. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="998936"></a></font></p>
    <h2 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">The Dhamma</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Dhamma is the Teaching of Deliverance in its entirety,
    as discovered, realized and proclaimed by the Buddha. It has been handed down in the
    ancient Pali language, and preserved in three great collections of hooks, called <em>Ti-Pi.taka</em>,
    the &quot;Three Baskets,&quot; namely: (I) the <em>Vinaya-pi.t aka</em>, or Collection of
    Discipline, containing the rules of the monastic order; (II) the <em>Sutta-pi.taka</em>,
    or Collection of Discourses, consisting of various books of discourses, dialogues, verses,
    stories, etc. and dealings with the doctrine proper as summarized in the Four Noble
    Truths; (Ill) the <em>Abhidhamma-pi.taka</em>, or Philosophical Collection; presenting the
    teachings of the <em>Sutta-Pi.taka</em> in strictly systematic and philosophical form. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Dhamma is not a doctrine of revelation, but the
    teaching of Enlightenment based on the clear comprehension of actuality. It is the
    teaching of the Fourfold Truth dealing with the fundamental facts of life and with
    liberation attainable through man's own effort towards purification and insight. The
    Dhamma offers a lofty, but realistic, system of ethics, a penetrative analysis of life, a
    profound philosophy, practical methods of mind training-in brief, an all-comprehensive and
    perfect guidance on the Path to Deliverance. By answering the claims of both heart and
    reason, and by pointing out the liberating Middle Path that leads beyond all futile and
    destructive extremes in thought and conduct, the Dhamma has, and will always have, a
    timeless and universal appeal wherever there are hearts and minds mature enough to
    appreciate its message. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="998959"></a></font></p>
    <h2 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">The Sangha</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Sangha-lit. the Assembly, or community-is the Order of
    Bhikkhus or Mendicant Monks, founded by the Buddha and still existing in its original form
    in Burma, Siam, Ceylon, Cambodia, Laos and Chittagong (Bengal). It is, together with the
    Order of the Jain monks, the oldest monastic order in the world. Amongst the most famous
    disciples in the time of the Buddha were: <em>Saariputta</em> who, after the Master
    himself, possessed the profoundest insight info the Dhamma; <em>Moggallaana</em>, who had
    the greatest supernatural powers: <em>Ananda</em>, the devoted disciple and constant
    companion of the Buddha; <em>Mahaa-Kassapa</em>, the President of the Council held at
    Rajagaha immediately after the Buddha's death; <em>Anuruddha</em>, of divine vision, and
    master of Right Mindfulness; <em>Raahula</em>, the Buddha's own son. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Sangha provides the outer framework and the favorable
    conditions for all those who earnestly desire to devote their life entirely to the
    realization of the highest goal of deliverance, unhindered by worldly distractions. Thus
    the Sangha, too, is of universal and timeless significance wherever religious development
    reaches maturity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="999064"></a></font></p>
    <h2 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">The Threefold Refuge</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, are called 'The
    Three Jewels' (<em>ti-ratana</em>) on account of their matchless purity, and as being to
    the Buddhist the most precious objects in the world. These 'Three Jewels' form also the
    'Threefold Refuge' (<em>ti-sara.na</em>) of the Buddhist, in the words by which he
    professes, or re-affirms, his acceptance of them as the guides of his life and thought. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Pali formula of Refuge is still the same as in the
    Buddha's time: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="998859"></a></font><dl>
      <dd><em><font face="Times New Roman">Buddha.m sara.na.m gacchaami <a name="998860"></a> </font></em></dd>
      <dd><em><font face="Times New Roman">Dhamma.m sara.n a.m gacchaami <a name="998861"></a> </font></em></dd>
      <dd><font face="Times New Roman"><em>San gha.m sara.na.m gacchaami</em>. <a name="998863"></a>
        </font></dd>
      <dd><font face="Times New Roman">I go for refuge to the Buddha <a name="998864"></a> </font></dd>
      <dd><font face="Times New Roman">I go for refuge to the Dhamma <a name="998865"></a> </font></dd>
      <dd><font face="Times New Roman">I go for refuge to the Sangha. </font><p><font
        face="Times New Roman">It is through the simple act of reciting this formula three times
        that one declares oneself a Buddhist. (At the second and third repetition the word <em>Dutiyampi</em>
        or <em>Tatiyampi</em>, 'for the second/third time,' are added before each sentence.) </font></p>
        <p><a name="998868"></a> </p>
        <h2 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">The Five Precepts</font></h2>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">After the formula of the Threefold Refuge follows usually
        the acceptance of the Five Moral Precepts (pa~nca-sila). Their observance is the minimum
        standard needed to form the basis of a decent life and of further progress towards
        Deliverance. </font><ol>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="998872"></a></font></p>
          <li><em><font face="Times New Roman">Paanaatipaataa veramani-sikkhaapadam samaadiyaami. </font></em><p><font
            face="Times New Roman">I undertake to observe the precept to abstain from killing living
            beings. </font></p>
          </li>
          <li><em><font face="Times New Roman">Adinnaadaanaa veramanii-sikkhaapada.m samaadiyaami. </font></em><p><font
            face="Times New Roman">I undertake to observe the precept to abstain from taking things
            not given. </font></p>
          </li>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Kaamesu michcaacaaraa verama.ni-sikkhaapada.m
            samaadiyaami</em>. </font><p><font face="Times New Roman">I undertake to observe the
            precept to abstain from sexual misconduct. </font></p>
          </li>
          <li><em><font face="Times New Roman">Musaavaadaa verama.ni sikkhaapada.m samaadiyaami. </font></em><p><font
            face="Times New Roman">I undertake to observe the precept to abstain from false speech. </font></p>
          </li>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Suraameraya - majja - pamaada.t.thaanaa
            verama.nii-sikkhaapada.m samaadiyaami</em>. </font><p><font face="Times New Roman">I
            undertake to observe the precept to abstain from intoxicating drinks and drugs causing
            heedlessness. </font></p>
          </li>
