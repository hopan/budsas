    The Origin Of Suffering</font></h2>
  
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1002810"></a><a name="999715"></a> <font size="-1"><em>D. 22 </em></font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What, now, is the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering?
    It is craving, which gives rise to fresh rebirth, and, bound up with pleasure and lust,
    now here, now there, finds ever-fresh delight. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="999717"></a></font></p>
    <h2 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">The Threefold Craving</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is the 'Sensual Craving' (kaa.ma-ta.nhaa), the
    'Craving for (Eternal) Existence' (bhava-ta.nhaa), the 'Craving for Self-Annihilation'
    (vibhava-ta.nhaa). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="999912"></a></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">'Sensual Craving (kaama-ta.nhaa) is the desire for the
      enjoyment of the five sense objects. </font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="999926"></a></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">'Craving for Existence' (bhava-ta.nhaa) is the desire
      for continued or eternal life, referring in particular to life in those higher worlds
      called Fine-material and Immaterial Existences (ruupa-, and aruupa-bhava). It is closely
      connected with the so-called 'Eternity-Belief' (bhava- or sassata-di.t.thi), i.e. the
      belief in an absolute, eternal Ego-entity persisting independently of our body. </font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="999721"></a></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">'Craving for Self-Annihilation' (lit., 'for
      non-existence', vibhava-ta.nhaa) is the outcome of the 'Belief in Annihilation' (vibhava-
      or uccheda-di.t.thi), i.e. the delusive materialistic notion of a more or less real Ego
      which is annihilated at death, and which does not stand in any causal relation with the
      time before death and the time after death. </font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="999723"></a></font></p>
    <h2 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">Origin Of Craving</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But where does this craving arise and take root? Wherever
    in the world there are delightful and pleasurable things, there this craving arises and
    takes root. Eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind, are delightful and pleasurable: there
    this craving arises and takes root. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Visual objects, sounds, smells tastes, bodily impressions,
    and mind objects, are delightful and pleasurable: there this craving arises and takes
    root. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Consciousness, sense impression, feeling born of sense
    impression, perception, will, craving, thinking, and reflecting, are delightful and
    pleasurable: there this craving arises and takes root. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is called the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering.

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="999735"></a></font></p>
    <h2 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">Dependent Origination Of All Phenomena</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="999737"></a> <font size="-1"><em>M. 38 </em></font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If, whenever perceiving a visual object, a sound, odour,
    taste, bodily impression, or a mind-object, the object is pleasant, one is attracted; and
    if unpleasant, one is repelled. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, whatever kind of 'Feeling' (vedanaa) one
    experiences-pleasant, unpleasant or indifferent-if one approves of, and cherishes the
    feeling, and clings to it, then while doing so, lust springs up; but lust for feelings
    means 'Clinging' (upaadaana), and on clinging depends the (present) 'process of Becoming';
    on the process of becoming (bhava; here kamma-bhava, Karma-process) depends (future)
    'Birth' (jaati); and dependent on birth are 'Decay and Death', sorrow, lamentation, pain,
    grief and despair. Thus arises this whole mass of suffering. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="999741"></a></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">The formula of the Dependent Origination
      (pa.ticca-samuppaada) of which only some of the twelve links have been mentioned in the
      preceding passage, may be regarded as a detailed explanation of the Second Truth. </font></em></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="999746"></a> <font size="-1"><em>M. 13 </em></font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Truly, due to sensuous craving, conditioned through
    sensuous craving, impelled by sensuous craving, entirely moved by sensuous craving, kings
    fight with kings, princes with princes, priests with priests, citizens with citizens; the
    mother quarrels with the son, the son with the mother, the father with the son, the son
    with the father; brother quarrels with brother, brother with sister, sister with brother,
    friend with friend. Thus, given to dissension, quarrelling and fighting, they fall upon
    one another with fists, sticks, or weapons. And thereby they suffer death or deadly pain. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And further, due to sensuous craving, conditioned through
    sensuous craving, impelled by sensuous craving, entirely moved by sensuous craving, people
    break into houses, rob, plunder, pillage whole houses, commit highway robbery, seduce the
    wives of others. Then, the rulers have such people caught, and inflict on them various
    forms of punishment. And thereby they incur death or deadly pain. Now, this is the misery
    of sensuous craving, the heaping up of suffering in this present life, due to sensuous
    craving, conditioned through sensuous craving, caused by sensuous craving, entirely
    dependent on sensuous craving. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="999750"></a></font></p>
    <h2 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">Future Karma-Results</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And further, people take the evil way in deeds, the evil
    way in words, the evil way in thoughts; and by taking the evil way in deeds, words and
    thoughts, at the dissolution of the body, after death, they fall into a downward state of
    existence, a state of suffering, into an unhappy destiny, and the abysses of the hells.
    But this is the misery of sensuous craving, the heaping up of suffering in the future
    life, due to sensuous craving, conditioned through sensuous craving, caused by sensuous
    craving, entirely dependent on sensuous craving. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is volition (cetanaa) that I call 'Karma' (action).
        Having willed, one acts by body, speech, and mind. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are actions (kamma) ripening in hells. . . ripening
        in the animal kingdom. . . ripening in the domain of ghosts. . . ripening amongst men. . .
        ripening in heavenly worlds. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The result of actions (vipaaka) is of three kinds:
        ripening in the present life, in the next life, or in future lives. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="999771"></a> <font size="-1"><em>A. X. 206 </em></font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">All beings are the owners of their deeds (kamma, Skr:
        karma), the heirs of their deeds: their deeds are the womb from which they sprang, with
        their deeds they are bound up, their deeds are their refuge. Whatever deeds they do-good
        or evil-of such they will be the heirs. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="999775"></a> <font size="-1"><em>A. III. 33 </em></font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">And wherever the beings spring into existence. there their
        deeds will ripen; and wherever their deeds ripen, there they will earn the fruits of those
        deeds, be it in this life, or be it in the next life, or be it in any other future life. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="999777"></a> <font size="-1"><em>S. XXII. 99 </em></font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There will come a time when the mighty ocean will dry up,
        vanish, and be no more. There will come a time when the mighty earth will be devoured by
        fire, perish, and be no more. But yet there will be no end to the suffering of beings,
        who, obstructed by ignorance, and ensnared by craving, are hurrying and hastening through
        this round of rebirths. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="999779"></a> </font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">Craving (ta.nhaa), however, is not the only cause of
          evil action, and thus of all the suffering and misery produced thereby in this and the
          next life; but wherever there is craving, there, dependent on craving, may arise envy,
          anger, hatred, and many other evil things productive of suffering and misery. And all
          these selfish, life-affirming impulses and actions, together with the various kinds of
          misery produced thereby here or thereafter, and even all the five groups of phenomena
          constituting life-everything is ultimately rooted in blindness and ignorance (avijjaa). </font></em></p>

        <h2 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">Karma</font></h2>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="999783"></a> </font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">The second Noble Truth serves also to explain the
          causes of the seeming injustices in nature, by teaching that nothing in the world can come
          into existence without reason or cause, and that not only our latent tendencies, but our
          whole destiny, all weal and woe, result from causes (Karma), which we have to seek partly
          in this life, partly in former states of existence. These causes are the life-affirming
          activities (kamma, Skr: karma) produced by body, speech and mind. Hence it is this
          threefold action (kamma) that determines the character and destiny of all beings. Exactly
          defined Karma denotes those good and evil volitions (kusala-akusala-cetanaa), together
          with rebirth. Thus existence, or better the Process of Becoming (bhava), consists of an
          active and conditioning 'Karma Process' (kamma-bhava), and of its result, the 'Rebirth
          Process' (upapatti-bhava). </font></em></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="999788"></a> </font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">Here, too, when considering Karma, one must not lose
          sight of the impersonal nature (anattataa) of existence. In the case of a storm-swept sea,
          it is not an identical wave that hastens over the surface of the ocean, but it is the
          rising and falling of quite different masses of water. In the same way it should be
          understood that there are no real Ego-entities hastening through the ocean of rebirth, but
          merely life-waves, which, according to their nature and activities (good or evil),
          manifest themselves here as men, there as animals, and elsewhere as invisible beings. </font></em></p>

          <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">Once more the fact may be emphasized here that
          correctly speaking, the term 'Karma' signifies only the aforementioned kinds of action
          themselves, and does not mean or include their results. </font></em></p>
