    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What, now, is Right Concentration? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1006250"></a></font></p>
    <h2 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">Its Definition</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Having the mind fixed to a single object (cittekeggataa,
    lit. 'One-pointedness of mind'): this is concentration. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1006254"></a></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">'Right Concentration' (sammaa-samaadhi), in its widest
      sense, is the kind of mental concentration which is present in every wholesome state of
      consciousness (kusala-citta), and hence is accompanied by at least Right Thought (2nd
      factor), Right Effort (6th factor) and Right Mindfulness (7th factor). 'Wrong
      Concentration' is present in unwholesome states of consciousness, and hence is only
      possible in the sensuous, not in a higher sphere. Samaadhi, used alone, always stands in
      the Sutta, for sammaa-samaadhi, or Right Concentration. </font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1006256"></a></font></p>
    <h2 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">Its Objects</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The four 'Foundations of Mindfulness' (7th factor): these
    are the objects of concentration. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1006260"></a></font></p>
    <h2 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">Its Requisites</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The four 'Great Efforts' (6th factor): these are the
    requisites for concentration. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1006264"></a></font></p>
    <h2 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">Its Development</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The practising, developing and cultivating of these
    things: this is the development (bhaavanaa) of concentration. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1006268"></a></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">Right Concentration (sammaa-samaadhi) has two degrees
      of development; 1. 'Neighborhood Concentration' (upacaarasamaadhi). which approaches the
      first absorption without, however, attaining it; 2. 'Attainment Concentration'
      (appanaasamaadhi), which is the concentration present in the four Absorptions (jhaana).
      These Absorptions are mental states beyond the reach of the fivefold sense-activity,
      attainable only in solitude and by unremitting perseverance in the practice of
      concentration. In these states all activity of the five senses is suspended. No visual or
      audible impressions arise at such a time, no bodily feeling is felt. But, although all
      outer sense-impressions have ceased, yet the mind remains active, perfectly alert, fully
      awake. </font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1006270"></a></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">The attainment of these Absorptions, however, is not a
      requisite for the realization of the four Supermundane Paths of Holiness; and neither
      Neighborhood-Concentration nor Attainment-Concentration, as such, possesses the power of
      conferring entry to the four Supermundane Paths: hence they really have no power to free
      one permanently from evil things. The realization of the Four Supermundane Paths is
      possible only at the moment of deep 'Insight' (vipassanaa) into the Impermanency
      (aniccataa), Miserable Nature (dukkhataa) and Impersonality (anattataa) of this whole
      phenomenal process of existence. This Insight, again, is attainable only during
      Neighborhood-Concentration, not during Attainment Concentration. </font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1006272"></a></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">He who has realized one or other of the Four
      Supermundane Paths without ever having attained the Absorptions, is called
      Sukkha-vipassaka, or Suddhavipassanaa-yaanika, i.e. 'one who has taken merely Insight
      (vipassanaa) as his vehicle'. He, however, who, after cultivating the Absorptions, has
      reached one of the Supermundane Paths is called Saniathayaanika, or 'one who has taken
      Tranquillity (samatha) as his vehicle (yaana)'. </font></em></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1006279"></a> <font size="-1"><em>D.22 </em></font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Detached from sensual objects, detached from evil things,
    the disciple enters into the first Absorption, which is accompanied by Thought Conception
    and Discursive Thinking, is born of detachment, and filled with Rapture and Happiness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1006281"></a></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the first of the Absorptions belonging to the
      Fine-Material Sphere (rupaavacarajjhaana). It is attained when, through the strength of
      concentration, the fivefold sense activity is temporarily suspended, and the five
      Hindrances are likewise eliminated. </font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1006283"></a></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">See B. Dict.: kasina, nimitta, samaadhi. </font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1006285"></a> <font size="-1"><em>M. 43 </em></font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This first Absorption is free from five things, and five
    things are present. When the disciple enters the first Absorption, there have vanished
    (the five Hindrances): Lust, Ill-Will, Torpor and Sloth, Restlessness and Mental Worry,
    Doubts; and there are present: Thought Conception (vitakka), Discursive Thinking
    (vicaara), Rapture (piiti), Happiness (sukha), Concentration (citt'ekaggataa = samaadhi). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1006443"></a></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">These five mental factors present in the first
      Absorption, are called Factors (or Constituents) of Absorption (jhaananga). Vitakka
      (initial formation of an abstract thought) and vicaara (discursive thinking, rumination)
      are called 'verbal functions' (vaci-sankhaara) of the mind; hence they are something
      secondary compared with consciousness. </font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1006289"></a></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">In Visuddhi-Magga, vitakka is compared with the taking
      hold of a pot, and vicaara with the wiping of it. In the first Absorption both are
      present, but are exclusively focussed on the subject of meditation, vicaara being here not
      discursive, but of an 'exploring' nature. Both are entirely absent in the following
      Absorptions. </font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And further: after the subsiding of Thought-Conception and
    Discursive Thinking, and by the gaining of inner tranquillity and oneness of mind, he
    enters into a state free from Thought-Conception and Discursive Thinking, the second
    Absorption, which is born of concentration (samaadhi), and filled with Rapture (piti) and
    Happiness (sukha). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1006293"></a></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">In the second Absorption, there are three Factors of
      Absorption: Rapture, Happiness, and Concentration. </font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And further: after the fading away of Rapture, he dwells
    in equanimity, mindful, with clear awareness: and he experiences in his own person that
    feeling of which the Noble Ones say: 'Happy lives he who is equanimous and mindful'-thus
    he enters the third Absorption. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1006299"></a></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">In the third Absorption there are two Factors of
      Absorption: equanimous Happiness (upekkhaa-sukha) and Concentration (citt'ekaggataa). </font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And further: after the giving up of pleasure and pain, and
    through the disappearance of previous joy and grief, he enters into a state beyond
    pleasure and pain, into the fourth Absorption, which is purified by equanimity and
    mindfulness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1006303"></a></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">In the fourth Absorption there are two Factors of
      Absorp-tion: Concentration and Equanimity (upekkhaa). </font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1006304"></a></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">In Visuddhi-magga forty subjects of meditation
      (kamma.t.thaana) are enumerated and treated in detail. By their successful practice the
      following Absorptions may be attained: </font></em></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1006456"></a></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">All four Absorptions. through Mindfulness of Breathing
      (see Vis. M. VIII. 3), the ten Kasina-exercises (Vis. M. IV, V. and B. Dict.); the
      contemplation of Equanimity (upekkhaa), being the practice of the fourth Brahma-vihaara
      (Vis. M. IX. 4). </font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1006312"></a></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">The first three Absorptions: through the development
      of Loving-Kindness (mettaa), Compassion (karunaa) and Sympathetic Joy (muditaa), being the
      practice of the first three Brahma-vihaaras (Vis. M. IX. 1-3,). </font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1008838"></a></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">The first Absorption: through the ten Contemplations
      of Impurity (asubha-bhaavanaa; i.e. the Cemetery Contemplations, which are ten according
      to the enumeration in Vis. M. VI); the contemplation of the Body (i.e. the 32 parts of the
      body; Vis. M. VIII, 2); 'Neighborhood-Concentration' (upacaara-samaadhi): through the
      Recollections on Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha, on Morality, Liberality, Heavenly Beings,
      Peace (=Nibbaana) and death (Vis. M. VI. VII); the Contemplation on the Loathsomeness of
      Food (Vis. M. XI. I); the Analysis of the Four Elements (Vis. M. IX. 2). </font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1006319"></a></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">The four Immaterial Absorptions (aruupa-jjhaana or
      aaruppa), which are based on the fourth Absorption, are produced by meditating on their
      respective objects from which they derive their names; Sphere of Unbounded Space, of
      Unbounded Consciousness, of Nothingness, and of Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception. </font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1006320"></a></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">The entire object of concentration and meditation is
      treated in Vis M. III-XIII; see also Fund. IV. </font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1006322"></a> <font size="-1"><em>8. XXII. 5 </em></font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Develop your concentration: for he who has concentration,
    understands things according to their reality. And what are these things? The arising and
    passing away of corporeality, of feeling, perception, mental formations and consciousness.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1006323"></a> <font size="-1"><em>M. 149 </em></font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, these five Groups of Existence must be wisely
    penetrated; Ignorance and Craving must be wisely abandoned; Tranquillity (samatha) and
    Insight (vipassanaa) must be wisely developed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1006325"></a> <font size="-1"><em>S. LVI. II </em></font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the Middle Path which the Perfect One has
    discovered, which makes one both to see and to know, and which leads to peace, to
    discernment, to enlightenment, to Nibbaana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1006489"></a> <font size="-1"><em>Dhp. 275 </em></font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And following upon this path, you will put an end to
    suffering. </font></p>
