    <h3 align="center"><a name="1004121"></a><font face="Times New Roman">(Sammaa-vaacaa)</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1004122"></a></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What now, is Right Speech? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1004126"></a></font></p>
    <h3 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">Abstaining from Lying</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1004127"></a> <font size="-1"><em>A. X. 176 </em></font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Herein someone avoids lying and abstains from it. He
    speaks the truth, is devoted to the truth, reliable, worthy of confidence, not a deceiver
    of men. Being at a meeting, or amongst people, or in the midst of his relatives, or in a
    society, or in the king's court, and called upon and asked as witness to tell what he
    knows, he answers, if he knows nothing: 'I know nothing', and if he knows, he answers: 'I
    know'; if he has seen nothing, he answers: 'I have seen nothing', and if he has seen, he
    answers: 'I have seen'. Thus he never knowingly speaks a lie, either for the sake of his
    own advantage, or for the sake of another person's advantage, or for the sake of any
    advantage whatsoever. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1004131"></a></font></p>
    <h3 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">Abstaining from Tale-bearing</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. He avoids tale-bearing, and abstains from it. What he
    has heard here, he does not repeat there, so as to cause dissension there; and what he has
    heard there, he does not repeat here, so as to cause dissension here. Thus he unites those
    that are divided; and those that are united, he encourages. Concord gladdens him, he
    delights and rejoices in concord; and it is concord that he spreads by his words. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1004135"></a></font></p>
    <h3 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">Abstaining from Harsh Language</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. He avoids harsh language, and abstains from it. He
    speaks such words as are gentle, soothing to the ear, loving, such words as go to the
    heart, and are courteous, friendly, and agreeable to many. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1004142"></a></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">In Majjhima-Nicaaya No. 21, the Buddha says: 'Even, O
      monks, should robbers and murderers saw through your limbs and joints, whosoever should
      give way to anger thereat would not be following my advice. For thus ought you to train
      yourselves: </font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1004144"></a></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">'Undisturbed shall our mind remain, no evil words
      shall escape our lips; friendly and full of sympathy shall we remain, with heart full of
      love, and free from any hidden malice; and that person shall we penetrate with loving
      thoughts, wide, deep, boundless, freed from anger and hatred'. </font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1004146"></a></font></p>
    <h3 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">Abstaining from Vain Talk</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1004148"></a> <font size="-1"><em>A. X. 176 </em></font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. He avoids vain talk, and abstains from it. He speaks at
    the right time, in accordance with facts, speaks what is useful, speaks of the law and the
    discipline: his speech is like a treasure, uttered at the right moment, accompanied by
    arguments, moderate and full of sense. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is called Right Speech. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1004153"></a><a name="1004154"></a></font></p>
    <h3 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">Mundane and Supermundane Speech</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1004157"></a> <font size="-1"><em>M. 117 </em></font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, Right Speech. I tell you, is of two kinds: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Abstaining from lying, from tale-bearing, from harsh
    language, and from vain talk; this is called 'Mundane Right Speech'
    (lokiya-sammaa-vaacaa), which yields worldly fruits and brings good results. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. But the avoidance of the practice of this fourfold
    wrong speech, the abstaining, desisting. refraining therefrom-the mind being holy, being
    turned away from the world, and conjoined with the path, the holy path being pursued-this
    is called the 'Supermundane Right Speech' (lokuttara-sammaa-vaacaa), which is not of the
    world, but is supermundane, and conjoined with the path. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1004163"></a></font></p>
    <h3 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">Conjoined with Other Factors</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, in understanding wrong speech as wrong, and right
    speech as right, one practises <em>Right Understanding</em> (1st factor); and in making
    efforts to overcome evil speech and to arouse right speech, one practises <em>Right Effort</em>
    (6th factor); and in overcoming wrong speech with attentive mind, and dwelling with
    attentive mind in possession of right speech, one practises <em>Right Mindfulness</em>
    (7th factor). Hence, there are three things that accompany and follow upon Right Speech,
    namely: Right Understanding, Right Effort, and Right Mindfulness. </font></p>
