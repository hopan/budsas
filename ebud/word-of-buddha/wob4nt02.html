    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What, now, is the Noble Truth of Suffering? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Birth is suffering; Decay is suffering; Death is
    suffering; Sorrow, Lamentation, Pain, Grief, and Despair are suffering; not to get what
    one desires, is suffering; in short: the Five Groups of Existence are suffering. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What, now, is Birth? The birth of beings belonging to this
    or that order of beings, their being born, their conception and springing into existence,
    the manifestation of the Groups of Existence, the arising of sense activity: this is
    called birth. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And what is Decay? The decay of beings belonging to this
    or that order of beings; their becoming aged, frail, grey, and wrinkled; the failing of
    their vital force, the wearing out of the senses: this is called decay. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And what is Death? The departing and vanishing of beings
    out of this or that order of beings. their destruction, disappearance, death, the
    completion of their life-period, dissolution of the Groups of Existence, the discarding of
    the body: this is called death. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And what is Sorrow? The sorrow arising through this or
    that loss or misfortune which one encounters, the worrying oneself, the state of being
    alarmed, inward sorrow, inward woe: this is called sorrow. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And what is Lamentation? Whatsoever, through this or that
    loss or misfortune which befalls one, is wail and lament, wailing and lamenting, the state
    of woe and lamentation: this is called lamentation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And what is Pain? The bodily pain and unpleasantness, the
    painful and unpleasant feeling produced by bodily impression: this is called pain. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And what is Grief? The mental pain and unpleasantness, the
    painful and unpleasant feeling produced by mental impression: this is called grief. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And what is Despair? Distress and despair arising through
    this or that loss or misfortune which one encounters: distressfulness, and desperation:
    this is called despair. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And what is the 'Suffering of not getting what one
    desires'? To beings subject to birth there comes the desire; 'O, that we were not subject
    to birth! O, that no new birth was before us!' Subject to decay, disease, death, sorrow,
    lamentation, pain, grief, and despair, the desire comes to them: 'O, that we were not
    subject to these things! O, that these things were not before us!' But this cannot be got
    by mere desiring; and not to get what one desires, is suffering. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. What, now, is the 'Solid Element' (pathavii-dhaatu)?
    The solid element may be one's own, or it may be external. And what is one's own solid
    element? Whatever in one's own person or body there exists of karmically acquired
    hardness, firmness, such as the hairs of head and body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews,
    bones, marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, stomach, bowels,
    mesentery, excrement and so on-this is called one's own solid element. Now, whether it be

    fluid element may be one's own, or it may be external. And what is one's own fluid
    element? Whatever in one's own person or body there exists of karmically acquired
    liquidity or fluidity, such as bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, skin-grease,
    saliva, nasal mucus, oil of the joints, urine, and so on-this is called one's own fluid

    element? Whatever in one's own person or body there exists of karmically acquired heat or
    hotness, such as that whereby one is heated, consumed, scorched, whereby that which has
    been eaten, drunk, chewed, or tasted, is fully digested, and so on-this is called one's

    acquired wind or windiness, such as the upward-going and downward-going winds, the winds
    of stomach and intestines, the wind permeating all the limbs, in-breathing and
    out-breathing, and so on-this is called one's own vibrating element. Now, whether it be

      the Abhidhamma, fifty Mental Formations are distinguished, seven of which are constant
      factors of mind. The number and composition of the rest varies according to the character
      of the respective class of consciousness (see Table in B. Dict). In the Discourse on Right
      Understanding (M.9) three main representatives of the Group of Mental Formations are
      mentioned: volition (cetanaa), sense impression (phassa), and attention (manasikaara). Of
      these again, it is volition which, being a principal 'formative' factor, is particularly

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Suppose a man who was not blind beheld the many bubbles on
    the Ganges as they drove along, and he watched them and carefully examined them; then
    after he had carefully examined them they would appear to him empty, unreal and
    unsubstantial. In exactly the same way does the monk behold all the corporeal phenomena,
    feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and states of consciousness-whether they be of
    the past, or the present, or the future, far or near. And he watches them, and examines
    them carefully; and, after carefully examining them, they appear to him empty, void and
    without a Self. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Did you never see in the world a man, or a woman, eighty,
        ninety, or a hundred years old, frail, crooked as a gable-roof, bent down, resting on
        crutches, with tottering steps, infirm, youth long since fled, with broken teeth, grey and

        being sick, afflicted, and grievously ill, wallowing in his own filth, was lifted up by
        some and put to bed by others? And did the thought never come to you that you also are

          <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">Sa.msaara-the wheel of existence, lit, the 'Perpetual
          Wandering'-is the name given in the Pali scriptures to the sea of life ever restlessly
          heaving up and down, the symbol of this continuous process of ever again and again being
          born, growing old, suffering, and dying. More precisely put: Sa.msaara is the unbroken
          sequence of the fivefold Khandha-combinations, which, constantly changing from moment to
          moment, follow continually one upon the other through inconceivable periods of time. Of
          this Sa.msaara a single life time constitutes only a tiny fraction. Hence, to be able to
          comprehend the first Noble Truth, one must let one's gaze rest upon the Sa.msaara, upon
          this frightful sequence of rebirths. and not merely upon one single life time, which, of
          course, may sometimes be not very painful. </font></em></p>

        <blockquote>
          <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">The term 'suffering' (dukkha), in the first Noble
          Truth refers therefore, not merely to painful bodily and mental sensations due to
          unpleasant impressions, but it comprises in addition everything productive of suffering or
          liable to it. The Truth of Suffering teaches that, owing to the universal law of
          impermanence, even high and sublime states of happiness are subject to change and
          destruction, and that all states of existence are therefore unsatisfactory, without
          exception carrying in themselves the seeds of suffering. </font></em></p>

        weeping and wailing you have shed upon this long way-hurrying and hastening through this
        round of rebirths, united with the undesired, separated from the desired-this, or the
        waters of the four oceans? </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Long have you suffered the death of father and mother, of
        sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters. And whilst you were thus suffering, you have
