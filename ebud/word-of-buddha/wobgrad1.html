    Development of the Eightfold Path<br>
    in the Progress of the Disciple</font></h2>
    <h2 align="center"><a name="998969"></a><a name="998846"></a><font face="Times New Roman">Confidence
    and Right Thought</font></h2>
    <h3 align="center"><a name="998847"></a><font face="Times New Roman">(Second Factor)</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="998849"></a> <font size="-1"><em>M. 38 </em></font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Suppose a householder, or his son, or someone reborn in a
    good family, hears the law; and after hearing the law he is filled with confidence in the
    Perfect One. And filled with this confidence, he thinks: 'Full of hindrances is household
    life, a refuse heap; but the homeless life (of a monk) is like the open air. Not easy is
    it, when one lives at home, to fulfil in all points the rules of the holy life. How if now
    I were to cut off hair and beard, put on the yellow robe and go forth from home to the
    homeless life?' And in a short time, having given up his possessions, great or little,
    having forsaken a large or small circle of relations, he cuts off hair and beard, puts on
    the yellow robe, and goes forth from home to the homeless life. </font></p>
    <h2 align="center"><a name="998851"></a><font face="Times New Roman">Morality</font></h2>
    <h3 align="center"><a name="998852"></a><font face="Times New Roman">(Third, Fourth, Fifth
    Factor)</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Having thus left the world, he fulfils the rules of the
    monks. He avoids the killing of living beings and abstains from it. Without stick or
    sword, conscientious, full of sympathy, he is desirous of the welfare of all living
    beings.- He avoids stealing, and abstains from taking what is not given to him. Only what
    is given to him he takes, waiting till it is given; and he lives with a heart honest and
    pure.- He avoids unchastity, living chaste, celibate and aloof from the vulgar practice of
    sexual intercourse.- He avoids lying and abstains from it. He speaks the truth, is devoted
    to the truth, reliable, worthy of confidence, no deceiver of men.- He avoids tale-bearing
    and abstains from it. What he has heard here, he does not repeat there, so as to cause
    dissension there; and what he has heard there, he does not repeat here, so as to cause
    dissension here. Thus he unites those that are divided, and those that are united he
    encourages; concord gladdens him, he delights and rejoices in concord; and it is concord
    that he spreads by his words.- He avoids harsh language and abstains from it. He speaks
    such words as are gentle, soothing to the ear, loving, such words as go to the heart, and
    are courteous, friendly, and agreeable to many.- He avoids vain talk and abstains from it.
    He speaks at the right time, in accordance with facts, speaks what is useful, speaks of
    the law and the discipline; his speech is like a treasure, uttered at the right moment,
    accompanied by arguments, moderate and full of sense. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He takes food only at one time of the day (forenoon),
    abstains from food in the evening, does not eat at improper times. He leeps aloof from
    dance, song, music and the visiting of shows; rejects flowers, perfumes, ointment, as well
    as every kind of adornment and embellishment. High and gorgeous beds he does not use. Gold
    and silver he does not accept.- He does not accept raw corn and flesh, women and girls,
    male and female slaves, or goats, sheep, fowls, pigs, elephants, cows or horses, or land
    and goods. He does not go on errands and do the duties of a messenger. He eschews buying
    and selling things. He has nothing to do with false measures, metals and weights. He
    avoids the crooked ways of bribery, deception and fraud. He has no part in stabbing,
    beating, chaining, attacking. plundering and oppressing. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He contents himself with the robe that protects his body,
    and with the alms bowl by means of which he keeps himself alive. Wherever he goes. he is
    provided with these two things; just as a winged bird in flying carries his wings along
    with him. By fulfilling this noble Domain of Morality (siila-kkhandha) he feels in his
    heart an irreproachable happiness. </font></p>
    <h2 align="center"><a name="998864"></a><font face="Times New Roman">Control of the Senses</font></h2>
    <h3 align="center"><a name="998865"></a><font face="Times New Roman">(Sixth Factor)</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, in perceiving a form with the eye- a sound with the
    ear- an odour with the nose- a taste with the tongue- an impression with the body- an
    object with the mind, he cleaves neither to the whole, nor to its details. And he tries to
    ward off that which should he be unguarded in his senses, might give rise to evil and
    unwholesome states, to greed and sorrow; he watches over his senses, keeps his senses
    under control. By practising this noble 'Control of the Senses' (indriya-sa.mvara) he
    feels in his heart an unblemished happiness. </font></p>
    <h2 align="center"><a name="998869"></a><font face="Times New Roman">Mindfulness and Clear
    Comprehension</font></h2>
    <h3 align="center"><a name="999010"></a><font face="Times New Roman">(Seventh Factor)</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He is mindful and acts with clear comprehension when going
    and coming; when looking forward and backward; when bending and stretching his limbs; when
    wearing his robes and alms-bowl; when eating, drinking, chewing and tasting; when
    discharging excrement and urine: when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep and
    awakening; when speaking and keeping silent. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now being equipped with this lofty 'Morality' (siila),
    equipped with this noble 'Control of the Senses' (indriya-sa.mvara), and filled with this
    noble, 'Mindfulness and Clear Comprehension' (sati-sampaja~n~na), he chooses a secluded
    dwelling in the forest, at the foot of a tree, on a mountain, in a cleft, in a rock cave,
    on a burial ground, on a wooded table-land, in the open air, or on a heap of straw. Having
    returned from his alms-round, after the meal, he seats himself with legs crossed, body
    erect, with mindfulness fixed before him. </font></p>
    <h2 align="center"><a name="998876"></a><font face="Times New Roman">Absence of the Five
    Hindrances</font></h2>
    <h3 align="center"><a name="998878"></a><font face="Times New Roman">(niivara.na)</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He has cast away 'Lust' (kaamacchanda); he dwells with a
    heart free from lust; from lust he cleanses his heart. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He has cast away 'Ill-will' (vyaapaada); he dwells with a
    heart free from ill-will; cherishing love and compassion toward all living beings, he
    cleanses his heart from ill-will. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He has cast away 'Torpor and Sloth' (thiinamiddha); he
    dwells free from torpor and sloth; loving the light, with watchful mind, with clear
    comprehension, he cleanses his mind from torpor and sloth. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He has cast away 'Restlessness and Mental Worry'
    (uddhacca-kukkucca); dwelling with mind undisturbed, with heart full of peace, he cleanses
    his mind from restlessness and mental worry. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He has cast away 'Doubt' (vicikicchaa); dwelling free from
    doubt, full of confidence in the good, he cleanses his heart from doubt. </font></p>
    <h2 align="center"><a name="998890"></a><font face="Times New Roman">The Absorptions</font></h2>
    <h3 align="center"><a name="998891"></a><font face="Times New Roman">(Eighth Factor)</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He has put aside these five 'Hindrances' (niivara.na), the
    corruptions of the mind which paralyse wisdom. And far from sensual impressions, far from
    evil things, he enters into the Four Absorptions (jhaana). </font></p>
    <h2 align="center"><a name="998894"></a><font face="Times New Roman">Insight</font></h2>
    <h3 align="center"><a name="998895"></a><font face="Times New Roman">(vipassanaa)</font></h3>
    <h3 align="center"><a name="998896"></a><font face="Times New Roman">(First Factor)</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="999043"></a> <font size="-1"><em>A. IX. 36 </em></font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But whatsoever there is of corporeality, feeling,
    perception, mental formations, or consciousness: all these phenomena he regards as
    'impermanent' (anicca), 'subject to pain' (dukkha). as infirm, as an ulcer, a thorn, a
    misery, a burden, an enemy, a disturbance, as empty and 'void of an Ego' (anattaa); and
    turning away from these things, he directs his mind towards the Deathless thus; 'This,
    truly, is Peace, this is the Highest, namely the end of all Karma formations, the
    forsaking of every substratum of rebirth, the fading away of craving, detachment,
    extinction, Nibbaana. And in this state he reaches the 'cessation of passions'
    (aasavakkhaya). </font></p>
    <h2 align="center"><a name="998900"></a><font face="Times New Roman">Nibbaana</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="998901"></a> <font size="-1"><em>M. 39 </em></font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And his heart becomes free from sensual passion
    (kaam'aasava), free from the passion for existence (bhav'aasava), free from the passion of
    ignorance (avijj'aasava), 'Freed am I!' this knowledge arises in the liberated one ; and
    he knows: 'Exhausted is rebirth, fulfilled the Holy Life; what was to be done, has been
    done; naught remains more for this world to do'. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="998903"></a> <a name="998904"></a><font size="-1"><em>M.
    26 </em></font></font><dl>
      <dd><font face="Times New Roman">For ever am I liberated. <a name="999067"></a> </font></dd>
      <dd><font face="Times New Roman">This is the last time that I'm born, <a name="999068"></a> </font></dd>
      <dd><font face="Times New Roman">No new existence waits for me. </font></dd>
    </dl>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="998906"></a> <font size="-1"><em>M. 140 </em></font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is, indeed, the highest, holiest wisdom: to know that
    all suffering has passed away. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is. indeed, the highest, holiest peace: appeasement
    of greed, hatred and delusion. </font></p>
    <h2 align="center"><a name="998911"></a><font face="Times New Roman">The Silent Thinker</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">'I am' is a vain thought; 'This am I' is a vain thought;
    'I shall be' is a vain thought; 'I shall not be' is a vain thought. Vain thoughts are a
    sickness, an ulcer, a thorn. But after overcoming all vain thoughts, one is called 'a
    silent thinker'. And the thinker, the Silent One, does no more arise, no more pass away,
    no more tremble, no more desire. For there is nothing in him whereby he should arise
    again. And as he arises no more, how should he grow old again? And as he grows old no more
    how should he die again? And as he dies no more, how should he tremble? And as he trembles
    no more, how should he have desire'? </font></p>
    <h2 align="center"><a name="998915"></a><font face="Times New Roman">The True Goal</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="999081"></a> <font size="-1"><em>M. 29 </em></font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hence, the purpose of the Holy Life does not consist in
    acquiring alms, honour, or fame, nor in gaining morality, concentration, or the eye of
    knowledge. That unshakable deliverance of the heart: that, indeed, is the object of the
    Holy Life, that is its essence, that is its goal. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="998918"></a> <font size="-1"><em>M. 51 </em></font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And those, who in the past were Holy and Enlightened Ones,
    those Blessed Ones also have pointed out to their disciples this self-same goal as has
    been pointed out by me to my disciples. And those who in the future will be Holy and
    Enlightened Ones, those Blessed Ones also will point out to their disciples this self-same
    goal as has been pointed out by me to my disciples. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="998921"></a> <font size="-1"><em>D. 16 </em></font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, disciples, it may be that (after my passing away)
    you might think: 'Gone is the doctrine of our master. We have no Master more'. But thus
    you should not think; for the 'Law' (dhamma) and the 'Discipline' (vinaya) which I have
    taught you, will after my death be your master. </font><dl>
      <dd><font face="Times New Roman">The Law be your isle, <a name="999093"></a> </font></dd>
      <dd><font face="Times New Roman">The Law be your refuge! <a name="999094"></a> </font></dd>
      <dd><font face="Times New Roman">Look for no other refuge! </font></dd>
    </dl>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore, disciples, the doctrines which I taught you
    after having penetrated them myself, you should well preserve, well guard, so that this
    Holy life may take its course and continue for ages, for the weal and welfare of the many,
    as a consolation to the world, for the happiness, weal and welfare of heavenly beings and
    men. </font></p>
