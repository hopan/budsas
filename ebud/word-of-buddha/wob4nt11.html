    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What, now. is Right Effort? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are Four Great Efforts; the effort to avoid, the
    effort to overcome, the effort to develop, and the effort to maintain. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1004245"></a></font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What, now is the effort to <em>Avoid</em>? Herein the
    disciple rouses his will to avoid the arising of evil, unwholesome things that have not
    yet arisen; and he makes efforts, stirs up his energy; exerts his mind and strives. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, when lie perceives a form with the eye, a sound with
    the ear, and an odor with the nose, a taste with the tongue, an impression with the body,
    or an object with the mind, he neither adheres to the whole, nor to its parts. And he
    strives to ward off that through which evil and unwholesome things, greed and sorrow,
    would arise, if he remained with unguarded senses; and he watches over his senses,
    restrains his senses. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Possessed of this noble 'Control over the Senses' he
    experiences inwardly a feeling of joy, into which no evil thing can enter. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is called the effort to avoid </font></p>

    <h3 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">(Pahaana-ppadhaana)</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What, now, is the effort to <em>Overcome</em>? There the
    disciple rouses his will to overcome the evil, unwholesome things that have already
    arisen; and he makes effort, stirs up his energy, exerts his mind and strives. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He does not retain any thought of sensual lust, ill-will
    or grief, or any other evil and unwholesome states that may have arisen; he abandons them,
    dispels them, destroys them. causes them to disappear. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1004263"></a></font></p>
    <h2 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">Five Methods of Expelling Evil Thoughts</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1004265"></a> <font size="-1"><em>M. 20 </em></font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If, whilst regarding a certain object, there arise in the
    disciple, on account of it, evil and unwholesome thoughts connected with greed, hatred and
    delusion, then the disciple (1) should, by means of this object, gain another and
    wholesome object. (2) Or, he should reflect on the misery of these thoughts; 'Unwholesome,
    truly, are these thoughts! Blamable are these thoughts! Of painful result are these
    thoughts!' (3) Or he should pay no attention to these thoughts. (4) Or, he should consider
    the compound nature of these thoughts. (5) Or, with teeth clenched and tongue pressed
    against the gums, he should with his mind restrain, suppress and root out these thoughts;
    and in doing so these evil and unwholesome thoughts of greed, hatred and delusion will
    dissolve and disappear; and the mind will inwardly become settled and calm, composed and
    concentrated. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is called the effort to overcome. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1004269"></a></font></p>
    <h2 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">3. The Effort to Develop</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1004271"></a></font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1004272"></a> <font size="-1"><em>A. IV. 13, 14 </em></font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What, now, is the effort to <em>Develop</em>? Herein the
    disciple rouses his will to arouse wholesome things that have not yet arisen; and he makes
    effort, stirs up his energy, exerts his mind and strives. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus he develops the 'Elements of Enlightenment'
    (bojjhanga), based on solitude, on detachment, on extinction, and ending in deliverance,
    namely: 'Mindfulness' (sati), 'Investigation of the Law' (dhamma-vicaya), 'Energy'
    (viriya), 'Rapture' (piiti), 'Tranquillity' (passaddhi), 'Concentration' (samaadhi). and
    'Equanimity' (upekkhaa). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is called the effort to develop. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1004281"></a></font></p>
    <h2 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">4. The Effort to Maintain</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1004282"></a></font></p>
    <h3 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">(Anurakkha.na-ppadhaana)</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What, now, is the effort to Maintain? Herein the disciple
    rouses his will to maintain the wholesome things that have already arisen, and not to
    allow them to disappear, but to bring them to growth, to maturity and to the full
    perfection of development (bhaavanaa); and he makes effort, stirs up his energy, exerts
    his mind and strives. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, for example, he keeps firmly in his mind a favorable
    object of concentration that has arisen, such as the mental image of a skeleton, of a
    corpse infested by worms, of a corpse blue-black in color, of a festering corpse, of a
    corpse riddled with holes, of a corpse swollen up. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is called the effort to maintain. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="1004290"></a> <font size="-1"><em>M. 70 </em></font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Truly, for a disciple who is possessed of faith and has
    penetrated the Teaching of the master, it is fit to think: 'Though skin sinews and bones
    wither away, though flesh and blood of my body dry up, I shall not give up my efforts till
    I have attained whatever is attainable by manly perseverance, energy and endeavour.' </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is called Right Effort. </font></p>
