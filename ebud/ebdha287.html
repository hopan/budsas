      <TD WIDTH="100%"><B></B><FONT SIZE="6">V</FONT>isakha Puja is the 
      commemoration of the Buddha's birth, enlightenment and passing away. It is 
      the most important festival in the Buddhist calendar. In Thailand, this 
      day is different from other Buddhist festivals in that, while many can 
      become occasions for drinking, feasting and big parties, Visakha Puja has 
      retained a quality of recollection and spiritual aspiration. The birth, 
      enlightenment and death of the Buddha all took place on the full moon in 
      May. It's a good reflection to see these events as inextricably linked. 
      Birth can be seen as the coming into being of the quest for enlightenment. 
      Then, there is the enlightenment itself. Finally, when the physical body 
      dies, does the enlightenment principle die with it? Not really. The whole 
      point of the Buddha's life was the realization of the deathless. That is, 
      there is something beyond birth, sickness and death, something beyond 
      change and separation. The Buddha asked the question: &quot;Why do I, being 
      subject to old age, change and separation, seek after that which is always 
      subject to old age, change and separation?&quot; This is a question in all of 
      our lives.
      <P>The general plight of people in the world is bound by ignorance and 
      obstructed by craving, creating a vortex of forces in the unenlightened 
      human mind. The aspiration of the Buddha's life is to seek that which is 
      unbound and unobstructed. His enlightenment is a continual, ongoing 
      example that this is possible. </P>
      <P>The Buddha named his son Rahula, meaning &quot;fetter.&quot; The birth of his son 
      was something that was binding. When one hears the word &quot;fetter,&quot; one 
      might believe the name was chosen through aversion, nastiness or 
      pettiness. Instead, it was the deep love that the Buddha felt towards his 
      son that led him to realize that even this kind of love needs to be 
      transcended, needs to be gone beyond. </P>
      <P>The Buddha's quest for enlightenment was inextricably bound to love and 
      compassion for others. He realized that if he himself were bound by 
      attachment, then the whole human race must be bound in the same way. So 
      how do we work with qualities of love and attachment? How do we deal with 
      aversion and irritation? These are the circumstances and difficulties that 
      the Buddha himself worked with, dealt with and understood -- even the 
      ordinary squabbles and petty jealousies that can take root in a community 
      and grow into great conflicts. </P>
      <P>The qualities of compassion and lovingkindness were manifested in the 
      Buddha's own renunciation, his own relinquishing of comfort and worldly 
      success to seek liberation. Spiritual seeking is itself an act of 
      compassion. Often, when we think of renouncing or giving up something, of 
      having to desist from a passion with which we identify strongly, there is 
      a feeling of loss, fear or insecurity. Actually, letting go is an act of 
      compassion and kindness that includes everyone. Letting go can be to our 
      attachment to precepts or meditation as well as to our obsessive thoughts. 
      Often, the mind balks at renunciation and tries to fill itself up with 
      other things.When one lifts the mind to a recollection of the benefits of 
      relinquishment, one can draw on compassion and kindness. One is fortified 
      for going though the wavering of the mind and turning towards that 
      unbinding and unobstructed quality. This is what the Buddha's teaching is 
      about. </P>
      <P>There is a lovely image in the suttas where the Buddha was quite old 
      and recovering from an illness. He was still weak but managed to get 
      outside to warm his limbs in the afternoon sun. </P>
      <P>Ananda came along and said, &quot;I'm so glad to see you are getting better. 
      I was worried about your health. I was afraid you were going to pass 
      away.&quot; Ananda sat beside the Buddha massaging his back and limbs, 
      commenting on how marvelous and strange it is that the Buddha's formerly 
      firm, strong and glowing body was now old, wrinkled and losing its luster. 
      The Buddha replied, &quot;Yes, this is very ordinary. This is the way it is.&quot; 
      His body was like a drum that had been patched again and again over the 
      years. After a while, some of its original parts were simply not there any 
      longer. </P>
      <P>We should look at the Buddha as a human being. He was not a 
      mythological figure or a god. One reason many of us were attracted to 
      Ajahn Chah as our own teacher was his very humanness. I remember a story 
      of Ajahn Chah from when he taught at the Insight Meditation Society in 
      1979. Ajahn Chah had been at IMS for many days, and people felt uplifted 
      by his presence and teachings. He was a very inspiring and charismatic 
      figure. One day after the meditation as he got up and walked slowly out of 
      the meditation hall, he turned to the group and said,&quot;My knees hurt.&quot; </P>
      <P>People often think, &quot;Ah, here is a great spiritual master. He probably 
      doesn't experience any pain, his feelings are not like mine.&quot; That's not 
      true. Our aspiration is not to be rid of feelings. We should not think 
      that if we didn't have certain feelings or if we had other feelings, then 
      we could become enlightened. Instead, the path to enlightenment is to pay 
      attention to the ordinary qualities of our likes and dislikes, our loves 
      and attachments.How do these things work and how do they affect us? How do 
      they obstruct us and bind us? How can we be free from them? It's through 
      questioning and seeing clearly that we find our way through. This is the 
      path of knowing. </P>
      <P>I remember travelling with Ajahn Chah to one of his branch monasteries. 
      Sometimes the main monastery,Wat Bah Pong, could be quite busy, so he 
      would go to a smaller monastery for a rest. By this time his health was 
      not so good, and he wasn't walking on almsrounds with the rest of the 
      monks.When I came back from almsround, I was preparing a ball of sticky 
      rice for him. Ajahn Chah had always trained us monks to just eat a small 
      ball of rice.When I brought the rice to him, he started to make his ball 
      bigger and bigger! I didn't say anything. Finally, he looked at me and 
      said, &quot;I'm getting old. In the olden days, I could pack it really tight.&quot;
      </P>
      <P>Knowing oneself and seeing clearly does not mean attaining some 
      ethereal height of renunciation. One uses one's circumstances for 
      understanding oneself. That's the same thing as the aspiration for 
      freedom. It's very ordinary. We tend to look at the Buddha or other great 
      spiritual teachers and believe that we are separate from them. That is not 
      what the Buddha taught. The Dhamma is imminent here and now. It is present 
      for everyone's access and realization. This is the legacy of the Buddha.
