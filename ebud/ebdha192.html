        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he
        Mahaparinibbana Sutta, from the Long Discourse of Pali Tipitaka, is
        without doubt the most reliable source for details on the death of
        Siddhattha Gotama (BCE 563-483), the Lord Buddha. It is composed in a
        narrative style that allows readers to follow the story of the last days
        of the Buddha, beginning a few months before he died.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">To understand what really happened to
        the Buddha is not a simple matter, though. The sutta, or discourse,
        paints two conflicting personalities of the Buddha, one overriding the
        other.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The first personality was that of a miracle worker who beamed himself
        and his entourage of monks across the Ganges River (D II, 89), who had a
        divine vision of the settlement of gods on earth (D II, 87), who could
        live until the end of the world on condition that someone invite him to
        do so (D II, 103), who determined the time of his own death (D II, 105),
        and whose death was glorified by the shower of heavenly flowers and
        sandal powder and divine music (D II, 138).&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The other personality was that of an aged being who was failing in
        health (D II, 120), who almost lost his life because of a severe pain
        during his last retreat at Vesali (D II, 100), and who was forced to
        come to terms with his unexpected illness and death after consuming a
        special cuisine offered by his generous host.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These two personalities take turns emerging in different parts of the
        narrative.&nbsp;Moreover, there also appear to be two explanations of
        the Buddha's cause of death: One is that the Buddha died because his
        attendant, Ananda, failed to invite him to live on to the age of the
        world or even longer (D II, 117). The other is that he died by a sudden
        illness which began after he ate what is known as
        &quot;Sukaramaddava&quot; (D II, 127-157).&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The former story was probably a legend, or the result of a political
        struggle within the Buddhist community during a stage of transition,
        whereas the latter sounds more realistic and accurate in describing a
        real life situation that happened in the Buddha's last days.</p>
        <p>A number of studies have focused on the nature of the special cuisine
        that the Buddha ate during his last meal as being the agent of his
        death. However, there is also another approach based on the description
        of the symptoms and signs given in the sutta, which modern medical
        knowledge can shed light on.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In another mural painting at Wat Ratchasittharam, the Lord Buddha is
        approaching death, but he still takes time to answer questions put forth
        by the ascetic Subhadda, his last convert who, after being admitted to
        the Buddhist Order, became an arahant (enlightened monk).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>What we know</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Mahaparinibbana Sutta, we are
        told that the Buddha became ill suddenly after he ate a special
        delicacy, Sukaramaddava, literally translated as &quot;soft pork&quot;,
        which had been prepared by his generous host, Cunda Kammaraputta. The
        name of the cuisine has attracted the attention of many scholars, and it
        has been the focus of academic research on the nature of the meal or
        ingredients used in the cooking of this special dish.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The sutta itself provides details concerning the signs and symptoms
        of his illness in addition to some reliable information about his
        circumstances over the previous four months, and these details are also
        medically significant.</p>
        <p>The sutta begins with King Ajatasattus' plot to conquer a rival
        state, Vajji. The Buddha had journeyed to Vajji to enter his last
        rainy-season retreat. It was during this retreat that he fell ill. The
        symptoms of the illness were sudden, severe pain.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>However, the sutta provides no description of the location and
        character of his pain. It mentions his illness briefly, and says that
        the pain was intense, and almost killed him.</p>
        <p>Subsequently, the Buddha was visited by Mara, the God of Death, who
        invited him to pass away.&nbsp;The Buddha did not accept the invitation
        right away. It was only after Ananda, his attendant, failed to recognise
        his hint for an invitation to remain that he died. This piece of the
        message, though tied up with myth and supernaturalism, gives us some
        medically significant information. When the sutta was composed, its
        author was under the impression that the Buddha died, not because of the
        food he ate, but because he already had an underlying illness that was
        serious and acute-and had the same symptoms of the disease that finally
        killed him.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>The Timing</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Theravada Buddhist tradition has adhered
        to the assumption that the historical Buddha passed away during the
        night of the full moon in the lunar month of Visakha (which falls
        sometime in May to June). But the timing contradicts information given
        in the sutta, which states clearly that the Buddha died soon after the
        rainy-season retreat, most likely during the autumn or mid-winter, that
        is, November to January.</p>
        <p>A description of the miracle of the unseasonal blooming of leaves and
        flowers on the sala trees, when the Buddha was laid down between them,
        indicates the time frame given in the sutta.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Autumn and winter, however, are seasons that are not favourable for
        the growth of mushrooms, which some scholars believe to be the source of
        the poison that the Buddha ate during his last meal.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Diagnosis</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The sutta tells us that the Buddha felt
        ill immediately after eating the Sukaramaddava. Since we do not know
        anything about the nature of this food, it is difficult to name it as
        the direct cause of the Buddha's illness. But from the descriptions
        given, the onset of the illness was quick.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While eating, he felt there was something wrong with the food and he
        suggested his host have the food buried. Soon afterward, he suffered
        severe stomach pain and passed blood from his rectum.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We can reasonably assume that the illness started while he was having
        his meal, making him think there was something wrong with the unfamiliar
        delicacy.&nbsp;Out of his compassion for others, he had it buried.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Was food poisoning the cause of the illness? It seems
        unlikely.&nbsp;The symptoms described do not indicate food poisoning,
        which can be very acute, but would hardly cause diarrhoea with blood.
        Usually, food poisoning caused by bacteria does not manifest itself
        immediately, but takes an incubation period of two to 12 hours to
        manifest itself, normally with acute diarrhoea and vomiting, but not the
        passage of blood.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Another possibility is chemical poisoning, which also has an
        immediate effect, but it is unusual for chemical poisoning to cause
        severe intestinal bleeding. Food poisoning with immediate intestinal
        bleeding could only have been caused by corrosive chemicals such as
        strong acids, which can easily lead to immediate illness. But corrosive
        chemicals should have caused bleeding in the upper intestinal tract,
        leading to vomiting blood. None of these severe signs are mentioned in
        the text.</p>
        <p>Peptic ulcer diseases can be excluded from the list of possible
        illnesses as well. In spite of the fact that their onset is immediate,
        they are seldom accompanied by bloody stool. A gastric ulcer with
        intestinal bleeding produces black stool when the ulcer penetrates a
        blood vessel. An ulcer higher up in the digestive tract would be more
        likely to manifest itself as bloody vomiting, not a passage of blood
        through the rectum.</p>
        <p>Other evidence against this possibility is that a patient with a
        large gastric ulcer usually does not have an appetite. By accepting the
        invitation for lunch with the host, we can assume that the Buddha felt
        as healthy as any man in his early 80s would feel. Given his age we
        cannot rule out that the Buddha did not have a chronic disease, such as
        cancer or tuberculosis or a tropical infection such as dysentery or
        typhoid, which could have been quite common in the Buddha's time.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These diseases could produce bleeding of the lower intestine,
        depending on their location. They also agree with the history of his
        earlier illness during the retreat. But they can be ruled out, since
        they are usually accompanied by other symptoms, such as lethargy, loss
        of appetite, weight loss, growth or mass in the abdomen. None of these
        symptoms were mentioned in the sutta.</p>
        <p>A large haemorrhoid can cause severe rectal bleeding, but it is
        unlikely that a haemorrhoid could cause severe abdominal pain unless it
        is strangulated. But then it would have greatly disturbed the walking of
        the Buddha to the house of his host, and rarely is haemorrhoid bleeding
        triggered by a meal.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Mesenteric infarction</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">A disease that matches the described
        symptoms-accompanied by acute abdominal pain and the passage of blood,
        commonly found among elderly people, and triggered by a meal-is
        mesenteric infarction, caused by an obstruction of the blood vessels of
        the mesentery. It is lethal. Acute mesenteric ischaemia (a reduction in
        the blood supply to the mesentery) is a grave condition with a high rate
        of mortality.</p>
        <p>The mesentery is a part of the intestinal wall that binds the whole
        intestinal tract to the abdominal cavity. An infarction of the vessels
        of the mesentery normally causes the death of the tissue in a large
        section of the intestinal tract, which results in a laceration of the
        intestinal wall.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This normally produces severe pain in the abdomen and the passage of
        blood. The patient usually dies of acute blood loss.&nbsp;This condition
        matches the information given in the sutta.&nbsp;It is also confirmed
        later when the Buddha asked Ananda to fetch some water for him to drink,
        indicating intense thirst.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As the story goes, Ananda refused, as he saw no source for clean
        water. He argued with the Buddha that the nearby stream had been muddied
        by a large caravan of carts. But the Buddha insisted he fetch water
        anyway.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A question arises at this point: Why did the Buddha not go to the
        water himself, instead of pressing his unwilling attendant to do
        so?&nbsp;The answer is simple. The Buddha was suffering from shock
        caused by severe blood loss. He could no longer walk, and from then to
        his death bed he was most likely carried on a stretcher.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If this was indeed the situation, the sutta remains silent about the
        Buddha's travelling to his deathbed, possibly because the author felt
        that it would be an embarrassment for the Buddha.&nbsp;Geographically,
        we know that the distance between the place believed to be the house of
        Cunda and the place where the Buddha died was about 15 to 20 kilometres.
        It is not possible for a patient with such a grave illness to walk such
        a distance.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>More likely, what happened was that the Buddha was carried on a
        stretcher by a group of monks to Kusinara (Kushinagara).&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It remains a point of debate whether the Buddha really determined to
        pass away at this city, presumably not much larger than a
        town.&nbsp;From the direction of the Buddha's journey, given in the
        sutta, he was moving north from Rajagaha. It is possible that he did not
        intend to die there, but in the town where he was born, which would have
        taken a period of three months to reach.</p>
        <p>From the sutta, it is clear that the Buddha was not anticipating his
        sudden illness, or else he would not have accepted the invitation of his
        host. Kusinara was probably the nearest town where he could find a
        doctor to take care of him. It is not difficult to see a group of monks
        hurriedly carrying the Buddha on a stretcher to the nearest town to save
        his life.</p>
        <p>Before passing away, the Buddha told Ananda that Cunda was not to be
        blamed and that his death was not caused by eating Sukaramaddava. The
        statement is significant.</font> <font face="Times New Roman">The meal
        was not the direct cause of his death. The Buddha knew that the symptom
        was a repeat of an experience he'd had a few months earlier, the one
        which had almost killed him.</p>
        <p>Sukaramaddava, no matter the ingredients or how it was cooked, was
        not the direct cause of his sudden illness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Progression of the disease</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mesenteric infarction is a disease
        commonly found among elderly people, caused by the obstruction of the
        main artery that supplies the middle section of the bowel-the small
        intestine-with blood. The most common cause of the obstruction is the
        degeneration of the wall of the blood vessel, the superior mesenteric
        artery, causing severe abdominal pain, also known as abdominal angina.</p>
        <p>Normally, the pain is triggered by a large meal, which requires a
        higher flow of blood to the digestive tract. As the obstruction
        persists, the bowel is deprived of its blood supply, which subsequently
        leads to an infarction, or gangrene, of a section of the intestinal
        tract. This in turn results in a laceration of the intestinal wall,
        profuse bleeding into the intestinal tract, and then bloody diarrhoea.</p>
        <p>The disease gets worse as the liquid and content of the intestine
        oozes out into the peritoneal cavity, causing peritonitis or
        inflammation of the abdominal walls.&nbsp;This is already a lethal
        condition for the patient, who often dies due to the loss of blood and
        other fluid. If it is not corrected by surgery, the disease often
        progresses to septic shock due to bacterial toxins infiltrating the
        blood stream.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Retrospective analysis</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">From the diagnosis given above, we can
        be rather certain that the Buddha suffered from mesenteric infarction
        caused by an occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery. This was the
        cause of the pain that almost killed him a few months earlier during his
        last rainy-season retreat.</p>
        <p>With the progress of the illness, some of the mucosal lining of his
        intestine sloughed off, and this site became the origin of the bleeding.
        Arteriosclerosis, the hardening of the vessel wall caused by ageing, was
        the cause of the arterial occlusion, a small blockage that did not
        result in bloody diarrhoea, but is a symptom, also known to us as
        abdominal angina.</p>
        <p>He had his second attack while he was eating the Sukaramaddava. The
        pain was probably not intense in the beginning, but made him feel that
        there was something wrong. Suspicious about the nature of the food, he
        asked his host to have it all buried, so that others might not suffer
        from it.</p>
        <p>Soon, the Buddha realised that the illness was serious, with the
        passage of blood and more severe pain in his abdomen. Due to the loss of
        blood, he went into shock. The degree of dehydration was so severe that
        he could not maintain himself any longer and he had to take shelter at a
        tree along the way.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Feeling very thirsty and exhausted, he got Ananda to collect water
        for him to drink, even though he knew that the water was muddied. It was
        there that he collapsed until his entourage carried him to the nearest
        town, Kusinara, where there would have been a chance of finding a doctor
        or lodging for him to recover in.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was probably true that the Buddha got better after drinking to
        replace his fluid loss, and resting on the stretcher. The experience
        with the symptoms told him that his sudden illness was the second attack
        of an existing disease. He told Ananda that the meal was not the cause
        of his illness, and that Cunda was not to blame.</p>
        <p>A patient with shock, dehydration and profuse blood loss usually
        feels very cold. This was the reason why he told his attendant to
        prepare a bed using four sheets of ifsanghati nf. According to Buddhist
        monastic discipline, a ifsanghati nfis a cloak, or extra piece of robe,
        very large, the size of a bed sheet, which the Budd ha allowed monks and
        nuns to wear in winter.</p>
        <p>This information reflects how cold the Buddha felt because of his
        loss of blood.&nbsp;Clinically, it is not possible for a patient who is
        in a state of shock with severe abdominal pain, most likely peritonitis,
        pale and shivering, to be ambulatory.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Buddha was most likely put into a lodging, where he was nursed
        and warmed, located in the city of Kusinara. This view is also confirmed
        with the description of Ananda who, weeping, swoons and holds onto the
        door of his lodge after learning that the Buddha was about to pass away.</p>
        <p>Normally, a patient with mesenteric infarction could live 10 to 20
        hours. From the sutta we learn that the Buddha died about 15 to 18 hours
        after the attack.&nbsp;During that time, his attendants would have tried
        their best to comfort him, for example, by warming the room where he was
        resting, or by dripping some water into his mouth to quench his
        lingering thirst, or by giving him some herbal drinks. But it would be
        highly unlikely that a shivering patient would need someone to fan him
        as is described in the sutta.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Off and on, he may have recovered from a state of exhaustion,
        allowing him to continue his dialogues with a few people. Most of his
        last words could have been true, and they were memorised by generations
        of monks until they were transcribed. But finally, late into the night,
        the Buddha died during a second wave of septic shock. His illness
        stemmed from natural causes coupled with his age, just as it would for
        anyone else.</font></p>
        <p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Conclusion</font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The hypothesis outlined above explains
        several scenes in the narrative of the sutta, namely, the pressuring of
        Ananda to fetch water, the Buddha's request for a fourfold cloak for his
        bed, the ordering of the meal to be buried, and so on.</p>
        <p>It also reveals another possibility of the actual means of
        transportation of the Buddha to Kusinara and the site of his death bed.
        Sukaramaddava, whatever its nature, was unlikely to have been the direct
        cause of his illness. The Buddha did not die by food poisoning. Rather,
        it was the size of the meal, relatively too large for his already
        troubled digestive tract, that triggered the second attack of mesenteric
        infarction that brought an end to his life./.</font></p>
