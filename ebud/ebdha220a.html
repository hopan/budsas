    M</font><font
    face="Times New Roman">aking their dreams come true seems all but impossible 
    for Buddhist nuns, particularly those in the Theravada tradition. After some 
    women gain experience practising and studying the dhamma, they wish to be 
    ordained as bhikkhunis (Buddhist nuns). They search for a teacher who will 
    be able to teach and guide their practice, as well as for a place where they 
    can be prepared for the future. Many move from place to place, experiencing 
    great disappointment because they do not receive what they are looking for.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">They encounter new traditions, 
    new languages for chanting, different English dialects and lifestyles. I 
    remember how an American friend of mine spent about two years with a dhamma 
    teacher from Asia, and how her friends complained that she was no longer 
    speaking English. I admired her courage to explore the Buddha&#39;s path, even 
    though the language and the culture were unfamiliar to her. Being a Western 
    woman, she was taught to express her opinion, to do what she likes, to be 
    brave, assertive and individualised. Many Western men, though, still think 
    men are superior.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As for Asians, teachers may 
    relax some customs to help such students, but lay supporters and others may 
    not be as helpful. Asian women who seek ordination also run into 
    difficulties. For example, there are men who have never seen a bhikkhuni or 
    who have little or no knowledge of bhikkhuni issues. They think it is wrong 
    for women to be bhikkhunis. The more that women move about, the greater is 
    their pool of knowledge and experience - and the keener their 
    disappointment.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One bhikkhuni I know is a very 
    highly educated, professional woman, very successful and well known in her 
    profession and community. She is honest, friendly, patient and down to 
    earth. She is well accepted by people who interact with her. When she 
    realised that she really wanted to be a bhikkhuni, a disciple of the Buddha, 
    she studied, practised and explored ways to achieve this goal.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We don&#39;t always get what we 
    want, though. Sometimes we have good jobs but no place to study Buddhism as 
    we would want. And most of the time, women must have a job in order to have 
    the funds to find an appropriate Buddhist study centre.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Anyway, this bhikkhuni moved 
    from one dhamma centre to another, from temple to temple, and even from one 
    ashram to another. She did this because she discovered that either she was 
    having to spend money to support the business (of that temple or ashram) or 
    that she had to work so as to have money to demonstrate her gratitude to a 
    teacher or a place. My friend was ordained and is now waiting for a higher 
    ordination. Like other Western bhikkhunis, she is struggling to find a place 
    to live and resources to live on. Almost all her savings have been spent on 
    shelter and health insurance.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">She has difficulty finding 
    support even within her own sect. When she was told she must be in a temple 
    for a few years to prepare herself for ordination as a novice, she asked why 
    so many men were ordained as monks without any preparation at all. When they 
    wish to become monks, they merely arrange the date and time. They celebrate 
    the announcement of their ordination as if it were a wedding ceremony.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some cannot even recite homage 
    to the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha. Some are drunk and almost unable to repeat 
    the precepts during their ordination. After ordination these monks stay in a 
    temple where everything is prepared for them. We never see any monk who has 
    to a rent place to stay, as bhikkhunis must do. There are always temples for 
    them.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Things are not the same as they 
    were 2,500 years ago - things and beings have changed. New innovations and 
    technology have become a part of daily life. Should we tell monks to stop 
    using cars, aeroplanes and computers, reading newspapers, answering 
    telephone calls, watching television and so on and so forth? If some of the 
    Vinaya or discipline has been relaxed in order to suit life in this century, 
    shouldn&#39;t it also be relaxed as regards women who want to be ordained as 
    bhikkhunis?</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha allowed women to be 
    ordained because he believed that gender was not a factor in enlightenment.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In addition, it appears that 
    women don&#39;t receive emotional support before their ordination or while 
    working to meet their wishes. However, since they work very hard for their 
    goals, they pursue the ordination and still insist on higher ordination. In 
    this world, things seem to be unfair for people who are honest and have good 
    intentions. Some of those people are self-made individuals, humble and 
    ashamed to ask for assistance. They think that if they have difficulties, 
    others may have the same problems.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">They believe that if they wait, 
    one day some people will be able to help them. If those people were 
    dishonest, they would do anything to gain personal benefits such as using 
    the robe to ask for donations or taking advantage of kind lay Buddhist 
    supporters. However, they have &#39;Hiri Otappa, shame and fear of doing worng.&quot; 
    As usual, the squeaky wheel gets the oil. Therefore, people seem to neglect 
    their needs In this case, I can understand the situation, because when we 
    look at the world &quot;Revival&quot; it means that you have to start from scratch. A 
    revival means we have to start over, and that is what Buddhist nuns must do.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The bhikkhuni order in 
    Theravada Tradition died out almost 800 years ago. Fortunately, in December 
    of 1996, the Sri Lankan Sangha conducted the first &quot;Restoration of the 
    Theravada Bhikkhuni Order&quot;. There have been other bhikkhunis ordained in 
    other traditions, such as the Mahayana in Asia, and later in the US and 
    other Western countries.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Teachers must find a place for 
    newly-ordained women to live, study and practise in a safe, appropriate 
    environment. However, sometimes, side tracks cause their plans to fail. 
    Nuns, though, have difficulty finding such places, as well as female 
    teachers who can counsel younger nuns, and resources to support and provide 
    security for practitioners. The students who don the saffron robes are no 
    longer able to work.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Thus having a Bhikkhuni Vihara, 
    or a centre for Buddhist nuns is in the best interests of women who wish to 
    study Buddhism, and will also be helpful to working women and young women 
    who wish to explore whether the Buddha&#39;s path is right for them.It can also 
    be a place for girls and boys to learn to respect and accept their mothers, 
    grandmothers, aunts and other females.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is not easy for many 
    educated women to give up a luxurious life and turn to a nunnery-not unless 
    they really want to practice dhamma correctly. Finding a place where they 
    can meditate regularly takes a lot of time, energy, emotion and money. Think 
    about those who try to understand the Dhamma in Pali, Sanskrit, or English. 
    Although it is not easy to acquire the concepts they study and spend time 
    for this diligently. They learn to let go of worldly life style and worldly 
    habit even before they decide to live in a temple for a few years to assure 
    that they really want to be bhikkhunis.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There is a saying, &quot;We don&#39;t 
    get anything for free.&quot; Some meditators work very hard just to save money 
    for a 10-day retreat. Although some meditation centres do not charge for 
    anything, many people have to travel a long way to get to them. For women 
    who would like to live the Buddha&#39;s path, it can be far more difficult. I 
    give such women credit for their good intentions, courage and the effort 
    they make in enduring all the obstacles they encounter.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Although they have decided to 
    &quot;go forth into homelessness&quot;, this should not mean that they have to live 
    under bridges, or in train stations or on mountains. If we can help them to 
    use their saving just for basic needs, it would promote Buddhism, 
    particularly &quot;Bhikkhuni Revival.&quot; These Bhikkhunis will have less 
    difficulties, tension, frustration and anxiety and able to practice Dhamma 
    correctly. I strongly believe that if they don&#39;t use their savnigs for 
    themselves, it will be donated to the temple where they belong to.</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If they don&#39;t realise that they 
    cannot take anything with them when they die, I think these women would 
    rather enjoy themselves with luxurious things in a worldly lifestyle instead 
    of having a few set of robes, eating only two meals a day and cut off from 
    the temptations in the community. The revival of female ordinations - 
    &quot;Bhikkhuni Revival&quot; - will not succeed if the women cannot &quot;survive&quot; both 
    during the training for ordination, and after the ordination itself. How 
    many women would succeed, like the late Ven Bhikkhuni Khema, who helped 
    propagate Buddhism in many countries, if only given the chance?</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha taught that the us 
    &quot;Sabbadanam dhammadanam jinati, the gift of truth, or dhamma, excels all 
    other gifts&quot;. On behalf of all women who seek Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha for 
    refuge, I thank all lay supporters and our friends of Buddhist for their 
    generosity and concern about this issue. A bhikkhuni Vihara or a Centre 
    centre will allow women, nuns or otherwise, to study, practise and promote 
    Buddhism correctly and appropriately. There is an ancient saying: &quot;Children 
    will turn out according to the way their parents raise them.&quot; I have high 
    confidence that your support will be rewarded with Dhamma Seeds for the 
    future.&nbsp; <B><A HREF="#top">[^]</A> </B></font></p>

    </b><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The ordination of prominent 
    Buddhist scholar Dr Chatsumarn Kabilsingh early this year promises a 
    resurgence of religious women in Buddhism, if Thai society will come forward 
    and support it</font></p>
    <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">For Dhammananda, bhikkhuni 
    ordination is a best way for women to carry on the Buddha&#39;s spiritual 
    heritage. Her ordination also epitomises an increasing demand for full 
    participation of women in Buddhism -- a worldwide movement which she insists 
    Thailand can&#39;t simply reject.</font></p>
    </i><font size="6"><p></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">T</font><font
    face="Times New Roman">he earth didn&#39;t shake. But when former Thammasat 
    lecturer and leading Buddhist scholar Dr Chatsumarn Kabilsingh took the 
    lifetime vow during her ordination to become a bhikkhuni (female monk) in 
    Sri Lanka early this year, it was momentous in the development of Buddhism 
    in Thailand.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dr Chatsumarn, who received the ordained 
    name of Dhammananda, now assumes the status of a Theravada samaneri 
    (novice). Within two years, if she maintains the novice&#39;s six rules (the 
    five Buddhist precepts plus the prohibition on eating after noon), 
    Dhammananda can apply to be ordained as a bhikkhuni.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">By committing herself to the sacred status 
    of female Buddhists, which unfortunately has yet to be recognised by Thai 
    law, Dhammananda is paving the way for women interested in realising the 
    Buddha within themselves.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Until now, the only road open to women who 
    wish to develop their spirituality is to become a mae chi (nun). Although 
    the precept-holder standing allows a monastic lifestyle, generally it is not 
    considered a serious platform for Dhamma study.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On a more personal basis, Dr Chatsumarn&#39;s 
    entrance into the monkhood attests to a spiritual continuation from one 
    generation to the next. Her mother, Mrs Voramai, is the first Thai bhikkhuni 
    with full ordination. Voramai, known among her many followers as Luang Ya 
    (Grandmother monk) is now 93. She has been sick recently and spends most of 
    the time in bed</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;After (my) ordination, I went in to see 
    her. I asked her what she thought of it. She simply stroked my face, playing 
    with my head as if to confirm that it really was shaved. After a while, she 
    let me go as she always did. Since I have worn the holy robes, however, she 
    wais to me,&quot; Dhammananda said.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Luang Ya sponsored the construction of Wat 
    Songdharmakalayani in Nakhon Pathom province, where Dhammananda now resides. 
    A leading Buddhist scholar, Dhammananda has had a distinguished career. With 
    a Ph.D in Buddhism from Magadh University in India, she taught Buddhist 
    philosophy at Thammasat University and Maha Chula Sangha University.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">She has published many books about Buddhism, 
    both in Thai and English and is a regular speaker at international 
    conferences. She was also a founder and former director of Thammasat 
    University&#39;s Indian Studies Centre.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Academically, Dhammananda is more than 
    accomplished in Buddhist study. But the real reason she decided to enter the 
    monkhood was her boredom with secular existence. The world, she said, just 
    turned her off.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I grew up in religious surroundings and in 
    fact, I was quite confident I would be ordained one day. But the real 
    calling came about two years ago. What I used to care and work for, the 
    personal glory or success, does not mean anything to me anymore. I have been 
    quite successful in my profession. I have been to many places. I have seen 
    the world. I thought it was time to devote my life to the service of 
    Buddhism.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dhammananda, who is 57 now, thought she 
    would be too old if she waited until her retirement to embark upon the 
    religious path. She sought early retirement and started preparing herself 
    for the transition.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the first things she did was file for 
    a divorce.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;My husband had known before we were married 
    that I would follow the Buddha&#39;s way one day. Now that my children have 
    grown up and settled down well, my job is done. I have no concern left.&quot; For 
    Dhammananda, what was more difficult was to choose where to be ordained.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The bhikkhuni ordination requires dual 
    ordinations by both the bhikkhuni and bhikkhu sangha (monks council). Since 
    Thailand has never established a bhikkhuni sangha, the ordination is 
    impossible here.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are a few other Asian countries with 
    an active bhikkhuni sangha, however. Taiwan, Dhammananda noted, has always 
    been the strongest advocate for women. The bhikkhuni order there is very 
    well-established and actively engaged in both academic and social welfare 
    activities.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even the Taiwanese supreme patriarch 
    remarked that: &quot;Buddhist education in this country is in the hands of 
    bhikkhunis.&quot; Dhammananda&#39;s own mother was ordained there in the Dharmagupta 
    lineage in 1971.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people reject the bhikkhuni ordination 
    from the Taiwanese lineage on the grounds that the lineage belongs to the 
    Mahayana Tradition. Dhammananda explained that this belief is unfounded 
    because the Dharmagupta lineage is in fact a sub-branch of Theravada 
    Buddhism.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Historically speaking, the bhikkhunis who 
    revived the ordination of women in China came from the Theravada Tradition 
    in Sri Lanka. A devout follower of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Dhammananda 
    herself was more interested in the Tibetan lineage. But Tibetan ordination 
    is available only at the novice level.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although the Dalai Lama suggested she could 
    seek a higher ordination in the existing Chinese lineage in Taiwan or Hong 
    Kong, as many women who joined the Tibetan lineage do, Dhammananda hesitated 
    to do so.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Fortunately, Sri Lanka began to revive its 
    bhikkhuni ordination. In 1996, the Korean bhikkhu sangha hosted an 
    ordination of 10 Sri Lankan precept-holders. Two years later, the Sri Lankan 
    sangha, led by Ven Sumangala from the Siam Sect, began to give ordinations 
    to women. According to Dhammananda, the revival of bhikkhuni order in Sri 
    Lanka is a turning point in Buddhist history.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It was the Sri Lankan bhikkhuni who 
    travelled to India and established the bhikkhuni order in China. The lineage 
    still continues until today but in the Mahayana tradition. When Sri Lanka 
    wanted to revive the long-defunct Theravada bhikkhuni order, the Mahayana 
    bhikkhunis returned to start the fire back where it began, making it 
    possible for women in Theravada Buddhist countries to be ordained once 
    again.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sri Lanka is the only Theravada Buddhist 
    country with a history of bhikkhuni ordination. &quot;So when it is revived on 
    that soil, it takes root,&quot; she said, adding there are more than 200 
    bhikkhunis in Sri Lanka at present.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In April last year, she flew to Taiwan to 
    receive the lay bodhisattva precepts as a way to formulate her mind. She 
    became a vegetarian soon after. The last secular job she did as Dr 
    Chatsumarn Kabilsingh was to be an emcee for a Buddhist fellowship 
    conference. &quot;I still got dressed up and wore make-up at that time,&quot; she 
    noted.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the first full moon night of the first 
    month of the year, she took the eight precepts. She stopped decorating 
    herself and having dinner after that.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On February 6, one day before the Buddhist&#39;s 
    holy Makhapuja Day, Dr Chatsumarn had her head shaved and received 
    ordination as a Theravadan samaneri.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;For me, the most important preparation 
    before the ordination was to understand the importance of bhikkhunis and to 
    prepare my mind. Unlike the smooth path of male ordination, being a 
    bhikkhuni is to walk against the tide. If my spiritual foundation is not 
    solid enough, I might become distracted or unhappy when faced with 
    resistance. And if I lose my calmness, it would defeat the whole purpose of 
    my ordination.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I do not choose to be ordained because I 
    want people to recognise me. I did it because I want to carry on the 
    heritage of the Lord Buddha. I am trying to revive the four pillars of 
    Buddhism-bhikkus, bhikkhunis, laymen and laywomen-that will sustain the 
    religion into the future. I don&#39;t mind if some people reserve different 
    opinions about bhikkhunis. The public will be the ones to judge our worth.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dhammananda added that there were two ideals 
    she strove towards but could never accomplish before the ordination. The 
    first one was to stop eating meat. &quot;As a Buddhist, I received the first 
    precept of &#39;do not kill&#39;. Still, I ate what other people killed and I could 
    tell that meat was more delicious than vegetables,&quot; she said. The second was 
    to lead a celibate life. &quot;Celibacy is a blissful state. It improves 
    meditation and spiritual development. I only achieved this after taking the 
    bodhisattva precepts.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now on the monastic path, there are 
    immediate transformations. The first she noticed was physical, related to 
    the new eating habits. &quot;Before, I consumed for my own pleasure. But now, I 
    eat whatever is offered to me. I eat merely to sustain my life. There is no 
    more question whether I like it or not,&quot; Dhammananda explained.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Also, I was an academic by nature. I 
    considered talking to people a waste of time. I would rather shut myself in, 
    reading and researching. But now that I am a monk, I listen to everything 
    visitors have to discuss, be it their illnesses or their conflicts with 
    relatives. I have discovered that most people don&#39;t need a tangible 
    solution, they just need someone to listen.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The changes are sudden and full. It is so 
    clear to me that a monk must serve other people, not his or her self. Even 
    the robes we wear,&quot; she touched her brick-coloured robes, &quot;are strictly 
    practical, not aesthetic.&quot; Dhammananda has two sets of long-sleeve shirt and 
    robes and she thinks the austere uniform is a wonderful creation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;With basically nothing to choose from, the 
    mind is less concerned. The only thing I have to consider is if one set of 
    robes is wet, the other must be dry. This frees my mind from distractions. I 
    always think what an amazing thing these robes are,&quot; Dhammananda said, with 
    a smile.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In terms of reaction from the people around 
    her, Dhammananda said they can be split into two groups. The first group 
    consists of admirers who are overjoyed at seeing a woman in religious robes. 
    The other are those who simply don&#39;t know how to react or interact with her.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To a certain extent, these small-circle 
    reactions reflect trends in the outside world. On the one side, bhikkhuni 
    ordination is praised as a means to empower women in Buddhism-to return to 
    them the previously denied access to enlightenment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the other side, it is viewed by some 
    scholars as further adding to the already problematic power structure of the 
    sangha. Dhammananda is aware of the criticism.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Bhikkhuni ordination is an option that is 
    simply not available for Buddhist women in Thailand. The door is closed. The 
    lock is rusted. And the key is lost. Internationally, however, the demand 
    for full participation of women is very strong. It is a worldwide movement 
    and Thailand can&#39;t reject it,&quot; Dhammananda said</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If the Thai sangha is far-sighted enough, it 
    should take this matter into its own hands instead of allowing women to seek 
    an ordination by themselves. Bhikkhunis are potential human resources that 
    could strengthen many aspects of the sangha&#39;s mission.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As for her plan for the future, Dhammananda 
    said that apart from running Wat Songdharmakalani and Baan Santi Rak for 
    unwed mothers and discussing dhamma with visitors, she is learning every 
    aspect of her ordained life and trying to understand it as completely as 
    possible.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As a novice, she is required to study Dhamma 
    with her preceptor for two years. Since the preceptor is in Sri Lanka, she 
    does it via the Internet. Building a religious community for women is next 
    on her agenda.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I would be satisfied if I could serve as a 
    refuge for women. I am not aiming at a big market. I don&#39;t think Thai women 
    will rise up and get ordained en masse. A monastic path is not a comfortable 
    lifestyle. I am thinking of a small religious community which helps women 
    develop their own spirituality and contribute something to society.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I know there is some resistance out there. 
    It is not my intention to stick out and provoke anybody. I will try to 
    honour everyone. I will try to be a supatipanno, to be a female monk with 
    good conduct. Time will tell. If society believes this is a worthy role, 
    then people will support it and consider it another alternative for women.&quot;</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Getting there</font></p>
    </b><p><font face="Times New Roman">What is the status of bhikkhuni in 
    Thailand?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The attempt to introduce the bhikkhuni 
    sangha to Thailand dates back to 1927. During that time, politician and 
    progressive social critic Narin Bhasit, commonly known as Narin Klueng, was 
    critical of the laxity of the sangha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He, then, challenged the institution by 
    having his two daughters, Sara and Chongdi, ordained as bhikkhunis. Narin 
    also donated a piece of land and had Wat Nariwong built as a residence for 
    bhikkhunis. The sangha and state authorities opposed his initiative. His 
    daughters, along with seven or eight bhikkhunis at Wat Nariwong, were 
    ordered to be disrobed. The two bhikkhunis resisted. They were put in jail 
    and physically had the robes removed from them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The incident prompted the Sangha Supreme 
    Council to pass an order forbidding any monks to give bhikkhuni, samaneri or 
    sikkhamana (a female novice during a two-year training before receiving a 
    bhikkhuni ordination) ordination to women in 1928. The rule still exists.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dhammananda, however, argues that the order 
    contradicts Article 5 of the Constitution, which stipulates that Thai 
    people, regardless of their origin, gender, or religion, are entitled to 
    equal protection under the Constitution.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I consulted some judges and they said there 
    is no need to nullify the order because any law that is in conflict with the 
    highest law of the land is automatically null and void. The reason this rule 
    remains is because nobody has ever challenged it. That means the validity of 
    this order has never been questioned or re-examined,&quot; the samaneri 
    explained.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Is gender a factor in enlightenment 
    according to the Buddha?</font></p>
    </b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people have lingering doubts about 
    the Buddha&#39;s acceptance of women because when Queen Maha Pajapati, the 
    Buddha&#39;s aunt and stepmother, asked for his permission to be ordained, the 
    Buddha refused. But Queen Maha Pajapati did not give up. She, along with 500 
    Sakya women, shaved their heads, donned the saffron robes and followed the 
    Buddha on foot.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ananda, the Buddha&#39;s personal attendant, 
    found them waiting at the entrance, covered with dust, in torn robes and 
    bleeding feet. He learned of their dilemma and approached the Buddha on 
    their behalf. Again, the Buddha forbade Ananda, telling him: &quot;Please, do not 
    ask so.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ananda persisted in an attempt to understand 
    the Buddha&#39;s refusal. He asked whether it was because women were not capable 
    of spiritual enlightenment that religious life is available only to men. To 
    this, Buddha made it clear that both men and women have the same potential 
    to reach Nirvana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He, then, allowed the women to be ordained. 
    The Buddha&#39;s statement broke new ground because during that time, according 
    to Hindu beliefs, a woman could reach salvation only through bhakti 
    (devotion) to her husband. A woman was not permitted to read nor recite the 
    Vedas, the Hindu&#39;s sacred text, nor was she allowed to lead a religious 
    life.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">What are the requirements for bhikkhuni 
    ordination?</font></p>
    </b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Bhikkhuni ordination requires dual 
    ordinations, one in the presence of a minimum of five bhikkhunis and the 
    other in the presence of a minimum of five bhikkhus. A woman who requests a 
    bhikkhuni ordination must be at least 20 years of age, having permission 
    from her parents and have no illness that will pose an obstacle to leading 
    an ordained life. She must have completed a two-year training as a 
    sikkhamana and be able to obtain basic material requirements, such as a bowl 
    and robes.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">During the training period, the sikkhamana 
    must observe six anudharmas without transgression. If she violates any of 
    the precepts, she has to start all over again.&nbsp; <B><A HREF="#top">[^]</A>

    </b><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A fervent debate has 
    erupted in the wake of the ordination of Buddhist scholar Dr Chatsumarn 
    Kabilsingh as a novice monk. The controversy has generated a lot of heat-but 
    little light and, as yet, no solution.</font></p>
    </i><font size="6"><p></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">T</font><font
    face="Times New Roman">hose who study the Tripitaka, the Buddhist 
    scriptures, know that the path to becoming a bhikkhuni (female monk) is not 
    a smooth, easy one. The circumstances surrounding the ordination of the 
    first bhikkhuni, Queen Maha Pajapati, the Buddha&#39;s foster mother, is a case 
    in point.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Maha Pajapati and the 500 Sakyan women she 
    led had to walk until their robes were torn and their feet were bleeding to 
    catch up with the Buddha to ask for ordination. Even so, when Ananda, the 
    Buddha&#39;s cousin and personal attendant, approached the Buddha on their 
    behalf, the Buddha turned down Maha Pajapati&#39;s request as he had done 
    several times before.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It was only when Ananda asked him whether 
    his refusal was because women were not capable of achieving spiritual 
    enlightenment that the Buddha made it clear that men and women had equal 
    spiritual potential, and allowed the women to be ordained on condition they 
    accepted the Eight Garudharmas. (See The Eight Garudharmas.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">More than 2,500 years have passed, and yet 
    the difficulty facing women who wish to follow the Buddha&#39;s path has not 
    lessened with the passing of time. Currently, it is not the Buddha&#39;s 
    permission that matters, but interpretation of his rules.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To a certain extent, Buddhist scholar Dr 
    Chatsumarn Kabilsingh had expected some resistance when she decided to be 
    ordained as a Theravadan samaneri (novice female monk) in Sri Lanka earlier 
    this year. After all, Thailand has never had a bhikkhuni sangha (order of 
    nuns). Thai law prohibits monks from ordaining women as samaneri or 
    bhikkhunis.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The backlash from senior monks over Dr 
    Chatsumarn&#39;s ordination has been daunting, while the Sangha Supreme Council 
    has been silent.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dr Chatsumarn, who received the ordained 
    name of Dhammananda, has explained that the surviving bhikkhuni sangha in 
    China, which helped revive the Sri Lankan lineage where she received 
    ordination, was established by bhikkhunis from the Theravada tradition. 
    Despite this explanation, the Council has kept quiet.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A few senior monks, however, have come out 
    to voice dissent. Reaction has ranged from a lukewarm, wait-and-see attitude 
    to completely denying the possibility of having a bhikkhuni sangha in 
    Thailand. The bhikkhuni lineage in the Theravada tradition was terminated a 
    long time ago, some say. There is no need to further investigate or 
    reinterpret existing rules to accommodate the demands of women who wish to 
    lead a religious life. End of conversation. &quot;The bhikkhuni ordination 
    requires a dual ordination from both the bhikkhu and bhikkhuni sangha&quot; 
    (according to the Vinaya, or monastic prohibitions and allowances, a set of 
    rules devised by the Buddha).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since there is no bhikkhuni in Thailand, the 
    ordination is simply impossible.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If we allow women to be ordained as 
    bhikkhunis and to establish their own monasteries, they can be attacked, 
    even raped. Such a thing will weaken Buddhism,&quot; Phra Dhepdilok, deputy abbot 
    of Wat Bovornives, reportedly said.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ironically, Phra Dhepdilok is the author of 
    the book, The History of Bhikkhunis, which explains how many bhikkhunis 
    excelled in the study of dhamma and helped promote Buddhism during the time 
    of Buddha. The book is used as a supplementary text on Buddhism and ethics 
    for high school students.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many Buddhist scholars disagree with the 
    Council&#39;s citing of the Vinaya as a barrier against female ordination.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dr Tavivat Puntarigvivat, chairman of the 
    Comparative Religions Graduate Programme at Mahidol University, argued that 
    the most important thing in this case was the Buddha&#39;s permission for women 
    to be ordained as bhikkhunis. Besides, the bhikkhuni sangha prospered for 
    more than a thousand years, both in India and Sri Lanka. During the 10th and 
    11th centuries, Buddhism in India was eclipsed by Islam while political 
    turmoil and war wiped out both the male and female sanghas in Sri Lanka. 
    Fortunately, the Sri Lankan monk order was revived by inviting monks from 
    the lineage in Thailand to give ordination. The bhikkhuni order, however, 
    died out and was not established again because of the rule requiring an 
    existing order to ordain new members. It was, however, recently revived with 
    assistance from Taiwan.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In an article for the book, What Men Owe to 
    Women: Men&#39;s Voices from World Religions, Dr Tavivat argues that the 
    bhikkhuni order is not like a &quot;biological species that cannot be revived&quot;.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The bhikkhuni sangha still exists in the 
    Mahayana tradition in China, whose original lineage came from the 
    Dharmagupta subsect of the Theravada tradition in Sri Lanka,&quot; he wrote.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dr Suwanna Satha-anand, from the Philosophy 
    Department of Chulalongkorn University, goes beyond the surface of the 
    controversy to delve further into the philosophy behind the Council&#39;s 
    cold-shoulder response to the possibility of introducing bhikkhunis to 
    Thailand.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I think the Council&#39;s silence is a matter 
    of allowing one accident in history-in this case the war that terminated 
    Buddhism and the bhikkhuni order in Sri Lanka-to triumph over the Buddha&#39;s 
    decision (of allowing women to be ordained).&quot;To understand the issue, we 
    need to analyse the circumstances surrounding the first female ordination. 
    In her article, Truth Over Convention: Feminist Interpretations of Buddhism, 
    Dr Suwanna explained that Buddhism accepts two categories of truth, one 
    ultimate the other conventional. The lecturer believes that the truth of 
    convention-awareness of social and cultural conditions-prompted the Buddha 
    to turn down the first three requests for ordination from his foster mother 
    Maha Pajapati. The Indian social norm at that time was patriarchal. Women 
    were not supposed to pursue a religious life. Salvation was available only 
    through devotion and service to one&#39;s husband.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, Ananda&#39;s question prompted the 
    Buddha to ascertain that men and women possess the same Buddha nature and 
    are thus equally capable of enlightenment. If the Buddha continued to 
    decline offering women access to the spiritual life, that would have meant 
    that Buddhist truth was not universal, that the Buddha&#39;s truth could not be 
    applied to half of humanity.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Viewed in this light, the Buddha was faced 
    with a conflict between conventional truth, which were the cultural 
    constraints of that time, and the ultimate truth, which was the universality 
    of his dhamma. The Buddha must have realised that the existence of a 
    bhikkhuni order would make everything more complicated for the religious 
    community, both in terms of psychological difficulties and possible tension 
    between the two orders. The fact that he allowed women to be ordained in 
    spite of all these anticipated difficulties meant he wanted to uphold the 
    ultimate truth over convention,&quot; Dr Suwanna explained.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If the principle of truth over convention is 
    applied, then the Thai Sangha must reconsider its rejection of the 
    re-establishment of the bhikkhuni order.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Many rules in the Vinaya were established 
    so that the Buddhist religious community could be at peace with conventional 
    practices in society at that time. By citing the Vinaya as an obstacle to 
    female ordination, the Council is then basing its judgement on conventional 
    limitations, which is against its duty to propagate Buddhist truth.&quot;In this 
    case, the Sangha should follow in the spirit of the Buddha by overcoming 
    conventional constraints and letting Buddhist truth prevail.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Put in more concrete terms, the Sangha is 
    duty-bound to respect the Buddha&#39;s will and support bhikkhuni ordination, Dr 
    Suwanna said.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Phra Maha Jerm Suvaco, general director of 
    the Buddhist Research Institute of the Maha Chula Buddhist University, 
    insisted that further study into the feasibility of reviving the bhikkhuni 
    order in Thailand was needed.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;At this moment, both lay people and monks 
    are very much in the dark. There is no research-based information about the 
    validity of the lineage. I think we need a comprehensive study that will 
    answer all the questions from the public before we can say we agree or 
    disagree with the movement.&quot; However, Phra Maha Jerm noted that as far as he 
    knows, there is no initiative on behalf of Maha Chula Buddhist University or 
    any religious organisation to begin researching the matter.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although the monk endorses the revival of 
    the bhikkhuni in principle, he does not feel comfortable with the &quot;feminist&quot; 
    disposition he perceives from the movement&#39;s supporters.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;According to Buddhism, dhamma is to fulfil 
    your rightful duty. If you could do so, there is no need to demand your 
    rights because they will be yours naturally.&quot; Phra Maha Jerm, who is 
    considered progressive, cautioned that changes in gender equality in the 
    male-dominated society of Thailand always came slowly. &quot;It is no use for the 
    movement to jump ahead and demand that society recognise it. Besides, if the 
    bhikkhuni movement remains immersed in the rights-oriented western mind-set, 
    it will alienate monks, some of whom have already shown animosity and a 
    refusal to cooperate,&quot; Phra Maha Jerm said.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He added that a bhikkhuni order could be 
    developed only with support from the monks, as evident in the successful 
    case of Taiwan.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Prof Nithi Eawsiwong, a well-respected 
    historian, dismissed the monk&#39;s concern. &quot;This is not about rights. It is 
    about justice. Why, when a woman wants to be ordained, does it mean she is 
    demanding more rights, but when a man wants to be ordained, he is seen as 
    doing his duty? Besides, this logic does not work with Dr Chatsumarn. She 
    has fulfilled all her worldly duties. There is nothing left to be achieved. 
    It is time for her to fulfil her religious duty by pursuing a spiritual 
    path. Why can&#39;t she do that?&quot; Neither does Prof Nithi agree with the belief 
    that the future of the bhikkhuni rests with monks or the establishment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The Sangha&#39;s job is to find a solution to 
    the problem, not to point at an impasse. If the Sangha keeps refusing to 
    honour the aspiration of women and does not try to understand what is 
    happening and adjust themselves to changes in society, they will risk 
    becoming an obsolete and meaningless organisation. At present, millions of 
    people treat Phothirak [the founder of the strict Santi Asoke sect] as if he 
    was a monk, even though the Sangha proclaimed he was not. If I happen to 
    meet Dr Chatsumarn, I would pay respect to her the way I would do to a monk. 
    Can the Council arrest me for doing that?&quot; Prof Nithi warned that if the 
    Sangha continues to resist changes and to let its authority falter, the 
    future of the Sangha and Buddhism in Thailand would be up for grabs. &quot;The 
    public will not listen to the ruling organisation, neither will monks. It 
    will be the end of unity as monks or cult groups are free to operate and 
    satisfy public demand. Do you believe we will still have good monks if all 
    of them have direct access to a profitable market?&quot; All things considered, 
    Dr Tavivat believes Thai society has much to gain from a revival of the 
    bhikkhuni institution.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;First, it will prevent scandals between 
    monks and women, which lately have become increasingly prevalent. At 
    present, many women have become interested in studying dhamma. If they could 
    study dhamma with learned bhikkhunis, they wouldn&#39;t have to gather around 
    monks, thus avoiding a situation that is conducive to sexual abuse or 
    possible scandal. Structurally, the existence of a bhikkhuni order could 
    provide a new opportunity for poor rural girls who otherwise would end up in 
    sweat shops or brothels.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thanks to the male ordination tradition, 
    both as novices and monks, poor, rural boys have an opportunity to receive 
    education and training. Unfortunately, the same opportunity is denied to 
    poor, underprivileged girls. Without an alternative, many are pressured to 
    become labourers in factories or to enter the sex business.&quot; Dr Tavivat 
    admitted that a host of other factors besides poverty were involved when 
    poor rural girls were pulled into the flesh trade. Still, he said he was 
    confident that introduction of the bhikkhuni order here would be a positive 
    cultural factor that would help alleviate the problem.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While insisting that the bhikkhuni order is 
    an important institution that should be developed, Phra Mettanando from Wat 
    Raja-Orasaram pointed out that it is only one of the four Buddhist pillars, 
    which are the bhikkhu (monks), bhikkhuni (nuns), upasaka (laymen) and 
    upasika (laywomen), that are destined to sustain Buddhism into the future.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;To strengthen the religion, we need to 
    reform the order of monks and develop a community of engaged laymen and 
    laywomen. These people can help do the religious works that are not quite 
    appropriate for monks, such as canvassing. We might as well learn from other 
    religions. In Catholicism, for example, priests are allowed to lead a 
    contemplative life while brothers and sisters are engaged in social work, 
    serving God by serving other people.&quot; There is one part in the Tripitaka 
    that is worth noting. One monk asked the Buddha what would be the factors 
    that would erode Buddhism after he passed away? To this, the Buddha said: 
    &quot;It is when the bhikkhu, bhikkhuni, upasaka and upasika do not respect or 
    obey the Buddha, Dhamma or Dangha. When they ignore education and fail to 
    respect one another. All these are factors that will shorten the life of the 
    ultimate truth after I die.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A revival of the bhikkhuni order is a whole 
    new episode in the history of Thai Buddhism. As with any unprecedented 
    occurrence, scepticism and resistance are to be expected, Dr Nithi said: 
    &quot;But if we are to sustain Buddhism into the future, isn&#39;t the duty of 
    Buddhists to respect the Buddha and start educating ourselves about this new 
    phenomena?&quot;&nbsp; <B><A HREF="#top">[^]</A> </B></font></p>

    face="Times New Roman">ow that Sri Lanka has revived female ordination in 
    Theravada Buddhism, one would have thought that nuns in Thailand would jump 
    at the chance to become bhikkhunis. Wrong.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of the estimated 13,000 nuns here, only 
    Jamnian Rattaburi has decided to seek ordination, making her only the second 
    Thai woman to do so. The first was Buddhist scholar Chatsumarn Kabilsingh, 
    and it has brought her under fierce attack by conservative monks and 
    laypeople. Chatsumarn, now samaneri Dhammananda, will become a full 
    bhikkhuni after completing her two-year novicehood.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many Thai nuns have worked hard and 
    selflessly to improve the status of the nunhood. So why are they shutting 
    themselves off to the bhikkhuni opportunities now open to them? Imagine you 
    were in their shoes.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">You are committed religiously and want to 
    live a monastic life. But you must struggle on your own because the nunhood 
    is disdained as a refuge of the heart-broken or poor women with nowhere to 
    go. The law does not even recognise nuns as clerics.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Despite the social and monastic structures 
    that put women down, some monks have offered help. Although it is not much, 
    it can make a big difference in your pursuit of education, spiritual 
    practice and social work. Is it grateful to antagonise them in any way? Or 
    to place them in trouble with their superiors? Moreover, you are brought up 
    to see patriarchy as a part of life which is full of suffering anyway. But 
    you are doing your best within this system to improve your spirituality and 
    to help others. It&#39;s not perfect. But is it realistic to look for perfection 
    in an imperfect world? Meanwhile, the bhikkhuni path is strewn with many 
    obstacles.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The clergy is against female ordination. 
    Theoretically, female ordination in the Theravada tradition remains 
    debatable and the bhikkhuni revival in Sri Lanka is not without its critics. 
    And legally, the clergy&#39;s ban on bhikkhuni ordination is still in effect.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">You must also ask yourself who will support 
    you if you take the plunge. Society? What can you expect when mainstream 
    society still feels it inappropriate for women to dare to act as equal to 
    monks, which views women who want to become bhikkhuni as greedy for status.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The clergy? Forget it. Even Phra 
    Dhammapitaka, a scholar monk who has won wide respect from the 
    intelligentsia, cautions against bhikkhuni ordination, suggesting that 
    society help nuns improve their institution instead.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To survive as a bhikkhuni in such a hostile 
    environment needs not only courage and moral support. It needs a lot of 
    resources. The majority of nuns are from rural backgrounds and are 
    uneducated; they are not blessed with plentiful resources. For the handful 
    who are educated, who have left worldly matters behind, spiritual practice 
    is their top priority.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For nuns active in social work, it is 
    difficult to discard the little space they now have and the fruits of their 
    hard work when the there is little to offer but more sweat and tears along 
    the bhikkhuni path. Also, you must think of what will happen to those under 
    your care if an angry clergy boycotts your work.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Female ordination is possible in Sri Lanka 
    because the people already respect nuns as the equal of monks, said nun 
    Sansanee Sathirabutr. Senior monks are supportive. Nuns also receive 
    rigorous training for the bhikkhuni ordination. Such factors do not exist 
    here.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Seeing the world through the eyes of a nun 
    helps us realise the weight of oppression they shoulder. And their fears. If 
    we want nuns to take the path of equality, we have an equal responsibility 
    to help them through organised support. If not, we have only ourselves to 
    blame.&nbsp; <B><A HREF="#top">[^]</A> </B></font></p>

    face="Times New Roman">elp women get what they want-but keep the Buddha&#39;s 
    rules intact. That should be what the Thai Buddhist clergy should do 
    regarding female ordination, says monk scholar Phra Dhammapitaka (P.A. 
    Payutto).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;We should find a way to help women gain-but 
    not at the loss of the Vinaya,&quot; he says, referring to the Buddha&#39;s rules 
    governing monastic conduct.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The controversy over female ordination was 
    recently rekindled when Dr Chatsumarn Kabilsingh, a feminist and Buddhist 
    scholar, was ordained in Sri Lanka where the Bhikkhuni order in the 
    Theravada tradition has been revived.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dr Chatsumarn, now Dhammananda Samaneri, was 
    harshly attacked by senior monks who also dismissed the possibility of 
    female ordination within the Thai clergy.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Bhikkhuni must be ordained by both the 
    Bhikkhuni and Bhikkhu orders, says the Vinaya. Since Bhikkhuni in the 
    orthodox Theravada tradition was extinct, it is not possible to revive the 
    Bhikkhuni clergy.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dhammananda, meanwhile, argues that the 
    lineage was never extinct and the clergy must give women their rightful 
    place in Buddhism as allowed by the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">How does Phra Dhammapitaka, the authority in 
    Thai Theravada Buddhism, view all this?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The clash represents two extreme views, he 
    says, blaming both sides for stirring antagonistic feelings for each other.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The clergy cannot just turn a blind eye on 
    women&#39;s religious needs, he says. Meanwhile, Dhammananda&#39;s demand that the 
    Thai clergy accept the Bhikkhuni order in Sri Lanka as part of Thai Buddhism 
    is impossible.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;It&#39;s like you graduated from a different 
    university and then demand that you are approved by another establishment. 
    The clergy doesn&#39;t have any right to grant that kind of approval. Only the 
    right to recognise,&quot; he says.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Recognition leads to cooperation, he says. 
    Unfortunately, that does not happen either.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If the Bhikkhuni Sangha is not possible, the 
    clergy should set up another institution to support women who want to live 
    as ascetics. Or the clergy should improve the status of white-robed nuns and 
    support their education as well as social work, he says.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At present, nuns receive little support from 
    the clergy and society. They are not legally recognised as ascetics in 
    Thailand. Many who live in temples are often treated as temple hands.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The clergy&#39;s lack of interest in nuns&#39; 
    education is not unusual, he says. The elders are not interested in monks&#39; 
    education either.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The aim of Buddhism is to educate or train 
    people-men and women-so that they transcend suffering and consequently 
    devote themselves to society, he explains.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But the clergy is preoccupied with only 
    power and temple property, not monastic education, as evident in the newly 
    drafted Sangha Bill.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">An indifferent clergy has caused many 
    problems, not only about lack of support for women&#39;s religious lives. 
    &quot;That&#39;s why I am worried about Buddhism in Thailand,&quot; he says.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the Dhammananda controversy, he suggests 
    Dhammananda Samaneri accept the fact that she was ordained in the Sri 
    Lanka&#39;s new Theravada Bhikkhuni order. The order was revived by a group of 
    Sri Lankan monks with cooperation from Mahayana Bhikkhuni.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The new Bhikkhuni order insists that it is 
    legitimate for Mahayana Bhikkhuni to perform double ordination as required 
    by the Vinaya for their Theravada sisters because their lineage actually can 
    be traced back to Sri Lanka itself.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Historically, it was the Sri Lanka&#39;s 
    Theravada Bhikkhuni who started the female monk order in China which later 
    spread to Taiwan and other parts of the world. If that is the case, then 
    Dhammananda Samaneri should make this history of female ordination clear to 
    the public, Phra Dhammapitaka said.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Prejudice exists. But don&#39;t pay attention 
    to it. Pay heed to facts only.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He suggests Dhammananda be forthright about 
    the background of her ordination and her order so that people can decide 
    based on facts and information if they want to accept it or not. The clergy 
    and the rest of society should pay attention to the issue of female 
    ordination, he says, adding it is not right &quot;just to feign indifference and 
    turn a blind eye&quot;.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Phra Dhammapitaka, however, dismisses a 
    suggestion from Dhammananda that monks can ordain women when there are no 
    Bhikkhuni to perform double ordination.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the Buddha established a rule that a 
    Bhikkhuni must have double ordination from both the Bhikkhu and Bhikkhuni 
    clergy, it replaced the previous rule that allowed monks to ordain women, he 
    says.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nonetheless, the Thai clergy should look at 
    women&#39;s religious needs with compassion and should find ways within the 
    Vinaya framework to help women realise their spiritual potential, aiming for 
    the public good.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I feel sympathetic. But things must be done 
    step by step. If we have a bad start, we will end up with antagonism and 
    mere form, not the essence.&quot;&nbsp; <B><A HREF="#top">[^]</A> </B></font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Bangkok</em> -- Nine years have passed 
    since an American doctor of philosophy took the vows of a bhikkhuni. But a 
    recent stay in the Kingdom by this US ordained female monk has served to 
    highlight once again the male- dominated thinking that still prevails in 
    this country.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Her hair is shorn, her blue eyes crystal 
    clear and her smile friendly and wide. Yet the most striking thing about 
    her, at least to Thai eyes, is the yellow robe she wears. Even today, Thais 
    are unable to associate a monk&#39;s robes with a woman.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Greeting the Venerable Bhikkuni Dr Leaura 
    Naomi, aka Bhikkuni Lee, I cannot find the words of protocol to address a 
    female monk. But her friendliness makes me feel comfortable and so I 
    dispense with the protocol.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even though our meeting took place two 
    months ago, the day before she was due to was to leave Thailand after more 
    than a year here as a guest of the Association for the Promotion of the 
    Status of Women, her gentle presence and peaceful attitude remain with me 
    today.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">She begins the interview with a very simple 
    question, yet one that is difficult to answer : &quot;What makes you happy?&quot; asks 
    the 41-year-old Bhikkuni Lee.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To her, happiness is love, interpersonal 
    understanding and living harmoniously. Born in New York to a family with a 
    Christian background, Dr Lee was exposed to several different cultures and 
    religions from an early age.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;My cousins and relatives include Jews and 
    Buddhist Chinese. They consider love as a high priority, they have tolerance 
    and learn from each others,&quot; she says quietly. &quot;We all knew love before 
    religion.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Why and how did she become so deeply 
    involved in Buddhism?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Perhaps there is a good reason why we are 
    here. Since I was very young I have known that I would become a nun. I 
    didn&#39;t know when or where. I just felt it deep in my heart.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The first time I came into contact with the 
    Buddhist world was in New York. I was seven at the time. My family and I 
    went to Chinatown. As we walked in front of a gift shop, I remember being 
    mesmerised by a religious image in the window display. My family didn&#39;t even 
    realise they had left me behind,&quot; she recalls.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The elderly shopkeeper started talking to 
    me. I asked her about the image that was on display. And she told me that he 
    is the Lord Buddha and that he loves all children. I have never forgotten 
    this incident. The memory is embedded in my mind. It was like a natural seed 
    had been planted in my heart.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The young Leaura was also exposed to 
    different cultures during her school years.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;One day, while looking down from the fifth 
    floor of my university building, I saw a woman with a shaved head wearing a 
    grey robe. Her gait was so serene. I was so excited, I ran down the stairs 
    immediately, jumped on my bicycle, trying to catch her but the nun had gone 
    to the bus stop,&quot; she says with alacrity.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Her heart dropped when she saw the bus 
    coming. She had missed a chance to meet a Buddhist nun.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I didn&#39;t know if I would ever have a chance 
    to see one again. Then, one day I was sitting in the park watching the 
    sunset and meditating with some friends. I asked the others if they had ever 
    seen a Buddhist nun in the city. And that was how I was finally introduced 
    to the ChineseBuddhist nun I had seen walking through the university 
    grounds.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After this meeting, there was no turning 
    back for the young student. She became even more determined to pursue 
    Buddha&#39;s path.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dr Lee was ordained as a bhikkhuni nine 
    years ago at an international Buddhist centre in Colorado.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Asked what Buddhist sect she belongs to, she 
    replies: &quot;I don&#39;t see any separation between Hinnayan (or Theravada) and 
    Mahayana sects. The search for spiritual fulfilment is universal.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although the State of Colorado boasts 
    somewhere between three and six Buddhist nuns Bhikkuni Lee was the only one 
    in her adopted home town. Following the advice of the serene nun dressed in 
    grey, she began her search for Buddhist teachings in English in seven 
    countries, including Thailand, where she stayed for more than a year. Why 
    was Thailand so special?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I saw Khun Ya ( literally grandmother) in 
    an English-language TV documentary called The Best of Us, The programme 
    featured the seven most kind-hearted lay people in the world. One of them 
    was former US president Jimmy Carter. He was not ashamed to don jeans and 
    join his fellow men in doing menial work.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Khun Ya in the documentary was Mae Chee 
    Khunying Kanitha Wichienchareon.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Bhikkuni Lee was impressed by Khun Ya&#39;s 
    sacrifices for women and children in distress, as well as her lack of 
    attachment to her social position.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;She works from the heart. I felt there was 
    a very deep connection. It was like a spiritual awakening. There are 
    different levels of spiritual awakenings that come at different times in our 
    lives.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But the documentary was over before Bhikkuni 
    Lee managed to catch the full name of the Khun Ya she had so admired. She 
    intensified her search and, in the meantime, tried to learn as much as she 
    could about the Thai people.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">She wrote to the TV station but to no avail. 
    Then she made her way to a Thai temple where she began teaching English to 
    Thai monks.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Eventually one of the monks, who was aware 
    of her search for Khun Ya, found a magazine in the library and pointed to a 
    woman in one of the photos. &quot;Is that the woman you saw on TV?&quot;, he asked.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I said &#39;yes! That&#39;s her&#39;,&quot; she recalls with 
    a fond smile.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Not long after, Bhikkhuni Lee finally met 
    Mae Chee Kanitha and it is thanks to sponsorship of the Association for the 
    Promotion of the Status of Women, founded by the kindly Khun Ya, that she 
    was able to stay on in Thailand and become involved in the pilot project for 
    Southeast Asia&#39;s first College for Buddhist Nuns and Laywomen.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I trust intuition. The Buddhist teachings 
    and traditions speak to my heart more than any others. It&#39;s spiritual 
    intuition, not Western logic or rational thinking,&quot; says the Venerable Dr 
    Lee, who holds a doctorate degree in geographical peace studies. &quot;Sometimes 
    spiritual intuitions protect us from something or lead us to something.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">She says her primary concerns are women and 
    children, in particular the HIV/Aids-afflicted in Thailand and, since 
    joining the Association early last year, has worked both in Bangkok and 
    upcountry and spoken at several conferences and seminars.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Most recently she inspired a Thai nun to 
    fulfill her dreams by being ordained as a bhikkhuni in Sri Lanka.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Seven years ago this island country saw a 
    revival of theBhikkhuni issue, the subject of controversy for four decades. 
    There are now more than 200 Bhikkhunis in Sri Lanka.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As a Bhikkhuni, Dr Lee&#39;s daily activities 
    are similar to those of a monk.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;It is a beautiful and intimate experience,&quot; 
    she says of the offerings of alms every morning, &quot;I have life because of 
    their love for me. If I don&#39;t have the food, I don&#39;t have life. Their loving 
    kindness goes into my soul and into my bones. It&#39;s because of their kindness 
    that I am alive. And that&#39;s about life. It doesn&#39;t matter what skin colour 
    you have, the language you speak or the country to which you belong. It&#39;s 
    the nature of human beings. It&#39;s a blessing to live life and feel that 
    everyday.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">She is particularly pleased to have become 
    so much part of the local community. &quot;When someone died in the family, or 
    when they had conflicts in the community, they talked to me. When their 
    child was sitting a major exam at school, or their daughters were studying 
    very hard, they let me know.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Most people were delighted to see her, a 
    female monk in a yellow robe. &quot;Women are the backbone of Buddhism in 
    Thailand. The majority of alm-givers in Thailand are women,&quot; observes 
    Venerable Lee. &quot;But the sight of a female monk has made some people 
    furious.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Her yellow robe made her feel a little 
    secure while in the Kingdom. One afternoon, while she was having lunch, she 
    was picked up by the police and taken to the station. &quot;On no grounds,&quot; she 
    says softly.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As no female is regarded by the Thai Sangha 
    as a monk, the police could obviously not charge her for violating the 
    vinaya (the discipline that demands that monks must not eat meals after 
    midday).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We are eating as she recounts the story and 
    instinctively I glance at my watch. My gesture does not go unnoticed. &quot;I 
    don&#39;t think the Lord Buddha had a watch,&quot; she says, adding that she sees the 
    interpretation of vinaya as a convenient arrangement to fit in with the 
    routine of lay people.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The vinaya of the Theravada school that 
    dominates Buddhism in Thailand states that a woman who wishes to become a 
    monk must be ordained by both the bhikkhu (male monk) Sangha and the 
    bhikkhuni Sangha . Since the latter body has never existed in Thailand, it 
    is not possible for women to be ordained as monks.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I am not fighting. I place emphasis on the 
    positive. Just do what you believe is true,&quot; she says with a gentle smile.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since our conversation, the female monk has 
    moved to Sri Lanka, where she hopes she can contribute something to society. 
    &quot;I want to plant seeds of the positive kind and let them grow naturally.&quot;&nbsp;

    provide instruction to this polyglot assembly, the text of the Vinaya 
    (Buddhist monastic precepts) was provided in five languages: Chinese, 
    English, French, Nepalese, and Sinalese. The renunciation ceremony, 
    organized by Venerable Master Hsing Yun and Fo Guang Shan Buddhist Order, 
    marshaled the cooperative efforts and support of Buddhist leaders, including 
    the His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Maha Ghosananda Maha Thero (Sangha Raja of 
    Cambodia), Thich Nhat Hanh (Abbot of Plum Village, France), Venerable Dr. M. 
    Wipulasara Maha Thero (President of the Maha Bodhi Society), and Venerable 
    P. Somalankara Nayake Thero (Chief Secretary of Sarvodaya Bhikkhu Congress, 
    Sri Lanka). (See list of patrons and organizers at the end of this article)</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The legitimacy of ordaining 
    women as bhikkhuni (nuns) has become a major topic of debate within the 
    Buddhist community. All Buddhists agree that the Buddha created an order of 
    bhikkhuni after his foster mother, Mahaprajnapati, and 500 other women 
    displayed a deep commitment to becoming his disciples. Buddhists disagree, 
    however, about whether or not there should be, or even can be, such an order 
    today. Sila, the laws of Buddhist discipline, stipulate that the ordination 
    of women to become bhikkhuni requires the presence of both ordained monks 
    (bhikkhu) and nuns. Since the 11<sup>th</sup> century, however, when the 
    bhikkhuni order died out in India and Sri Lanka, conservatives have stymied 
    any attempts to revive it in those countries by citing the lack of qualified 
    nuns to legitimize the proceedings. Similarly, in Thailand and Tibet, where 
    there has never been an order of nuns, efforts to institute such an order 
    have faced difficulty for the same reason. Fortunately, in such places as 
    mainland China, Taiwan, Japan, and Korea, bhikkhuni orders have continued 
    down to today.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">To overcome this obstacle, the 
    ordination ceremony in Bodhgaya was officiated by both Buddhist monks from 
    around the world and by 15 Buddhist nuns who received their ordination in 
    Taiwan. The idea of bringing together bhikkhu and bhikkhuni from a diverse 
    range of Buddhist traditions and schools to solve the ordination problem 
    gradually took shape during a series of annual international monastic 
    seminars. At the conclusion of the fourth such conference, held in May of 
    1997, the participants requested Venerable Master Hsing Yun, the founder of 
    Fo Guang Shan Buddhist Order, to organize a renunciation ceremony to 
    reintroduce a bhikkhuni lineage in those countries currently lacking one. Fo 
    Guang Shan was asked to spearhead this effort because it has branch temples 
    worldwide, a large contingent of nuns, and extensive experience teaching 
    Buddhist women from South and Southeast Asia. Subsequently, during the Dalai 
    Lamaâ€™s visit to Taiwan in the Spring of 1997, which he undertook primarily 
    to learn more about the islandâ€™s thriving bhikkhuni order, he too endorsed 
    the plan, a support he has reaffirmed several times hence. Unfortunately, 
    His Holiness was unable to personally attend the Bodhgaya ceremony.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The women from India, Sri 
    Lanka, and Thailand who received ordination in February did not expect a 
    warm welcome from all of their Buddhist brethren when they returned to their 
    respective countries. More conservative members of the Southeast Asian 
    monastic communities were not expected to even recognize the authenticity of 
    their ordination. This was expected as a result of the historical treatment 
    given to Buddhist nuns from East Asian countries who go to Thailand to 
    conduct religious work. Unlike Buddhist monks, who can receive work visas 
    from the Thai government to carry out their special tasks, Buddhist nuns can 
    only enter the country as tourists, having no status as religious 
    professionals.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The sponsoring organizations 
    continue to do all that they can to aid the nuns in overcoming obstacles 
    that they might encounter after ordination. Fo Guang Shan, for instance, 
    fully paid the expenses for their transportation, room and board for the 
    ordination ceremony, and also offered free education in any of its 16 
    monastic colleges worldwide to any of the nuns who would wish to strengthen 
    their knowledge of Buddhist practice. Efforts were also made to provide 
    long-term housing for those who might have required it. The Ladakh, India 
    chapter of Buddhaâ€™s Light International Association (BLIA) has already built 
    a nunnery and the Ananda Buddha Vihara Trust of Andra Pradesh, India is 
    currently constructing a temple which will include a dormitory for nuns.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The American Buddhist scholar 
    Rita Gross has recently published a book entitled <i>Buddhism After 
    Patriarchy,</i> in which she examines how best to reshape the Buddhist 
    tradition so that it provides equal opportunity and dignity to women and men 
    of all races. What Gross has done in theory, those gathering in Bodhgaya in 
    February intended to realize in practice. The nuns of Taiwan, who played a 
    role in organizing the Bodhgaya event, regard renunciation as a potent means 
    for women to express their capabilities and leadership qualities, allowing 
    them to make great contributions in social, philanthropic, cultural, and 
    educational pursuits. They therefore see the re-establishment of the 
    bhikkhuni order in Southeast Asia as a significant advancement for womenâ€™s 
    rights in that region. Their hope is that the ordination will serve as a 
    catalyst to spur not only all Buddhists, but all people, to awaken to the 
    truth that the Buddha himself realized under the Bodhi Tree so long ago: 
    that all beings are inherently equal and inter-dependent, and may attain 
    enlightenment through cultivating a mind of kindness, compassion, 
    equanimity, gratitude and wisdom.</font></p>

    the Bhikkhuni Order in Sri Lanka</font></h3>
    <p align="center"><font color="#800000" face="Times New Roman"><em><b>D. 
    Amarasiri Weeraratne</b></em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">I</font>t is well known that 
    the Bhikkhuni (nuns) order was introduced to Sri Lanka during the reign of 
    King Devanampiyatissa. (BC 250 - 210) Since then this order flourished at 
    Anuradhapura for about 1200 years. With the fall of Anuradhapura to the 
    Cholian invaders in AD 1017 and the annexation of the Aunradhapura Kingdom 
    to the Cholian empire the Bhikkhuni order disappeared and became defunct. 
    The Order of Monks (Bhikkhus) also met the same fate. But was later revived 
    after King Vijayabahu drove away the Cholian invaders. For this revival the 
    King had to get down monks from Burma. But there were no nuns in Burma, 
    Siam, Cambodia or Laos the other four Theravada countries. Hence the monks 
    maintained that the Bhikkhuni order should be considered defunct and not 
    restorable. During the time the Bhikkhuni order existed in Sri Lanka it 
    proved to be an asset to the religion and rendered yeoman service to the 
    Sasana. Details can be found in the Dipawansa on which was modelled the 
    Mahavamsa - the great chronicle in Sinhala history. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After 50 years of Cholian rule, King 
    Vijayabahu coming up from Ruhuna expelled the invaders and assumed rulership 
    over the whole island. He shifted his capital to Polonnaruwa. During the 
    Polonnaruwa period which followed Sinhalese Buddhism came more and more 
    under Tamil, Hindu influence. The Tamil caste system of South India was 
    adopted and the monks took the names of their villages as a prefix to their 
    Pali names given at ordination. The Sangha became the preserve of one caste 
    monopolising the temporalities in imitation of Hindu priesthood. The study 
    of Sanskrit and secular sciences associated with it came into vogue. Anti 
    feminism and casteism were features entrenched in the Manu laws of Hinduism.</font></p>
    <b><font><p></font><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Anathema</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These features found their way to Sinhalese 
    society and its religion. Therefore, in this milieu the revival of the 
    defunct Bhikkhuni order became anathema to Sinhalese Buddhism. There is 
    permission in the Vinaya Chullavagga for monks to ordain nuns. This 
    permission could easily have been made use of if the monks were willing to 
    restore the Bhikkhuni order. But since their wishes were otherwise and they 
    were more interested in maintaining their monopolies, it suited the to take 
    the casteist and anti feminist line. They enabled them to avert rivalry from 
    low caste men in the Sangha and women in to Bhikkhuni order.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore, from the Polonnaruwa period right 
    up to the British conquest of the island in 1815 no one took up the issue of 
    admitting â€˜low casteâ€™ men to the Sangha and women to the Bhikkhuni order. 
    Priestcraft saw to it that the Buddhist Sangha was the preserve of the 
    high-caste and that women were debarred from leading the holy life of a 
    Bhikkhuni as advocated by the Buddha. The majority of people were ignorant 
    and illiterate. They took their Buddhism from the priestcraft of the Sangha 
    and the Kings who took their advise in matters of religion from the Sangha 
    hierarchy.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, a tradition to the effect that the 
    Bhikkhuni order is defunct and cannot be restored until the appearance of 
    Martie Buddha in a future aeon became accepted. Thereby the teachings of the 
    Buddha on appamada (diligence), samanatmata (egalitarianism), Karuna, Metta, 
    Artachariya etc were lost sight of. An anti-feminist dogma prevented women 
    from taking to holy orders in Buddhism. This was the situation from the 
    Polonnaruwa period right up to the time the Sangha - King combine lost their 
    control of the nation in 1815 with the betrayal of the last King to the 
    British.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">During the colonial period, under British 
    rule, it was Anagarika Dharmapala who was the pioneer of the Buddhist 
    revival. He opened the first nunnery in modern Ceylon at Darley Lane, 
    Colombo. It was not a success. He was followed by Miss Catherine de Alwis 
    who went to Burma and got ordained there as a Junior Nun without Higher 
    Ordination. She came back to Sri Lanka in 1903 and founded the Dasa Sil Mata 
    order of Buddhist nuns. Thus from 1903 onwards these D.S.M nuns were the 
    vestige and the representatives of the Bhikkhuni Sangha of old. They seemed 
    to believe in the theory that half a loaf is better than no bread. Therefore 
    they had to be satisfied with observing the ten precepts of Junior Nuns or 
    Samaneris.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many Buddhist leaders among the clergy and 
    the laity realised that the DSM status for nuns was really incongruous and 
    incompatible with the Buddhaâ€™s concept of a four-fold division among his 
    disciples and devotees.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He recognised only Bhikkhus, Bhikkhunis, 
    male lay devotees and female lay devotees. There is no room for a half way 
    house between lay women devotee and Bhikkhunis such as a Dasa Sil Matas. The 
    later term is an invention by apostates in the Sasana who wish to keep down 
    women renunciates from their proper place as Bhikkhunis.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Among the advocates for the revival of the 
    Bhikkhuni order was Ven. Pandit Narawala Dhammaratana Thero. He had led a 
    delegation to a peace conference in Peking, China. He studied the Bhikkhuni 
    order in China and found that it had been established on a firm Vinaya 
    footing by Sinhalese nuns from Anuradhapura in AD 429.</font></p>
    <b><font><p></font><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Chinese nuns</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore, in his writings and teachings he 
    advocated the revival of the Bhikkhuni Order with assistance from Chinese 
    Nuns. Other advocates of the revival among our Maha Theras were Ven. Pandit 
    Hedipannala Pannaloka of the Vijalankara Pirivena, Ven. Pandit Henpitagedera 
    Gnanaseeha, Ven. Banbarende Seevali and several other progressives. Among 
    lay Buddhist leaders, Anagarika Dharmapala, Sir D.B. Jayatillaka, H. Sri 
    Nissanka, Dr. G.P. Malalasekera, J.R. Jayewardene and many others encouraged 
    the movement and spoke for it. Among the living sympathizers and advocates 
    were Ven. Mapalagama Vipulasara. Principal, Paramadhamma Chetiya Pirivena, 
    Ven. Pandit Inamaluwe Sumangala of the Dambulla Raja Maha Viharaya, Ven. 
    Talalle Dhammaloka, Anunayaka Thero of the Amarapura Sect, Ven Dr. Kirinde 
    Dhammananda, Ven. Pandit Pathegama Gnanarama retired Principal Sudharmakara 
    Pirivena, Panadura, Ven. Porawagama Soma, Ven. Deegala Mahinda, Tembiliyane 
    Ariyadhamma etc.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While the progressive monks called for and 
    advocated the revival there were reactionaries, conservatives and 
    obscurantists who took the traditional stand in Sinhalese Buddhism as a 
    dogma, equating it with â€˜pure Theravada Buddhismâ€™. Thus there was division 
    of opinion in the two camps, the conservatives sticking to traditional 
    anti-feminism and the progressives calling for a revision of the traditional 
    stand and a restoration of the Bhikkhuni Order.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As a sequel to the public interest created 
    on this question Ven. M. Vipulasara, Principal, Parama Dhamma Chetiya 
    Pirivena and President Mahabodhi Society came forward with the assistance of 
    the World Sangha Council and Sakyadhita International Organisation of 
    Buddhist Women and held an ordination ceremony on 8.12.96 at Saranath 
    Temple, India. This was a grand and historic ceremony - a red letter day in 
    the annals of Theravada Buddhism. At this ceremony 11 selected Sinhalese DSM 
    nuns were ordained fully as Bhikkhunis by a team of Theravada monks in 
    concert with a quorum of Korean Nuns. Thus for the first time after 980 odd 
    years the Theravada Bhikkhuni Order was revived in India.</font></p>
    <b><font><p></font><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Sasanodaya 
    Society</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For the first time since the disappearance, 
    the Bhikkhuni Order was restored at Saranath India on 8.12.96. The Sinhalese 
    Nuns who received their Bhikkhuni Ordination there came back to Sri Lanka 
    after one year and two months at the invitation of the Bhikkhuni Sasanodaya 
    Society, Dambulla. On Medin Poya Day (12/3/98) they ordained 23 selected 
    Sinhalese DSM Nuns into the Bhikkhuni Sangha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This ordination was confirmed and ratified 
    by a quorum of the Theravada Sangha as required in the Vinaya. Ven. 
    Inamaluwe was the director of the function and the master of ceremonies. He 
    was assisted by Ven. Mapalagama Vipulasara, Galkadawela Punnasara, Pandit 
    Tallalle Dhammananda Anu Nayakam, Ven. Prof. K. Vajira and Porwagama Soma 
    and a few others.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus for the first time since the 
    Anuradhapura days the Bhikkhuni Sasana has been revived in Sri Lanka 
    According to full Theravada ceremonial. Sinhalese DSM nuns, Buddhist women 
    feminists and other advocates of the restoration of the Bhikkhuni Sasana 
    will have the satisfaction that one of their cherished dreams for the Buddha 
    Sasana has been realised.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sri Lanka became the caretaker and 
    headquarters of Theravada Buddhism since it was expelled from India. Other 
    Theravada countries such as Siam, Burma, Laos, and Cambodia has never had a 
    Bhikkhuni Order. There are movements in these countries for the admission of 
    women to the Bhikkhuni Sangha in the Theravada tradition to which they 
    belong. These countries border China and they see that in China Bhikkhunis 
    have been existing from the earliest days of the introduction of Buddhism to 
    that land.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hence, their aspiration for entry to the 
    Bhikkhuni Sangha will receive a fillip on hearing and seeing that the 
    Theravada Bhikkhuni Order has been established in Sri Lanka. Though the 
    Bhikkhuni Order had never been introduced to any country except Sri Lanka, 
    Burma is an unusual exception. It had originally been a Mahayana country. 
    Therefore during the Mahayana days there were Bhikkhunis in Burma. But once 
    it was converted to Theravada Buddhism the Bhikkhuni Order there became 
    unrecognised. Hence there continued to be the nuns with only Samaneri 
    Ordination under the Ten Precepts. Even today the position is the same. It 
    is from these Samaneri nuns (called Ma-Theelas) that Sri Lanka received its 
    DSM order of nuns.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now that the Theravada Bhikkhuni Order has 
    been established in Sri Lanka it should be a matter of time for women 
    renunciates in these countries to come to Sri Lanka, or get down Sri Lankan 
    nuns to their countries and establish the Bhikkhuni Order in their lands. 
    Admittance to the Bhikkhuni Order to women was granted by the Buddha 
    himself. Womens&#39; rights are a part of human rights in the modern world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore, the Bhikkhuni Order in Sri Lanka 
    should be the spearhead for the movement to establish the Theravada 
    Bhikkhuni Order in these lands. The Bhikkhuni Order cannot function properly 
    in poor and backward cultures which do not recognise womenâ€™s rights. That is 
    why even in some backward Mahayana countries such as Mongolia, Kirghizia and 
    Tibet there never has been a Bhikkhuni Order. Now that Sri Lanka is emerging 
    from a backward Third World country with a poor record of human rights to a 
    modern democracy which recognises womenâ€™s rights the prospects of the 
    Bhikkhuni Order gaining its rightful place as in the Anuradhapura period are 
    bright and full of promise.&nbsp; <B><A HREF="#top">[^]</A> </B></font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">O</font>ne of 
    the most critical challenges facing all religious traditions in the new 
    century will be the issue of gender equality. This is certainly true of 
    Buddhism. At the outset of any discussion about womenÂ¹s rights in Buddhism 
    the point needs to be made that gender is not an enlightenment factor, women 
    and men have an equal capacity for spiritual liberation. The Pali scriptures 
    mention by name many highly attained women, and there is one entire book of 
    verses by fully enlightened nuns.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">It is to be admitted, however, 
    that this doctrinal equality may be seen as cold comfort in light of the 
    practical reality of female inequality in most Buddhist countries and 
    institutions. In all Theravada (Southern School) Buddhist countries the 
    status of the nuns is very much lower than that of the monks. There are a 
    few exceptionally good places for women to practice, but in most situations 
    the nuns have a difficult time finding support, and all too often are 
    relegated to the role of kitchen help. The situation in the Tibetan 
    tradition is not much better.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">One of the critical factors in 
    maintaining this inequality is the lack of a bhikkhuni, or full ordination 
    nuns&#39; order in both Theravada and Tibetan Buddhism. Around the year 1000 AD 
    Theravada Buddhism was nearly destroyed when the Cholian Empire invaded Sri 
    Lanka. The monkÂ¹s order barely survived, the nuns were less fortunate. When 
    the Theravada form of Buddhism spread to South-East Asia, it already lacked 
    a bhikkhuni order and so Thailand and Burma have never known fully ordained 
    nuns. Likewise, the bhikkhuni order never made the demanding passage across 
    the Himalayas into Tibet. Instead, all these Buddhist countries have women 
    living as nuns without full ordination, in one or another semi-formal 
    arrangement.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Restoring the legitimate nuns&#39; 
    order is more than just a question of good-will. In Buddhism a large part of 
    the value of ordination rests in the continuity of a lineage going back to 
    the Buddha. If the transmission of ordination is broken, it cannot be 
    restored. Further, according to the Vinaya, or rules for monastics, a quorum 
    of at least five bhikkhunis are required to ordain a new one.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Nevertheless, the situation for 
    a restored bhikkhuni order is far from hopeless. In fact, the last few years 
    have seen a renewal of effort in this direction in several quarters. The 
    Bhikkhuni Sasanodaya Society has been established to re-institute the nuns 
    order in the Theravada school by cooperation with nuns of the Chinese 
    Mahayana tradition who still have an unbroken line of ordination. In 1996 an 
    historic turning point occurred when eleven women were ordained in a 
    ceremony in Saranath India. In the intervening years, several further 
    ordinations have followed, mostly in Sri Lanka and these have been given 
    credibility by the participation of many well known senior monks.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">There are still many problems 
    outstanding. The validity of the revived bhikkhuni order is not universally 
    accepted. Even among those who welcome the restoration of the female order, 
    there is some controversy around the rules which the new nuns should follow. 
    We should be cautious about being too impatient; the monastic order is a 
    body that has survived for two and a half millennia and operates on a long 
    time scale. This makes for inherent caution and conservatism.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Most importantly, the position 
    of women within Buddhism will not be immediately transformed by the 
    restoration of the bhikkhuni order, although this will certainly help 
    matters. More importantly, attitudes need to be changed, and not just the 
    attitudes of men. It may be that as Buddhism spreads into the west, this 
    will be the one big contribution of western civilization to the universal 
    body of the Buddhist tradition. <B><A HREF="#top">[^]</A> </B></font></p>
