        <P>Introduction by Bhikkhu Bodhi</P>
        </B>
        <P>In America, Theravada Buddhist meditation is often flatly identified 
        with the practice of vipassana, even to the extent that those who 
        practice within this tradition speak of themselves as vipassana 
        meditators. However, the Pali suttas, the ancient records of the 
        Buddha&#39;s discourses, do not treat vipassana as an autonomous system of 
        meditation but as a member of two paired meditative skills called 
        samatha and vipassana, tranquility and insight. Far from being opposed, 
        in the suttas tranquility and insight are held to be complementary 
        aspects of mental cultivation which, to yield the proper fruits of the 
        Buddhist path, must eventually be yoked and harmonized.</P>
        <P>According to their aptitude and disposition, meditators will develop 
        these two qualities in different temporal sequences. One important 
        source (Anguttara Nikaya, The Fours, Sutta 170) states that some develop 
        tranquility first and insight afterwards; others develop insight first 
        and tranquility afterwards; and still others develop tranquility and 
        insight in close conjunction. While most teachers of Theravada 
        meditation in the West have leaned towards the second of these models, 
        in the Buddha&#39;s own discourses it is the first that predominates, and 
        this model also forms the scaffolding for the classical Pali meditation 
        manuals such as the Visuddhimagga (&quot;The Path of Purification&quot;).</P>
        <P>Ajahn Brahmavamso, abbot of Bodhinyana Monastery in Western 
        Australia, teaches meditation in accordance with this ancient paradigm. 
        Like many other meditation teachers, he takes mindfulness of breathing 
        as his primary subject of meditation, but he emphasizes the development 
        of breath meditation in a particular way designed to induce states of 
        deep concentration culminating in the jhanas, the exalted stages of 
        mental unification. In this model, the meditator first pursues the 
        development of a powerful, peaceful, focused mind by means of 
        tranquility meditation. Once this is achieved, one then applies this 
        mind to investigate the true characteristics of phenomena. This is the 
        cultivation of vipassana, also called the higher wisdom of insight into 
        phenomena, which brings direct personal insight into the impermanence, 
        unsatisfactoriness, and selfless nature of all conditioned things. --

      <HR></I><FONT SIZE="6">
      <P>I</FONT>t is a law of nature that without effort one does not make 
      progress. Whether one is a layperson or a monk, without effort one gets 
      nowhere, in meditation or anything else.</P>
      <P>Effort alone, though, is not sufficient. The effort needs to be 
      skillful. This means directing your energy just at the right places and 
      sustaining it there until its task is completed. Skillful effort neither 
      hinders nor disturbs you; instead it produces the peace of deep 
      meditation.</P>
      <P>In order to know where your effort should be directed, you must have a 
      clear understanding of the goal of meditation. The goal is the silence, 
      stillness and clarity of mind. If you can understand that goal, then the 
      place to apply your effort and the means to achieve the goal become very 
      clear.</P>
      <P>Skillful effort is directed at letting go, at developing a mind that 
      inclines to abandoning. One of the many simple but profound statements of 
      the Lord Buddha is that &quot;a meditator whose mind inclines to abandoning 
      easily achieves samadhi.&quot; Such a meditator gains these states of inner 
      bliss almost automatically. What the Lord Buddha was saying was that the 
      major cause for attaining deep meditation, for reaching these powerful 
      states, is the willingness to abandon, to let go, and to renounce.</P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#800000">1. Abiding in the Present Moment</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P>In the way that I teach meditation, I like to begin with the very 
      simple stage of giving up the baggage of past and future and abiding in 
      the present moment. You may think that this is too basic, that it is an 
      easy thing to do. However, if you give it your full effort, not going 
      ahead until you have properly reached the first goal of sustained 
      attention on the present moment, then you will find later on that you have 
      established a very strong foundation on which to build the higher stages 
      of meditation.</P>
      <P>Abandoning the past means not thinking about your work, your family, 
      your commitments, your responsibilities,<I> </I>your history, the good or 
      bad times you had as a child and so on. You abandon all past experiences 
      by showing no interest in them at all. You let go of every part of your 
      history, even the memory of what happened to you just a moment ago!</P>
      <P>In this way, you carry no burden from the past into the present. You do 
      not allow the past to reverberate in your mind. During the time that you 
      meditate you become someone who has no history. In this way, everyone 
      becomes equal, just a meditator. It becomes unimportant how many years you 
      have been meditating, whether you are an old hand or a beginner. You free 
      yourself of these concerns, perceptions and thoughts that limit you and 
      that stop you from developing the peace born of letting go. </P>
      <P>As for the future -- anticipations, fears, plans and expectations -- 
      let all of that go too. The Lord Buddha once said about the future, 
      &quot;Whatever you think it will be, it will always be something different!&quot; 
      The future is known to the wise as uncertain, unknown and unpredictable. 
      It is often complete stupidity to anticipate the future, and always a 
      great waste of your time to think of the future in meditation.</P>
      <P>So in this stage of meditation keep your attention right in the present 
      moment, to the point where you don&#39;t even know what day it is or what time 
      it is: Morning? Afternoon? Don&#39;t know! All you know is what moment it is 
      -- right now! In this way you arrive at this beautiful monastic timescale 
      where you are just meditating in the moment, not aware of how many minutes 
      have gone by or how many remain, not even remembering what day it is.</P>
      <P>The reality of now is magnificent and awesome. When you have abandoned 
      all past and all future, it is as if you have come alive. You are here; 
      you are mindful. This is the first stage of the meditation, this 
      mindfulness sustained only in the present. Reaching here, you have done a 
      great deal. You have let go of the first burden that stops deep 
      meditation. So put forth a lot of effort to reach this first stage until 
      it is strong, firm and well-established. </P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#800000">2. Silent Awareness of the Present 
      Moment</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P>The first stage is attained when the meditator abides comfortably in 
      the present moment for long, unbroken periods of time. But having achieved 
      so much, one should go further, into the even more beautiful and truthful 
      silence of the mind.</P>
      <P>It is helpful here to clarify the difference between silent awareness 
      of the present moment and thinking about it. It is through our inner 
      commentary that we sometimes think we know the world. Actually, that inner 
      speech does not know the world at all! It is inner speech that weaves the 
      delusions that cause suffering. It is inner speech that causes us to be 
      angry at those we make our enemies, and to have dangerous attachments to 
      those we make our loved ones. Inner speech causes all of life&#39;s problems. 
      It constructs fear and guilt. It creates anxiety and depression. It builds 
      these illusions as surely as the skillful commentator on TV manipulates an 
      audience to create anger or tears. So if you seek for truth, you should 
      value silent awareness, considering it more important, when meditating, 
      than any thought whatsoever.</P>
      <P>The high value that one gives to one&#39;s thoughts is the major obstacle 
      to silent awareness. Carefully removing the importance one gives to one&#39;s 
      thinking and thus realizing the value and truthfulness of silent awareness 
      is the insight that makes the second stage -- silent awareness of the 
      present moment -- possible.</P>
      <P>One of the ways of overcoming inner commentary is to develop such 
      refined present-moment awareness, watching every moment so closely, that 
      you simply do not have the time to comment about what just happened. A 
      thought is often an opinion on what has just happened. For example, &quot;That
      <I>was</I> good&quot;, &quot;That <I>was</I> gross&quot;, &quot;What <I>was</I> that?&quot; All of 
      these comments are on experiences that have just passed by. When you are 
      noting, making a comment about an experience that has just passed, then 
      you are not paying attention to the experience that has just arrived. You 
      are dealing with old visitors and neglecting the new visitors coming now!</P>
      <P>Another useful method of developing silent awareness is to recognize 
      the space between thoughts, between periods of inner chatter. If you 
      closely attend with sharp mindfulness, when one thought ends and before 
      another thought begins -- THERE! That is silent awareness! It may be only 
      momentary at first, but as you recognize that fleeting silence you become 
      accustomed to it, and as you become accustomed to it, the silence lasts 
      longer. Once you have found it at last, you begin to enjoy the silence, 
      and that is why it grows. But remember, silence is shy. If silence hears 
      you talking about her, she vanishes immediately!</P>
      <P>It would be marvelous if each one of us could abandon inner speech and 
      abide in silent awareness of the present moment long enough to realize how 
      delightful it is. Silence is so much more productive of wisdom and clarity 
      than thinking. When you realize how much more enjoyable and valuable it is 
      to be silent within, then silence becomes more attractive and important to 
      you. Inner silence becomes what the mind inclines towards. The mind seeks 
      out silence constantly, to the point where it only thinks if it really has 
      to, only if there is some point to it. Since at this stage you have 
      realized that most of your thinking is really pointless anyway, that it 
      gets you nowhere, only giving you many headaches, you gladly and easily 
      spend much time in inner quiet.</P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#800000">3. Sustained Attention on the Breath</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P>If you want to go further, then instead of being silently aware of 
      whatever comes into the mind, you choose silent present-moment awareness 
      of just <I>one thing</I>. That one thing can be the experience of 
      breathing, the idea of loving-kindness (<I>metta</I>), a colored circle 
      visualized in the mind (<I>kasina</I>) or several other, less-common focal 
      points for awareness. Here I will describe silent present-moment awareness 
      of the breath.</P>
      <P>Choosing to fix one&#39;s attention on one thing is letting go of diversity 
      and moving to its opposite, unity. As the mind begins to unify, sustaining 
      attention on just one thing, the experience of peace, bliss and power 
      increases significantly. Here you discover that the diversity of 
      consciousness -- like having six telephones on your desk ringing at the 
      same time -- is such a burden. Letting go of this diversity -- only 
      permitting one telephone, a private line at that, on your desk -- is such 
      a relief that it generates bliss. Understanding that diversity is a burden 
      is crucial to being able to settle on the breath.</P>
      <P>If you have developed silent awareness of the present moment carefully 
      for long periods of time, you will find it quite easy to turn that 
      awareness onto the breath and follow that breath from moment to moment 
      without interruption. This is because the two major obstacles have already 
      been subdued -- the mind&#39;s tendency to go off into the past and future, 
      and inner speech. This is why I teach the two preliminary stages of 
      present-moment awareness and silent awareness of the present moment as a 
      solid preparation for deeper meditation on the breath.</P>
      <P>When you know the breath is going in, or the breath is going out, for, 
      say, one hundred breaths in a row, not missing one, then you have achieved 
      what I call the third stage of this meditation, sustained attention on the 
      breath. This again is more peaceful and joyful than the previous stage.
      </P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#800000">4. Full Sustained Attention on the 
      Breath</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P>The fourth stage occurs when one&#39;s attention expands to take in every 
      single moment of the breath. You know the in-breath at the very first 
      moment, when the first sensation of in-breathing arises. Then you observe 
      those sensations gradually developing through the whole course of one 
      in-breath, not missing even a moment of the in-breath. When that in-breath 
      finishes, you know that moment, you see in your mind that last movement of 
      the in-breath. You then see the next moment as a pause between breaths, 
      and then many more pauses until the out-breath begins. You see the first 
      moment of the out-breath and each subsequent sensation as the out-breath 
      evolves, until the out-breath disappears when its function is complete. 
      All this is done in silence and just in the present moment.</P>
      <P>You experience every part of each in-breath and out-breath, 
      continuously, for many hundred breaths in a row. This is why this stage is 
      called <I>full</I> sustained attention on the breath. You cannot reach 
      this stage through force, through holding or gripping. You can only attain 
      this degree of stillness by letting go of everything in the entire 
      universe, except for this momentary experience of breath happening 
      silently now.</P>
      <P>&quot;You&quot; don&#39;t reach this stage; the mind reaches this stage. The mind 
      does the work itself. The mind recognizes this stage to be a very peaceful 
      and pleasant abiding, just being alone with the breath. This is where the 
      &quot;doer,&quot; the major part of one&#39;s ego, starts to disappear.</P>
      <P>You will find that progress happens effortlessly at this stage of the 
      meditation. You just have to get out of the way, let go and watch it all 
      happen. The mind will automatically incline, if only you let it, towards 
      this very simple, peaceful and delicious unity of being alone with one 
      thing, just being with the breath in each and every moment. This is the 
      unity of mind, the unity in the moment, the unity in stillness.</P>
      <P>This fourth stage is what I call the &quot;springboard&quot; of meditation, 
      because from here one can dive into the blissful states. When one simply 
      maintains this unity of consciousness, by not interfering, the breath will 
      begin to disappear. The breath appears to fade away as the mind focuses 
      instead on what is at the center of the experience of breath, which is 
      awesome peace, freedom and bliss.</P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#800000">5. The Beautiful Breath</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P>The fifth stage is called full sustained attention on the beautiful 
      breath. Often, this stage flows on naturally, seamlessly, from the 
      previous stage. As one&#39;s full attention rests easily and continuously on 
      the experience of breath, with nothing interrupting the even flow of 
      awareness, the breath calms down. It changes from a coarse, ordinary 
      breath, to a very smooth and peaceful &quot;beautiful breath.&quot; The mind 
      recognizes this beautiful breath and delights in it. The mind experiences 
      a deepening of contentment. It is happy just to be there watching this 
      beautiful breath. The mind does not need to be forced. It stays with the 
      beautiful breath by itself. &quot;You&quot; don&#39;t do anything. If you try to do 
      something at this stage, you disturb the whole process, the beauty is lost 
      and, like landing on a snake&#39;s head in the game of snakes and ladders, you 
      go back many squares. The &quot;doer&quot; has to disappear from this stage of the 
      meditation, with just the &quot;knower&quot; passively observing.</P>
      <P>Now the breath will disappear -- not when &quot;you&quot; want it to but when 
      there is enough calm, leaving only &quot;the beautiful.&quot; A simile from English 
      literature might help. In Lewis Carroll&#39;s <I>Alice in Wonderland</I>, 
      Alice and the White Queen saw a vision of a smiling Cheshire cat appear in 
      the sky. As they watched, first the cat&#39;s tail disappeared, then its paws, 
      followed by the rest of its legs. Soon the Cheshire cat&#39;s torso vanished, 
      leaving only the cat&#39;s head, still with a smile. Then the head started to 
      fade into nothing, from the ears and whiskers inwards, and soon the 
      smiling cat&#39;s head had completely disappeared -- except for the smile, 
      which still remained in the sky! This was a smile without any lips to do 
      the smiling, but a visible smile nevertheless. This is an accurate analogy 
      for the process of letting go that happens at this point in meditation. 
      The cat with a smile on her face stands for the beautiful breath. The cat 
      disappearing represents the breath disappearing, and the disembodied smile 
      still visible in the sky stands for the pure mental object &quot;beauty,&quot; 
      clearly visible in the mind.</P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#800000">6. Experiencing the Beautiful Nimitta</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P>This pure mental object is called a <I>nimitta</I>. Nimitta means &quot;a 
      sign,&quot; here a mental sign. This is a real object in the landscape of the 
      mind (<I>citta</I>) and when it appears for the first time it is extremely 
      strange. One simply has not experienced anything like it before. 
      Nevertheless, the mental activity called perception searches through its 
      memory bank of life experiences for something even a little bit similar in 
      order to supply a description to the mind. For most meditators, this 
      disembodied beauty, this mental joy, is perceived as a beautiful light. It 
      is not a light. The eyes are closed and the sight consciousness has long 
      been turned off. It is the mind consciousness freed for the first time 
      from the world of the five senses. It is like the full moon, here standing 
      for the radiant mind, coming out from behind the clouds, here standing for 
      the world of the five senses. It is the mind manifesting, but for most it 
      is perceived as a light, because this imperfect description is the best 
      that perception can offer.</P>
      <P>For other meditators, perception chooses to describe this first 
      appearance of mind in terms of physical sensation, such as intense 
      tranquility or ecstasy. Again, the body consciousness (that which 
      experiences pleasure and pain, heat and cold, and so on) has long since 
      closed down and this is not a physical feeling. It is just &quot;perceived&quot; as 
      similar to pleasure. Some see a white light, some a gold star, some a blue 
      pearl. The important fact to know is that they are all describing the same 
      phenomenon. They all experience the same pure mental object, and these 
      different details are added by their different perceptions.</P>
      <P>You can recognize a nimitta by the following six features: 1) it 
      appears only after the fifth stage of the meditation, after the meditator 
      has been with the beautiful breath for a long time; 2) it appears when the 
      breath disappears; 3) it comes only when the external five senses of 
      sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch are completely absent; 4) it 
      manifests only in the silent mind, when descriptive thoughts (inner 
      speech) are totally absent; 5) it is strange but powerfully attractive; 6) 
      it is a beautifully simple object. I mention these features so that you 
      may distinguish real nimittas from imaginary ones.</P>
      <P>The sixth stage, then, is called experiencing the beautiful nimitta. It 
      is achieved when one lets go of the body, thought and the five senses 
      (including the awareness of the breath) so completely that only the 
      nimitta remains.</P>
      <P>A skillful means to achieve such profound letting go is to deliberately 
      offer the gift of confidence to the nimitta. Interrupt the silence just 
      for a moment -- so, so gently -- and whisper, as it were, inside your mind 
      that you give complete trust to the nimitta, so that the &quot;doer&quot; can 
      relinquish all control and just disappear. The mind, represented by the 
      nimitta before you, will then take over the process as you watch it all 
      happen.</P>
      <P>You do not need to do anything here, because the intense beauty of the 
      nimitta is more than capable of holding the attention without your 
      assistance. Be careful not to go assessing. Questions such as, &quot;What is 
      this?&quot; &quot;Is this jhana?&quot; &quot;What should I do next?&quot; and so on are all the 
      work of the &quot;doer&quot; trying to get involved again. This is disturbing the 
      process. You may assess everything once the journey is over. A good 
      scientist assesses the experiment only at the end, when all the data is 
      in. So do not assess or try to work it all out. There is no need to pay 
      attention to the edge of the nimitta: &quot;Is it round or oval?&quot; &quot;Is the edge 
      clear or fuzzy?&quot; This is all unnecessary and just leads to more diversity, 
      more duality of &quot;inside&quot; and &quot;outside,&quot; and to more disturbance.</P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#800000">7. The Jhana</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P>Let the mind incline where it wants, which is usually to the center of 
      the nimitta. The center is where the most beautiful part lies, where the 
      light is most brilliant and pure. Let go and just enjoy the ride as the 
      attention gets drawn into the center and falls right inside, or as the 
      light expands all around, enveloping you totally. This is, in fact, one 
      and the same experience perceived from different perspectives. Let the 
      mind merge in the bliss. Let the seventh stage of this path of meditation, 
      jhana, occur.</P>
      <P>There are two common obstacles at the door into jhana: exhilaration and 
      fear. Exhilaration is becoming excited. If, at this point, the mind 
      thinks, &quot;Wow, this is it!&quot; then the jhana is most unlikely to happen. This 
      &quot;wow&quot; response needs to be subdued in favor of absolute passivity. You can 
      leave all the &quot;wows&quot; until after emerging from the jhana, where they 
      properly belong. The more likely obstacle, though, is fear. Fear arises at 
      the recognition of the sheer power and bliss of the jhana, or else at the 
      recognition that to go fully inside the jhana, something must be left 
      behind -- you! The &quot;doer&quot; is silent before jhana but still there. Inside 
      jhana, the &quot;doer&quot; is completely gone. The &quot;knower&quot; is still functioning, 
      you are fully aware, but all the controls are now beyond reach. You cannot 
      even form a single thought, let alone make a decision. The will is frozen, 
      and this can appear scary to the beginner. Never before in your whole life 
      have you ever experienced being so stripped of all control, yet so fully 
      awake. The fear is the fear of surrendering something so essentially 
      personal as the will to do.</P>
      <P>This fear can be overcome through confidence in the Buddha&#39;s teachings, 
      together with the enticing bliss just ahead that one can see as the 
      reward. The Lord Buddha often said that this bliss of jhana &quot;should not be 
      feared but should be followed, developed and practiced often&quot; (<I>Latukikopama 
      Sutta, Majjhima Nikaya</I>). So before fear arises, offer your full 
      confidence to that bliss and maintain faith in the Lord Buddha&#39;s teachings 
      and the example of the noble disciples. Trust the dhamma and let the jhana 
      warmly embrace you for an effortless, blissful, body-less and ego-less 
      experience that will be the most profound of your life. Have the courage 
      to fully relinquish control for awhile and experience all this for 
      yourself.</P>
      <P>If it is a jhana it will last a long time. It does not deserve to be 
      called jhana if it lasts only a few minutes. Usually, the higher jhanas 
      persist for many hours. Once inside, there is no choice. You will emerge 
      from the jhana only when the mind is ready to come out, when the &quot;fuel&quot; of 
      relinquishment that was built up before is all used up. These are such 
      still and satisfying states of consciousness that their very nature is to 
      persist for a very long time. </P>
      <P>Another feature of jhana is that it occurs only after the nimitta is 
      discerned as described above. Furthermore, you should know that while in 
      any jhana it is impossible to experience the body (e.g., physical pain), 
      hear a sound from outside or produce any thoughts, not even &quot;good&quot; 
      thoughts. There is just a clear singleness of perception, an experience of 
      nondualistic bliss that continues unchanging for a very long time. This is 
      not a trance but a state of heightened awareness. This is said so that you 
      may know for yourself whether what you take to be a jhana is real or 
      imaginary.</P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="6">F</FONT>or those who are misled to conceive of all this 
      as &quot;just samatha practice&quot; without regard to insight (<I>vipassana</I>), 
      please know that this practice is neither vipassana nor samatha. It is 
      called <I>bhavana</I>, the method taught by the Lord Buddha and repeated 
      in the Forest Tradition of northeast Thailand, of which my teacher, 
      Venerable Ajahn Chah, was a part. Ajahn Chah often said that samatha and 
      vipassana cannot be separated, nor can the pair be developed apart from 
      right view, right thought, right moral conduct and so forth. Indeed, to 
      make progress on the above seven stages, the meditator needs an 
      understanding and acceptance of the Lord Buddha&#39;s teachings and one&#39;s 
      precepts must be pure. Insight will be needed to achieve each of these 
      stages, insight into the meaning of &quot;letting go.&quot; The further one develops 
      these stages, the more profound will be the insight, and if you reach as 
      far as jhana then it will change your whole understanding. Insight dances 
      around jhana and jhana dances around insight. This is the path to nibbana, 
      the Lord Buddha said (<I>Pasadika Sutta, Digha Nikaya</I>), for &quot;one who 
      indulges in jhana, four results are to be expected: Stream Winner, Once 
      Returner, Non-Returner or Arahant.&quot;</P>
