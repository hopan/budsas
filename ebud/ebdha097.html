  <hr width="25%">
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In a perfect world, the opening line of this
  introduction would have read: &quot;This issue of What Is Enlightenment? would not be
  complete without the following interview with the Buddha.&quot; This is not a perfect
  world, of course, but What Is Enlightenment? always strives for perfection, and we felt
  certain that, as one of history's most illustrious celibates, the Buddha would have had
  more than a few enlightening things to tell us about the relationship between sexuality
  and spirituality, and no shortage of comments on the decline of celibacy and the
  increasing popularity of tantra in the modern spiritual world. How, we wondered, would our
  issue ever be complete without him? <br>
  <br>
  But when we spoke with Bhante Henepola Gunaratana-or &quot;Bhante G,&quot; as he is
  affectionately called by his students-he put our minds at ease. Ordained a celibate
  Buddhist monk at the age of twelve in Sri Lanka, the country of his birth, Bhante
  Gunaratana is today, at seventy, a renowned Buddhist scholar and author and the spiritual
  leader of the Bhavana Society, a monastic retreat center in West Virginia's Shenandoah
  Valley. According to the Bhante, our interview with the Buddha would have yielded no real
  surprises because where spirituality and sex are concerned, things haven't really changed
  that much since the Buddha's time. In our time there are still, relatively speaking, just
  a few monks, still many householders, and still-as the Bhante feels there always will
  be-more than a few adventurous souls who are convinced that sex, not renunciation, is
  going to lead them to the highest peaks of human consciousness. And the Buddha, in the
  course of his life, gave teachings, precepts and admonitions to address the spiritual
  needs of individuals in all three of these categories. What, then, were the Buddha's views
  on spirituality and sex? Steeped in the Dhamma [spiritual teaching] since his youth,
  Bhante Gunaratana answered all of our questions with a conviction that was utterly
  doubtless and a gentle and infectious humor that made it an unqualified pleasure to speak
  with him. And as the hour he had reserved for us drew to a close, he described his own
  lifelong experience of celibacy-its challenges and rewards-with a sweetness and enthusiasm
  born of the certainty that in a life of absolute renunciation there is absolutely nothing
  missing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><strong>INTERVIEW</strong></font></p>
  <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>WIE:</strong> In the course of planning for
  this interview we were joking that if we could actually interview the Buddha himself that
  would be ideal, but that&nbsp; speaking with you about what the Buddha taught would be the
  next best thing. </font></em></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Bhante Gunaratana (BG):</strong> I wish we all
  could meet Buddha and ask him these questions!</font></p>
  <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>WIE:</strong> One fact that most everyone who
  is interested in Buddhism these days is aware of is that the Buddha was a monk who founded
  a monastic tradition; and of course it is this very tradition that you yourself have
  devoted so much time and energy to bringing to the West. Why did the Buddha put so much
  emphasis on celibacy? Why did he feel it was so important?</font></em></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>BG:</strong> Because those who want to attain
  liberation from dukkha, from suffering, have to observe certain principles. In fact, for
  those who want to live a monastic life, celibacy is mandatory. Because if they are engaged
  in all kinds of sexual activities, then they are no different from laypeople, who are
  engrossed in various types of problems related to sex. Also, those who are interested in
  monastic life want to live a very simple life-which is what all monastic traditions are
  set up for-because in the final analysis, it is only when we get rid of our greed, lust
  and craving that we can liberate ourselves from suffering. You see, if our intention is to
  get rid of suffering, then we have to get rid of the cause of suffering, and lust is
  definitely the cause of suffering. So those who want to live the monastic life have to get
  rid of that so that they can live a life that does not nourish the root of craving.</font></p>
  <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>WIE: </strong>Would it be fair to say then
  that if someone was not living a monastic life, if they were a layperson, it would be much
  more difficult, or perhaps even impossible, for them to do that?</font></em></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>BG:</strong> Even laypeople have to live a
  disciplined life; they have to exercise a certain restraint. And that's why for laypeople
  there are the precepts to observe; but ordinary laypeople are not supposed to observe
  celibacy. Laypeople can attain certain stages of enlightenment-what we call
  &quot;stream-enterer&quot; and &quot;once-returner&quot;-before they have realized for
  themselves that there are inherent difficulties and problems involved in sexual
  activities. And laypeople can attain even the third stage of sainthood, which is called
  the &quot;never-returner&quot; stage. But soon after they attain that stage they
  themselves will decide from their own experience, from their own understanding, that
  involvement in sexuality is going to block the progress of their spiritual practice, and
  when they realize this they will voluntarily give up sexual activities. So you see,
  celibacy is not something that can be imposed upon us by force or command.</font></p>
  <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>WIE:</strong> Could you go into a little more
  detail about why it is that sex itself has to be transcended in order for one to progress
  on the spiritual path?</font></em></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>BG:</strong> Because as long as you are in it,
  your mind will be cluttered, clouded and confused and you will get involved in jealousy,
  fear, hatred, tension and so forth-all the worries that arise from lust. Therefore if you
  want to be liberated from all of that, you first haveto get rid of lust. Actually, some
  people don't like the phrase &quot;get rid of&quot;; some people prefer words like
  &quot;transcending&quot; or &quot;transforming.&quot; &quot;Surely,&quot; they say,
  &quot;we can transform 'lust' into 'nonlust'!&quot;</font></p>
  <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>WIE:</strong> What is the distinction between
  &quot;transcending&quot; and &quot;getting rid of&quot;?</font></em></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>BG:</strong> Some terms are a little closer to the
  real meaning, and others are what you call euphemistic terms, rather than very strong
  negative terms. These people like to say &quot;transcending&quot; or
  &quot;transforming&quot; rather than &quot;getting rid of&quot; because they need
  sugarcoated words that make them feel better.</font></p>
  <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>WIE: </strong>But what we're actually talking
  about is getting rid of lust?</font></em></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>BG:</strong> Right. But when you say, &quot;Get
  rid of it,&quot; it's so strong, so negative, that people wonder, &quot;How can I get rid
  of anything?&quot; So if you say, &quot;Let us transform it into something else,&quot;
  then they can relate to it.</font></p>
  <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>WIE:</strong> In the Buddha's teachings on
  sexuality, was sex considered inherently negative?</font></em></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>BG:</strong> Buddha taught that as long as one is
  engaged in sexual activity, one would not be interested in practicing spiritual life;
  these two just don't go together. But when he gave his gradual enlightenment teaching, he
  also said that the sensation of lust, of sexuality, has pleasure. He did not deny the
  pleasure. It has pleasure. But then, you see, that very pleasure turns into displeasure,
  and gradually, slowly, as the initial fever of lust wears out, people begin to fight.
  Because out of lust arises fear; out of lust arises greed; out of lust arises jealousy,
  anger, hatred, confusion and fighting; all these negative things arise from lust. And
  therefore these negative things are inherent in lust. <br>
  <br>
  And if we want to see this, you know, we don't have to look any further than our own
  society. Just open your eyes and look around. How many millions of people are fighting?
  And it is only based on their lust and greed-husbands, wives; boyfriends, girlfriends;
  boyfriends, boyfriends; girlfriends, girlfriends-and so on, you see? Whether you are
  heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, it doesn't matter. As long as you are in it, it is
  inevitable that you will have these problems-fighting, disappointment, anger, hatred,
  killing-all these are involved. Therefore, because he saw the inherent problem in
  sexuality, Buddha said that it is better to control and discipline our senses in order to
  have a calm and peaceful life. But one has to do this gradually, slowly, only through
  understanding and not abruptly. It cannot be forced. It has to be done gradually and with
  deep understanding. If people do not understand this and try to stop it all of a sudden,
  they will get more frustration, more fear and so forth. And therefore in his gradual
  teaching, he said that first there is the pleasure in sexual activities, and then there
  are the disadvantages, then there are the problems. And only when you see the problems,
  only then do you begin to realize that these disadvantages, this negativity, are inherent
  in sexuality-they are intrinsic. These troubles, these problems, are intrinsic to lust.</font></p>
  <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>WIE:</strong> Especially nowadays, that would
  be considered a very radical view.</font></em></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">BG: Oh, surely. But you know, it is only when people turn
  away from these things, it is only when they stay away from this kind of teaching and are
  gone in time and space a million miles away, that when they turn back and look at the root
  of their problem it appears to be radical. They have turned their backs for so long, gone
  so far away in time and space, that when they look back they think, &quot;Oh boy, how can
  I get rid of this now? I've gone so far and I'm so deeply involved in it.&quot; Therefore
  this appears to them to be radical. Surely it is radical! </font></p>
  <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">WIE: I found myself thinking, as you were speaking,
  that because you spent very little time on the pleasure of sex and so much more on all the
  disadvantages, many people-</font></em></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>BG:</strong> Yes! For that little pleasure, a lot
  of pain, right?</font></p>
  <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>WIE:</strong> Definitely.</font></em></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">BG: But you're right. People don't want to think about
  that. People always want to hear what they like to hear. But we don't want to say that!
  Whether the people like it or not, we want to tell the truth. And we shouldn't be afraid
  of telling the truth. Whether the world will accept it or not . . . now that's a different
  issue. What can we do? </font></p>
  <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>WIE:</strong> When we were looking for a quote
  from the Buddha about his feelings with regard to sexuality, we came across this passage,
  from The Life of the Buddha: &quot;Misguided man, it were better for you (as one gone
  forth) that your member should enter the mouth of a hideous, venomous viper or cobra than
  that it should enter a woman. It were better for you that your member should enter a pit
  of coals burning, blazing and glowing than that it should enter a woman. Why is that? For
  the former reason you would risk death or deadly suffering, but you would not, on the
  dissolution of the body after death, reappear in a state of privation, in an unhappy
  destination, in perdition, even in hell.&quot; Now I think one gets a pretty clear
  impression from this how the Buddha felt about sex. But as you know, in the West today
  there are many variations of Buddhism being taught and practiced, and many Western
  Buddhist practitioners seem to disagree with the Buddha's assertion that lust-which as you
  said earlier he viewed as a manifestation of craving-must by definition be transcended in
  order to achieve enlightenment. In addition, the liberal climate in contemporary American
  society as a whole tends to regard sexuality as a very good, a very healthy, and a very
  natural expression of our humanity-and not only our humanity, but our spirituality. What
  do you think the Buddha would have to say about this?</font></em></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>BG:</strong> Before I say anything I want to add a
  little footnote to that translation. You know that when Buddha talked about celibacy he
  was not talking only about the celibacy of a man, but the celibacy of a woman also. So
  when he said, for example, that it is better to swallow a red-hot iron ball than to engage
  in sexual activity, that goes for women, too. We have to make that clear; otherwise women
  will get upset. They might think that Buddha hated women and that that is why he wanted to
  keep men away from women and asked men to observe celibacy. But if a woman wants to
  observe celibacy, then by the same token she should keep away from men. That's the first
  point I want to make clear. The second point is that living a household life, having a
  spouse and so forth-Buddha did not condemn that; a healthy sexual family life is permitted
  for laypeople, even though, as I said, this can never lead to full enlightenment. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But to answer your question: Not only in contemporary
  society, but also in Buddha's time, there were people who believed that sexuality is
  something holy, something noble, something sacred, something miraculous. So this is not
  only a modern, twentieth century social phenomenon. The mentality of people has always
  been the same from time immemorial, up to now, and into the future. There are always some
  people who think that through sexuality they can attain liberation, and that is what we
  call a distorted perception, distorted thinking.</font></p>
  <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>WIE:</strong> This &quot;distorted
  perception,&quot; as you call it, seems to be particularly prevalent nowadays, perennial
  though it may be. I'm referring to the increasingly popular notion that sexuality in and
  of itself, if it's pursued to the end, would be the very expression of enlightenment-and
  that because sexuality is the road to liberation, if you avoid it in any way, then you
  don't really have any hope of reaching the final goal. If possible I'd like to get a very
  clear indication of how the Buddha would have responded to that point of view.</font></em></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>BG: </strong>I am quite familiar with that. He
  said - and I am translating from Pali: &quot;No matter what you may do or attain - you may
  live in a cave, in a solitary place, and you may have learned entire sutras; you may be a
  very erudite speaker; you may even practice morality and so forth and so on-no matter what
  else you do, until you get rid of your lust, your hatred, your ignorance, you will never
  attain enlightenment.&quot; This is the Buddha's teaching. So the more you engage in
  sexual activities the deeper you go in your lust, the deeper you get in your confusion,
  and the deeper you get in your jealousy. When a person, whether male or female, wants to
  get involved in sexual activities with so many different persons at the same time, then by
  the same token there are so many different ways that that person will suffer: from
  jealousy, fear, tension, worry. This is a very unhealthy, very unhealthy life. If somebody
  thinks of having sexual activities with all kinds of people in all different manners all
  the time, then that person would be dead very soon as a result of such unhealthy behavior.
  Now of course you have to understand at the same time that moderate, wise, healthy sexual
  activity is permissible. But all attaining enlightenment through sexuality means is: you
  go and engage in sexual activities until you die! And you will be dead before you reach
  that enlightenment!</font></p>
  <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>WIE: </strong>How does all this play out then
  in the context of actual spiritual practice, for example in tantric Buddhism?</font></em></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>BG: </strong>I'm a Theravada Buddhist - you know
  that, right?</font></p>
  <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>WIE:</strong> Yes, I do.</font></em></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">BG: Now, I'm sometimes sorry to say these things, but
  Theravada Buddhists don't consider tantra to be Buddhism. Nowhere in the original Buddhist
  literature can you find &quot;tantric Buddhism.&quot; Tantra is a later development. There
  is no such thing as tantric Buddhism in original Buddhism. There's never been such a thing
  as tantric Buddhism. Tantra is tantra, Buddhism is Buddhism, and these two will never go
  together. But some people who were so engrossed in sex and so distorted in their
  perception wanted to glorify sex by adding Buddhism to that. And that is why they combined
  tantra with Buddhism. People may hate me for saying this, but still I had to say it.</font></p>
  <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>WIE:</strong> We've noticed in the course of
  our research not only that the notion of sacred sexuality has been increasing in
  popularity, but also that celibacy is often viewed with a great deal of fear and suspicion
  by people in Western culture. Why do you think that might be?</font></em></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>BG:</strong> If celibacy is strictly observed,
  that is good only for the person observing it. You cannot open an institute of celibacy.
  Celibacy is not something that can be institutionalized. It cannot be organized. We cannot
  have a celibate society. It is a totally personal, individual practice. And therefore if
  people object to it, they may be objecting to the organization of celibacy.</font></p>
  <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>WIE:</strong> It seems, though, that any
  monastic discipline would have to be organized to some extent. In fact, we were fascinated
  and even shocked to discover, as we were reading the Patimokkha Training Rules for Monks,
  that the Buddha apparently had to make a whole series of rules that prohibited his monks
  from engaging in sexual contact with-just to give you a few examples which I'm sure you're
  aware of anyway-skulls, dead bodies, animals . . . that kind of thing. Now as far as we
  know, this type of behavior doesn't go on today-although that isn't necessarily true, I
  suppose!-so we were just wondering: Was the Buddha, by making these rules, responding to
  things that people were actually doing?-even his own students and followers?</font></em></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>BG:</strong> Right. When Buddha introduced one
  rule, the monks in those days soon found another way of doing the same thing. They wanted
  to commit sexual activities in one way or another. So when Buddha introduced one rule,
  they did not break that rule, but they found out some other way to commit sexual activity.
  And then Buddha had to introduce another rule to stop them. It's just like the police and
  the criminals-when there is a law, criminals will find a way to go around it and commit
  the crime, and then we have to introduce another law. This is what happened in the time of
  Buddha. When more and more people got into the Order, they started doing all sorts of
  things, and for all these things he had to make a rule. That is why these rules are there.
  It was not in anticipation of the future that he introduced these rules.</font></p>
  <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>WIE: </strong>And now here we are, in the
  future, and because you have gone out of your way to bring the Buddha's monastic tradition
  to the West, I'm curious to know what your experience has been of the Westerners who come
  to you for teaching. How do modern Westerners take to monastic life? Do you find that they
  have more difficulty with it, for example, thanpeople from your own culture?</font></em></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>BG:</strong> You know, that's a good question. We
  really screen people before we accept them into monastic life. We put them under a sort of
  a probation for two years to find out whether or not they are really sincerely serious
  about getting involved. Because sometimes people come just for the fun of it, and because
  our place is very quiet and peaceful and so forth, they think that they might like to stay
  here and become monks. But then later on they will change their minds. And therefore we
  don't want to play some sort of game; we want to know whether they are really sincerely
  serious. If they are serious, we accept them. But these are only a few. Many come here,
  many write letters to us-and these days they even send us e-mails!- asking us to allow
  them to become monks and live here in the monastery. But we don't accept all of them
  because we know that later on they will lose interest. Still, there are some very sincere
  people who really do want to become monks and nuns. And this is not some new phenomenon.
  Even in the olden days, out of millions of people, only a very few entered the
  monasteries. Even today in Buddhist countries not everybody goes to the monastery. In some
  countries, like Thailand, Burma, Laos, Cambodia, and so forth, they have in their
  tradition a custom: they enter the monastery for a short period of time. But of those who
  enter the monastery for a short period of time, most of them disrobe and go back. Only a
  handful of people actually stay there. In the Western countries, where there is no such
  tradition, those who come to the monasteries are even fewer. And of those, still fewer
  will actually remain in monastic life. But that is more or less true all over the world,
  and has been in all times. In the West, you know, more and more people are tired of
  society pressing in upon them-really, really tired-and so they want to get away. But only
  a very few of them will stay, and most will go back again to the society. But we
  established our Center with this understanding because this has always been the same
  everywhere.</font></p>
  <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>WIE:</strong> I'd like to know, if possible, a
  little more about you and your own life as a monk. For example, how has being celibate
  affected your spiritual development?</font></em></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>BG:</strong> My friend, it gives me tremendous
  peace. And I'm speaking honestly, you see? Because I can live with all human beings
  without any problem. Not one particular woman or one particular girl, one particular boy,
  one particular man, because my celibacy helps me to accept all other human beings equally.
  And that helps me to have a peaceful mind. And I think this is what the Buddha wanted us
  to have-a friendly, peaceful relationship with all beings. So it affects my life so
  positively.</font></p>
  <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>WIE:</strong> You've been a monk, I
  understand, since you were ...</font></em></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>BG:</strong> Twelve. And now I am seventy.
  Fifty-eight years I have been in this robe!</font></p>
  <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>WIE:</strong> If you were advising someone who
  was considering a commitment to celibacy as a spiritual practice, what would you tell
  them?</font></em></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>BG:</strong> I'd tell them, &quot;If you honestly,
  sincerely want to live a peaceful life, a mindful life, a life free of trouble, a life
  devoted to the service of others without discrimination, then a celibate life is a very
  good life because when you are celibate you can really practice true loving-kindness, true
  compassion. You can appreciate whatever is in front of you. You can have an equanimous,
  unbiased state of mind. But when you are bound by one person or another, you cannot have
  all this. And therefore, if you are a person who honestly, sincerely wants to practice
  these things, then you have to think seriously about becoming celibate.&quot; But they
  should never accept it on faith or because somebody forces it upon them. One has to have
  serious understanding and think very carefully about celibacy before one gets involved in
  it.</font></p>
  <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">WIE: You have to go in with your eyes open.</font></em></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>BG:</strong> Exactly.</font></p>
  <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>WIE: </strong>And should the individual also
  expect to experience many challenges?</font></em></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>BG: </strong>Sure, sure. When you practice
  celibacy you are always facing challenges. There are so many who would like to get
  involved with you, so many others who would like to get close to you and break your
  celibacy. Because others know that you are not corrupt. You are not doing all sorts of
  hanky-panky things, you are not getting involved in wrong things and getting all kinds of
  diseases and so forth. People understand that you are a very decent person, a neat person.
  And some people like to be with a very neat individual, and that is a challenge. You've
  got to face it.</font></p>
  <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>WIE:</strong> You've been practicing celibacy,
  as you said, for fifty-eight years. How has your experience of the practice changed or
  deepened over time?</font></em></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>BG:</strong> You know, at first it was very
  difficult, very difficult, especially when I was young, as a teenager and up until my late
  twenties. It was a real challenge. But because of the training that I received, I
  developed a sense of responsibility for my duties, my work, my commitment to the Dhamma
  and, moreover, respect for my teachers and parents. Teachers and parents, we love them
  very much, and we don't want to be disloyal to them, disrespectful to them. So that went
  on for many years until I really fully matured. And then I began to understand for myself
  the true meaning of celibacy.</font></p>
