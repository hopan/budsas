  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i><b>Ajahn Nyanadhammo</b> is the vice-abbot at
    Bodhinyana Monastery in Western Australia. He made his first visit to Europe in the spring
    of 1998. The following is from a talk given at Cittaviveka in June, 1998.</i> </font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>A</strong> <i>Dhamma</i> theme which is very close
  to my heart is the five <i>indriya</i> - the Five Spiritual Faculties. These Five
  Spiritual Faculties are the qualities of practice, the qualities of mind that one needs to
  bring to the spiritual path. There's <i>saddha</i>, which is faith; <i>viriya</i>, energy;
  <i>sati</i>, mindfulness; <i>samadhi</i>, which is calm concentration; and <i>panna</i>,
  wisdom. They become powers of mind through which the mind becomes very dynamic and can end
  suffering. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i><b>S</b>addha</i> is often translated as faith,
  confidence or conviction. The <i>Buddha</i> said that faith comes from having seen that
  the human condition is unsatisfactory. It is imperfect, wrought with dissatisfaction,
  discontentment, pain, grief, fear, and anxiety. Having seen that, then the mind naturally
  seeks a path out of that state. It questions the meaning of life and how to find inner
  happiness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>S</b>o this faith looks for a path out of suffering.
  For people who come across the <i>Buddh's</i> words, to hear that there is a cause for
  unsatisfactoriness and that there is the ending of unsatisfactoriness and a path to
  practise for that release: that brings this faith. It&#146;s often because we haven't
  understood <i>dukkha</i> - or because we think that <i>dukkha</i> shouldn't occur - that
  we don't leap forth to find a way out. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>R</b>ecently a lady came to speak with me explaining
  that a friend of hers had just given birth to a child, and the child had died. She was
  very upset because she was going to be the godmother, and she said, &quot;This shouldn't
  happen, this is unfair.&quot; So there is the presumption that life should be fair. But
  with experience, we start to see and understand that life isn't always fair. So <i>dukkha</i>
  is the unfairness of existence. It is not a fair abiding. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>S</b>o, having seen <i>dukkha</i>, we seek a way out.
  In the case of that lady: having experienced suffering, she came to the monastery and
  decided that she would practise <i>Dhamma</i> and share the merits of her practice with
  that deceased child. She began seeking a way of dealing with suffering. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>W</b>hen the <i>Buddha</i> described faith he talked
  about faith in four aspects: faith in the <i>Buddha</i>, the person who has become fully
  enlightened in this world and teaches a path out of <i>dukkha</i>, and in the <i>Dhamma</i>,
  those teachings of the <i>Buddha</i>; and in the <i>Sangha</i> those monks, nuns and
  lay-people who have realised that truth in their own lives; and in the Training. This last
  one means having faith that this practice we're doing will yield results. Faith in the
  training also intrinsically implies faith in our own abilities to realise truth: faith
  that we can do it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>T</b>he lack of conviction in our own ability to do the
  practice is a common obstacle, so one of the responsibilities of a teacher is to encourage
  and uplift people. This was one of the things that <b>Ajahn Chah</b> often did. I remember
  one time having a few difficulties and going to him. He was chatting, and he turned to me
  and said, &quot;Tan Nyanadhammo, you've got very few defilements.&quot; That was at a time
  when it seemed like my mind was full of defilements! But just those few words gave
  encouragement. There was another occasion when I was newly ordained. The food in <b>Ajahn
  Chah's</b> monastery was extremely basic: sticky rice, leaves, curries - which were all
  put in one pot together - and a few bananas, and that was it. As there was very little,
  some of the monks would get up to serve out the food. You sat with your bowl in front of
  you and they put the food in your bowl: you didn't have a choice, you could only say what
  you didn't want. One of the Western monks was asked to get up and hand out the food, but
  he refused, because if he got up then he couldn't watch his bowl and thereby prevent the
  Thai monks from putting things in it that would upset his stomach. And because of that
  they asked me to get up in his place. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A</b> couple of days later we went on the same
  alms-round together into the village, and, as we were coming back to the dining-hall, this
  monk started complaining about the monks who hand out the food. Self-righteous anger came
  up in me, and I said to him, &quot;Instead of complaining about the other monks, why don't
  you get up and help us?&quot; And then I stormed off in a huff. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A</b>s I was walking, I heard <b>Ajahn Chah's</b> voice
  saying, &quot;Good morning&quot; in English. (The only words he knew in English were `Good
  morning' and `Cup of tea.') I turned to see him standing only three feet away with a big
  radiant smile on his face. And I said, &quot;Oh, good morning, Luang Por.&quot; And he
  radiated loving kindness to me, and the aversion completely disappeared and I was really
  happy. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>T</b>hat evening I decided, &quot;As <b>Ajahn Chah</b>
  was very friendly to me, I'll go over and offer him a foot massage&quot;: that was a way
  to do some service for him, and often he would teach <i>Dhamma</i> at that time. So he was
  sitting on a cane seat with me sitting on the floor and massaging his foot when the bell
  rang for evening chanting. He told the other monks to go to the chanting and I was left
  together with <b>Ajahn Chah</b>; it was a beautiful cool evening, with the moon coming out
  full, and the sound of some seventy monks chanting - it was just wonderful. Ajahn Chah sat
  in meditation as I was massaging his foot - and my mind was on cloud nine, uplifted with
  joy. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A</b>t that point <b>Ajahn Chah</b> kicked me in the
  chest and knocked me flat on my back! I looked up in shock, and <b>Ajahn Chah</b> pointed
  at me saying, &quot;See? In the morning someone says something you don't like and you're
  upset. Then someone else just says, `Good morning' and you're uplifted all day. Don't get
  caught up in moods and emotions of like and dislike at what other people say.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>T</b>hen he gave me a <i>Dhamma</i> talk, and I raised
  my hands in anjali and listened to this <i>Dhamma</i>. I remember it to this day, and it
  always brings a sense of how much compassion he had: he saw a person was walking past with
  his head steaming; he said, &quot;Good morning&quot;, and then he waited until the
  opportunity arose. Out of seventy monks in the monastery, and all the nuns, he thought,
  &quot;Today I'll teach this person. This one's really stubborn, I'm going to have to give
  him a kick! He won't remember it if I don't do it tough.&quot; What has stayed with me is
  a sense of faith that the teacher is concerned, is motivated by compassion, and motivated
  to release you from suffering. And that confidence, that earnestness of mind, brings up
  the quality of energy, <i>viriya</i>, which is the next aspect of the spiritual path. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>T</b>he <i>Buddha</i> defined <i>viriya</i>, as
  application to four things. The first is: if an unwholesome state of mind arises, one
  recognises it first and then one strives to overcome it. For example, if anger arises, one
  recognises, &quot;I am angry&quot; and then one strives to overcome that anger. The next
  aspect is if an unwholesome state of mind hasn't yet arisen then one strives to make sure
  it doesn't arise. It's a preventative. And in that example of anger, it's often the case
  that we need to develop loving-kindness (which is the antidote to anger) before it arises.
  It is very difficult to spread loving-kindness when we are already angry, isn't it? So the
  preventative is very important. You'll find that if you develop loving-kindness when the
  mind is at ease then that allows the mind to develop strength and prevent anger from
  arising. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>I</b>f the mind gains strength, and develops this
  quality of preventing unwholesome states to arise, that leads on to the next aspect of
  Right Effort, which is encouraging wholesome states which haven't yet arisen to arise. One
  puts forth effort to purposely arouse a thought of loving-kindness in the mind. If one's
  not thinking a thought of compassion, one intentionally arouses a thought of compassion in
  the mind. If one's not thinking a thought of renunciation or letting go, one purposely
  arouses that in the mind. And when these qualities have arisen the final aspect is to
  sustain them: make much of thoughts of loving-kindness, compassion or renunciation;
  rejoice in them, make them great, infinite, immeasurable. Those qualities then become very
  strong. This is the effort of the mind, the earnestness to create wholesome qualities, to
  make them grow, and to recognise unwholesome qualities and abandon them and not allow them
  to arise again. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>T</b>he next faculty is Right Mindfulness, and
  mindfulness has two aspects: an ability to recall and the ability to know what one is
  doing. One remembers for example, &quot;I am watching the breath&quot;, &quot;I am
  watching this out-breath, I am watching this in-breath.&quot; And then it has this ability
  to remember and recall what is the purpose of watching the breath, why one is doing it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>O</b>ften people are told when meditating to watch the
  breath at the tip of the nose, but actually many people find that this is a distraction.
  If you look in the suttas, the <i>Buddha</i> never tells us to watch the breath in a
  physical place. He says to know that you are breathing in and to know that you are
  breathing out. The important thing is to note it in time. So: &quot;Am I breathing in at
  this time, or am I breathing out at this time?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>M</b>indfulness also knows its goal. It recalls why
  we're watching the breath: so that we're knowing the breath, in each moment in time, for
  the purpose of calming the mind. But to achieve calm, it's also important to approach
  meditation with the right attitude. One has to be content to watch the breath or else you
  can't watch the breath; the mind will go elsewhere. So, this sense of contentment is
  important because it composes the mind. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>T</b>here was a layman who used to come and see <b>Ajahn
  Chah</b>, who had a lot of complaints - his fields weren't producing very much, and his
  buffalo was getting old, and his house wasn't big enough and his kids weren't satisfying
  him... and he said he was getting really sick of the world, and becoming dispassionate. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A</b>nd <b>Ajahn Chah</b> said, &quot;No, you're not.
  You're not dispassionate. If you got more buffaloes, newer ones, healthier ones, and a
  bigger house and a lot more wealth, then you'd find that your dispassion with the world is
  very temporary. You just have aversion to the world.&quot; He continued, &quot;What you
  need to meditate on is, `It's good enough'. Whatever comes up in the mind: `It's good
  enough'.&quot; So the man practised that for a while and the next time he came back to see
  Ajahn Chah he had become contented, just by meditating on `It's good enough'. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>C</b>raving arises because we have discontentment with
  what we have. But when we have that sense of `It's good enough', then the mind starts to
  settle down and come to a place of ease. And it&#146;s from that place of ease, well-being
  and contentment that the mind can go into what we call <i>samadhi</i>. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i><b>S</b>amadhi</i>- the next of the Spiritual Faculties
  - is often translated as `concentration' but I prefer the concept of peace. It is the
  ability to let go of what is disturbing and go to a place in the mind which is less
  disturbing. As we progressively give things up and tranquillise the mind then the mind is
  going to become more and more peaceful and blissful. Then it can even give up blissfulness
  and go to a state of equanimity. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>T</b>he tranquillity of meditation has a lot of
  benefits: it gives energy to the mind by providing a place of rest. Then when the mind
  comes out of that state we can put it to work. It's like our bodies: if we get over-tired
  we need to rest, and then when we've slept enough we can get up and go to work. We don't
  over-sleep and not work at all - nor do we over-work and not rest at all. There has to be
  a balance. Each person will have their own balance of how much the mind needs to go into
  tranquillity, and how much the mind needs to work, to investigate and consider, in order
  to develop insight and understanding. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>T</b>here are various steps to calming the mind. The
  first is developing the sense of well-being, and contentment. Then the next is when from
  that contentment a sense of gladness arises. When there's gladness in the mind that leads
  to rapture. And that rapture then leads to tranquillity of the body, this buoyancy of the
  body, which leads to happiness: a happiness of the mind as it dwells on wholesomeness. Now
  when that arises, then the mind becomes concentrated. The precondition for concentration
  is happiness. If one asks, &quot;Well, why am I not calm and concentrated?&quot; it is
  because the mind is not dwelling happily on a wholesome object. So when you watch the
  breath, watch it to see its beauty. Joyfully, happily watch each in-breath, and know it as
  a friend that you haven't seen for a long time. With each breath that comes in, you're
  glad to greet that breath; and with each breath that goes out you're glad with the breath.
  Glad of the in-breath, glad of the out-breath. And as we do that, then the mind gradually
  lets go of distraction, lets go of the body, and then lets go of all thinking. The body
  feels light, and the mind becomes more and more calm and concentrated. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>T</b>he result of calming the mind down is that one has
  access to wisdom. We use the <i>Buddh's</i> wisdom to develop our own. The wisdom of the <i>Buddh's</i>
  enlightenment is that all conditioned things are impermanent; that all conditioned things
  are <i>dukkha</i> and that all things are not-self. We have received that, so we put it to
  work with our experience, using his wisdom to cultivate our own. And in this way we come
  to Right View. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>T</b>he <i>Buddha</i> defined Right View firstly in a
  conventional sense; that is a confidence in the <i>Buddh's</i> enlightenment, in the <i>Dhamma</i>;
  and in the Sangha; conviction in the efficacy of generosity; belief in heaven and hell.
  These are fundamentals of Right View. But the Right View which leads to liberation is that
  Right View which is based in the Four Noble Truths. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>T</b>his Right View is also defined as the opposites to
  the four perversions or distortions of view. These distortions in seeing mean that we do
  not see the world as it truly is. Because of the perversion of the mind we see what is
  impermanent as permanent. Through the distortion of the mind we see what is <i>dukkha</i>
  as <i>sukha</i> - what is unsatisfactory as satisfying. Through the distortions and
  perversions of the mind, we see what is non-self as self. And we see what is not beautiful
  as beautiful. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>I</b>once remember asking <b>Ajahn Chah</b>, as to how
  he'd developed his immense loving-kindness. And his response was: &quot;You're like a
  child who sees an adult running, and that child hasn't learnt to walk yet but wants to
  run.&quot; That was the first part of his response, the second part was: &quot;When you
  see that all conditioned things are impermanent then you automatically have
  loving-kindness. You cannot not have loving-kindness.&quot; That was loving-kindness
  arising out of wisdom, because the wisdom of seeing things as they really are means that
  aversion cannot arise any more. It is cut off at its roots. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>S</b>o that ability to see things with Right View; this
  is impermanent, this is unsatisfactory, this is not-self, is very important. Watch
  conditions arising in the mind: is this permanent or impermanent; for example, the aching
  in the knee now? Is this permanent or impermanent? - and you notice it changes, it
  pulsates. If it's pulsating then it's impermanent. You won't find any sensation that does
  not change. And if it is impermanent, it's unsatisfying. And anything that changes and
  cannot satisfy or be satisfied is not worthy of calling `me' or `mine'. Therefore that
  letting go process can occur. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>T</b>o see the non-beautiful in those things that we
  take to be beautiful: now what that means is seeing that the body is not beautiful. We
  decorate the body and the reason we do so is to cover up its non-beautiful aspects. If we
  believe, &quot;This body is me, is mine, is beautiful&quot;, then when it gets old, when
  it gets sick and starts to fall apart, we suffer. This body is made of up of many parts,
  none of which are particularly beautiful in themselves. So if a surgeon takes a body apart
  and puts the various organs around on a bench, there's no beauty there. The beauty of a
  human being comes through <i>Dhamma</i>, through virtue, through peace of mind, and
  through wisdom. These are what makes a human being beautiful. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>S</b>o this Chithurst Monastery is a Beauty Parlour! If
  we cultivate and develop these Five Spiritual Faculties, then we become more and more
  beautiful. I think I have said enough this evening, so I will stop here, and thank you for
  all your kindness in listening to me.</font></p>
