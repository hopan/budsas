    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Vipassana meditation
    is an awareness meditation. It teaches you to be with the
    present moment, to live in the present moment. It teaches to
    be aware of everything that comes to you and is happening to
    you. Only the present moment is important. And everything
    that comes to you at the present moment through the six sense
    doors: &quot;eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body and mind&quot; is
    to be noted, to be watched, to be observed as the object of
    awareness. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">When you practice
    Vipassana meditation, by making mental notes or just watching
    the various things that come to you, you will bring awareness
    to a high level so that you will be able to see things as
    they truly are. You will come to see the true nature of mind
    and body, of the mental and physical phenomena of which you
    are composed. &quot;True nature&quot; means the nature of
    impermanence, the nature of unsatisfaction, and the nature of
    insubstantiality or the absence of an unchanging self or
    soul. It is important to see these three characteristics of
    nature so that you can have a correct view of things, so that
    you may have less attachment to mind and body, and gradually
    be able to weaken the hold of mental defilements that prevent
    enlightenment. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">When you practice
    Vipassana meditation, you choose an object on which to focus
    your mind. That object will be the &quot;home&quot; object of
    meditation. Traditionally, the breath is taken as the object.
    You keep your mind focused on the breath and make mental
    notes &quot;in-out-in-out&quot; along with the breaths.
    During the notings of the breath when your mind gets lost or
    distracted, you make notes of them too, such as
    &quot;thinking&quot; or &quot;hearing&quot; or
    &quot;distractions&quot; or &quot;emotions&quot;, etc. And
    also you make notes of the feelings in your body. In this
    way, you keep yourself aware of everything that is happening
    in you or that comes to you through the six sense doors. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">By keeping your mind
    on the object of meditation, you are able to develop
    concentration or one-pointedness of mind which is necessary
    for the penetrative knowledge into the true nature of mind
    and body to arise. Without concentration this cannot happen.
    So what you need first is concentration. And in order to have
    concentration, you must first keep your mind focused on one
    object. If you can keep your mind focused on one and the same
    object for some time you can get the necessary concentration.
    But you will find that in the beginning that is very
    difficult to do even for a short time. That is because you
    are dealing with the mind which is very unruly and difficult
    to control. You can keep a wild bull by tying it with ropes.
    But you cannot tie your mind with ropes, so you tie your mind
    to the object with awareness or mindfulness. In the
    beginning, mindfulness may not be strong enough to tie the
    mind down to one object and you may have many distractions to
    interfere with your meditation. But when distractions come to
    you, whether through the eyes, ears or nose, etc., do not get
    irritated or upset. Just turn them into the objects of
    meditation by making notes of them too. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The beauty of
    Vipassana meditation lies in the fact that all things are the
    object for this meditation. The breath is only the
    &quot;home&quot; object. If you have no other object to note,
    just keep noting them too. Whether you are keeping your mind
    on the breath or on other distractions, you are doing good
    meditation if you are aware of them. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">When you practice
    Vipassana meditation, you have to be patient and persevere.
    And do not get discouraged, if you cannot get concentration
    at the beginning. Everybody has that experience. And leave
    all your expectations behind when you are meditating. Just be
    in the present moment. And if these thoughts come to you in
    spite of the instructions, just make them the object of
    meditation. In this way, you can effectively deal with
    everything that comes to you.</font></p>
