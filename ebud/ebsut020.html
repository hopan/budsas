<P>
 The ordination ceremony (UPASAMPADA) which makes
a Theravada Buddhist monk is one of the 'legal acts of the Sangha'
 contained in the Buddhist Monastic Rule (VINAYA).  The ceremony
must be performed according to this Rule or else the ordination
in invalid and the candidate not a monk.  The strict requirement
to follow the Rule has meant that the ceremony has remained unchanged
since the time of the Lord Buddha.  It is still conducted in Pali,
the language of original Buddhism, to give the rite a solemn formality
which reflects the importance of the occasion.  However, as the
ceremony is always public, with relatives and friends and other
well-wishers in attendance, the Pali phrases are often translated
and the ceremony explained.  
<P>
 According to the Rule, some may not become monks:
 one who has murdered an Arahant (Enlightened Being), one who
has murdered his mother or father, one who has injured the Lord
Buddha, one who has raped a Buddhist nun, one who has caused a
schism in the Sangha, one who has pretended to be a monk without
ordination, one who has left the Sangha and ordained in another
religion, one who as a monk committed any of the four 'disrobing
offences' (see below), one who is a Eunuch, Hermaphrodite or who
is an animal ...
<P>
... Once a Naga, a powerful serpent who can take
the form of a human being, was mistakenly ordained as a monk.
 Shortly after, when asleep in his hut, the naga returned to the
shape of a huge snake.  The monk who shared the hut was somewhat
alarmed when he woke up to see a great snake sleeping next to
him!  The Lord Buddha summoned the naga and told him he may not
remain as a monk, at which the utterly disconsolate snake began
to weep.  The snake was given the Five Precepts as the means to
attaining a human existence in his next life when he can then
be a monk.  Then out of compassion for the sad snake, the Lord
Buddha said that from then on all candidates for the monkhood
be called 'Naga' as a consolation.  They are still called 'Naga'
to this day.  
<P>
... all the above may not be monks and if 'ordained'
mistakenly must be asked to leave.  
<P>
 The candidate must be 20 years of age or more, counting
from when &quot;consciousness first appeared in his mother's womb&quot;.
 Because of the obvious difficulty in knowing when this occurred,
it is usual to insist on at least 20 years since birth.  If, by
mistake, he was 'ordained' under the age of 20, the candidate
remains a ten precept novice and is not a monk.  
<P>
 There are others still who should not be ordained,
although if they are ordained by mistake their ordination is valid.
 These include: one with infectious diseases, a slave, one escaped
from jail, one known to be wanted by the police, one with unpaid
debts, one in the 'King's Service' (e.g. a soldier), one maimed,
deformed, disabled or very old (meaning to the extent that it
is impractical to perform the duties of monastic life).  One also
needs the permission of one's parents.  
<P>
 The ceremony begins with the candidate's sponsor,
often his parents, presenting him with his monk's robes and bowl.
 One may not be ordained without a set of robes and a bowl of
one's own.  When the sponsors are his parents, he often takes
the opportunity to show his gratitude to his parents by formally
asking for their forgiveness for any wrong he has done to them
over the years, intentional or unintentional, by body, speech
or mind.  Then with his parents' blessing, the candidate approaches
the waiting Sangha.  
<P>
 To perform the ordination ceremony, one needs a Sangha
of at least five monks, one of whom must be a knowledgeable senior
monk of at least ten years who will be the candidate's Preceptor
(UPAJJHAYA).  The Preceptor will be responsible for that candidate
throughout his monastic life and the candidate should, in turn,
take care of his Preceptor as if he was his father.  Thus the
ceremony continues with the candidate choosing his Preceptor,
and the Preceptor agreeing.  
<P>
 The candidate is then briefly instructed about the
ceremony and given his new name, a monk's name to always remind
him of his new life's purpose.  He is sent to stand outside of
the gathering of monks and then two senior monks are chosen to
go out and question the candidate on his suitability to be a monk.
 They ask him if he has any infectious diseases, if he is a human
being (to prevent nagas), a man, a freeman (to prevent someone
on the run from the police), without debt, free from government
service, that he has his parent's consent, he is over 20 years
of age, that he has his bowl and robes, and that he has chosen
a Preceptor.  Having successfully examined the candidate, the
senior monks return to the gathering of monks, inform the monks
of the examination and then call the candidate back into the gathering.
 The candidate is asked the same questions again within the gathering
just to make sure.  
<P>
 One cannot be forced to be a monk against one's wishes
and so, in the next part of the ceremony, the candidate makes
a formal request to the Sangha to be ordained as a monk.  Now
the crucial part of the ceremony begins, wherein the whole Sangha
formally agree to accept him as a monk.  If this part of the ceremony
is performed incorrectly, the ordination is invalid.  
<P>
 All the monks within the agreed monastic boundary
(SIMA) must be present and sitting within arms length of each
other.  Then two senior monks make a formal announcement to the
gathering that the candidate has requested ordination and has
been found suitable to become a monk.  They continue by proposing
three times that he be admitted as a monk.  Should any monk in
the gathering object to the ordination during these three proposals
then the ordination is stopped and the candidate fails to be a
monk.  If no monk objects, at the end of the third proposal the
candidate becomes a monk.  
<P>
 The time has to be noted because the new monk's seniority
will be counted from that time.  Another monk ordained even a
few seconds before him will sit ahead on the line.  
<P>
 The Preceptor will then usually instruct the new
monk on the four disrobing offences (sexual intercourse, stealing,
murder and falsely claiming high attainments), and the four basic
needs of a monk (food gained on alms round, robes made of rags,
a shelter under a tree, and medicines made from urine), adding
that anything more than this is to be regarded throughout his
monk's life as an unnecessary luxury!  With this lesson in the
four dangers to his monkhood and the encouragement in frugality,
the ceremony comes to an end.  
<P>
 In spite of this instruction in monastic frugality,
parents and well-wishers often continue by offering gifts to the
new monk!  Having received the gifts, however, he can later give
them away if he wishes!  After all, ordaining as a monk is all
about letting go.
