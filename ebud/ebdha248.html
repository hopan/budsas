      to the topic of ego in the spiritual life, few people have staked out the 
      territory like the Zen masters. To read their stories is to enter another 
      world, one where commitment, humility, devotion and insight take on 
      larger-than-life significance and one thing matters above all else: to 
      slay the ego once and for all, and in doing so to achieve enlightenment, 
      to deeply realize one's Buddha-nature in this life. Indeed, few people 
      could honestly claim the fortitude of spirit required to withstand the 
      ego-destroying tactics of the Zen teachers of yore who, in stories that 
      have become legends, resorted to often outrageous acts of enlightened 
      wisdom in order to shock, jolt and awaken their students from the 
      nightmare of ego-centered existence. Zen Buddhism, it would seem, has 
      never been a path for the faint of heart, a testament, perhaps, to the 
      First Zen Patriarch, Bodhidharma, who sat facing a wall for nine years to 
      demonstrate his commitment to the path of enlightenment. Even in the 
      modern era, we find echoes of Bodhidharma's resolve in the stories of 
      contemporary practitioners, like the now-classic <I>My Struggle to Become 
      a Zen Monk </I>by Morinaga Soko. In his efforts to gain admittance into 
      the monastic life, Soko spent three days crouched beneath the wooden steps 
      at the entrance to one Japanese Zen monastery enduring what is called &quot;<I>niwazume</I>,&quot; 
      a test of character designed to ensure that only the most determined make 
      it through the outer gates. Exposed to the cold wind and snow, he 
      withstood verbal assaults, psychological pressure and even physical 
      beatings before he was finally able, with numb legs and a bloody face as 
      evidence, to convince the monks inside that he had the humility and 
      resolve to take up the austere life of a Zen monk. Those who aren't 
      willing to pay the high price of slaying the ego, in other words, need not 
      even apply. </P>
      <P>So from the moment we decided to present an investigation of the nature 
      of ego in this issue, we began a search for a Zen master who could speak 
      from his own experience of the trials of this rigorous path beyond the ego 
      a search that eventually led us to the venerable master of Ch'an Buddhism 
      Sheng-yen. The word &quot;ch'an&quot; is the Chinese translation of the Indian term
      <I>&quot;dhyana,&quot;</I> a Sanskrit word meaning meditation, and as Buddhism 
      eventually spread from China to Japan, it was translated there as the term 
      much more familiar to our Western ears: Zen. Sheng-yen, according to his 
      most recent book, <I>Subtle Wisdom,</I> was initiated into Ch'an Buddhism 
      at the age of thirteen when he left behind home and family to take up the 
      robes of a novice in a Shanghai monastery, an austere and traditional 
      temple that would be his home for the next six years. In 1949, however, a 
      wind of revolution and change swept through China, and the Communist 
      takeover of the mainland cut short his career as a young monk. Conscripted 
      into the Nationalist army, Sheng-yen soon headed for Taiwan, and it was 
      there, almost ten years later, that he experienced a powerful spiritual 
      awakening at the age of twenty-eight. It was, he says, &quot;the most important 
      experience in my life up to that point.&quot; In a story that could have been 
      taken from the pages of classic Zen literature, the young Sheng-yen was on 
      a brief sabbatical from the military, visiting local Ch'an teachers when, 
      while up late one night meditating, he found himself sitting near an older 
      man, also a guest of the monastery, who impressed Sheng-yen with his 
      steady and peaceful demeanor. Asking the elderly monk if he would answer a 
      question or two, Sheng-yen proceeded to pour out his heart for two hours, 
      giving voice to all of the questions that no one had been able to help him 
      with during his many years of spiritual practice. And at the end of each 
      question, the monk, whom Sheng-yen would later find out was actually a 
      revered Ch'an master, would simply ask, &quot;Is that all?&quot; Finally, Sheng-yen 
      had exhausted his litany of questions and, in a moment of confusion, 
      hesitated, not knowing what to do<I>. Bang!</I> The monk struck the 
      platform they were sitting on and roared, &quot;Take all of your questions and 
      put them down! Who has all of these questions?&quot; The effect on Sheng-yen 
      was immediate and profound. &quot;In that instant all of my questions were 
      gone,&quot; he writes. &quot;The whole world had changed. My body ran with 
      perspiration but felt extraordinarily light. The person I had been was 
      laughable. I felt like I had dropped a thousand-pound burden.&quot; The words 
      of the Buddhist <I>sutras </I>[scriptures], which once seemed foreign and 
      impenetrable, now came alive as Sheng-yen's own experience. &quot;I understood 
      them immediately, without explanation,&quot; he writes. &quot;I felt as if they were 
      my own words.&quot; </P>
      <P>As fascinating and inspiring as this story is, what was most intriguing 
      to us, from the perspective of our investigation of ego, was not the 
      experience itself but the way Sheng-yen responded to it. In a time when it 
      seems that so many, after similar experiences of profound awakening, have 
      quickly assumed that the dangers of the ego have been forever left behind, 
      Sheng-yen came to a very different conclusion. While knowing that his 
      perspective on life had radically changed, he also recognized that his 
      &quot;vexations,&quot; or the character deficiencies arising from his own ego, had 
      not disappeared and could, under the right circumstances, still cause him 
      trouble. It was not time to rest or to teach, he decided far from it. It 
      was time to practice to rededicate himself to spiritual purification with 
      all of the resolve, inspiration and determination that this deep glimpse 
      into his true nature had given him. </P>
      <P>So with deepened faith in the reality of a life beyond the attachments 
      of ego, Sheng-yen once again took up the robes of a <I>bhiksu</I> [monk], 
      obtaining early release from his military duties. He began to study with a 
      well-known Ch'an master named Tung-chu, who had earned a reputation as a 
      very demanding teacher, even by the high standards of Ch'an. Tung-chu 
      pushed Sheng-yen hard, one day challenging him to perform prostrations, 
      and then days later reprimanding him for the same; telling him to write, 
      and then tearing up his essays when they were completed; even going so far 
      as instructing him to close up the door to his room just so he could 
      create a new one in the opposite wall. </P>
      <P>Grateful to have returned to his interrupted monkhood and discipleship, 
      and for the freedom to devote himself full time to spiritual life, 
      Sheng-yen pursued his spiritual practice with great intensity. On his own 
      initiative, he eventually decided to begin a three-year solitary retreat 
      high in the mountains of Taiwan. Living in a small cliff-top hut with no 
      running water or electricity and subsisting on wild potato leaves that he 
      grew himself in his backyard, he worked to uproot the deep vexations of 
      his own mind, to bring the full power of the Buddhist dharma to bear upon 
      his attachment to the ego. Beginning with a half-year of prostrations 
      (doing one for each of the almost 80,000 characters in the Lotus Sutra) he 
      then concentrated on sitting meditation and, in his spare time, wrote and 
      completed two books on the Buddhist teachings. Three years later, feeling 
      at home in the quiet calm of solitary practice but convinced that his 
      efforts to cultivate freedom from &quot;greed, anger, arrogance and ignorance&quot; 
      were still incomplete, he decided to double the time of his retreat, 
      extending to a total of six years this period of seclusion, contemplation, 
      practice and study. </P>
      <P>It was after he emerged from this second retreat that Sheng-yen began 
      to feel that the time was right for him to take up the mantle of a Ch'an 
      teacher in his own right and spread the Buddhist dharma. But having long 
      been troubled by the extreme lack of education he had often seen among the 
      monks and nuns of Taiwan, he first set out to obtain the formal schooling 
      that he himself had never received during his years of retreat and 
      practice. He headed for Japan and attended a university there, immersing 
      himself in the subtle intricacies of the Buddhist dharma, earning a 
      doctorate in Buddhist philosophy and, in the process, studying with 
      well-known teachers from almost all the major schools of Japanese Zen. 
      Later, accepting an invitation from a Buddhist association in the United 
      States, he headed for the unfamiliar territory of America, where he 
      launched a teaching career that would grow rapidly until it eventually 
      encompassed communities of students from both the West and the Far East.
      </P>
      <P>Currently Master Sheng-yen resides primarily in Taiwan but spends 
      several months each year visiting his centers in the United States. As the 
      founder of a liberal arts college near Taipei as well as several 
      monasteries and meditation centers, the author of more than ninety books 
      in ten different languages, a lineage holder in the two major schools of 
      Ch'an Buddhism and personal spiritual guide to thousands of devoted 
      students, Sheng-yen is a master who wears the threads of a great many 
      responsibilities in the fabric of his simple monk's robe. He is credited 
      by some for sparking a revival of Chinese Buddhism, a tradition that is 
      today in exile from its home country a place where Sheng-yen may visit but 
      cannot teach and where an illicit underground network is the only way to 
      distribute Buddhist literature to the population. In a role that has some 
      similarities to that of H.H. the Dalai Lama, Sheng-yen has spent much of 
      his life working hard to help save and invigorate what was once an 
      extraordinarily rich tradition, despite its continuing oppression in the 
      very homeland where it first blossomed more than a thousand years ago. </P>
      <P>Morinaga Soko, in writing about the lessons learned during his ordeal 
      outside the Zen monastery where he became a monk, states, &quot;Until you have 
      subjected yourself to some discipline, you should not put too much faith 
      in your own willpower. When I saw my own will crumbling at the monastery 
      entrance, I suddenly felt I understood the reason for <I>niwazume</I>. As 
      one crouches by the bench on the dirt floor, one's resolve is put to the 
      test time and time again. . . . At the entrance to the monastery, I had 
      learned the meaning of the courage which has its roots in faith and which 
      remains undaunted whenever resistance is encountered.&quot; It doesn't take 
      more than a cursory look at the spiritual life to recognize that to truly 
      free oneself from the fetters of the ego takes courage, determination and 
      resolve in no small measure. Sheng-yen, it seemed, was someone who had 
      spent much of his life attempting to cultivate these very qualities. 
      Indeed, he was a man who had been tested in the fire of the Zen path, who 
      had given his heart and soul to a tradition that demands much of the 
      spiritual aspirant and has a reputation for offering little if any quarter 
      to the needs and concerns of the ego. So what would he, as a person who 
      had truly lived and breathed the experiences most people only read about, 
      have to say about this ancient enemy of the spiritual life? Would he be 
      filled with the fire, intensity and passion for ego death that so many in 
      his lineage have expressed down through the ages? Or would he, in his 
      current role as a teacher and the public face of Buddhism to thousands of 
      people around the world, be more palliative in his relationship to the 
      ego, more accepting of those for whom the idea of ego death is going just 
      a little too far and more accommodating to a Western spiritual culture in 
      which the ego seems to have fallen from its preeminent position as the one 
      and only obstacle between us and the gates of <I>nirvana</I>? </P>
      <HR>
      <P><B><FONT SIZE="4">Interview</FONT></B> </P>
      <P><I>Sheng-yen talked with me one November afternoon on the second floor 
      of his Queens, New York, meditation center. As the soft chanting of the 
      Buddhist </I>sutras<I> drifted up through the wooden floorboards from the 
      room below us, we sat together and spoke through a translator for an hour.</I></P>
      <P><B>WIE: </B><I>What is the ego according to Ch'an Buddhism? </P>
      </I><B>
      <P>Master Sheng-yen:</B> In Ch'an Buddhism the idea of ego revolves around 
      the idea of attachment or clinging. The ego originally does not exist. It 
      is created as a result of attachment to the body and attachment to one's 
      ideas or one's own viewpoint. But because both the body and the mind are 
      impermanent and constantly changing over time, our attachments to them are 
      always changing as well. And as these attachments change, the ego also 
      changes. So from the perspective of Ch'an, the ego does not exist in the 
      sense of being a permanent, unchanging entity. The ego does not exist 
      independent of one's changing attachments to one's body and one's ideas.
      </P>
      <P><B>WIE: </B><I>What does it mean to go beyond the ego? </P>
      </I>
      <P><B>SY: </B>There are two different ways to accomplish this 
      transcendence of the ego. One is experiential, through experiencing the 
      transcendence of the self. And this can be done through practice, the 
      practice of sitting meditation and the investigation of a <I>koan </I>
      [paradoxical question]. It is possible to attain this experience without a 
      practice, but that's very rare; most people need to do the practice. The 
      point of this kind of practice is to essentially push the ego into a 
      corner so that it has nowhere else to go. It cannot escape anywhere. </P>
      <P>So the ego and the method that you are using to transcend the ego are 
      in direct opposition to each other. As I said, the ego is based on 
      attachment our attachment to the body and to ideas. Therefore, the method 
      of transcending the ego is to deal with this attachment, to put down this 
      attachment. When the ego is cornered and has nowhere to go, the only thing 
      one can do is to put it down. And when one puts down the ego, then that is 
      enlightenment. </P>
      <P><B>WIE: </B><I>Could you explain further how facing into a </I>koan<I> 
      helps to &quot;corner the ego&quot;? </P>
      </I>
      <P><B>SY: </B>In this method, you're actually not trying to solve the <I>
      koan.</I> Rather, the method involves asking the <I>koan</I> to give you 
      the answer. A <I>koan</I> may be like, &quot;What is <I>wu </I>[nothingness]?&quot; 
      So you keep asking and asking the <I>koan</I> to give you the answer to 
      that question. But actually, it's impossible to answer. Of course, in the 
      process of asking, your mind will give you answers, but whatever answer 
      you get you have to reject. And you just stay with this method keep asking 
      and keep rejecting whatever answer comes up in your mind. In the end you 
      will develop a sense of doubt. You will not be able to ask the <I>koan</I> 
      anymore. In fact, it'll be meaningless to ask anymore. Then there is 
      nothing to do except to finally put down the self and that is when 
      enlightenment appears in front of you. But if you ask the <I>koan</I> and 
      you simply get tired, if you can't get an answer and so you just stop, 
      that's not enlightenment. That's just laziness. </P>
      <P>The second way to transcend the ego is the conceptual way. It happens 
      when there's a sudden and complete change in one's viewpoint. It can 
      happen, for example, when one's reading a <I>sutra</I> [Buddhist 
      scripture] or listening to a dharma talk. In an instant, one can become 
      enlightened. But for this to really work, a person has to already want to 
      know the answer to the question, &quot;What is ego, what is the self?&quot; They 
      have to already be engaged with this question in their own mind. And then, 
      when they come across a particular sentence, they can suddenly recognize 
      the answer and instantaneously realize enlightenment. One very good 
      example is the Sixth Patriarch, Hui Neng. He heard one sentence from the 
      Diamond Sutra and got enlightened. However, for people who never think 
      about these issues and questions in their daily life, who don't care about 
      what the ego is and have no desire to know what the self is, this won't 
      work. Listening to a dharma lecture or reading the <I>sutras</I> isn't 
      going to help them. </P>
      <P><B>WIE: </B><I>What is the role of the teacher in liberating the 
      student from his or her ego? </P>
      </I>
      <P><B>SY: </B>First of all, the most important thing is that the student 
      has to really <I>want</I> to know what the nature of the ego is. They need 
      to have this burning desire to know. Then, what the teacher can do is to 
      give the students a method or a tool to investigate and show them how to 
      go about practicing the method. Many students may have a method and not be 
      able to use it well. So the teacher can show a student how to use their 
      method properly and can also show the right attitude and conceptual 
      understanding they need in going about their practice. And if the student 
      has a strong desire to understand the nature of their real self, then the 
      method will be helpful. They will be able to see that this self that's 
      based on attachment is illusory. It's not real. And when they realize 
      this, they will also see that there's no such thing as the ego. </P>
      <P><B>WIE: </B><I>In your recent book </I>Subtle Wisdom,<I> you write, 
      &quot;Sometimes the mind experiences something that it takes to be 
      enlightenment, but it is actually just the ego in a very happy state.&quot; 
      Could you explain the difference between these two experiences between 
      genuine enlightenment and a condition where the ego is simply, as you 
      said, &quot;in a very happy state&quot;? </P>
      </I><B>
      <P>SY: </B>The experience of happiness can also be a part of 
      enlightenment; a person can feel happy whether they are enlightened or 
      not. But usually when one is in this blissful, happy state, it is because, 
      in that moment, one is no longer feeling burdened by one's body or by 
      one's mind and emotions, and so one feels very at ease. However, this is 
      not the same as liberation. One may feel very light; it doesn't mean 
      anything. A very peaceful, blissful, happy feeling is not the same as 
      enlightenment. Enlightenment is not being attached to any viewpoint or 
      having any attachment to the body. There's no burden at all, and <I>that's</I> 
      why one would feel happy. For example, Shakyamuni Buddha, after his 
      enlightenment, sat under the bodhi tree for seven days to enjoy this 
      happiness, this dharma joy from his liberation. But one can feel happiness 
      whether one is enlightened or is not enlightened. So we need to be able to 
      distinguish. </P>
      <P><B>WIE: </B><I>In your book you go on to say that this experience of 
      the ego being in a very happy state could occur because &quot;the ego may even 
      be identified with the universe as a whole or with divinity.&quot; Could you 
      explain what you mean by that? </P>
      </I>
      <P><B>SY: </B>That feeling of unification with the universe is actually 
      one kind of <I>samadhi</I> [meditative absorption], a result of a deep 
      state of concentration, and when a person is at this stage, they recognize 
      that the entire universe is the same as themselves. What happens is that 
      one expands one's small ego outward, to include all viewpoints, to include 
      all of the universe and everything in it. So at this point, one would no 
      longer have individual selfish ideas or individual selfish thoughts that 
      normally arise from the narrow, selfish ego. In fact, one may experience a 
      tremendous power that would result from this <I>samadhi,</I> a power that 
      would come from the idea that &quot;the universe is the same as me.&quot; People who 
      have had this kind of realization can often become very great religious 
      leaders. </P>
      <P>But the Buddha, after his enlightenment, did not say, &quot;I'm the center 
      of the universe.&quot; Neither did he say that he represented the entire 
      universe. What he said is that the Buddha is here to encourage all 
      sentient beings to see that ego comes from attachment, and if we can all 
      put down this attachment, then we will be liberated. And so the Buddha 
      sees himself as a friend, a wise friend to all sentient beings, 
      encouraging them to understand that ego comes from attachment and 
      encouraging everybody to practice, to put down this attachment. </P>
      <P>So in the Buddha's nirvana, there's no more arising and no more 
      extinguishing. There's no self no big Self, no small self and that is the 
      true enlightenment. That's the enlightenment of the Buddha. </P>
      <P><B>WIE: </B><I>So if an individual is identified with the universe as a 
      whole, is there still, in that case, an ego attachment that the individual 
      hasn't given up? </P>
      </I>
      <P><B>SY: </B>Yes. </P>
      <B>
      <P>WIE: </B><I>Some of the great Ch'an and Zen patriarchs were reputed to 
      have been very fierce teachers who would go to great lengths and use very 
      extreme measures to liberate their students from their egos. In your 
      books, you have written about how some of your own teachers were very 
      tough with you as well. Is it because our attachment to the ego is so deep 
      and so strong that these revered masters needed to employ such extreme 
      measures to get their students to go beyond the ego? </P>
      </I>
      <P><B>SY: </B>Actually, not everybody needs these harsh methods. The kind 
      of method that is used has to match the needs of the individual student 
      and the condition of the moment. Timing is very important. For example, 
      when I teach my students, I only use harsh methods when it is necessary. 
      Most of the time I use a lot of encouragement, especially for beginner 
      students. It is for those who have been practicing for a while, who have a 
      lot of confidence in their practice already but who still have this 
      attachment to the ego, that I will use some harsher methods to help them 
      to move forward. But it takes a very experienced, very good master to know 
      when the time is right to use such methods. </P>
      <P><B>WIE: </B><I>Another passage from your book reads, &quot;If your sense of 
      self is strong, solid, and formidable, then there is no way you can 
      experience enlightenment.&quot; What do you mean by this? Why is it difficult 
      for a person with a strong sense of self or what Westerners would call &quot;a 
      strong ego&quot; to experience enlightenment? </P>
      <P></I><B>SY: </B>It's not necessarily true that people who have a very 
      strong ego cannot be enlightened. In fact, those who <I>know</I> that they 
      have a strong ego may, in some cases, actually be very good candidates to 
      practice the Buddha-dharma. You see, there is a type of person who is very 
      egocentric yet at the same time has a strong desire for enlightenment. 
      Because of this strong desire, they are naturally going to be very unhappy 
      and dissatisfied with having a big ego, and that attitude will be good for 
      their practice. When you have such a strong ego, you have to be willing to 
      do something about it. So someone like this could be a good candidate for 
      practicing and studying Ch'an. </P>
      <P>Then there are also individuals who have what we would call a weaker or 
      softer ego. This can help them, but only if they still have a real desire 
      to deal with their ego. If they don't, they are not going to be any closer 
      to enlightenment because they won't have any confidence in the practice. 
      They won't have diligence in the practice. But if an individual has a 
      weaker, softer ego and still understands that they need to practice 
      diligently to deal with it, then we could say that these individuals, 
      because they have both a strong desire for liberation and a smaller ego, 
      are closer to enlightenment. </P>
      <P><B>WIE: </B><I>Today many Western spiritual teachers believe that 
      traditional spiritual paths, including Buddhism, do not properly address 
      all the needs of the modern seeker. In particular, they feel that people 
      may need psychotherapy to supplement their spiritual practice in order to 
      work out many of their emotional attachments and problems with their ego. 
      Do you feel that the Ch'an path is incomplete when it comes to addressing 
      the suffering of the modern seeker and that a person would be well advised 
      to consider this dual approach psychotherapy </I>and<I> spiritual practice 
      in their pursuit of enlightenment? Or is spiritual practice alone, if it's 
      sincere and diligent, sufficient to free us from the ego? </P>
      </I>
      <P><B>SY: </B>There are two different issues here. First, individuals who 
      have very severe psychological problems should not use the Ch'an method. 
      It's not good for them. If they just want to learn the beginner's sitting 
      meditation, we will teach them and they will reap benefits from that, such 
      as improved health. However, a person with severe problems should get a 
      doctor to help them recover before they begin the practice of Ch'an. </P>
      <P>But generally, for individuals who do not have severe psychiatric 
      problems, Ch'an practice is sufficient. There's no need to get help from a 
      psychiatrist or a therapist. In fact, sometimes psychiatrists or 
      therapists come and seek help from me. </P>
      <P><B>WIE: </B><I>In the last thirty years, there have been many powerful 
      teachers who have had profound spiritual understanding and experience and 
      have attracted large numbers of students, but who eventually fell from 
      grace due to corruption and scandal, sometimes in very shocking ways. Is 
      it possible that spiritual experience and understanding could, in some 
      cases, actually empower the ego? </P>
      </I>
      <P><B>SY: </B>It's hard to say. I don't really want to comment on this. It 
      is a problem. There are some individuals who think that they are 
      enlightened, that they are liberated, and they also have the idea that 
      after they're liberated, they do not need any morality; they do not need 
      to uphold the precepts [basic obligations undertaken by Buddhists] 
      anymore. And according to my own understanding of Buddhism I can only 
      speak for myself here we follow Shakyamuni Buddha and if we look at the 
      Buddha after he was enlightened, he didn't go and drink. He didn't go and 
      hang out with women, sleep around and cheat people out of their money. And 
      so that is what we follow. The Chinese Ch'an masters emphasize the 
      importance of upholding the precepts. </P>
      <P><B>WIE: </B><I>For everyone, teachers and students? </P>
      </I>
      <P><B>SY: </B>In the <I>sutras,</I> the Buddhist scriptures, they say that 
      if you are really genuinely enlightened, you will <I>naturally</I> uphold 
      the precepts. </P>
      <P><B>WIE: </B><I>You are a revered teacher with students in Taiwan and 
      also Western students here in America. Some of the Western spiritual 
      teachers and psychologists we have spoken to for this issue have said that 
      the ego of Westerners is different from the ego of Easterners that 
      Westerners are more attached to an individual self and personal identity. 
      If that's true, then theoretically, it should generally be easier for 
      Easterners to get enlightened than it is for Westerners. Do you agree with 
      that? Is that your experience? </P>
      </I>
      <P><B>SY: </B>This is not necessarily the case. It all depends on whether 
      you have the desire for enlightenment whether, as I was saying, you really 
      want to understand the nature of the ego. </P>
      <P><B>WIE: </B><I>You're saying that's the key to success? </P>
      </I>
      <P><B>SY: </B>Yes, that's the key. You may have a weak or small ego, but 
      if you don't care about these things and you don't have a strong desire, 
      then you're not closer to enlightenment.</P>
