<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;(...) Right View in Buddhism is the first step of
  the Eightfold Path. This is why we say it's a Path of Wisdom, not just doctrine or belief.
  It's a noticing and observing of ourselves, our lives. The Buddha taught what is obvious,
  what is there to be seen. Although it's there to be seen, it doesn't mean we see it; it
  may be obvious but it doesn't mean we understand or notice it. Maybe we miss it all the
  time because it is so obvious. The Buddha pointed things out which we need to consider. He
  taught nothing outside of what can be seen and realised within this body, with this mind.
  The whole path is to be developed through this body and mind. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;We have all that we need. All we have to do is to
  start noticing what is around us. That's when the spark of Right View begins to arise. The
  result of Right View is that Right Aspiration or Right Thought arises. This happens to us
  in various ways. I'm sure it has happened to everyone here, especially when we have a
  traumatic experience, or something helps us to stop and think and observe. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;One very nice story is of a man I know here in
  Perth. He was brought up as a Buddhist actually, and considered himself one, but never
  really took an interest or practised anything beyond just the superficial. On one
  occasion, he decided to go on a trip, with his wife, around Australia, camping and
  driving. While they were travelling from Perth to Adelaide, they camped out in the desert.
  One night, camping in the middle of nowhere, just open space, he couldn't sleep. So, he
  got up, went out to the emptiness of the desert. He found himself completely alone. In
  this emptiness, he noticed himself, this human being, and he became very aware of the
  emptiness in this life. What am I doing? What's it all about anyway? All this study and
  accumulation of degrees and knowledge and money, so what? What do I want out of life? A
  spark of Right View there, a stopping and considering. The mechanical, the habitual
  existence comes to a stop for a moment. All thought comes to a stop for a moment and this
  reflection arises: a consideration and appreciation of one's present existence. Right View
  arises.(...)&quot;</font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The above paragraphs are taken from a booklet by Ajahn
  Jagaro (1988), <i>&quot;Calm and Insight&quot;</i>, published by the Buddhist Society of
  Western Australia. I would like to continue telling that story which happened in 1979: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">- After that long four-week journey driving around
  Australia with his wife, the young man went back to Perth and resumed his postgraduate
  research study. Not long after, he was informed by one of his wife's friends that a
  Western Buddhist monk of the Thai Theravadin tradition was visiting Perth, and the monk,
  Phra Khantipalo, gave a series of talks about Buddhism and Buddhist meditation. He went
  along with his wife to attend one of these talks. Somehow, he felt very much <i>&quot;at
  home&quot;</i> with what the monk said about the Buddhadhamma (the Buddha's Teaching). It
  was simple, but practical and straight to the heart. It did make sense to him. It seemed
  that at last, he found those missing pieces of the jigsaw puzzle he had in his mind since
  that trip through the desert. He decided to join the local Buddhist Society, and has been
  practicing the Theravadin Buddhist tradition ever since. </font></p>
