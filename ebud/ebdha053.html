 This is how to deal with the most
subtle sorts of defilements hiding out in the heart. Hit them
hard with the truth of impermanence, suffering and not-self, because
these defilements are the essence of sammuti - all our suppositions
about the world. They must be crushed and dispersed from the heart,
and then we'll see whether the heart has also been annihilated.
No... it is not destroyed. The heart has no cemetery. It is <B><I>undying</I></B>
by its very nature - even when it still has defilements. 
<P>
 The Lord Buddha called this the complete
dissolution of the defilements: "the end of danger, the quenching
of the fires of greed, hatred and delusion" by the pouring
of the <B><I>Undying Dhamma</I></B> (amata-dhamma) elixir. With the defilements
gone, only spotless purity remains. And it is here in this fully
purified heart that perfect happiness is found. All work finishes
here; all projects end here. The Lord Buddha said: "Done
is the task, fulfilled is the holy life, there is no further work
to do." All suffering ends with this right understanding.
<P>
 The summit of Dhamma is found in
this purified heart. The <I><B>"Buddham-Dhammam-Sangham saranam
gacchami"</B></I> which we repeat to reverently recollect the Lord
Buddha, all gather and converge in this pure nature. Concern with
questions about the Lord Buddha's parinibbana (final passing away)
in India -- "how many centuries ago is it now?" -- will now end.
The true nature of Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha will now be evident
in "one's own" heart of purity. This is the heart's priceless
treasure, where the true state of things is seen and all questions
settled.
<P>
 Where did the Lord Buddha go when
he finally passed away? The bodily aggregate certainly disintegrated,
following its nature - bodies being the same everywhere. However,
the purified nature, <I><B>Buddho</B></I>, was not destroyed or annihilated,
for it is not confined by time or position. And it is this which
we refer to in <B><I>"Buddham-Dhammam-Sangham saranam gacchami"</I></B>.
When we can experience this for ourselves, we will be able to
verify with complete certainty that this nature cannot be annihilated.
<P>
 The <I>arahant</I> disciples understand
this. And wherever they may be they are together with Dhamma;
with "Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha", having constant audience
with the Lord Buddha. Their minds are unshakable because the fires
of desire are quenched with the waters of Dhamma. "<I>The
quelling and cessation of all conditioning factors is supreme
happiness</I>." (Tesam vupasamo sukho.) These conditioning
factors are really samudaya, the source of suffering, so when
this is ended all that remains is supreme happiness.
<P>
 The means and the results, the good
and the bad, are within all of us who are aware and care. This
<B><I>nature which knows</I></B> is uniquely suited to all levels of
Dhamma, up to and including the state of purity, and there's nothing
apart from this knowledge.
<P>
 Please try to steadily purify this
nature that knows, ridding it of all obstructions and oppressive
influences. There will then be no need to make inquiries about
Nibbana, for having experienced the purified heart all questions
will be finally settled.<BR>
