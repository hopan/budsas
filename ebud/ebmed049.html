  <b><font SIZE="5"><h3 ALIGN="CENTER"></font><font color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">The
  Fundamentals of Meditation</font></b></h3>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">The essence of concentration (<b>samadhi</b>) is the study
      of the <i><a HREF="#obj">heart*.</a></i> </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">The <i><a HREF="#obj">mind*</a></i> is cogitating and
      thinking: pondering about this, wondering about that, turning over assorted problems.
      Indulging in these suppositions and notions gives the mind no rest. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Being aware of the thinking mind is defined (by the Lord
      Buddha) as mindfulness (<b>sati</b>). </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">The knowledge of the mind occupied in thinking about
      something is clear comprehension (<b>sampajañña</b>) and discernment. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">We need to train mindfulness and clear comprehension so
      that they become swift enough to keep up with the mind. If mindfulness is still weak it
      will be unable to match up against the speed of the mind, and samadhi can&#146;t then
      progress. The mind can&#146;t be brought together with the selected meditation <a
      HREF="#obj"><i>object*</i></a>; it can&#146;t concentrate on the in-and out-breathing.
      Instead it continues on its own way with mindful awareness lagging behind, unable to catch
      up. We almost manage to bring it in but it then slips away to (thoughts of)
      &#145;America&#146;, and upon following it we find it&#146;s already back in
      &#145;Thailand&#146;&#133;.or &#145;Germany&#146; and so on. We can but chase after yet
      never catch up because mindfulness remains undeveloped and immature. It can&#146;t match
      the mind. This is the source of problem in the development of our meditation practice. It
      is therefore essential to improve and cultivate mindfulness.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Cultivation of mindfulness starts from being aware of
  the current bodily posture. If standing, be mindful of that. Walking, sitting or lying
  down - - be present with that movement and posture. Bathing, eating or excreting - - be
  fully aware of what is going on. This constant awareness of bodily actions brings
  mindfulness and clear comprehension to the forefront.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once this skill is developed you will become aware of
  changing postures as different activities occur: working on the job, washing clothes or
  dishes, reading or writing, sewing or knitting. Whatever you are involved with be present
  with that activity while you are doing it. Don&#146;t allow the mind to wander away. This
  is how mindfulness develops in daily life.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You will now find mindfulness becoming swifter and
  sharper, able to recognize and catch the fleeting mind. Wherever your mind may go
  mindfulness will follow and return with it to the object of meditation. Being more
  practiced you will now succeed in concentrating on the in-and out-breath. Whenever the
  mind wanders away you will catch up with it and bring it back together with the breathing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now skilful and sharp endowed with mindfulness, you will
  bring the mind and its wayward thinking to reflect on the breathing until it comes into
  view. At the time the breath is actually seen, the mind is present there together with the
  breath. Without such vision the mind must be elsewhere &#150; and yet, if you bring them
  together again you should be able to understand about this. Whatever, if the mind
  isn&#146;t with the breath it&#146;s off rambling and concocting.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who can bring the mind to reflect on the breath with
  relative ease will find that it becomes still quiet with the breath going in and out.
  There is awareness of a heavier or softer, longer or shorter inhalation and exhalation, as
  breath succeeds breath. This knowledge and awareness indicate the mind is together with
  the breath. It should be understood in this way. If it only happens a litter and briefly
  before separating, then this is define as <b>momentary concentration ( khanika-samadhi). </b>You
  should then pull the mind back to reflect again on the breath. Together again for a longer
  period the breath seems much more refined, almost as if there isn&#146;t any at all. You
  can&#146;t find it! It&#146;s at this point that people fear death: &quot;<i>Where&#146;s
  my breath gon</i>e?&quot; &quot;<i>It was here just now</i>&#133;.&quot; And so they come
  out of samadhi. They withdraw being afraid they will die.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Don&#146;t go and be so afraid. The breathing is still
  there only it&#146;s extremely subtle and refined. But there&#146;s no need to go
  searching for it. Direct you mindfulness and discernment to the mind and return it to the
  meditation object. Go and examine: exactly where does the heart or mind have its origin ?
  Where does its thinking arise ? What is the feeling of happiness and contentment currently
  been experience like ? At that moment you have found the heat. Now direct it to the chest
  area or some such point. Place the pleasant feeling which the heart is experiencing there,
  and support it with your mindfulness and discernment. Keep your reflection there, let that
  be where any &#145;thinking&#146; occurs. In this way a deeper, more profound tranquillity
  will develop until the level of <b>access concentration (upacara samadhi) </b>is reached.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At this point some people may experience a bright
  radiance. But if nothing happens for you, don&#146;t feel discouragement. The practice of
  meditation is not concern with the desire to see any manifestations. Don&#146;t fabricate
  any expectations about seeing a bright light or any such thing. Do not speculate about
  what may be going to happen. The state of tranquillity will develop in its own way and
  whatever happens, happens. Never crave for a vision of heaven and hell for that type of
  wishful thinking will itself block any approach to tranquillity.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Anyone who find concentration easy to manage will
  certainly experience ease and happiness as soon as the heart is still and tranquil. You
  will realize for the first time what happiness is all about. This state must also include
  rapture (<b>piti</b>) though it may manifest in a different manner for different people.
  Your hair may tingle all over and &#145;stand on end&#146;; or a sense of coolness
  refreshes the heart; or you may feel as if enveloped in soft cotton wool; or as though a
  flash of lighting precedes the coolness; or the body seems so light and buoyant that it
  might float away.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The meditation teacher can&#146;t order or control this
  sort of experience. They are termed &#145;the buoyant body and the buoyant mind.&#146;.
  Why should the calm mind be so light and buoyant ? It&#146;s because it has released the
  hindrances (nivarana) and is free of such burdens. Endeavor to support and sustain this
  state of mind. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I would like you to bypass the affair of voices heard in
  this state. They sound a bit indistinct like over long distance telephone lines. You may
  actually seem to see and hear both local and distant conversations concerning yourself.
  However they cut off when the mind either goes deeper or withdraw from that particular
  level of calm. The mind just happened to be properly tuned in, so don&#146;t go around
  boasting of your clairaudience or clairvision. Some people may not want to experience such
  images but whatever appear depends on the nature of the concentrated mind itself.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">On leaving these things behind the tranquillity deepens,
  by the hour, the physical body will seem to drop completely away. No arms or legs: you
  don&#146;t notice your hands or body. Wherever are they ? There&#146;s the temptation to
  open your eyes to check but don&#146;t bother about doing that. Never mind about those
  things. Come and look closely at your heart to check what object it rests with, and
  sustain it there. Tremendous happiness is prominent and vividly present. This is <b>attainment
  concentration (apana samadhi)</b> where the mind is enraptured and engrossed in that
  buoyant state, free from all hindrances. There is no hunger or thirst, no wanting of any
  external object only the desire to stay with that happiness, never experienced before.
  This spiritual happiness attained through samadhi puts all gross worldly affairs and
  desires out of mind; business and work concerns are completely thrown out.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Should attainment concentration continue in sublime
  happiness letting go of all else, then it is called <b>absorption (jhana)</b> . This
  serenity is only a litter different from the state of <b>equanimity (upekkha).</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At this point, the question of other people comes up <i>:
  &#145;has anyone else experienced what I have?&#146; &#145;How can they manage to do so ?
  &#145;</i> this is the time to be extra careful so that you don&#146;t start flaunting
  your knowledge. It&#146;s all too easy to become sidetracked here so stay prepared and
  alert to this matter. Many people go off the rails and become crazy, telling all and
  sundry, &quot;<i>It&#146;s such real happiness&#133;..You must do this ! &#133;.You should
  do that!&#133;.</i>&quot; Forestall this with mindfulness and discernment. Don&#146;t go
  around preaching --- you&#146;re not enlightened yet.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Examine and remember the sequence of steps you have taken
  to achieve this level of samadhi. Next time you will then be able to retrace the way with
  ease and greater skill. Notice how you establish mindfulness and clear comprehension right
  from the beginning of your practice. How was the mind placed ? What was developed and what
  disregarded ? When the deeper level of samadhi was reached, how was the mind sustained in
  attainment concentration ?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When coming again to the practice you will immediately be
  able to deal with anything that intrudes. Such things are disposed of in the same way as
  before and the previous state becomes established again. A person skilled in this way will
  be proficient in doing this under any circumstances; travelling by car, ship or plane,
  wherever he might be sitting. Whichever country, it&#146;s all the same. Once expert in
  entering and withdrawing from meditation it all seems easily and swiftly accomplished. The
  hindrances no longer come into the picture at all.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are some people though who find it difficult to
  concentrate their minds. No matter how they try, the mind always seems to wander away.
  They should keep mindfulness on the mind&#146;s trail until it tires. It really can&#146;t
  escape for it is stuck on thinking about money or a car, or a house, or the children or
  grandchildren and near friends. As soon as it fastens onto some such object, mindfulness
  and discernment must follow and catch it there. Interrogate it immediately about its
  possessiveness<i>; &quot;Why be so grasping and attached to this (for example) house ? Is
  it even yours ? &quot;</i> The answer will come back<i>, &quot;certainly, it&#146;s
  mine.&quot;</i> Mindfulness and wisdom must then probe and examine the mind with, &quot;<i>Then
  when you die will you take it with you ?&quot;</i> If it should admit the impossibility of
  that, then follow up with, <i>&quot;Then why be so preoccupied with it; it&#146;s solidly
  built and isn&#146;t going to run away.&quot;</i> The mind must be reprimanded and when
  necessary brought to order by intimidation. Such threats will leave the mind baffled and
  dazed and it can then be led back to the meditation object, concentrating on the
  breathing. This is the way of wisdom developing samadhi, for those who find concentration
  difficult. It means using the right and most appropriate tactic, the best skilful means
  that accords with the situation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once the mind is together with the meditation object it is
  time to curb and restrain it there. Sustain it without allowing it to break away. On
  occasion though, the mind will also deserve approval and praise. For instance the wish to
  go and meditate arise even in the midst of unfinished work. Try to nourish that intention
  by speedily tying up any work which left undone might remain a cause of uneasiness.
  However as no task is ever complete settled, as soon as the right pause or lull appears
  rewards the mind&#146;s desire by quickly going away. Take the break sitting samadhi in
  your room or think of a way to get away, like escaping via the bathroom. For it&#146;s
  when the mind wants to concentrate that the calm and tranquillity will develop with
  special facility, backed by the full force of faith. Any preoccupation will automatically
  be cut aside.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The stilled mind brings happiness without any drawbacks or
  anxieties. It is content in itself. It&#146;s as if one likes the climate and atmosphere
  of some cave, forest or shady spot. The cool breeze blows and one feels relaxed and
  quickly becomes at ease. So the praise worthy state of mind wishing to meditate must be
  encouraged to do so. If at night time the mind is very tranquil then continue on with the
  practice until midnight. And if it still progresses then don&#146;t quit but develop it
  further to perfect serenity. It will deepen and establish itself more and more firmly, on
  a more and more profound level. Don&#146;t stop now. This is the time when you&#146;ll
  recognize how far your meditation has developed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">With this accomplishment you can now go to bed. After
  offering respect to the Lord Buddha lie down and recollect the steps you have taken to
  tranquillity and sleep together with that. On awakening the mind will immediate go to the
  meditation object and that level of samadhi. I myself practice in this way. The mind will
  automatically be drawn and concentrated deeper and deeper at the place it knows. With
  constant development and with genuine samadhi there will absolutely no dreaming during
  sleep. Once awake again the mind knows its duty and this is what we call mindfulness and
  clear comprehension. They are there to unremitting uphold and care for the heart.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You have to understand about the trained mind. When it
  needs to be chided, you must chide it. When it needs disciplining then do so and sustain
  it when it needs supporting. And when it&#146;s commendable then applaud it. It&#146;s
  like confronting one&#146;s disobedient children. One takes hold of their arm without
  releasing until they accept. When they listen to one, are good and study diligently then
  they should be rewarded with praise. The mind is similar in that it resists if one
  continually uses force, so you must also soothe and coax it along. Being bullied, it might
  refuse to study, to work; it becomes weak and lazy. But with praise and encouragement it
  will work all day, our employee need this treatment too. The assistant in our shop sells
  our merchandise for us, helps us with out work and to earn our livelihood. We can&#146;t
  simply bully and be on their back all the time. They also need care and attention, kind
  and solicitous words. However, if a mistake is made they will still need telling and
  correcting. Bullying will only work and livelihood.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The child is quiet and still because of wise handling on
  the part of the parents. They don&#146;t solely punish and bully for otherwise the child
  may fail in his studies or even have a nervous breakdown. The serene mind also needs
  similar treatment with mindfulness and wisdom carefully watching over and correcting it.
  Mindful discernment &#150; this is the resource to use. The more the better. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mindfulness also supervises speech. Defilement&#146;s come
  in many forms so we need to be aware of what we are saying. By talking in such a way, is
  it beneficial ? Is it well justified ? For example, is what I am saying right now useful
  to anyone ? Does it offer happiness and is it worthwhile ? Holding forth without
  mindfulness supervising means you will blunder and go astray. In the beginning we all have
  to make mistakes so the first thing is to recognize that and then it can be corrected.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">After dealing with speech you come to your thought. Be
  aware of unwholesome thinking and know when it&#146;s good. Thoughts going in a bad
  direction must be held back; you must keep them on the right track. The mental process
  need to supervised and cut off when necessary. Let go of evil thoughts. Fix your mind on
  skilful thinking in every posture &#150; standing, walking, sitting, lying down. Then
  happiness will arise. Once you realize this the mind will diligently apply itself in the
  wholesome direction and accumulate virtue. Comparing this with something on the strictly
  material plane, it&#146;s similar to making roads, cars, aircraft, ship or clothes etc.
  Careful and skilful thoughts will result in good, favourable products which will sell well
  and make your fortune. So with the mind. Good thoughts make your mind buoyant and happy,
  whereas evil thoughts will result in suffering. If you do not produce good products they
  will not sell. If you say bad things, you will soon be quarreling and fighting. Then
  suffering will certainly appear for anger and hatred can only bring distress.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The meditation of everyday life will bring happiness when
  you are continually aware of whatever activity you&#146;re engaged in. Watch; while
  standing, walking, sitting, lying down, eating, going to the bathroom, washing your hands.
  Notice the mind thinking and see with what topic it calms down. No matter what you do be
  conscious of doing it. People like this meditate all the time. Cooking or washing dishes
  &#150; it&#146;s the practice of samadhi. They concentrate their mind while walking to the
  bathroom, while using the toilet. Contemplating and being aware of the mind &#150; this is
  unfailing meditation. There&#146;s no need to lock yourself away to meditate, the wise
  person will be able to do so at any time. This is what I would also advise you to do.
  Don&#146;t continually wait for the appointed time &#150; develop samadhi as you read this
  book, as you write or sew or even while you cut your finger nails. Be mindful and
  concentrate on the thing in hand and rest your mind with it. But keep away from
  unwholesome things for such thinking will bring distress instead. People who diligently
  watch over their mind in this way, who are aware of the mind at every moment &#150; except
  when in sleep - - will always be serene and at peace.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The enlightened being (<b>ariya</b>) and our venerable
  teachers (<b>acharn</b>) practice in this way. Their minds are always concentrated. They
  converse and it&#146;s still samadhi because their heart doesn&#146;t go out to take issue
  or bother anybody. Mindfulness and wisdom supervises the whole process so that even a chat
  together becomes samadhi. Those venerable <b>acharns</b> who recently were killed in a
  plane crash were prepared for death. Their minds were endowed with samadhi and ready to
  die without fear at any moment. Wisdom was always composed and present to sustain the mind
  through any eventually. They were prepared to die at any time, and being always aware of
  the potential for death they could simply abandon their bodies at the actual time without
  any distress.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those people who have never practiced meditation or
  developed samadhi may find such things hard to believe. If they don&#146;t know what their
  own minds are truly like through meditation, then they can&#146;t be expected to
  comprehend things anyway. To them it is impossible for anyone to train his mind because it
  keeps changing all the time. When the mind grasps onto suffering, we suffer; when it holds
  to happiness, we&#146;re content. For those <b>acharns</b> the mind was released and
  serene. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If the mind dwells in samadhi then we meditate all the
  time. I&#146;ve been contemplating this and really consider the teaching of the Lord
  Buddha to be very deep and profound, so subtle and intricate. It becomes clear how the
  purity of mind of those perfectly practiced and accomplished <b>acharns </b>might even
  suffuse their bones too. Why have the bone fragments found in the burned-out cremation
  pyre of the venerable <em><a HREF="#mun">Phra Ajahn Mun*</a> </em>now become crystal like,
  clean and white relics ? The purity is not only a thing of the mind - - it seems to affect
  the very bones as well. Bones are bones but this is something more. It&#146;s about <b>nibbana</b>
  isn&#146;t it ? How deep and unfathomable this is !</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism is so profound. Other religions are fine too in
  their own way. If anyone wants to follow a religion then one can&#146;t say anything about
  that. It&#146;s definitely their own affair. We should be aware of the different qualities
  - - <b>parisannuta</b> - - of different groups so we can pass among various communities in
  different countries without quarreling or disputing about any issue.</font></p>
