<blockquote>
    <p>There is a wide-spread belief, particularly in the West,
    that the ideal of the Theravada, which they conveniently
    identify with Hinayana, is to become an Arahant while that of
    the Mahayana is to become a Bodhisattva and finally to attain
    the state of a Buddha. It must be categorically stated that
    this is incorrect. This idea was spread by some early
    Orientalists at a time when Buddhist studies were beginning
    in the West, and the others who followed them accepted it
    without taking the trouble to go into the problem by
    examining the texts and living traditions in Buddhist
    countries. But the fact is that both the Theravada and the
    Mahayana unanimously accept the Bodhisattva ideal as the
    highest.</p>
    <p>The terms <b>Hinayana</b> (Small Vehicle) and <b>Mahayana</b>
    (Great Vehicle) are not known to the Theravada Pali
    literature. They are not found in the Pali Canon (Tripitaka)
    or in the Commentaries on the Tripitaka. Not even in the Pali
    Chronicles of Ceylon, the Dipavamsa and the Mahavamsa. The
    Dipavamsa (about the 4th Century A.D.) and Pali Commentaries
    mention Vitandavadins, evidently a sect of dissenting
    Buddhists holding some unorthodox views regarding some points
    in the teaching of the Buddha. The Vitandavadin and the
    Theravadin both quote the same authorities and name the
    sutras of the Tripitaka in order to support their positions,
    the difference being only in the mode of their
    interpretations. The <i>Mahavamsa </i>(5th Century A.D.) and
    a Commentary on the Abhidhamma refer to Vetulla - or
    Vetulyavadins (Sanskrit: Vaitulyavadin) instead of
    Vitandavadin. From the evidence of the texts, it may not be
    wrong to consider that these two terms - Vitanda and Vetulya
    - represented the same school or sect.</p>
    <p>We learn from the <i>Abhidhamma-Samuccaya,</i> an
    authoritative Mahayana philosophical text (4th Century A.D.)
    that the terms Vaitulya and Vaipulya are synonymous, and that
    Vaipulya is the <i>Bodhisattva-Pitaka.</i> Now, the <i>Bodhisattva-Pitaka
    </i>is definitely Mahayana. Hence Vaitulya undoubtedly
    denotes Mahayana.</p>
    <p>So we can be certain that the terms Vitanda, and Vetulya
    used in the Pali Chronicles and Commentaries refer to
    Mahayana. But the terms Hinayana and Mahayana were not known
    to them, or ignored or unrecognised by them.</p>
    <p>It is universally accepted by scholars that the terms
    Hinayana and Mahayana are later inventions. Historically
    speaking, the Theravada already existed long before these
    terms came into being. That Theravada, considered to be the
    original teaching of the Buddha, was introduced to Ceylon and
    established there in the 3rd Century B.C., during the time of
    Emperor Asoka of India. At that time there was nothing called
    Mahayana. Mahayana as such appeared much later, about the
    beginning of the Christian Era. Without Mahayana there could
    not be Hinayana. Buddhism that went to Sri Lanka, with its
    Tripitaka and Commentaries, in the 3rd Century B.C., remained
    there intact as Theravada, and did not come into the scene of
    the Hinayana-Mahayana dispute that developed later in India.
    It seems therefore not legitimate to include Theravada in
    either of these two categories.</p>
    <p>The Mahayana mainly deals with the Bodhisattva-yana or the
    Vehicle of the Bodhisattva. But it does not ignore the other
    two: Sravaka-yana and Pratyekabuddha-yana. For example,
    Asanga, the founder of the Yogacara system, in his <i>Magnum
    Opus,</i> the <i>Yogacara Bhumisastra, </i>devotes two
    sections to Sravaka-bhumi and Pratyekabuddha-bhumi to
    Bodhisattva-bhumi, which shows that all three yanas are given
    due consideration in the Mahayana. But the state of a Sravaka
    or a Pratyekabuddha is inferior to that of a Bodhisattva.
    This is quite in keeping with the Theravada tradition which,
    too, holds that one may become a Bodhisattva and attain the
    state of a fully Enlightened Buddha; but if one cannot, one
    may attain the state of a Pratyekabuddha or of a Sravaka
    according to one's capacity. These three states may be
    considered as three attainments on the same Path. In fact,
    the <i>Sandhinirmocana Sutra </i>(a Mahayana Sutra) clearly
    says that the Sravakayana and the Mahayana constitute one
    yana (ekayana) and that they are not two different and
    distinct 'vehicles'.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>The Three Individuals</b></font></p>
    <p>Now, who are these three individuals: Sravaka,
    Pratyekabuddha and Bodhisattva? Very briefly:</p>
    <p>- A <strong>Sravaka</strong> is a disciple of a Buddha. A
    disciple may be a monk or a nun, a layman or a laywoman. Bent
    on his or her liberation, a Sravaka follows and practises the
    reaching of the Buddha and finally attains Nirvana. He also
    serves others, but his capacity to do so is limited.</p>
    <p>- A <strong>Pratyekabuddha</strong> (Individual Buddha) is
    a person who realizes Nirvana alone by himself at a time when
    there is no Samyaksambuddha in the world. He also renders
    service to others, but in a limited way. He is not capable of
    revealing the Truth to others as a Samyaksambuddha, a fully
    Enlightened Buddha does.</p>
    <p>- A <strong>Bodhisattva</strong> is a person (monk or
    layman) who is in a position to attain Nirvana as a Sravaka
    or as a Pratyekabuddha, but out of great compassion <i>(maha
    karuna) </i>for the world, he renounces it and goes on
    suffering in samsara for the sake of others, perfects himself
    during an incalculable period of time and finally realizes
    Nirvana and becomes a Samyaksambuddha, a fully Enlightened
    Buddha. He discovers The Truth and declares it to the world.
    His capacity for service to others is unlimited.</p>
    <p>The definition of the three <i>Yanikas </i>(followers of
    the three yanas) given by Asanga is very instructive and
    clarifies some points. According to him, a Sravakayanika (one
    who takes the vehicle of disciples) is a person who, living
    according to the law of the disciples. By nature having
    feeble faculties (qualities), bent on his own liberation
    through the cultivation of detachment, depending on the Canon
    of the Disciples <i>(Sravaka-pitaka),</i> practising major
    and minor qualities, gradually puts an end to suffering. A <i>Pratyeka-Buddha-Yanika
    </i>(one who takes the Vehicle of the Individual Buddha) is a
    person who, lives according to the law of the Individual
    Buddha, By nature having medium faculties, bent on his
    liberation through the cultivation of detachment, he has the
    intention of attaining Enlightenment exclusively through his
    own mental development, depending on the Sravaka-pitaka,
    practising major and minor qualities, born at a time when
    there is no Buddha in the world and gradually puts an end to
    suffering. A <i>Mahayanika (one</i> who takes the Great
    Vehicle) is a person who, living according to the law of the
    Bodhisattvas, by nature having sharp faculties, bent on the
    liberation of all beings, depending on the Canon of the
    Bodhisattvas, matures other beings, cultivates the pure
    Buddha-domain, receives predictions or declarations <i>(Vya-Karana)
    </i>from Buddhas and finally realizes the perfect and
    complete Enlighten<i>ment (Samyaksambodhi).</i></p>
    <p>From this we can see that anyone who aspires to become a
    Buddha is a Bodhisattva, a Mahayanist, though he may live in
    a country or in a community popularly and traditionally
    regarded as Theravada or Hinayana. Similarly, a person who
    aspires to attain Nirvana as a disciple is a Sravakayanika or
    Hinayanist though he may belong to a country or a community
    considered as Mahayana. Thus it is wrong to believe that
    there are no Bodhisattvas in Theravada countries or that all
    are Bodhisattvas in Mahayana countries. It is not conceivable
    that Sravakas and Bodhisattvas are concentrated in separate
    geographical areas.</p>
    <p>Further, Asanga says that when a Bodhisattva finally
    attains Enlightenment <i>(Bodhi) </i>he becomes an Arahant, a
    Tathagata (i.e. Buddha). Here it must be clearly understood
    that not only a Sravaka (disciple) but also a Bodhisattva
    becomes an Arahant when finally he attains Buddhahood. The
    Theravada position is exactly the same: the Buddha is an
    Arahant <i>-Araham Samma-SamBuddha</i> - &quot;Arahant, Fully
    and Perfectly Enlightened Buddha.&quot;</p>
    <p>The Mahayana unequivocally says that a Buddha, a
    Pratyekabuddha and a Sravaka (disciple), all three are equal
    and alike with regard to their purification or liberation
    from defilements or impurities <i>(Klesavaranavisuddhi).</i></p>
    <p>This is also called <i>Vimukti-Kaya</i> (Liberation-body),
    and in it there is no difference between the three. That
    means that there are no three different Nirvanas or Vimuktis
    for three persons. Nirvana or Vimukti is the same for all.
    But only a Buddha achieves the complete liberation from all
    the obstructions to the knowable, i.e., obstructions to
    knowledge <i>(Jneyyavaranavisuddhi), </i>not the Sravakas and
    Pratyekabuddhas. This also is called <i>Dharma-Kaya </i>(Dharma-body),
    and it is in this and many other innumerable qualities,
    capacities and abilities that the Buddha becomes incomparable
    and superior to Sravakas and Pratyekabuddhas.</p>
    <p>This Mahayana view is quite in keeping with the Theravada
    Pali Tripitaka. In the <i>Samyutta-Nikaya</i> the Buddha says
    that the Tathagata (i.e. Buddha) and a bhikkhu (i.e. sravaka,
    disciple) liberated through wisdom are equal with regard to
    their <i>Vimutta</i> (liberation), but the Tathagatha is
    different and distinguished from the liberated bhikkhus in
    that he (Tathagata) discovers and shows the Path (Magga) that
    was not known before.</p>
    <p>These three states of the Sravaka, the Pratyekabuddha and
    the Buddha are mentioned in the <i>Nidhikanda Sutta </i>of
    the <i>Khuddakapatha, </i>the first book of the
    Khuddaka-nikaya, one of the five Collections of the Theravada
    Tripitaka. It says that by practising virtues such as
    charity, morality, self-restraint, etc., one may attain,
    among other things, &quot;the Perfection of the
    Disciple&quot; <i>(Savaka-Parami), </i>&quot;Enlightenment of
    the Pratyekabuddha&quot; <i>(Paccekabodhi) </i>and &quot;the
    Buddha-domain&quot; <i>(Buddhabhumi). </i>They are not called
    <i>Yanas </i>(vehicles).</p>
    <p>In the Theravada tradition these are known as <i>Bodhis, </i>but
    not <i>Yanas. </i>The <i>Upasaka-janalankara, </i>a Pali
    treatise dealing with the ethics for the lay Buddhist written
    in the 12th century by a Thera called Ananda in the Theravada
    tradition of the Mahavihara at Anuradhpura, Sri Lanka, says
    that there are three Bodhis: <i>Savakabodhi</i> <i>(Skt:
    Sravakabodhi), Paccekabodhi (Skt: Fratyekabodhi)</i> and <i>Sammasambodhi
    (Skt: Samyaksambodhi). </i>A whole chapter of this book is
    devoted to the discussion of these three <i>Bodhis </i>in
    great detail. It says further that when a disciple attains
    the <i>Bodhi </i>(Enlightenment), he is called <i>Savaka-Buddha
    (Skt: Sravaka-Buddha).</i></p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>The Bodhisattvas</b></font></p>
    <p>Just like the Mahayana, the Theravada holds the
    Bodhisattva in the highest position. The Commentary on the
    Jataka, in the tradition of the Mahavihara at Anuradhapura,
    provides a precise example: In the dim past, many
    incalculable aeons ago, Gotama the Buddha, during his career
    as Bodhisattva, was an ascetic named Sumedha. At that time
    there was a Buddha called Dipankara whom he met and at whose
    feet he had the capacity to realise Nirvana as a disciple <i>(Sravaka).
    </i>But Sumedha renounced it and resolved, out of great
    compassion for the world, to become a Buddha like Dipankara
    to save others. Then Dipankara Buddha declared and predicted
    that this great ascetic would one day become a Buddha and
    offered eight handfuls of flowers to Sumedha. Likewise,
    Dipankara Buddha's disciples who were with him and who were
    themselves Arahants offered flowers to the Bodhisattva. This
    story of Sumedha distinctly shows the position a Bodhisattva
    occupies in the Theravada.</p>
    <p>Although the Theravada holds that anybody can be a
    Bodhisattva, it does not stipulate or insist that all must be
    Bodhisattva which is considered not practical. The decision
    is left to the individual whether to take the Path of the
    Sravaka or of the Pratyekabuddha or of the Samyaksambuddha.
    But it is always clearly explained that the state of a
    Samyaksambuddha is superior and that the other two are
    inferior. Yet they are not disregarded.</p>
    <p>In the 12th Century AD., in Myanmar (a strictly Theravada
    country), King Alaungsithu of Pagan, after building Shwegugyi
    Temple, set up an inscription in Pali verse to record this
    act of piety in which he publicly declared his resolution to
    become a Buddha and not a Sravaka.</p>
    <p>In Sri Lanka, in the 10th Century, King Mahinda IV
    (956-972 AD.) in an inscription proclaimed that &quot;none
    but the Bodhisattvas would become kings of Sri Lanka
    (Ceylon)&quot;. Thus it was believed that kings of Sri Lanka
    were Bodhisattvas.</p>
    <p>A Thera named Maha-Tipitaka Culabhaya who wrote the <i>Milinda-Tika
    </i>(about the 12th Century AD.) in the Theravada tradition
    of the Mahavihara at Anuradhapura, says at the end of the
    book in the colophon that he aspires to become a Buddha: <i>Buddho
    Bhaveyyam </i>&quot;May I become a Buddha,&quot; which means
    that this author is a Bodhisattva.</p>
    <p>We come across at the end of some palm leaf manuscripts of
    Buddhist texts in Sri Lanka the names of even a few copyists
    who have recorded their wish to become Buddhas, and they too
    are to be considered as Bodhisattvas. At the end of a
    religious ceremony or an act of piety, the bhikkhu who gives
    benedictions, usually admonishes the congregation to make a
    resolution to attain Nirvana by realising one of the three <i>Bodhis
    - </i>Sravakabodhi, Pratyekabodhi or Samyaksambodhi - as they
    wish according to their capacity.</p>
    <p>There are many Buddhists, both bhikkhus and laymen, in Sri
    Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia which are regarded as
    Theravada countries, who take the vow or resolution to become
    Buddhas to save others. They are indeed Bodhisattvas at
    different levels of development. Thus one may see that in
    Theravada countries all are not Sravakas. There are
    Bodhisattvas as well.</p>
    <p>There is a significant difference between the Theravada
    and the Mahayana with regard to the Bodhisattva ideal. The
    Theravada, although it holds the Bodhisattva ideal as the
    highest and the noblest, does not provide a separate
    literature devoted to the subject. The teachings about the
    Bodhisattva ideal and the Bodhisattva career are to be found
    scattered in their due places in Pali literature. The
    Mahayana by definition is dedicated to the Bodhisattva ideal,
    and they have not only produced a remarkable literature on
    the subject but also created a fascinating class of mythical
    Bodhisattvas.</p>
