<h1>Deliverance From Suffering Through Non-Grasping</h1>
<h2><i>by Lieu Phap</i></h2>

<blockquote>
Everything in the entire Buddhist Scriptures is really an expansion
of the Four Noble Truths:
<P>
1) suffering exists <BR>
2) the cause of suffering is craving, hatred and ignorance <BR>
3) there is a cure for suffering, and <BR>
4) there is a path to end suffering. 
<P>
Also important are the teachings of the law of causality (causes
and effects), impermanence (thingschange constantly...) and selflessness
(nothing has a unique self). The law of kamma (in Pali, karma
in Sanskrit) should not be understood merely as &quot; doing good
produces good; doing evil produces evil &quot;, concepts found
in most religions. Buddhism's primary teaching is that  &quot;kamma
ceases with the ceasing of craving, hatred and ignorance&quot;
which means that all past, present and future kamma, desirable
as well as undesirable kamma, cease when a being puts an end to
craving, hatred and ignorance. 
<P>
The most important Noble Truth is the fourth one which teaches
that the extinction of suffering is achieved by following The
Eightfold Path. The Eightfold Path consists of three major factors
of practice: Morality (Right Speech, Action, Livelihood), Concentration
(Right Effort, Mindfulness, Concentration) and Insight (Right
Understanding, Thought). 
<P>
To succeed in the practice of Buddhism, practitioners must keep
the basic concept of non-grasping and non-clinging in mind at
all times and reflect it in their every day actions. 
The teachings mentioned above can help us end suffering just as
medicine can end illness. Although we don't usually know what
a medecine consists of, by following the instructions, we can
see it cures the illness. It doesn't  matter if we know if a concept
is true or false. Many westerners and orientals who consider themselves
modern, expect concepts to be proven true or false scientifically.
Buddhist teachings  are not against science. Many scientific discoveries
of the last half century were in fact taught by Buddha 2500 years
ago.
<P>
For example, Buddha taught that we should not automatically believe
the Tipitaka or the Buddhist canon, nor rely on the people, text
books or the majority opinion, but should believe what we find
out for ourselves. The key is to understand and understanding
comes from experience. Wanting to understand the Buddha teachings
without practicing them is like wanting to taste food without
eating it but just hearing it described by someone or in books! 
<P>
We all experience suffering and want to end it, however most of
us want to  see proof of the of the Concepts of Buddhism  or to
discuss them in stead of seriously practicing. Many people  explain
Buddha's teachings in a way it suits their conception of reality,
rather than the other way around. Modernizing Buddhism try to
make the reality of life around them suit their conceptions, rather
the other way around. Modernizing Buddhism may be helpful for
people today, however we should be extremely careful, not to depart
from the essence of Buddhism. The loving kindness practice in
Buddhism fosters helping others and public benefits, but ego can
easily become involved in power struggles in the name of ideology!
<P>
Sometimes we don't know if we are able of overcoming the attraction
of sensual or worldly pleasures. We have seen monks attemting
to propagate their political ideas in the temple, on Sunday mornings,
after the rituals, instead of giving Dhamma talks. These monks
and their followers like to talk about politics, how to save the
country from a certain regime or how to fight the other side !
Taking sides does not fit in to any Buddhist practice. Such speeches
should not take place in the main hall of a Buddhist temple. Accoding
to the proper character of a Buddhist monk, as described in the
sutta &quot;hat is a Bikkhu?&quot;, speeches may not promote hatred,
contradicting the basic objective of all practitioners, that is
to end craving, hatred and ignorance.
<P>
The Eightfold Path is also called the middle path or the moderation
way since it lies in between the path of sensual indulgence and
self-mortification. In general, Buddhism is also considered as
the middle path because it is in between the two extremes of truth
and falsehood. Buddha was not interested in true or false, real
or unreal. He was interested in  how and why things appear to
be real. When we see how things arise, we believe that they are
real. But when we see that they pass away, then we don't believe
that they are real. The Buddhist psychology states that any arising
is conditioned, that all phenomena experience dependent origination
and dependent extinction. All phenomena are real only in the relative
sense. However, in the absolute sense, nothing  is real. When
one has insight, one sees the world as it is, not the way it seems.
Looking at a flower, one can see in the same time the sun that
warms it, the cloud that feeds it, and the hands that pruned it.
This would be in depth perception. However, to penetrate an object
or a phenomena, to really see it, our insight needs to be developed
through the mindfulness practice.
<P>
The Buddhist psychology is called ABHIDHAMMA which analyses the
relationship between (rupa) and mind (nama), and explains all
the mental formations, the development of the mind and its interaction
with the body as well as the dependent origination of all phenomena.
Abhidhamma helps people to liberate  themselves from suffering
and is considered as greater than the Sutta (Discourses ) and
the Vinaya (Discipline ). Through the  practice of The Noble Eightfold
Path, people  experience the relation between mind and matter
and the law of causality  to finally develop the Insight.
<P>
 Efforts to develop Insight through theoretical explanations are
 useless. &quot;Insight that can be spoken is not real insight&quot;.
 Insight cannot be practiced, it either arises or does not arise
&quot;, meaning that insight reveals itself when it is freed from
ignorance. We should not have expectations from our practice;
expectation of any kind is also greed and hinders our progress.
Suffering, like any other illnesses of people, needs a way to
end it and this way is usually communicated by words. However
we must always remember that words are used to describe other
words as &quot;one thorn may be used to remove another thorn in
the flesh&quot;, just as another means to accomplish something,
we should not be attached or hung up on words.
<P>
We assume that our mind automatically grasps reality but don't
know  how artfully the mind works and, therefore, we live in delusion
and suffering. The mind must be developed. The Buddhist teachings
show how to liberate the mind from ignorance and obtain wisdom
or insight. Wisdom implies a mind with equanimity, free of mental
defilements, not influenced by worldly pleasures or suffering,
a mind detached from the past and the future, a calm and collected
mind that experiences that the reality of all phenomena is in
its impermanence and selflessness.
<P>
To gain this Wisdom, we learn to understand Buddha teaching (Dhamma
) and more importantly, to practice the Eightfold Path. Concentration
(meditation practice ) is very important. The Buddhist verses
on the Four Foundations of Mindfulness (Satipatthana sutta) explain
how to contemplate on the four meditation objects (mind, mind
object, body and feeling), and show how to observe and note  the
phenomena  as they arise without any attachment to them. The goal
is to practice  non grasping  in our daily life. Through mindfulness
we have to give up things we are attached to.
<P>
Meditation is bacically letting go. In meditation, we observe
everything which comes to our six senses without  reacting; we
give up the sound coming to our ears, the itching sensation on
our body, the bubble of anger, hatred or craving arising in our
mind; just noting the arising, progressing and falling of the
phenomenon without and clinging on to it. We then reach a  state
of concentration where the mind starts seeing  the true nature
of things, understanding the selflessness (anatta), and experiencing
the five aggregates as impermanent and continually flowing and
changing (anicca).
<P>
The practice of morality, concentration and insight outlined in
the Noble Eightfold Path is referred as walking the ordinary path.
The Buddha also taught a short cut: do not grasp at the urges
of the six senses, but constantly watch all phenomena without
attachment. When we finally see that there is no self, the entire
eight factors of the Eightfold Path arise simultaneously. Buddha
taught of the emptiness of essential nature (sunnata): nothing
that exists has a self. Because of misconception of that we have
a self, we cling to our desires, and by doing so, we create suffering
for ourselves. The ultimate aim is to cling to no thing at all.
Gradually we can see that less detachment reduces suffering. This
theory seems simple, however  practice requires  patience and
determination, it would go from gross to very fine form. We must
give up what we have been attached to, such as material, objects,
power, sensual pleasures, affection, love, our concepts, the things
we value most... 
<P>
Buddha teaching offers  a raft which takes us across the river
to  real happiness. As a way of life, Buddhism is neither pessimistic
nor optimistic, it teaches us  to see clearly for ourselves, through
practice, not just talking about practice. Once we reach the other
side, we don't need to carry the raft along with us. The Dhamma,
the process of meditation, the precepts would not be necessary
at all if we could let go all attachments. Buddha taught the basic
practice: &quot; Nothing whatsoever should be grasped or clung
to &quot;. This practice leads to  deliverance from suffering,
the unique goal of a Buddhist.
