    <p align="left"><font color="#000080"><b>SEEKING HAPPINESS</b></font></p>
    <p align="left">It is a truism to say that nobody likes
    suffering and everybody seeks happiness. In this world of
    ours, human beings are making all possible efforts for
    prevention and alleviation of suffering and enjoyment of
    happiness. Nevertheless, their efforts are mainly directed to
    the physical well-being by material means. Happiness is,
    after all, conditioned by attitudes of mind, and yet only a
    few persons give real thought to mental development; fewer
    still practice mind-training in earnest.</p>
    <p>To illustrate this point, attention may be drawn to the
    commonplace habits of cleaning and tidying up one's body; the
    endless pursuits of food, clothing, and shelter; and the
    tremendous technological progress achieved for raising the
    material standard of living, for improving the means of
    transport and communications, and for prevention and cure of
    diseases and ailments. All these strivings are, in the main,
    concerned with the care and nourishment of the body. It must
    be recognized that they are essential. However, these human
    efforts and achievements cannot possibly bring about the
    alleviation or eradication of suffering associated with old
    age and disease, domestic infelicity and economic troubles;
    in short, with non-satisfaction of wants and desires.
    Sufferings of this nature are not overcome by material means;
    they can be overcome only by mind-training and mental
    development.</p>
    <p>Therefore, it becomes clear that the right way must be
    sought for training, stabilizing, and purifying the mind.
    This way is found in the Maha Satipatthana Sutta, a
    well-known discourse of the Buddha, delivered well over
    twenty-five hundred years ago. The Buddha declared thus:</p>
    <p>&nbsp; This is the sole way for the purification of
    beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the
    destroying of pain and grief; for reaching the right path,
    for the realization of Nirvana, namely the Four Foundations
    of Mindfulness.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#000080"><strong>BASIC PRACTICE</strong></font></p>
    <p><strong>Preparatory Stage:</strong> If you sincerely
    desire to develop contemplation and attain insight in this
    your present life, you must give up worldly thoughts and
    actions during training This course of action is for the
    purification of conduct, the essential preliminary step
    toward the proper development of contemplation. You must also
    observe the rules of discipline prescribed for laymen (or for
    monks, as the case may be), for they are important in gaining
    insight. For layfolk, these rules comprise the eight precepts
    which Buddhist devotees observe on holidays and during
    periods of meditation. These voluntary precepts are
    abstention from:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>(1) killing, <br>
        (2) stealing, <br>
        (3) sexual intercourse, <br>
        (4) Lying, <br>
        (5) intoxicants, <br>
        (6) eating solid foods after noon, <br>
        (7) dance, shows, wearing flowers, perfume, and
        adornments, and <br>
        (8) high and luxurious beds. <br>
        An additional rule is not to speak with contempt, in
        jest, or malice to or about any of the noble ones who
        have attained states of enlightenment.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The old masters of Buddhist tradition suggest that you
    entrust yourself to the enlightened one, the Buddha, during
    the training period, for you may be alarmed if it happens
    that your own state of mind produces unwholesome or
    frightening visions during contemplation. Also place yourself
    under the guidance of your meditation instructor, for he can
    talk to you frankly about your work in contemplation and give
    you the guidance he thinks necessary.</p>
    <p>The aim of this practice and its greatest benefit is
    release. from greed, hatred, and delusion, which are the
    roots of all-evil and suffering. This intensive course in
    insight training can lead you to such release. So work
    ardently with this end in view so that your training will be
    successfully completed. This kind of training in
    contemplation, based on the foundations of mindfulness
    (satipatthana), is that taken by all Buddha and noble ones,
    for attaining enlightenment. You are to be congratulated on
    having the opportunity to take the same kind of training.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#000080"><strong>BEFORE YOU
    MEDITATE</strong></font></p>
    <p>It is also important for you to begin your training with a
    brief contemplation on the 'four protections' which the
    Buddha offers you for reflection. It is helpful for your
    psychological welfare at this stage to reflect on them. The
    subjects of these four protective reflections are the Buddha
    himself, loving-kindness, the loathsome aspects of the body,
    and death.</p>
    <p><strong>First</strong>, devote yourself to the Buddha by
    sincerely appreciating his nine chief qualities in this way:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><em><strong>-- Truly, the Buddha is holy, fully
        enlightened, perfect in knowledge and conduct, a welfare,
        world-knower, the incomparable leader of men to be tamed,
        teacher of gods and mankind, the awakened and exalted
        One.</strong></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>Second</strong>, reflect upon all sentient beings
    as the receivers of your loving-kindness, be fortified by
    your thoughts of loving-kindness and identify yourself with
    all sentient beings without distinction, thus:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><em><strong>-- May I be free from enmity, disease and
        grief .... As I am, so also may my parents, preceptors,
        and teachers, intimate, unknown, indeed all other beings
        be free from enmity, disease, and grief. May they be
        released from suffering.</strong></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>Third</strong>, reflect upon the repulsive nature
    of the body to assist you in diminishing the unwholesome
    attachment that so many people have for the body. Dwell upon
    some of its impurities, such as stomach, intestines, phlegm,
    pus, and blood. Ponder these impurities so that the absurd
    fondness of the body may be eliminated.</p>
    <p>The <strong>fourth protection</strong> for your
    psychological benefit is to reflect on the phenomenon of
    ever-approaching death. Buddhist teaching stress that life is
    uncertain but death is certain, life is precarious but death
    is sure. Life has death as its goal. There is birth, disease,
    suffering, old age, and eventual death. These are all aspects
    of the process of existence.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#000080"><strong>HOW TO SIT</strong></font></p>
    <p>&nbsp; To begin training, take the sitting posture, and
    sit erect with legs crossed. You might feel more comfortable
    if the legs are not interlocked but evenly placed on the
    ground, without pressing one against the other. Have your
    meditation teacher explain the sitting posture in detail. If
    you find that sitting on the floor interferes with
    contemplation, then obtain a more comfortable way of sitting.
    Now proceed with each exercise in contemplation as described.
    </p>
    <p><em><strong>Basic Exercise I:</strong></em> Try to keep
    your mind (but not your eyes) on the abdomen. You will
    thereby come to know the movements of rising and falling, the
    expansion and contraction of this organ. If these movements
    are not clear to you in the beginning, then place both hands
    on the abdomen to feel these rising and falling movements.
    After a short time the outward movement of inhalation and the
    inward movement of exhalation will become clear. Then make a
    mental note, rising for the outward movement, falling for the
    inward movement. Your mental note of each movement must be
    made while it occurs. From this exercise you learn the actual
    manner of the movements of the abdomen. You are not concerned
    with the form of the abdomen. What you actually perceive is
    the bodily sensation of pressure caused by the heaving
    movement of the abdomen. So do not dwell on the form of the
    abdomen but proceed with the exercise.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#000080"><strong>DIFFICULTIES
    FOR BEGINNERS</strong></font></p>
    <p>&nbsp; For the beginner it is a very effective method of
    developing the facilities of attention, concentration of mind
    and insight in contemplation. As practice increases, the
    manner of movement will be clearer. The ability to know each
    successive occurrence of the mental and physical processes at
    each of the six sense-organs is acquired only when insight
    contemplation is fully developed. Since you are a beginner
    whose attentiveness and power of concentration are still
    weak, you may find it difficult to keep the mind on each
    successive rising movement and falling movement as it occurs.
    In view of this difficulty, you may be inclined to think:
    &quot;I just don't know how to keep my mind on each of these
    movements.&quot; Then simply remember that this is a learning
    process. The rising and falling movements of the abdomen are
    always present, and therefore there is no need to look for
    them. Actually with practice it becomes easy for a beginner
    to keep his mind on these two simple movements. Continue with
    this exercise in full awareness of the abdomen's rising and
    falling movements. Never verbally repeat the words rising,
    falling, although you may make a mental note rising and
    falling in the mind silently as they occur. Be clearly aware
    only of the actual process of the rising and falling movement
    of the abdomen. </p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#000080"><strong>BREATHING
    MANNERS</strong></font></p>
    <p>&nbsp; Avoid deep or rapid breathing for the purpose of
    making the abdominal movements more distinct, because this
    procedure causes fatigue that interferes with the practice.
    Just be totally aware of the movements of rising and falling
    as they occur in the course of normal breathing. </p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#000080"><strong>HOW TO REACT TO
    THE WONDERING MIND</strong></font></p>
    <p>While occupied with the exercise of observing each of the
    abdominal movements, other mental activities may occur
    between the noting of each rising and falling. Thoughts or
    other mental functions, such as intentions, ideas,
    imaginings, etc., are likely to occur between each mental
    note of rising and falling. They cannot be disregarded. A
    mental note must be made of each as it occurs.</p>
    <p>&nbsp; If you imagine something, you must know that you
    have done so and make a mental note imagining. If you simply
    think of something, mentally note thinking. If you reflect,
    reflecting. If you intend to do something, intending. When
    the mind wanders from the object of meditation, which is the
    rising and falling of the abdomen, mentally note wandering.
    Should you imagine you are going to a certain place, mentally
    note going. When you arrive, arriving. When, in your
    thoughts, you meet a person, note meeting. Should you speak
    to him or her, note speaking. If you imaginatively argue with
    that person, arguing. If you envision and imagine a light or
    color, be sure to note seeing. A mental vision must be noted
    on each occurrence of its appearance until it passes away.
    After its disappearance, continue with <em><strong>Basic
    Exercise I</strong></em> by being fully aware of each
    movement of the rising and falling abdomen. Proceed
    carefully, without slackening. If you intend to swallow
    saliva while thus engaged, make a mental note intending.
    While in the act of swallowing, swallowing. If you intend to
    spit, spitting. Then return to the exercise of rising and
    falling. Suppose you intend to bend the neck, intending. In
    the act of bending, bending. When you intend to straighten
    the neck, intending. In the act of straightening the neck,
    straightening. The neck movements of bending and
    straightening must be done slowly. After mentally making a
    note of each of these actions, proceed in full awareness with
    noticing the movements of the rising and falling abdomen.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#000080"><strong>HOW TO REACT TO
    THE PAINFUL SENSATION</strong></font></p>
    <p>Since you must continue contemplating for a long time
    while in one position, that of sitting or lying down, you are
    likely to experience an intense feeling of fatigue, stiffness
    in the body or in the arms and legs. Should this happen,
    simply keep the knowing mind on that part of the body where
    such feeling occurs and carry on the contemplation, noting
    tired or stiff. Do this naturally, that is, neither too fast
    nor too slow. These feelings gradually become fainter and
    finally cease altogether. Should one of these feelings become
    more intense until the bodily fatigue or stiffness of joints
    is unbearable, then change your position. However, do not
    forget to make a mental note of intending, before you proceed
    to change position. Each detailed movement must be
    contemplated in its respective order.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#000080"><strong>YOU MAY CHANGE
    THE BODY POSITION, BUT....</strong></font></p>
    <p>If you intend to lift the hand or leg, make a mental note,
    intending. In the act of lifting the hand or leg, lifting.
    Stretching either the hand or leg, stretching. When you bend,
    bending. When putting down, putting. Should either the hand
    or leg touch, touching. Perform all these actions in a slow,
    deliberate manner. As soon as you are settled in the new
    position, continue with the contemplation of the abdominal
    movements. If you become uncomfortably warm in the new
    position, resume contemplation in another position keeping to
    the procedure as described in this paragraph.</p>
    <p>&nbsp; Should an itching sensation be felt in any part of
    the body, keep the mind on that part and make a mental note,
    itching. Do this in a regulated manner, neither too fast nor
    too slow. When the itching sensation disappears in the course
    of full awareness, continue with the exercise of noticing the
    rising and falling of the abdomen. Should the itching
    continue and become too strong and you intend to rub the
    itching part, be sure to make a mental note, intending.
    Slowly lift the hand, simultaneously noting the action of
    lifting, and touching when the hand touches the part that
    itches. Rub slowly in complete awareness of rubbing. When the
    itching sensation has disappeared and you intend to
    discontinue the rubbing, be mindful by making the usual
    mental note of the action, withdrawing. When the hand rests
    in its usual place touching the leg, touching. Then again
    devote your time to observing the abdominal movements.</p>
    <p>&nbsp; If there is pain or discomfort, keep the knowing
    mind on that part of the body where the sensation arises.
    Make a mental note of the specific sensation as it occurs,
    such as painful, aching, pressing, piercing, tired, giddy. It
    must be stressed that the mental note must not be forced nor
    delayed but made in a calm and natural manner. The pain may
    eventually cease or increase. Do not be alarmed if it
    increases. Firmly continue the contemplation. If you do so,
    you will find that the pain will almost always cease. But if,
    after a time, the pain has increased and becomes almost
    unbearable, you must ignore the pain and continue with the
    contemplation of rising and falling.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#000080"><strong>PAIN MAY
    DISCOURAGE MEDITATING</strong></font></p>
    <p>As you progress in mindfulness you may experience
    sensations of intense pain: stifling or choking sensations
    such as pain from the slash of a knife, the thrust of a
    sharp-pointed instrument, unpleasant sensations of being
    pricked by sharp needles, or small insects crawling over the
    body. You might experience sensations of itching, biting,
    intense cold. As soon as you discontinue the contemplation
    you may also feel that these painful sensations cease. When
    you resume contemplation you will have them again as soon as
    you gain in mindfulness. These painful sensations are not to
    be considered as something serious. They are not
    manifestations of disease but are common factors always
    present in the body and are usually obscured when the mind is
    normally occupied with more conspicuous objects. When the
    mental faculties become keener you are more aware of these
    sensations. With the continued development of contemplation
    the time will arrive when you can overcome them and they
    cease altogether. If you continue contemplation, firm in
    purpose, you will not come to any harm. Should you lose
    courage, become irresolute in contemplation, and discontinue
    for a time, you may encounter these unpleasant sensations
    again and again as your contemplation proceeds. If you
    continue with determination you will most likely overcome
    these painful sensations and may never again experience them
    in the course of contemplation.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#000080"><strong>HOW TO REACT
    SWAYING</strong></font></p>
    <p>Should you intend to sway the body, then knowingly note
    intending. While in the act of swaying,swaying. When
    contemplating you may occasionally discover the body swaying
    back and forth. Do not be alarmed; neither be pleased nor
    wish to continue to sway. The swaying will cease if you keep
    the knowing mind on the action of swaying and continue to
    note swaying until the action ceases. If swaying increases in
    spite of your making a mental note of it, then lean against a
    wall or post or lie down for a while. Thereafter proceed with
    contemplation. Follow the same procedure if you find yourself
    shaking or trembling. When contemplation is developed you may
    sometimes feel a thrill or chill pass through the back or the
    entire body. This is a symptom of the feeling of intense
    interest, enthusiasm, or rapture. It occurs naturally in the
    course of good contemplation. When your mind is fixed in
    contemplation you may be startled at the slightest sound.
    This takes place because you feel more intensely the effect
    of censorial impression while in the state of good
    concentration.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#000080"><strong>HOW TO REACT
    FEELING</strong></font></p>
    <p>If you are thirsty while contemplating, notice the
    feeling, thirsty. When you intend to stand, intending. Then
    make a mental note of each movement in preparation for
    standing. Keep the mind intently on the act of standing up,
    and mentally note, standing. When you look forward after
    standing up straight, note looking, seeing. Should you intend
    to walk forward, intending. When you begin to step forward,
    mentally note each step as walking, walking or left, right.
    It is important for you to be aware of every moment in each
    step from beginning to end when you walk. Adhere to the same
    procedure when strolling or when taking a walking exercise.
    Try to make a mental note of each step in two sections as
    follows: lifting, putting; lifting, putting. When you have
    obtained sufficient practice in this manner of walking, then
    try to make a mental note of each step in three sections:
    lifting, moving, placing: or up, forward, down.</p>
    <p>When you look at the water faucet, or water pot, on
    arriving at the place where you are to take a drink, be sure
    to make a mental note looking, seeing.</p>
    <p>When you stop walking, stopping.<br>
    When you stretch the hand, stretching.<br>
    When the hand touches the cup, touching.<br>
    When the hand takes the cup, taking.<br>
    When the hand dips the cup into the water, dipping.<br>
    When the hand brings the cup to the lips, bringing.<br>
    When the cup touches the lips, touching.<br>
    Should you feel cold at the touch, cold.<br>
    When you swallow, swallowing.<br>
    When returning the cup, returning.<br>
    Withdrawing the hand, withdrawing.<br>
    When you bring down your hand, bringing.<br>
    When the hand touches the side of the body, touching.<br>
    If you intend to turn back, intending.<br>
    When you turn around, turning.<br>
    When you walk forward, walking.<br>
    On arriving at the place where you intend to stop, intending.<br>
    When you stop, stopping.<br>
    <br>
    If you remain standing for some time continue the
    contemplation of rising and falling. But if you intend to sit
    down, intending. When you go forward to sit down, walking. On
    arriving at the place where you will sit, arriving. When you
    turn to sit, turning. While in the act of sitting, sitting.
    Sit down slowly, and keep the mind on the downward movement
    of the body. You must notice every movement in bringing hands
    and legs into position. Then resume the prescribed exercise
    of contemplating the abdominal movements.</p>
    <p>Should you intend to lie down, intending. Then proceed
    with the contemplation of every movement in the course of
    lying down: lifting, stretching, leaving, touching, and
    lying. Then make as the object of contemplation every
    movement in bringing hands, legs, and body into position.
    Perform these actions slowly. Thereafter continue with rising
    and falling. Should pain, fatigue, itching, or any other
    sensation be felt, be sure to notice each of these
    sensations. Notice all feelings, thoughts, ideas,
    considerations, reflections, and all movements of hands,
    legs, arms, and body. If there is nothing in particular to
    note, put the mind on the rising and falling of the abdomen.
    Make a mental note of drowsy, when drowsy, and sleepy, when
    sleepy. After you have gained sufficient concentration in
    contemplating you will be able to overcome drowsiness and
    sleepiness and feel refreshed as a result. Take up again the
    usual contemplation of the basic object. Suppose you are
    unable to overcome a drowsy feeling, you must then continue
    to contemplate until you fall asleep.</p>
    <p>The state of sleep is the continuity of subconsciousness.
    It is similar to the first state of rebirth consciousness and
    the last state of consciousness at the moment of death. This
    state of consciousness is feeble and therefore unable to be
    aware of an object. When you are awake the continuity of
    subconsciousness occurs regularly between moments of seeing,
    hearing, tasting, smelling, touching, and thinking. Because
    these occurrences are of brief duration they are usually not
    clear and therefore not noticeable. Continuity of
    subconsciousness remains during sleep&#151;a fact, which
    becomes obvious when you wake up; for it is in the state of
    wakefulness that thoughts and dense objects become distinct.</p>
    <p>Contemplation should start at the moment you wake up.
    Since you are a beginner, it may not yet be possible for you
    to start contemplating at the very first moment of
    wakefulness. But you should start with it from the moment
    when you remember that you are to contemplate. For example,
    if on awakening you reflect on something, you should become
    aware of the fact and begin your contemplation by a mental
    note, reflecting. Then proceed with the contemplation of
    rising and falling. When getting up from the bed, mindfulness
    should be directed to every detail of the body's activity.
    Each movement of the hands, legs, and body must be performed
    in complete awareness. Are you thinking of the time of the
    day when awakening? If so, note thinking. Do you intend to
    get out of bed? If so, note intending. If you prepare to move
    the body into position for rising, note preparing. As you
    slowly rise, rising. When you are in the sitting position,
    sitting. Should you remain sitting for any length of time,
    revert to contemplating the abdominal movements of rising and
    falling. Perform the acts of washing the face or taking a
    bath in their order and in complete awareness of every
    detailed movement; for instance, looking, seeing, stretching,
    holding, touching, feeling cold, rubbing. In the acts of
    dressing, making the bed, opening and closing doors and
    windows, handling objects, be occupied with every detail of
    these actions in their order.</p>
    <p>You must attend to the contemplation of every detail in
    the action of eating:</p>
    <p>When you look at the food, looking, seeing.<br>
    When you arrange the food, arranging.<br>
    When you bring the food to mouth, bringing.<br>
    When you bend the neck forward, bending.<br>
    When the food touches the mouth, touching.<br>
    When placing the food in the mouth, placing.<br>
    When the mouth closes, closing.<br>
    When withdrawing the hand, withdrawing.<br>
    Should the hand touch the plate, touching.<br>
    When straightening the neck, straightening.<br>
    When in the act of chewing, chewing.<br>
    When you are aware of the taste, tasting.<br>
    When swallowing the food, swallowing.<br>
    Should, while swallowing, the food be felt touching the sides
    of the gullet, touching.</p>
    <p>Perform contemplation in this manner each time you partake
    of a morsel of food until you finish the meal. In the
    beginning of the practice there will be many omissions. Never
    mind. Do not waver in your effort. You will make fewer
    omissions if you persist in your practice. When you reach an
    advanced stage of the practice, you will also be able to
    notice more details than those mentioned here.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#000080"><strong>WALKING
    MEDITATION</strong></font></p>
    <p>Between sessions of the sitting practice that may last
    from forty to ninety minutes you can alternate with a walking
    meditation. This will help serve to balance the factors of
    concentration and energy and overcome sleepiness. On a quiet
    stretch of ground or in a room you can do this practice. It
    is best for this exercise if you walk deliberately much
    slower than usual. Something about the speed of a good slow
    march is ideal, but nevertheless you should walk in as simple
    and natural a manner as speed allows. During this walking
    exercise, you should focus attention on the movement of the
    feet and legs. You should note as the right foot begins to
    rise from the ground, lifting; as it moves forward, moving;
    and as it places again on the ground, placing. Similarly for
    the left foot, and so on. </p>
    <p>In exactly the same manner as during the sitting breathing
    practice, all distracting thoughts or sensations should be
    noted in the opposite manner. If you happen to look up at
    something while ' walking, you should immediately register
    looking and revert to the movement of the feet. Looking about
    and noticing the details of objects, even those on your path
    is not a part of the practice. If you inadvertently do, then
    note looking.</p>
    <p>On reaching the end of the path the need will arise to
    turn and walk in the opposite direction. You will become
    aware of this fact a pace or two before reaching the end.
    This intention to turn should be noted as intending.
    Intention may be hard to note at first but if concentration
    is strong, it will be seen. After noting the intention to
    turn, note all other details of the thoughts and movements
    involved in the turn. As the last step forward is taken and
    you begin actually to turn the body, you should note turning,
    as the other foot raises, lifting, turning, placing, and so
    on. Then as you step out again on the return path, lifting,
    moving, placing. There is often a temptation on coming to the
    end of your &#145;tether&#146; to look up and glance around
    for something interesting. If this undisciplined impulse
    occurs it should be noted as intending, and the attention can
    revert naturally to the movement of the feet again.</p>
    <p>It is normally best for beginners to develop this walking
    exercise with a three-stage noting technique as indicated.
    Lifting, moving, placing. Depending on your capacity, your
    instructor may recommend either fewer or more stages to
    register. At times walking too slowly is inconvenient,
    especially outside of your meditation surroundings, so a
    simple left, right, left, right, will suffice for these
    cases. The important point is not how many or how few points
    of noting you make, but whether you are really aware of them
    as they occur, or whether your mind is off 'woof gathering'.
    Advancement in Contemplation After having practiced for a
    while, you may find your contemplation considerably improved
    and that you are able to prolong the basic exercise of
    noticing the abdominal rising and falling. At this time you
    will notice that there is generally a break between the
    movements of rising and falling. If you are in the sitting
    posture fill in the pause with a mental note on the act of
    sitting, in this way: rising, falling, and sitting. When you
    make a mental note of sitting, keep your mind on the erect
    position of the upper body. When you are lying down you
    should proceed with full awareness as follows: rising,
    falling, and lying. If you find this easy, continue with
    noticing these three sections. Should you notice that a pause
    occurs at the end of the rising as well as the falling
    movement, then continue in this manner: rising, sitting,
    falling, and sitting. Or when lying down: rising, lying,
    falling, and lying. Suppose you no longer find it easy to
    make a mental note of three or four objects in the above
    manner. Then revert to the initial procedure of noting only
    the two sections, rising and falling.</p>
    <p>While engaged in the regular practice of contemplating
    bodily movements you need not be concerned with objects of
    seeing and hearing. As long as you are able to keep your mind
    on the abdominal movements of rising and falling it is
    assumed that the purpose of noticing the acts and objects of
    seeing and hearing is also served. However, you may
    intentionally look at an object, then simultaneously make a
    mental note, two or three times, seeing. Thereafter return to
    the awareness of the abdominal movements. Suppose some person
    comes into your view, make a mental note of seeing, two or
    three times, and then resume attention to the rising and
    falling movements of the abdomen. Did you happen to hear the
    sound of a voice? Did you listen to it? If so make the mental
    note of hearing, listening while it is happening, and having
    done so, revert to rising and falling. But suppose you heard
    loud sounds, such as the barking of dogs, loud talking, or
    singing. If so, immediately make a mental note two or three
    times, hearing. Then return to your basic exercise of
    attending to rising and falling. If you fail to note and
    dismiss such distinctive sights and sounds as they occur, you
    may inadvertently fall into reflections about them instead of
    proceeding with intense attention to rising and falling,
    which may then become less distinct and clear. It is by such
    weakened attention that mind-defiling passions breed and
    multiply. If such reflections do occur, make two or three
    times the mental note, reflecting, and again take up the
    contemplation of rising and falling. Should you forget to
    make a mental note of body, leg, or arm movements, then
    mentally note forgetting, and resume your usual contemplation
    of the abdominal movements. You may feel at times that
    breathing is slow or that the rising and falling movements of
    the abdomen are not clearly perceived. When this happens, and
    you are in the sitting position, simply carry on the
    attention to sitting, touching; if you are lying down, lying,
    touching. While contemplating touching, your mind should not
    be kept on the same part of the body, but on different parts
    successively. There are several places of touch, and at least
    six or seven should be contemplated. Some of these points are
    where the thigh and knee touch, or the hands are placed
    together, or finger to finger, thumb to thumb, closing of the
    eyelids, tongue inside the mouth, or lips touching together. </p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#000080"><strong>HOW TO COPE
    WITH LAZINESS</strong></font></p>
    <p>Up to this point you have devoted quite some time to the
    training course. You might begin to feel lazy after deciding
    that you have made inadequate progress. By no means give up.
    Simply note the fact, lazy. Before you gain sufficient
    strength in attention, concentration, and insight, you may
    doubt the correctness or usefulness of this method of
    training. In such a circumstance, turn to contemplation of
    the thought, doubtful. Do you anticipate or wish for good
    results? If so, make such thoughts the subject of your
    contemplation, anticipating or wishing. Are you attempting to
    recall the manner in which this training was conducted up to
    this point? Yes? Then take up contemplation on recollecting.
    Are there occasions when you examine the object of
    contemplation to determine whether it is mind or matter? If
    so, then be aware of examining. Do you regret that there is
    no improvement in your contemplation? If so, then attend to
    that feeling of regret. Conversely, are you happy that your
    contemplation is improving? If you are, then contemplate the
    feeling of being happy. This is the way in which you make a
    mental note of every item of mental behavior as it occurs,
    and if there are no intervening thoughts or perceptions to
    note, you should revert to the contemplation of rising and
    falling.</p>
    <p>During a strict course of meditation, the time of practice
    is from the first moment you wake up until you fall asleep.
    To repeat, you must be constantly occupied either with the
    basic exercise or with mindful attention throughout the day
    and during those night hours when you are not asleep. There
    must be no relaxation. Upon reaching a certain stage of
    progress in contemplation you will not feel sleepy in spite
    of these prolonged hours of practice. On the contrary, you
    will be able to continue the contemplation day and night.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#000080"><strong>SUMMARY</strong></font></p>
    <p>It has been emphasized during this brief outline of the
    training that you must contemplate on each mental occurrence
    good or bad, on each bodily movement large or small, on every
    sensation (bodily or mental feeling) pleasant or unpleasant,
    and so on. If, during the course of training, occasions arise
    when there is nothing special to contemplate upon, be fully
    occupied with attention to the rising and falling of the
    abdomen. When you have to attend to any kind of activity that
    necessitates walking, then, in complete awareness, each step
    should be briefly noted as walking, walking or left, right.
    But when you are taking a walking exercise, contemplate each
    step in three sections, lifting, moving, and placing. The
    student who thus dedicates himself to the training during day
    and night, will be able in not too long a time to develop
    concentration to the initial stage of the fourth degree of
    insight (knowledge of arising and passing away) and onward to
    higher stages of insight meditation.</p>
