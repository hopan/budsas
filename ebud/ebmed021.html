Spending time in a retreat is like recharging a battery. Once

you have charged a battery, you don&iacute;t let it just sit around.

You install it in an appliance and use it until it runs out. Then

you recharge it.  Similarly, when you need to recharge yourself

you go for retreats. 

<P>

The difference between charging a battery and going for a retreat

is that the length of time spent in a retreat cannot really  be

equated with the time you charge a battery. If you charge a battery

longer, that does not mean it can run longer. Once the battery

has reached full capacity it cannot be  charged any more. Charging

after that point is useless. But this does not happen when you

go on a long-term retreat. 

<P>

 First, before you go for long retreats, you should have undertaken

short weekend retreats. Also, be aware of the length of the longer

retreat you hope to accomplish -- ten days, twenty days, a month,

three months, or a year or two?

<P>

 You have to prepare your mind and body for a long retreat. You

do this by attending several graduated short retreats that last

a weekend, three days, a week, ten days, two weeks and a month.

Once you know you can handle a weekend retreat comfortably then

go to the next longer one. When you know  you can handle that

retreat easily, move on up to the next longer one.

<P>

<B><FONT COLOR=#800040>PREPARING YOURSELF</FONT></B>

<P>

 Sometimes even a weekend retreat is boring and painful if you

are not prepared. How can you prepare your mind? When you go for

a retreat, don&iacute;t bring your office with you. Leave it behind.

People are generally unable to let go of their work. They are

used to their daily and weekly routines full of TV, company, gossip,

uncontrolled eating, drink, drugs, sex, travel,  etc. When they

go for retreats they have to let go of most of these routines.

<P>

 Since they are accustomed to working under great pressure, even

in retreats they are tense and anxious. They want to get something

out of meditation as quickly as possible and then get back to

their work. Don&iacute;t go for retreat in this frame of mind.

Try to think that you have left everything behind for a while

and now you have all the time in the world. Nobody -- no work,

nothing -- is going to bother you. Use all the time for your practice.

<P>

 What happens to you if you do not have this kind of attitude

is that you begin to feel bored and tired of meditation. You find

meditation is a waste of time. You are in the same situation as

when you were at work or at home or with company.  If you start

your retreat with this attitude, you will wish to achieve some

benefit as quickly as possible, and to go home or to work to enjoy

what you have been doing before you went for the retreat.

<P>

 Moreover, in a short retreat you experience a great deal of pain

and discomfort. As you become impatient, your aches and pains

become more acute. Naturally, in a short retreat you experience

more physical discomfort, for you are not used to sitting in one

place for a long time or to staying in one place for a long period

of time by yourself without listening to radio or watching TV,

or without chatting with somebody or reading a newspaper, or perhaps

doing some computer work. When you try to look at yourself introspectively,

taking stock of the garbage you have within yourself, you experience

a great deal of discomfort. 

<P>

 How much time do you have in a weekend retreat? Not more than

two days. Before the body gets adjusted to the new situation,

the new practice, the new discipline, the retreat time or your

holiday time is over. Then you may conclude that all you got from

a retreat is aches and pains all over your body. Or boredom. Then

you decide never to go for a retreat again. As you have not had

any previous retreat experiences, what you don&iacute;t know is

that it takes a couple of days for your body to become adjusted.

Short retreats, however, are beneficial for preparing yourself

for a long retreat. 
<P>

<B><FONT COLOR=#800040>GROUP SUPPORT</FONT></B>
<P>

 People who have done meditation by themselves on their own should

expect to face courageously whatever arises in their bodies and

minds. Meditating alone by oneself is also beneficial in that

you can make your own schedule. You can avoid any human contact.

You can chose a quiet place. Even when you go to a group meditation,

you meditate by yourself without worrying about other meditators.

<P>

 However, group meditation also has its own benefits. When you

are in a group you receive silent group support. When you feel

depressed or disheartened or disappointed you can notice others

meditating. When you see them, you feel encouraged. You may think:

&igrave;If they can do it, I can, too. Let me try.&icirc; Also,

in group meditation there are times for Dhamma discussion and

you can benefit from that. 

<P>

 In a short-term retreat, you hardly settle down and get used

to the new way of looking at yourself before the retreat is over.

Moreover, as we have mentioned earlier, your mind is fully preoccupied

with the pain and discomfort you are going through during the

whole period of a short retreat. This does not permit you to pay

any attention to the changes taking place all the time. 

<P>

 The benefits of a longer retreat are many. You can see the changes

in the aggregates taking place every moment. In long-term retreats,

you have plenty of time to get over those difficulties. Noticing

changes in your body and mind is a very good way to learn to overcome

your hatred which keeps nagging you all the time. As long as anger

troubles you, you cannot meditate properly. 

<P>

 Secondly, you can see clearly the connection between your intense

greed and continuous suffering. Third, you can very succinctly

notice the total phenomenon of your life operating without anything

permanent in it, just like an ever-running machine. You realize

there is nothing you can do to stop the process of growing, but

to accept it cheerfully. This is where you will achieve real relaxation,

real joy and real happiness, which can be equated with eternal

bliss. This is where you see that all the aggregates are inseparably

functioning together.

<P>

 This acceptance of yourself is the beginning of an entirely new

life. This is where you are firmly rooted in your practice. Prior

to this experience you would go from retreat to retreat, looking

for a better teacher or a better meditation system. Now you realize

you have found it within yourself. You don&iacute;t need to go

anywhere, seeking another new teacher. Prior to this you would

have been pretending to know meditation, possibly even teaching

meditation, without knowing what you yourself were doing. Now

you realize that this entire rat race is simply a waste of your

time and energy.
