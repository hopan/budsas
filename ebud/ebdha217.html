        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>Thank you, Ajahn, for taking the
        time to talk with us this morning. Let me start by asking you something
        simple: What do you feel is the essence of dharma?</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">[Laughter.] This is not such a simple
        question… The essence of dharma is liberation. Liberation from <i>dukkha</i>,
        from suffering in its widest meaning. And also liberation from any kind
        of delusion, any kind of ignorance.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>Sometimes liberation is portrayed
        as a goal at the end of one's path, and at other times one hears about
        moments of liberation and freedom. Can you clarify this?</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Liberation is not out there somewhere,
        or an event that will happen sometime in the future. It begins right
        here right now. Many conditions are supporting the time when one might
        have a profound experience of letting go of some particular blind spot
        or pattern of attachment. Even though <i>nirvana</i> is presented as a
        goal—the goal of final liberation—each moment is a moment where
        there is a possibility of liberating the mind from its habitual
        grasping, its clinging, its blindness. So it's the goal, and at the same
        time it's happening in the moment. These do not contradict one another.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>What do these moments feel like,
        when you actually experience insight?</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's not like a major fireworks
        experience, where everything is suddenly just blown apart. For me, it
        can be very simple: just suddenly noticing an habitual way of the mind
        seeing things. You contact the world, and suddenly you see the <i>dukkha</i>
        and you KNOW. You just see the experience of tension, and the actual <i>tanhà</i>
        [craving] behind it. You can experience both the wanting—and then the
        relaxing into that experience and allowing it to just be there. You see
        that you can stop acting on it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When it becomes clear that grasping is
        the cause of <i>dukkha</i>, you just let go. Instead of clinging, you
        just release it. The peace that comes from releasing, that is nirodha,
        the experience of cessation, the third noble truth which is often hardly
        even noticed. The mind, under the influence of ego, is more inclined to
        notice what is exciting or interesting. Usually you might be pushing
        away the experience, or grasping it, or struggling with it, or making
        something out of it, or becoming it. And then, in this moment of
        insight, you see these as just reactive responses that we usually have
        out of ignorance towards our mind states, our bodily experiences, and so
        on. Cessation is peaceful: the ending of grasping, the ending of our
        problems, the ending of ME with my story and all its complexities.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">You realize that there is no one there.
        The mind with its thoughts, feeling and perception just seems to arise
        out of nowhere, and disappears, and arise again. It is only through our
        delusion that we are constantly building up a sense of self around that,
        creating what we hope is some kind of secure landscape. We construct a
        person, again and again, out of our misapprehension of physical and
        mental phenomena.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>So the noble truths are really
        revealed in experience moment after moment?</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes. If you are awake.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>And how do we wake up, or remain
        awake, in order to see these things in our experience?</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Paradoxically, the experience of <i>dukkha</i>
        is part of our waking up. Somehow I've noticed that most human beings
        around me—including myself—seem to be spurred on by the experience
        of unsatisfactoriness. I don't think any one of us is looking for that,
        or wants it, and it's not necessarily unsatisfactory in thesense of
        being unhappy. But often with the experience of <i>dukkha</i> comes the
        realization that you are asleep; there is a lack of mindfulness, a lack
        of awareness and energy. A kind of contraction has already begun, and
        then suddenly you realize that you are not aware. You are not really
        present with what's happening. You are seeing the world through the veil
        of habits, the veil of misery and depression, excitement, anger or
        frustration. As a well known teacher says, you are not meeting the
        moment as a fresh moment.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>Do you mean that you need to be
        awake to see the noble truths in your experience, and at the same time,
        by seeing them, you wake up?</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">That's right. When you really see
        suffering, you have already come to that place of wakefulness, which is
        not clinging and grasping. So in a way by seeing suffering, you have
        also almost seen the ending of suffering. It's not like a linear
        sequence in time, one, two, three, four. It's more like the case of a
        hand touching a cinder of hot coal. As soon as you pick it up you drop
        it, because you just know it is hot. You don't wait, you just drop it.
        At some point it becomes as urgent as this.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>And what might you say to help a
        person who can see the unsatisfactoriness arising again and again in
        their experience, but somehow just can't seem to manage to see the
        holding that is underlying and causing it?</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We all go through this. We can often
        feel the misery of <i>dukkha</i> and not be able to drop it. It is as if
        we were addicted to it. I think all of us are in the same boat. But this
        is where practice makes a difference. With meditation we have tools that
        help us to investigate the nature of our experiences and to see our
        habitual grasping. Much of the practice is about being very patient and
        willing to bear with our habits until they run out of fuel.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's as though we were starting a
        program of detox: it doesn't feel so good. We can experience the
        withdrawal symptoms of addiction to delusion. For a while you just feel
        very ill at ease because you are not feeding the habits of grasping.
        Many people come to practice thinking, &quot;Oh, it's going to be really
        nice. I'm going to find peace, and I'll be confident and more
        clear.&quot; They don't realize that actually when you enter the
        practice, you enter a strong fire.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>And what helps us make the
        breakthrough? Is it just the gradual effects of patiently returning our
        attention to the present? Or is it a momentum that grows from moments of
        insight getting closer together, or more deep?</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes it is just a matter of
        patiently bearing with difficult states of mind, mood, emotion,
        perceptions, old conditionning and so on. As we keep taking refuge in
        mindfulness, moment by moment, we are not fueling our habits and our
        grasping begins to loosen up. It does not seem like very much at first,
        yet you begin to notice how certain situations, certain people, certain
        moods that used to agitate your mind do not have any hold anymore.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When I first learned about practice, my
        teacher emphasized right view. His teaching constantly reminded me to
        observe experiences as changing—and to notice when there was suffering
        or not. Paying attention, I began to be aware when I took things
        personally and when I did not, when the sense of self was present or
        not. The more it hurt, I noticed, the more I was invested in what I
        experienced. I was noticing the patterns of attachment in my life and
        the lack of inherent seflhood of the mind.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I think sometimes in the West we see the
        practice and the path of training the mind in a way that is a little
        narrow. We think of it, perhaps, as a technique or some kind of special
        conditions to reach a breakthrough. We often forget that every aspect of
        life is a tool to realize Dhamma. Everything in life influences us, and
        awareness is key. Awareness of mistakes can take us right into the fire.
        Sometimes not getting it quite right is what wakes you up, much more
        sharply than developing a lot of techniques to be aware. Transformation
        sometimes needs fire, and we don't have to be afraid of the heat that's
        generated by the shadow side of our personality.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>But what is the wisdom component
        of that? For many people, when their ego gets thrown down, they feel bad
        about themselves; and this can just fuel more unskillful states. What is
        the crucial factor that will allow one to use this as a tool for growth
        rather than for further suffering?</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Wisdom can help discern the suffering
        that perpetuates itself and the suffering that takes us to the end of
        suffering. Most people identify with what they experience. So when they
        feel miserable, they don't know how to let awareness reflect back their
        experiences. If we are still desperately clinging to being successful,
        or being loved, or being praised, or being famous, or whatever—then we
        won't be able to see the bigger picture. We won't be able to reach the
        state of peace that Ajahn Chah was pointing to when he said:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If you let go of a little you have
        a little peace. If you let go of a lot you have a lot of peace. And if
        you let go completely, then you have complete peace.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you have seen through insight that
        the things we crave are not really worth making ourselves miserable, it
        becomes possible to be at peace with whatever is happening.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>Is this easier to do in a monastic
        environment?</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Certainly in the beginning it's easier
        to practice in an environment where people share a common interest and
        commitment, and whose lifestyle is designed to support the practice and
        realization of Dhamma. It is also an advantage to be away from a lot of
        situations where the worldly assumptions hold undisputed sway. In our
        Western secular society, to be famous, and successful, and loved, and
        praised is the only goal isn't it? That is what you are brought up to
        believe from childhood. But when you are in a monastic environment for a
        while you have many encouragement to just drop the whole thing and to
        see what happens when you don't cling to these ideals. There are also
        very clear ethical standards, which is a big help.Sila (morality)
        provides clear guidelines that remind us to be mindful of all aspects of
        our life: mind, body, speech and our interaction with the outside world.
        But these guidelines would not be very useful if they were seen simply
        as another set of ideas to be clung to. Wisdom and a compassionate
        attitude must be present to use them skilfully, and to realise that our
        mistakes as well as our success are valuable material for practice.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>So even as a monastic you still
        have an occasional opportunity to make mistakes and learn from them?</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Occasional? [Laughter] People have such
        a funny idea about monasticism. It's a place where your shortcomings
        become magnified and you have to face yourself as you are rather than as
        an ideal you may be trying to uphold. You have many mirrors of yourself
        in a community. It can be quite a shock sometimes to realize how many
        identities you are living with!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>How did you come to the dharma?
        Who has been your teacher?</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I always think of Thomas Merton and
        Krishnamurti as the people who gave me an inkling of an inquiring mind
        and the dimension of awareness. But it all really began for me with
        Ajahn Sumedho. I met him early in 1978, when he came to visit the
        university where I was studying at the time. One of the students, who
        had been a monk with Ajahn Chah, had started a Buddhist Society where
        some meditation was being taught.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">What really struck me is that Ajahn
        Sumedho was describing in his talks a lifestyle which I had been looking
        for but never imagined I could ever find in our culture. I had always
        lived in metropolitan areas, in a world of artists and intellectuals
        where tranquility and peace was not exactly the aim of life. He spoke of
        the simple lifestyle of a monk in Thailand and I saw somebody who was
        intelligent, reflective, bright and humorous. He embodied qualities
        which I appreciated. I remembered his humor more than anything.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There was a certain freshness about his
        outlook on things that was very reassuring. Having trained as a dancer,
        I was familiar with the kind of focused attention and concentration you
        need to be in the present moment. You can't dance by thinking, or with a
        manual in your hands—you've got to be right there. I was looking for
        something that could sustain that experience of presence in my every day
        life, but there was nothing in our society that seemed able to provide
        this.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>Presumably as a dancer you were
        well trained in mindfulness and concentration. If these are factors that
        lead to awakening, why don't all dancers have wisdom?</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Well, concentration and a certain degree
        of mindfulness are present, but not what the Buddha calls right
        mindfulness. There was no shortage of suffering and opportunity to see
        the Dhamma, yet I didn't know how to find a skillful way to deal with
        it. Even though I had learned a lot about the body, I did not know what
        it was about. It was a bit like a doctor who might know every detail
        about the human body, but who is totally ignorant of its real nature. I
        eventually found the dancer's world ego-centered and narcissistic.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>So how did you get from there to
        the monastic community?</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Inspired by the teaching of
        Krishnamurti, I started inquiring into what I was feeling and thinking,
        sitting quietly and simply being present. In the stillness there was a
        strong awareness of the restlessness of the mind, the fear, the
        agitation, the frustration and so on. It was like opening the gates to
        all that which did not want to be present. And I began to see how mind
        and body interacted with one another, which triggered my curiosity:
        &quot;Oh that's very interesting. What's going on here?&quot; I had
        never known that I was living with such an active mind and body. All
        sorts of things were becoming conscious, not just difficult aspects of
        the mind but also some very positive ones, which came as a surprise.
        Suddenly I felt a great wish to be generous, and not being so
        preoccupied with myself, I had more time and wanted to share what I had.
        So there was a slow transformation happening, beyond my control.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This was a very unfamiliar experience,
        because like most people I thought that my strength and ability to act
        and respond to life came from getting actively involved—not by
        relaxing and just being at peace in the present moment. Yet so many
        experiences were coming up by doing nothing, by just being present.
        There were also some changes in my professional and personal life taking
        place, raising many questions which I knew had no real answer. Somehow
        the answers were not so important, but I felt that the questions were.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>We're getting closer. And the
        final step?</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The turning point was a retreat with
        Ajahn Sumedho. I discovered that I loved getting up at four o'clock in
        the morning and eating only one meal a day. I did get totally bored,
        miserable, hungry and critical at times—yet to me, because of the
        presence of mindfulness, it was ten days in heaven! I discovered that I
        had enough space to see my critical mind reflected everywhere: &quot;I
        don't like him. I don't like it here. She's not practicing right&quot;
        and enough compassion to let things be. This incredible simplicity of
        the present moment, and all this energy to just be here and now and to
        notice what was going on in the mind, fascinated me.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, the last thing I thought is
        that I would wind up at a monastery. I had all sorts of ideas and plans
        for the years ahead. And at some point I was talking to Ajahn Sumedho
        about all of this—going on about the greatness of the challenges of
        the world. When I stopped he just said &quot;Yes, and it's a matter of
        knowing where the world is, isn't it?&quot; And that was like a
        lightening bolt. It changed everything. Suddenly I realized something
        that I had read in many books, that I was actually making my world and
        was free to lead my life as I wanted</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>So &quot;The world is in this
        fathom-long body.&quot; [M1:82] Is that what he was referring to?</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes. &quot;You cannot reach the end of
        the world by walking, but you cannot end dukkha without going to the end
        of the world&quot; the Buddha said. I didn't realize the impact it had
        until I realized my mind had stopped somehow. Soon thereafter I thought,
        &quot;Well, ten days did a jolly good job. How about three months? That
        should sort yourself out for the rest of your life.&quot; Of course,
        that first month turned out to be so fascinating I stayed on, and
        eventually joined the order of nuns.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>And how developed was the nun's
        community at that point?</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Well, there was nothing. We were four
        laywomen who happen to come to the monastery at about the same time. We
        were ordained together a few weeks later. Learning to live together
        under the same roof was an extraordinary classroom. We were four
        incredibly strong individuals—very different. [Laughter] It was an
        entirely different lifestyle for all of us, to suddenly find ourselves
        with three other people day in and day out in really rough conditions.
        In the early years the monastery was a really tough place to live. It
        was virtually a building site, stripped from the cellar up to the roof.
        It was cold and damp, and there was a kind of spooky atmosphere at
        times.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We got up at four and had to be up at
        the main house at five o'clock in morning. Since we were fifteen
        minute's walk up a tiny deserted lane from the bottom of a hill, we had
        to get up even earlier than the men. Each week there was an all-night
        vigil where we meditated until four or five o'clock in the morning. We
        lived on one meal a day, we didn't have breakfast for two years. Being
        French (food is important!), that was really quite a drastic change for
        me. [Laughter] A real mind-stopper!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>And there must have been some
        special difficulties around the fact that nuns and monks were relatively
        close together?</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, of course. It was quite an
        extraordinary situation. The monks had just moved from Thailand to the
        West, in an entirely different culture. They did not have the support of
        an Asian society that is predominantly Buddhist, and had never lived
        close to nuns. Personally, not knowing much about this tradition, it
        wasn't too bad as I remember at the time, because I just took on board
        the situation as it was. As a female monastic I never felt particularly
        inferior in those days—I think I was too conceited to feel that I was
        inferior, anyway. But I have to say we were very well treated, very
        respected. I am often asked questions like &quot;How can you cope with
        the fact that women are subordinate to men&quot; [according the ancient
        monastic codes] and so on. This has been an issue in our community not
        just for the nuns but for the monks too, and has not been an easy one.
        We have had to learn to work with a situation that challenges much of
        our conditioning around being strong and independent western women. The
        practice helps us respond to the way things are, rather than projecting
        some sort of ideals onto a monastic form which is to be used as a
        skillful means rather than an end in itself. But this is an ongoing
        challenge, and the question remains: &quot;How do we relate to this
        whole convention skillfully, and translate into our culture a tradition
        that is so incredibly different from what we know in the West?&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the last decade, the nun's community
        has become much more independent, and administers its own internal
        affairs. The responsibilities of running the monastery are shared, and
        most decisions are made by a group of senior monks and nuns. Over the
        years a great mutual respect between the male and female members of the
        community has developed.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>In this and many other ways there
        seems to be a good deal of evolution in the modern Sangha.</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I have noticed, since I have been in the
        United States more over the last ten years, that there is a sense of
        growing interest in monastic life that I had not seen so much before.
        There seems to be a deeper understanding of what monastic life means for
        us, and a greater interest in supporting monastics. I think the more
        understanding there is between the lay community and the monastic
        community, the more mutual respect naturally develops. This will surely
        benefit and enrich each other's experience and quality of practice. It
        was not too long ago that more polarity existed, and I feel this is a
        really positive development.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The growing connection between our
        Sangha on the one hand, and the larger retreat centers in America such
        as IMS and Spirit Rock is very heart-warming. I was at Spirit Rock
        recently when Ajahn Sumedho was there teaching a group of senior lay
        dharma teachers, and was very happy to see a bit more of the harmony
        within the communities of which the Buddha so often spoke when he
        reminded us to meet often, meet in concord, and part in concord.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>Any last thoughts, Sister?</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I would just like to express my
        gratitude and appreciation to everyone at the Barre Center for Buddhist
        Studies and at the Insight Meditation Society for the kindness,
        generosity and support that I have received during my three-month stay,
        and to thank particularly those who made it possible for me to spend the
        Vassa here.</font></p>
