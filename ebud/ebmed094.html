      <td width="100%"><B></B><FONT SIZE="6">M</FONT>any Buddhists think about 
      the Dhamma too much and practise too little. Lacking the experience of 
      what it is like to keep precepts, and lacking the data supplied by the Jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ānas, 
      t</FONT>hey inadvertently distort the Dhamma with their own wishful 
      thinking. Unfortunately, some of these Buddhists are Dhamma teachers.<P>An 
      example of how the Buddha&#39;s teachings become distorted is seen in the 
      Buddha&#39;s well known brief teaching to B<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āhiya, 
      as recorded in the Udāna (Ud 1.10). Bāhiya was not a monk. The sutta does 
      not record him giving dāna [1], nor taking refuge in the Triple Gem, nor 
      keeping any precepts. Moreover, the sutta has no mention at all of Bāhiya 
      ever meditating, let alone reaching a Jhāna. Yet, after receiving a very 
      brief teaching from the Buddha, Bāhiya became fully Enlightened, an 
      Arahant, within seconds!</P>
      </FONT>
      <P>This episode is very well known in Buddhist circles, because it seems 
      to make Enlightenment so easy. It appears that you don&#39;t need to be a 
      monk, you can be miserly and not give d<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna, 
      no ceremonies such as that of taking refuge are required, precepts are 
      unnecessary, and even meditating can be avoided! What a relief -- for 
      some! All you need is intelligence, and everyone thinks that they are 
      intelligent. (You think you are intelligent, don&#39;t you?) This makes 
      Bāhiya&#39;s Teaching both attractive and notorious.</P>
      </FONT>
      <P>So what was this teaching? Here is my own translation.</P>
      <P>&quot;B<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āhiya, you should train yourself thus: 
      in the seen will be merely what is seen; in the heard will be merely what 
      is heard; in the sensed [2] will be merely what is sensed; in the cognized 
      will be merely what is cognized. Practising in this way, Bāhiya, you will 
      not be &#39;because of that&#39;. When you are not &#39;because of that&#39; you will</FONT> 
      not be &#39;in that&#39;. And when you are not &#39;in that&#39; then you will be neither 
      here not beyond nor in between the two. Just this is the end of 
      suffering.&quot;</P>
      <P>And then B<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āhiya became fully Enlightened. 
      Sounds easy, doesn&#39;t it? You have just read the same teaching. </FONT>Did 
      you achieve Full Enlightenment? No! Why Not?</P>
      <P>As usual, there is more to the story than is recorded in the sutta. It 
      is often the case that the suttas record only the highlights of a long 
      episode. Just like the wedding photos do not record the first meeting, the 
      dating and the arguments, so many suttas do not record all that occurred 
      before the finale. So what is the full story of B<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āhiya? 
      How can we put the finale, captured for posterity in the Udāna, into its 
      full context? Fortunately, the whole story is recorded in the Apadāna 
      (past lives of the Arahants) and in the commentaries.</P>
      </FONT>
      <P>In his previous life, B<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āhiya was a monk 
      under the Buddha Kassapa. Together with six other monks, he climbed a 
      steep mountain, throwing away the ladder, and determined to remain on top 
      of that rock until they became Enlightened or died. One of the seven monks 
      became an Arahant, another became an Anāgāmī (Non Returner), the other 
      five died on the mountain. Bāhiya was one of the five. In Bāhiya&#39;s final 
      life, he was a sailor, successfully crossing the ocean seven times. On the 
      eighth voyage, he was shipwrecked but managed to survive by floating 
      ashore on a plank of wood. Having lost all his clothes, he made temporary 
      garments out of bark and went begging for food in the town of Suppārakā. 
      The townspeople were impressed with his appearance and offered him food, 
      respect and even a costly set of clothes. When Bāhiya refused the new 
      clothes, the people esteemed him even more. Bāhiya had gained a 
      comfortable living and so did not return to sea. The people regarded 
      Bāhiya as an Arahant. Soon, Bāhiya thought he was an Arahant too!</P>
      </FONT>
      <P>At that point, a deva discerned the wrong thought of B<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āhiya 
      and, out of compassion, reprimanded him. That deva was none other than his 
      former fellow monk, one of the seven, the one who had become an Anāgāmī. 
      (It is of interest to add that the remaining four fellow monks were also 
      reborn at this time, and they all, like Bāhiya, eventually attained full 
      Enlightenment. (They were Pukkusāti, Sabhiya, Kumārakassapa and Dabba the 
      Mallian.) Then the Anāgāmī-deva informed Bāhiya about a true Arahant, the 
      Buddha, living at that time on the other side of India, at Sāvatthi. 
      Bāhiya immediately left Suppārakā (present day Sopāra, just north of 
      Mumbai) and reached Sāvatthi (just 17 kilometres west of Balrumpur) in 
      only one night. Bāhiya met the Buddha while he was on alms round and asked 
      for a teaching. The Buddha at first refused, for it was an inappropriate 
      time. But on being asked a third time, the Buddha interrupted his alms 
      gathering and gave the famous teaching presented above. Within seconds of 
      hearing that Dhamma, Bāhiya was fully Enlightened. A few minutes later, 
      the Arahant Bāhiya was killed by a cow with calf.</P>
      </FONT>
      <P>So, B<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āhiya&#39;s background was exceptional. 
      He had been a monk un</FONT>der the previous Buddha, Kassapa. His powers 
      of determination were so strong that he went to meditate on the mountain 
      with the resolve to become Enlightened or die. In this life, he could hear 
      deva&#39;s speak to him and he could travel more than halfway across India, 
      some 1,300 Kilometres as the levitator flies, in only one night. If you 
      had such a background from your previous life, and had such psychic powers 
      already in this life, then perhaps you too would have been Enlightened 
      when you read B<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āhiya&#39;s Teachi</FONT>ng a few 
      minutes ago!</P>
      <P>It is usually the case that one requires very deep sam<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ādhi, 
      Jhānas, to achieve such psychic powers. Certainly, Bāhiya would have had a 
      pre-disposition for meditation, taking account of his previous life. And 
      the psychic power of the &#39;divine ear&#39; that enabled him to hear the deva, 
      and the other psychic power that enabled him to travel so fast, suggest 
      that he was practising Jhāna before he heard the deva. Perhaps this was 
      another reason why he thought himself an Arahant. But there is more 
      evidence to suggest that, though it was not mentioned in the texts, Bāhiya 
      had been practising Jhānas.</P>
      </FONT>
      <P>Few people are aware that the very same teaching, that here I call B<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āhiya&#39;s 
      Teaching, was also given by the Buddha to the old monk Mālunkyaputta (SN 
      35.95). Mālunkyaputta appears several times in the suttas. In particular, 
      in sutta 64 of the Majjhima Nikāya, occurring certainly before the 
      occasion when Mālunkyaputta was given Bāhiya&#39;s Teaching, the Buddha first 
      disparages Mālunkyaputta for his wrong view and then teaches the necessity 
      of attaining at least one of the Jhānas in order to destroy the five lower 
      fetters [3] (and thereby attain the level just below full Enlightenment 
      called Non Returning). The Buddha said in front of Venerable Mālunkyaputta 
      that it is impossible to achieve Non Returning (let alone Full 
      Enlightenment) without a Jhāna just as much as it is impossible to reach 
      the heartwood of a tree without first going through its bark and sapwood. 
      Think about it.</P>
      </FONT>
      <P>So, Venerable M<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ālunkyaputta was first 
      taught the necessity of Jhānas, and then later he was given Bāhiya&#39;s 
      Teaching. After hearing Bāhiya&#39;s Teaching &#39;dwelling alone, withdrawn, 
      diligent, ardent and resolute&#39; Mālunkyaputta soon became an Arahant. It is 
      therefore certain that Mālunkyaputta achieved Jhāna before Bāhiya&#39;s 
      Teaching could be effective. Or else the Buddha would be blatantly 
      inconsistent. It also adds weight to the inference that Bāhiya also had 
      experience of Jhāna before he heard the same teaching -- otherwise he 
      would have rea</FONT>ched the heartwood of the tree without going through 
      its bark and sapwood!</P>
      <B>
      <P>The Vipall<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āsa</FONT></B> [4]</P>
      <P>So what did B<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āhiya, and Venerable 
      Mālunkyaputta, see in the Buddha&#39;s words that generated the Arahant 
      experience? What does it mean &#39;In the seen will merely be wha</FONT>t is 
      seen&#39;?</P>
      <P>What it means is to see without any distortion of the data, without 
      adding or subtracting from it. As modern psychology knows, what come to 
      our attention as &#39;the seen&#39; has already been sifted and distorted by our 
      desires and aversions. This process of distortion occurs prior to the 
      event of cognition. It is impossible to see this process as it occurs. It 
      is subconscious. We can only infer its occurrence. We discover that our 
      preferences have embellished the data to present to our mind what we 
      wanted to see, while hostility has denied any access to the mind for those 
      features that we didn&#39;t want to see. What we see is rarely, merely the 
      seen. That which we see with bare attention is seldom the truth. It is not 
      the way things are, it is only the way things seem.</P>
      <P>We should have had enough experience of life to know this by now. When 
      you men see a beautiful woman, what do you see? Most people, even monks, 
      do not see what is really there -- just muscle, sinew, skin and hair -- 
      they see instead a bimbo! Where did that come from? Our sexual desire 
      added it on, distorting the reality. When you see the recently deceased 
      body of your mother, what do you see? Again, you do not see what is truly 
      there -- just muscle, sinew, skin and hair again -- instead you see a 
      tragedy. Your attachment added on the grief. It distorted the reality.</P>
      <P>In Northeast Thailand many years ago, in poor and remote jungle 
      monasteries, I had to eat grasshoppers, frogs, ants and other crawling 
      insects. That was all there was to eat. A regular dish was ant-egg curry. 
      When you just read this, were you practising &#39;in the seen will merely be 
      the seen&#39; or did you add on your own disgust? Fried grasshoppers were 
      actually quite delicious. How much do we add on our own likes and dislikes 
      to the seen?</P>
      <P>A tour company wanted to employ a dentist for their cruise ship. So 
      they looked in the Yellow Pages under the section &#39;Off-shore Drilling&#39;...! 
      How much do we add on to what we see?</P>
      <P>Twenty-five centuries before modern psychology, the Buddha identified 
      the process that distorts cognition and called it the vipall<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āsa. 
      He explained this essentially circular process starting from view. It is 
      our views that bend our perception to agree with the view. The perceptions 
      then form the evidence for our thoughts. The</FONT>n the thoughts argue in 
      support of our view. It is a self-justifying cycle. Views generate 
      perceptions that make thoughts that support the views. This is the very 
      process of delusion.</P>
      <P>For example, someone believes in God. They hold a theist view. That 
      view will deny access to the mind for any perceptions that challenge that 
      view. Scientific facts such as astrophysics, quantum mechanics, geology, 
      bio-chemistry become &#39;no-fly&#39; perceptions. They are rejected before they 
      even register in the consciousness, because they are antithetic to the 
      view. Only perceptions that support and conform to the God-view survive 
      the subconscious sifting process. These pro-God perceptions then form the 
      data for our thoughts to work on. The data is convincing. It supports our 
      view. We become convinced that there is a God, and our view grows ever 
      more resistant to challenge. Such is the origin and progress of our many 
      religions, which are all convinced that they are right. They are mistaking 
      the way things seem for the way things are.</P>
      <P>Or take the abortion debate. Are you &#39;Pro-life&#39; or &#39;Pro-choice&#39;? 
      Whichever one of these two views you hold on to, it will corrupt your 
      perception, selecting perceptions in support of your view and blinding 
      your consciousness to any perceptions that challenge your view. Your 
      thinking will be built up of your perceptions, in the same way that a 
      house is built up out of bricks. Such misinformed thinking will justify 
      your view, so strongly that you simply cannot understand why everyone else 
      doesn&#39;t see it the right way, which is your way!</P>
      <P>One last example, is meditation easy for you? If you hold the view that 
      meditation is difficult, and you are very attached to that idea, then 
      meditation will seem to be difficult. Where did that view come from? 
      Maybe, a long time ago, someone with authority told you that meditation 
      was difficult, you believed them, and that view has stuck. Or, perhaps, 
      you began meditation without clear and accurate instructions, and you 
      found it difficult then. On the basis of such limited experience, you 
      formed the solid view that meditation is difficult. However that view 
      arose, once it is there, it makes meditation difficult! Your attachment to 
      this view twists your perceptions. The only perceptions that make it into 
      full consciousness are those that perceive the difficulties in meditation. 
      Based on those negative perceptions, you think meditation is, in fact, 
      difficult. You, and only you, have just made meditation difficult!</P>
      <P>When we have some understanding of what is going on, we might be able 
      to change such a view on meditation. Allow me to brainwash you! Let me 
      convince you that, in spite of who said what, in spite of all your 
      previous lack of success; MEDITATION IS EASY! MEDITATION IS EASY! 
      MEDITATION IS EASY! Let me coach you into believing that you can meditate 
      well. Help me recondition you into believing in your innate ability to 
      meditate well. You have been reborn into a precious human body and are now 
      reading the priceless teachings of Buddhism. You are alive when the Dhamma 
      is thriving and you have met that amazing Dhamma. You are such a rare 
      being. You have worked for lifetimes for such an opportunity as this. With 
      so much going for you already, of course you will be able to meditate 
      well. The fact that you are reading this proves that you have got a huge 
      store of good kamma supporting you. Other people, much less able than you, 
      have attained Jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna, so why not you! Once, 
      with my help, you have concocted a positive view of your ability in 
      meditation -- hey presto -- you perceive only success in meditation and 
      you think only success in meditation. You have just made meditation easy! 
      You have opened the door to tranquillity, inner bliss and the Jhānas. Try 
      it!</P>
      </FONT><B>
      <P>Discovering Truth</P>
      </B>
      <P>The point is, the view that meditation is difficult for you and the 
      view that meditation is easy, are both untrue. They are both the product 
      of distorting what is seen, heard, sensed and cognized. They are both 
      delusion. It is just that the positive view is a more useful delusion. In 
      fact, it is the view that will lead you to discovering the truth.</P>
      <P>The Buddha explained that it is the Five Hindrances [5] that distort 
      perception and corrupt our thinking. He called the Five Hindrances the 
      nutriment that feeds delusion (AN 10.61). The first hindrance, Sensual 
      Desire, selects what we want to see, hear, sense and cognize. It often 
      embellishes the truth. It presents to our consciousness the product of 
      wishful thinking. The second hindrance, Ill Will, is that negative impulse 
      that blocks us seeing, hearing, sensing or cognizing, what we don&#39;t want 
      to know. It blinds us to what is unpleasant, and to what is contrary to 
      our view. Psychology knows the second hindrance as the process of denial. 
      The third hindrance is Sloth and Torpor. This does not distort what we 
      see, hear, sense or cognize. It buries it in a fog so that we are unable 
      to discern clearly. The fourth hindrance is Restlessness and Remorse, 
      which keeps our senses on the run, so fast that we do not have sufficient 
      time to see, hear, sense or cognize fully. Sights do not have time to 
      fully form on our retina, before the back of the eye has another sight to 
      deal with. Sounds are hardly registered, when we are asked to listen to 
      something else. The fourth hindrance of Restlessness, and its special case 
      of Remorse (inner restlessness due to bad conduct), is like the 
      over-demanding boss in your office who never gives you enough time to 
      finish a project properly. The fifth hindrance is Doubt, which interrupts 
      the gathering of data with premature questions. Before we have fully 
      experienced the seen, heard, sensed or cognized, doubt interferes with the 
      process, like a cocky student interrupting the teacher with a question in 
      the midst of the lecture. You should now be able to appreciate that it is 
      these Five Hindrances that distort perception, corrupt the thinking and 
      maintain a deluded view.</P>
      <P>It is well known among serious students of Buddhism that the only way 
      to suppress these Five Hindrances is through the practice of Jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna. 
      As it says in the Nalakapāna Sutta (MN 68), in one who does not attain a 
      Jhāna, the Five Hindrances (plus discontent and weariness) invade the mind 
      and remain. Anything less than Jhāna is not powerful and lasting enough to 
      suppress the Five Hindrances sufficiently. So, even if you are practising 
      bare mindful</FONT>ness, with the Five Hindrances still active at a 
      subconscious level, you are not seeing things as they truly are, you are 
      seeing things as they seem, distorted by these Five Hindrances.</P>
      <P>Thus, in order to fulfil the Buddha&#39;s Teaching to B<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āhiya 
      and Venerable Mālunkyaputta, in order that &#39;in the seen will be merely 
      what is seen, in the heard will be merely what is heard, in the sensed 
      will be merely what is sensed, and in the cognized will merely be what is 
      cognized&#39; -- the Five hindrances have to be suppressed and that means 
      Jhāna!</P>
      </FONT><B>
      <P>Seeing Things as They Truly Are</P>
      </B>
      <P>It is true that the Five Hindrances become suppressed just prior to Jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna, 
      in what the commentaries accurately call upacāra samādhi, &#39;stillness of 
      mind at the threshold of Jhāna&#39; (my own translation). So, how can you know 
      for sure that these insidious Five Hindrances, which usually operate at a 
      subconscious level, are fully suppressed? How do you know if you are in 
      upacāra samādhi? The acid test for upacāra samādhi is that you can move 
      effortlessly over the threshold into first Jhāna! In upacāra samādhi, 
      there is no obstacle, no hindrance, between you and Jhāna. In just the 
      same way, you know that you are standing on the threshold of a house when 
      there is nothing between you and the room inside, when you can enter the 
      room easily. If you can&#39;t enter Jhāna, the Five Hindrances are still 
      there. So, to make sure they are gone, you try entering a Jhāna, and you 
      enter.</P>
      </FONT>
      <P>When the mind emerges from the Jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna, it 
      rests on the threshold, in upacāra samādhi, for a long time. Just like 
      when you leave a house, you stand on the threshold again. It is at this 
      point, during the period immediately after a Jhāna experience, when the 
      Five Hindrances no longer invade the mind and remain (according to the 
      above mentioned Nalakapāna Sutta), that one is finally able to practise 
      &#39;in the seen is merely what is seen, in the heard is merely what is heard, 
      in the sensed is merely what is sensed, and in the cognized is merely what 
      is cognized&#39;. As the Buddha repeatedly said (e.g. AN 6.50), only as a 
      result of Jhāna (sammā samādhi) does one see things as they are 
      (yathā-bhūta-</FONT>ñ<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ānadassanam) and not as 
      they seem.</P>
      </FONT><B>
      <P>The End of a View of Self</P>
      </B>
      <P>An experience of a Jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna can blow you 
      apart. What do I mean by that? I mean that the data supplied by the Jhāna 
      experience, contemplated just after in upacāra samādhi when the hindrances 
      cannot distort anything, destroys the delusion of self, soul, me and mine.</P>
      </FONT>
      <P>In the first Jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna mostly, and in the 
      higher Jhānas completely, the potential to do, will, choi</FONT>ce, what I 
      call &#39;the doer&#39;, has disappeared. The data is so clear, and the Five 
      Hindrances are no longer able to prevent you seeing that there is no-one 
      at the controls, to put it bluntly, of you body and mind. Will is not a 
      self, nor a product of a self. Will is just an impersonal natural process 
      that can come to an absolute cessation. You have seen this for yourself, 
      and you can trust this knowledge because it occurred when the corrupting 
      Five Hindrances were suppressed. This insight is the most certain that you 
      have ever known -- free will is a delusion. You, the reader, will be 
      incapable of agreeing with me. This is because your Five Hindrances are 
      still active and they will prevent you from seeing this. So, experience a 
      Jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna first, then investigate this matter 
      right after. Then try arguing with me!</P>
      </FONT>
      <P>Also, in Jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna, real Jhāna not fake ones, 
      the seen and the heard and the sensed all disappear. The external five 
      senses cease. This data is also so clear. When one reflects on the 
      complete absence of these five senses within the Jhāna experience, in the 
      hindrance-free state of post-Jhāna upacāra samādhi, one will see with 
      certainty that there is no self, soul or me observing the sight, hearing 
      the sounds or sensing the smells, tastes and touches. There is no s</FONT>elf, 
      soul or me, knowing the known. Consciousness, too, all forms, is seen as 
      an impersonal process that can come to a complete cessation. In short, you 
      are not identical with your mind. The mind is just a natural process. It 
      can completely stop. It does stop, once and for all, at Parinibb<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna! 
      Once again you, my reader, will be incapable of agreeing with me. The Five 
      Hindrances active within you now, under the surface of cognition, prevent 
      you from seeing the truth. It challenges your most basic view, the view 
      that &#39;You Are&#39;! Just don&#39;t worry about such disagreements for now. 
      Instead, meditate until you have experienced Jhāna and suppressed those 
      Five Hindrances. Then see if I&#39;m right!</P>

      <P>The Final Part of B<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āhiya&#39;s Teaching</P>
      </FONT></B>
      <P>&quot;B<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āhiya, you should train yourself thus: 
      in the seen will be merely what is seen, ... in the cognized will merely 
      be what is cognized. Practising in this way, Bāhiya, you will not be 
      &#39;because of that&#39;. When you are not &#39;because of that&#39;, you will not be &#39;in 
      that&#39;. And when you are not &#39;in tha</FONT>t&#39;, you will be neither here nor 
      beyond nor in between the two. Just this is the end of suffering.&quot;</P>
      <P>What does it mean &quot;you will not be &#39;because of that&#39;&quot;? The P<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āli 
      is <I>na tena</I>. <I>Tena </I>is the instrumental of the word for &#39;that&#39;. 
      Na is the negative. It means, l</FONT>iterally, &quot;not because of that, not 
      through that, not by that&quot;. It means in essence, you will not assume that 
      there is a self, a soul, a me; because of, through, or by; the seen or the 
      heard or the sensed or the cognized. The Buddha is saying that once you 
      have penetrated the truth of sensory experience, by suppressing the 
      Hindrances through Jh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āna, you will see that 
      there is no &#39;doer&#39;, nor a &#39;knower&#39;, behind sensory experience. No longer 
      will you be able to use sensory experience as evidence for a self. Des</FONT>cartes&#39; 
      famous &quot;I am because I think&quot; is refuted. You will not be because of 
      thinking, nor because of seeing, hearing or sensing. In the Buddha&#39;s 
      words, &quot;You will not be because of that (any sensory experience)&quot;.</P>
      <P>When the sensory processes are discarded as tenable evidence for a 
      self, a soul or a me, then you are no longer located in the sensory 
      experience. In the Buddha&#39;s words, &quot;You will not be &#39;in that&#39;&quot;. You no 
      longer view, perceive or even think that there is a &#39;me&#39; involved in life. 
      In the words of the doctor in the original series of Star Trek, &quot;It is 
      life, Jim, but not as we know it&quot;! There is no longer any sense of self, 
      or soul, at the centre of experience. You are no more &#39;in that&#39;.</P>
      <P>Just to close off the loophole that you might think you can escape 
      non-existence of a self or soul by identifying with a transcendental state 
      of being beyond what is seen, heard, sensed or cognized, the Buddha 
      thunders, &quot;and you will be neither here (with the seen, heard, sensed or 
      cognized) nor beyond (outside of the seen, heard, sensed or cognized) nor 
      in between the two (neither of the world nor beyond the world). The last 
      phrase comprehensively confounded the sophists!</P>
      <P>In summary, the Buddha advised both B<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āhiya 
      and Venerable Mālunkyaputta to experience the Jhānas to suppress the Five 
      Hindrances. Thereby one will discern with certainty the absence of a self 
      or a soul behind the sensory process. Consequently, sensory experience 
      will never again be taken as evidence of a &#39;knower&#39; or a &#39;doer&#39;: such that 
      you will never imagine a self or a soul at the centre of experience, nor 
      beyond, nor anywhere else. Bāhiya&#39;s Teaching put in a nutshell the way to 
      the realization of No-Self, Anattā. &quot;Just this&quot;, concluded the Buddha &quot;is 
      the end of suffering&quot;.</P>

      <P>Conclusion</P>
      </B>
      <P>I hope that my argument has been strong enough to challenge you, or 
      rather to confound the vipall<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">āsa driving your 
      sensory processes. The Buddha&#39;s brief teaching to Bāhiya and Venerable 
      Mālunkyaputta is not some short cut for the super intelligent. The 
      practice of &#39;in the seen will be merely what is seen...&#39; requires the 
      suppressing of the Five Hindrances. The suppressing of the Five Hindrances 
      requires Jhāna. Jhāna requires the rest of the Noble Eightfold Path,6 the 
      first seven factors. It requires faith in the Triple Gem, the keeping of 
      precepts and the practice of dāna. There is only one path to Nibbāna, and 
      that is the Noble Eightfold Path. There are no short cuts.</P>
