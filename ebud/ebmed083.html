        <P><I>A panel discussion with Ajahn Sumedho, Reverend Patricia Dai-en 
        Bennage, Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche and Gaylon Ferguson.</I></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000080"><I><STRONG>BUDDHADHARMA</STRONG><B>: I’d begin by 
      asking each of you to speak about your understanding of formless 
      meditation from the point of view of your tradition. In Zen, for example, 
      formless meditation often goes by the name of shikantaza, or “just 
      sitting.” Reverend Bennage, could you say more about that?</B></I></FONT></P>
      <P><STRONG>DAI-EN BENNAGE</STRONG>: Yes, we say “just sitting,” but the 
      “just” in “just sitting” doesn’t mean “just” in the usual way. It means 
      thoroughgoing, total sitting. It’s like the feeling you would have if you 
      were riding a horse at an incredible speed and you fell out of the saddle 
      and found yourself between the saddle and the ground. What kind of state 
      of mind would you have there?</P>
      <P>Shikantaza is thoroughgoing, total attention to everything, a 
      tremendously powerful practice. It’s like a huge gymnasium opens up in 
      front of you in which there are no lines of demarcation, no markers to go 
      by. You don’t know whether the space is for volleyball, basketball, or 
      what have you. You don’t know what to do with that immense space, but you 
      can learn to have deep trust. The abbot I trained with in Japan talked 
      about allowing ourselves to be babysat by the universe. Since the universe 
      is good, it takes no effort to be babysat by it. We simply allow ourselves 
      to be present. In Zen, we have a recitation: “Abandon myself to breathing 
      out and letting breathing in naturally still me. All that is left is an 
      empty cushion under the vast sky, the weight of a flame.” Abandoning 
      ourselves to breathing out means no effort. It means allowing the causes 
      and conditions of where we are in the universe—with our amount of sleep, 
      food and so on—to do the breathing for us. All that’s left is the great 
      emptiness and the vivacity of who we are.</P>
      <P><STRONG>TENZIN WANGYAL</STRONG>: In the Dzogchen tradition, the very 
      reason people are introduced to form practice is to introduce formless 
      practice, the nature of mind. The master introduces you to yourself. In 
      formless meditation, we abide without any judgment, without observer and 
      observed, abiding in the boundless view. Spontaneous meditation and 
      flexible action is what formless meditation really is. In the process of 
      doing it, we experience emptiness, clarity and bliss. However, if we grasp 
      for these, they do not work. You have to be aware but not grasp, which we 
      call “self-liberation.” For example, if you leave a hundred-dollar bill in 
      the street and you go back an hour later, you won’t find it. It is 
      self-liberated. Why? Because no one was grasping it, it went away.</P>
      <P>Formless meditation is ultimately about self-liberating the observer. 
      No one is grasping, because there is no observer to grasp. Everything is 
      effortlessly self-liberated into space. This is the experience of 
      emptiness, which in turn leads to fearlessness. With nothing there, there 
      is nothing to fear. Yet there is also unceasing clarity: the flow of life 
      never stops, experiences never stop. Everything is lively and fully there, 
      without anybody doing anything. This kind of clarity offers a deep 
      experience of hopelessness—not in a bad sense, but in a positive sense of 
      having no need to go anywhere or get anything. When the emptiness and 
      clarity, the fearlessness and hopelessness, are inseparable, it produces 
      the experience of bliss––happiness with no reason to be happy.</P>
      <P><STRONG>GAYLON FERGUSON</STRONG>: Formless meditation might appear more 
      mysterious than it is. There’s a sense in which the attitude of formless 
      meditation—which is not to manipulate whatever arises in our experience—is 
      there whether we’re doing practice with form or without form. There’s a 
      continuity between the two. Appreciating them both is a matter of 
      understanding the view of the teachers of the lineage; namely, that one 
      could practice without any gaining idea, without pushing anything away, 
      but nakedly and directly experiencing the vividness of whatever arises in 
      one’s experience, whether that’s emotional experience or perceptions of 
      the world. Nowness is really the essence of formless practice as well as 
      practice with form.</P>
      <P>Ironically, formless practice is the simplest of all, but we could 
      complicate it by talking about it. Although it is fundamentally 
      uncomplicated, within formless practice, there is still progression. The 
      Mahamudra tradition of formless practice speaks of four stages: 
      one-pointedness, stabilizing the mind in its own essence; simplicity, 
      where there are no further complications to deal with; one taste, the 
      seamlessness of non-duality; and finally non-meditation, not manipulating 
      the sacred world in any way. These are simply further levels of 
      spaciousness and vividness.</P>
      <P><STRONG>AJAHN SUMEDHO</STRONG>: In the Vipassana tradition, you begin 
      by examining the impermanence of conditions. After your practice deepens, 
      the sense of personal identity lessens and attention is awakened. Once you 
      realize the state of awakened attention—what we call the unconditioned, 
      stillness, or the still point of awareness—you gain perspective on 
      thoughts or emotions, the conditions of the present. You witness rather 
      than grasp and identify. With this recognition of inner light, insight 
      into the truth of cessation, you have direct insight into shunyata, 
      emptiness, or pure awareness, and anatman, non-self.</P>
      <P>At that point, we can cultivate and develop that reality. In our daily 
      life, we no longer seek identity and attachment to worldly conditions—the 
      sense of ourselves as a personality and the illusory world that most 
      people need for identification. This reality doesn’t need an object for 
      its existence. It’s a natural state of being that isn’t created or 
      dependent on conditions.</P>
      <P>Once there is realization of awareness and non-attachment, then there’s 
      no need to use form anymore, because the path of awareness is very clear. 
      Awareness does not require an object. Its natural state is not a created 
      state. Most people are always looking for something they conceive of or 
      that they imagine. Awareness—what we call the gate to the deathless—is 
      learning to realize this natural state of being. Then, we don’t need a 
      form any more. We can just be present with the existing forms as they rise 
      and cease. We can use form, but we don’t need it anymore, because our 
      insight embraces form rather than depends on form.</P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000080"><I><STRONG>BUDDHADHARMA</STRONG><B>: Would you 
      describe this as a practice or as an attainment?</B></I></FONT></P>
      <P><STRONG>AJAHN SUMEDHO</STRONG>: Attainment is a word I don’t use, 
      because it’s misleading. When you’re talking about attainment and 
      meditation, it sounds like you’ve got to get something you don’t have. The 
      Buddha was pointing to something quite obvious, suffering, which is a very 
      banal human experience. In investigating that truth, we let go of the 
      causes rather than attain anything. It’s a matter of relinquishing, 
      letting go—of <I>non</I>-attainment really—not trying to get anything but 
      to awaken fully to life, to see things through wisdom rather than 
      delusion. Wisdom isn’t an attainment; it’s a natural state we begin to 
      recognize and access through our attention to life, through awareness to 
      existence as it manifests.</P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000080"><I><STRONG>BUDDHADHARMA</STRONG><B>: Presumably 
      this is a condition that could exist whether you were in a formal practice 
      situation or walking about in the market?</B></I></FONT></P>
      <P><STRONG>AJAHN SUMEDHO</STRONG>: Yes, it integrates into the flow of 
      life because you’re not binding it to formal situations—even though you 
      certainly use formal meditation sessions as a means to cultivate this 
      attention through the four postures of sitting, standing, walking and 
      lying down. Some students get to this quickly; others take much longer. In 
      either case, I don’t let people delude themselves, thinking they have to 
      do something in order to become something. But obviously, to realize the 
      natural state of awareness that needs no object they need meditation 
      retreats and formal practice.</P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000080"><I><STRONG>BUDDHADHARMA</STRONG><B>: How do 
      meditation with form and formless meditation work together?</B></I></FONT></P>
      <P><STRONG>DAI-EN BENNAGE</STRONG>: My training was entirely in Japan. I 
      started with a Rinzai master, Omori Sogen Roshi, who told me straight off 
      that my Japanese was not good enough for me to do koan practice. 
      Therefore, I should practice shikantaza for three years before koan study 
      would be considered. He did teach me s<I>usokukan</I>, the counting of 
      exhalations. The spaciousness of formless meditation can be hard to 
      sustain, so I found the counting practice extremely helpful in dealing 
      with that huge space with no landmarks that would open up in front of me. 
      There are variations on this type of meditation with form, but I found 
      counting the most helpful. It’s a concentration practice that cuts down 
      outer distractions and helps you to get quickly and deeply to the breath.</P>
      <P>After three and a half years my teacher became too ill for us to 
      continue, and I found a teacher in the Soto tradition. I practiced 
      shikantaza, but they did not speak about using any form such as the 
      susokukan method as a support. I found, though, that I reverted to 
      susokukan in times of mental turmoil. I also found that when I felt more 
      concentrated I could let go of counting and be fine with the larger space 
      provided by shikantaza. I still teach that way. I don’t know if including 
      the possibility of counting exhalations is considered strict Soto Zen 
      shikantaza, but I feel it’s a tool people can use when they need it. To 
      this day, there are occasions when I revert to susokukan if, for example, 
      there is news from the war that might upset me. In so doing, I also 
      remember that, as our abbot said in Japan, no one graduates from this 
      practice. When I feel the need for and the benefit from going back to 
      counting, however briefly—perhaps not even as much as ten breaths—I too am 
      a student along with my students.</P>
      <P>Even though there is a branch of Soto that uses koan practice, the main 
      stem of Soto Zen is the shikantaza practice of seamless sitting. In order 
      to have formless practice, though, the forms around it are essential as a 
      support. Therefore, we put extreme emphasis on the quality of the seated 
      posture. We are not invited to allow ourselves to be more comfortable. We 
      are asked to deal with what comes up sitting in that position and to see 
      how often the pain is not physical. It comes from the mind. One young man 
      who was just beginning was struck by how much knee pain he had, but when 
      thoughts of fishing came to his mind, his knee pain disappeared. It showed 
      him how much of the pain is in the mind. One needs to understand this or 
      formless experience will not be possible.</P>
      <P>All of the myriad forms support the formless experience, especially in 
      the monastery, where I lived a cloistered life for twelve years. We didn’t 
      have interviews often, only if we really felt we had something to discuss 
      with a teacher. But our teachers never took their eyes off us—where we 
      were, the sound we made with our slippers, the way we reached for 
      something, the way we passed something to someone else, the tone of our 
      voice, our body language in standing at a distance or near to other 
      people. What we did on the cushion should be manifest when we stood up 
      and, as the Venerable Ajahn Sumedho said, it should be visible in sitting, 
      standing, lying down and walking.</P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000080"><I><STRONG>BUDDHADHARMA</STRONG><B> How do you 
      instruct someone in shikantaza, other than the close observation you were 
      just talking about?</B></I></FONT></P>
      <P><STRONG>DAI-EN BENNAGE</STRONG>: That comes through the practice of 
      deep trust, which is not easy in our culture. When students feel they need 
      a safety net, like the trapeze artist in the circus, they may consider 
      using the susokukan method. When they feel they don’t need that, they can 
      let it go and go back into the arena of the trust. They have a choice. And 
      the point is to see how little of the susokukan seems necessary.</P>
      <P><STRONG>TENZIN WANGYAL</STRONG>: In Dzogchen, we refer to form and 
      formless meditation as meditation with attributes and meditation without 
      attributes. It’s very traditional to do meditation with attributes before 
      going into meditation without attributes. The usual style of meditation 
      with attributes is <I>shiné</I>, calm abiding. We use external objects, 
      such as seed syllables. One might, for example, begin by meditating on a 
      white, luminous <I>AH</I> surrounded by a rainbow. Internally, we might 
      focus on a particular part of the body, such as the third eye area. We 
      also use the breath, of course. Sounds are good for people who need less 
      discipline. People who need more discipline need to focus on an external 
      object.</P>
      <P>One begins with effortful calm abiding, which develops into natural 
      calm abiding and finally into ultimate calm abiding, which is essentially 
      the beginning stages of formless meditation. At the effortful stage, one 
      is dealing with all the external problems that dominate us—sounds, 
      discomfort, movement of the thoughts, and so forth. One might also have 
      internal obstacles, such as falling asleep or becoming extremely creative, 
      having many ideas and projects. We regard these two as different kinds of 
      movement of the <I>prana</I> [wind, life force]. When it moves downward, 
      we have dullness. When it moves upward, we have agitation. Working with 
      all of these requires effort. We usually need to practice calm abiding for 
      a long time and follow strict rules, but it all comes down to being alert 
      in the moment and focusing on an object.</P>
      <P>Gradually you begin to develop stability. You find the calmness more 
      inside you than in the object. Eventually you feel the same kind of calm, 
      even if the object of meditation is removed. The form is less necessary; 
      form is fine, but without it you can still experience stability. That is 
      natural calm-abiding. The mind is clear, sharp and stable, and those 
      characteristics are still there when the objects are removed. It’s like 
      learning to drive. When you first learn to drive, you cannot turn on music 
      or do anything else at all. Gradually, people reach the point where they 
      can drink coffee, put on makeup, brush their hair and so on. That’s 
      natural driving or ultimate driving—so long as you’re not getting into 
      accidents. Once you achieve the ultimate calm abiding, you are abiding in 
      the nature of mind; there’s no sense of observer or observed. You abide in 
      ultimate stillness. When you are finally able to rest there, that’s 
      formless practice.</P>
      <P>This is a beginning level of formless practice, because you usually 
      cannot stay there long. There will always be obstacles, which at this 
      stage are largely internal obstacles. When I was a teenager I went into a 
      dark retreat—fifty days in a totally dark room. In the dark, you have lots 
      of visions. The distractions are obviously not outside, so you see just 
      how many obstacles you have inside. Since I was practicing this as a 
      teenager, which is rather common in Tibet, I had so much energy! It was 
      not an easy thing. It was an especially powerful way to reveal how much 
      internal movement arose as an obstacle to calm abiding.</P>
      <P><STRONG>AJAHN SUMEDHO</STRONG>: Naturally, you start people out from 
      the point where they are, which for most people is attachment to objects 
      and to ideas. You direct attention to very obvious existing conditions, 
      such as the inhalation, the exhalation, the physical body, the experience 
      of sitting, standing, walking and lying down. We point students to 
      impermanence; we get them to reflect on the changing of thoughts, of 
      history and so forth. Starting with the first noble truth, the point is to 
      use the awareness to notice the existing conditions one is experiencing, 
      such as thinking or emotional feeling. You can notice any conditioned 
      phenomenon—its arising, its presence and its absence. When you begin to 
      recognize the sensation of thought or emotional experience through this 
      development of awareness and you recognize how things arise and cease, 
      your relationship to them is no longer one of personal identity, which is 
      the second noble truth.</P>
      <P>Now one sees the nature of conditioned development in terms of <I>
      dhammas </I>[discrete building blocks of experience]. <I>Samskaras</I> 
      [mental formations] are seen as impermanent, and that which is aware of 
      the impermanence takes refuge in transcending the conditioned realm. You 
      are now at the gate to the deathless realm, the unconditioned. Allowing 
      things to cease in your mind, you have insight into the third noble truth 
      of cessation, the end of suffering or the end of an arising condition. 
      With this perspective on human existence, we have insight into the fourth 
      noble truth, the path of non-attachment, or non-identity with conditioned 
      phenomenon. At this point, there’s no need to use form anymore because the 
      path of awareness is very clear.</P>
      <P><STRONG>GAYLON FERGUSON</STRONG>: The beginning of practice in our 
      tradition, which is derived from both the Kagyü and Nyingma lineages of 
      Tibet, is closely related to what the others have discussed. Specifically, 
      we begin with shamatha and vipashyana, calm abiding and insight. The 
      student begins with mindfulness of body and mindfulness of the breathing 
      as objects, and then moves to some insight into the nature of reality and 
      on to an experience of spaciousness or egolessness. At that point, one 
      begins to work with compassion practices to awaken the heart, the 
      bodhicitta practices associated with Atisha. Those <I>lojong,</I> or 
      mind-training, practices often involve resting the mind in its basic 
      nature, in its fundamental goodness, as the basis for compassion practice.</P>
      <P>The full development of the formless aspect of this meditation path is 
      called Mahamudra in the Kagyü lineage and Maha Ati or Dzogchen in the 
      Nyingma lineage. In those advanced meditation practices, the essence of 
      mind is itself taken as the formless object of meditation. Alongside those 
      techniques, Vajrayana, or tantra, uses visualizations and mantras as part 
      of what’s called the development stage of a sadhana, a ritual practice 
      liturgy. The development stage is always accompanied by a completion 
      stage, in which you dissolve the visualization. You no longer rest your 
      mind on visualizing something or saying a mantra; you rest rather in the 
      essence of what you’ve been connecting with through the mantra recitation 
      and visualization. The completion stage of a sadhana practice, then, is 
      another instance of formless practice.</P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000080"><I><STRONG>BUDDHADHARMA</STRONG><B>: Where does 
      the stability of calm abiding fit into the visualization and mantra 
      practice?</B></I></FONT></P>
      <P><STRONG>GAYLON FERGUSON</STRONG>: The stability or the shamatha aspect 
      of visualizing and reciting is that your mind stays with what you’re 
      visualizing and reciting rather than wandering off to a laundry list of 
      other things. One can definitely develop shamatha further during 
      visualization; that’s part of its importance. It’s a way of developing a 
      deeper kind of stability, stability in some of the qualities of mind that 
      are represented by, let’s say, Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva of 
      compassion, or Manjushri, the bodhisattva of insight. One is resting one’s 
      mind in those very qualities by visualizing them in particular forms.</P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000080"><I><STRONG>BUDDHADHARMA</STRONG><B>: You have all 
      talked about intensive training as a prerequisite to formless meditation. 
      Sometimes one hears people saying they’re practicing formless meditation, 
      Dzogchen, for example, and after practicing for about a year, they claim 
      to have experiences of bliss and self-liberation. How do you know if 
      that’s genuine?</B></I></FONT></P>
      <P><STRONG>TENZIN WANGYAL</STRONG>: In the end, it’s very difficult to 
      know. You can never judge other people’s experience. You see, 99.9% of 
      people might not be having that kind of experience, but there might be 
      0.01% who could have that experience. How can we judge? We are trying to 
      define what’s happening in the moment and by so doing, we spoil it.</P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000080"><I><STRONG>BUDDHADHARMA</STRONG><B>: So if you 
      practice with Ajahn Sumedho, do you get a different kind of formless 
      meditation experience than if you practice with Reverend Bennage, or in 
      the Kagyü or Nyingma traditions? Are there different kinds of formless 
      meditation experience?</B></I></FONT></P>
      <P><STRONG>TENZIN WANGYAL</STRONG>: Of course, it’s very important to 
      define more precisely what formless meditation means. Does it simply mean 
      meditation without an external object? Does it refer to a feeling in the 
      body? Does it refer to whether you are focusing on the emotions in the 
      mind or not? As far as Dzogchen is concerned, formless practice does not 
      have much to do with emotions or feelings or external objects. Ultimately, 
      it’s about the observer. At some point you have to get beyond that. That’s 
      real formless meditation. Everything else is an approximation of formless 
      meditation, where you might say you are having experiences of bliss, for 
      example. You might indeed experience bliss, but there’s definitely 
      somebody who wants that bliss and does not want to let go of it. You 
      cannot say the experience is not bliss, but it’s not real formless 
      meditation. There’s no “object” per se, but meditation experiences become 
      objects.</P>
      <P><STRONG>GAYLON FERGUSON</STRONG>: This comparison of experience and 
      practice across traditions applies not just to formless meditation but to 
      meditation altogether. Is all Buddhist meditation in essence the same? 
      Certainly we hope that it’s all a matter of the wakefulness of the Buddha. 
      There’s an essence of wakefulness that is the nature of mind and it is 
      inseparable from the nature of reality. That understanding is held by all 
      the traditions. At the same time, there’s undoubtedly a different flavor 
      of practicing satipatthana, the Theravada tradition; practicing shikantaza 
      or zazen; or practicing formless meditation within a Vajrayana sadhana. 
      I’m sure the experience of a specific tradition has its particular flavor. 
      Do the others think that’s true?</P>
      <P><STRONG>DAI-EN BENNAGE</STRONG>: I do believe that the fruits of 
      practice come in many flavors, but that there is some commonality that we 
      see manifests itself in students as growing spaciousness and growing 
      acceptance over time. I think of the example of Brother David 
      Steindl-Rast, who was interested in beginning Zen practice with Shimano 
      Eido Roshi. He had to ask his superior for permission, and his superior 
      asked to meet the teacher first. After the meeting, Brother David asked 
      his superior, “What do you think?” He replied, “He spoke like a monk, he 
      moved like a monk, he acted like a monk, and I didn’t understand a single 
      word he said, but you may go and practice with him.”</P>
      <P>This commonality covers not only Buddhism but any practice of giving up 
      ego for the greater good of sentient beings. The flavors are also 
      important, but I’d like to hope that there is commonality that runs 
      through numerous traditions.</P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000080"><I><STRONG>BUDDHADHARMA</STRONG><B>: At times, 
      people might want to taste a lot of different flavors. Is it best to 
      remain with the style of meditation practice in one’s own tradition, or at 
      a certain point is it worth exploring and testing another flavor to see 
      where the commonality is?</B></I></FONT></P>
      <P><STRONG>AJAHN SUMEDHO</STRONG>: I can’t speak for anyone else, but I 
      would definitely say that as you have insight into formless reality, then 
      of course you could appreciate all the different methods or techniques. 
      It’s not as if you feel that yours is the only way to do it, because 
      emptiness, non-attachment, non-self, is the universal reality. It’s not 
      personal; it doesn’t belong to any group or tradition. It isn’t even 
      Buddhist.</P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000080"><I><STRONG>BUDDHADHARMA</STRONG><B>: If you’re 
      practicing in the Theravada tradition, for example, and you’re introduced 
      to shikantaza, would it be valid to say that you’re practicing the same 
      thing under another name?</B></I></FONT></P>
      <P><STRONG>AJAHN SUMEDHO</STRONG>: Well, I’ve not practiced those ways, so 
      I can’t speak from experience, but the reality of emptiness is the point 
      of it. If those ways of practice lead to that, then that’s excellent. Who 
      can argue with that? One has to follow where your interest and your faith 
      lies. If one has a particular affinity with a particular tradition, that’s 
      probably the right one to follow.</P>
      <P><STRONG>DAI-EN BENNAGE</STRONG>: Affinity is really important. It’s not 
      that one teacher is more skilled than another. I dearly loved and 
      venerated the first teacher I had, but in my forties I didn’t have the 
      physical stamina to work with the Rinzai tradition on that level. By 
      happenstance, I found a shikantaza tradition in which I could work broadly 
      and deeply. I tell students in the beginning that if they still have the 
      opportunity to go to other places to please take advantage of it now and 
      find the best working combination for them.</P>
      <P>In my own case I trained in one tradition, but I was interested in 
      Thich Nhat Hanh, because I wanted to see how the teaching was done in 
      English, since I had all of my training in Japanese. Our abbot was quiet 
      about this idea, but then she said, “Dai-En, you are so close to full 
      understanding, could you please wait? Once you recognize that, then go to 
      another style.” I followed her advice and I am glad I did, because I did 
      not confuse the two streams. I was clear on my primary training, and then 
      when I took that understanding to a different school there was no 
      confusion.</P>
      <P>Some students will come for a full introduction and then I won’t see 
      them again, and I might get in touch with them and they’ll say, “Well, I 
      have this foundation; now I can do it all on my own.” I respond by asking, 
      “Have you ever wondered why it’s important for teachers to be trained a 
      dozen years, fifteen years or more? What is available in that intensive 
      training?” Some understand that, but not everybody.</P>
      <P><STRONG>GAYLON FERGUSON</STRONG>: I think it’s important to stay with 
      one’s tradition and take it to some completion rather than spiritual 
      shopping or giving into spiritual materialism. I like Ajahn Samedho’s use 
      of the word <I>emptiness</I>, because it seems to me with formless 
      meditation we are talking about different ways of realizing emptiness or 
      resting in emptiness. And yet emptiness manifests in myriad ways through 
      the compassion of the Buddhas. They’ve given us these various 
      compassionate skillful means that have the different flavors we’re talking 
      about. One could have affinity with different aspects of the Buddha’s 
      wisdom that show up in different traditions. But it seems a misuse of that 
      skillfulness to hop from tradition to tradition prematurely.</P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000080"><I><STRONG>BUDDHADHARMA</STRONG><B>: If a student 
      asked you to compare shikantaza, silent illumination, Dzogchen and 
      Vipassana, how would approach that kind of question?</B></I></FONT></P>
      <P><STRONG>GAYLON FERGUSON</STRONG>: One would have needed to have 
      practiced in all those traditions.</P>
      <P><STRONG>DAI-EN BENNAGE</STRONG>: Correct. To actually taste each of 
      those—that’s a rare person. How can we open our mouths to make a judgment 
      about a style in which we have no experience, no guided training?</P>
      <P><STRONG>TENZIN WANGYAL</STRONG>: There are a few issues we are mixing 
      here. We are talking about formless meditation and we are also talking 
      about the commonality in different traditions. In essence, formless 
      meditation has got to be the same, because formless is formless. What 
      makes the difference is the form, how one is introduced to the form, the 
      development of the form, and how one enters into the formless from there. 
      These are the things that create the differences.</P>
      <P>In the buddhadharma, there are many tenet systems, doctrinal systems, 
      and as a result there are differences we have to acknowledge, for example 
      between Madhyamika and Cittamatra. In the monastery, people study these 
      for years and try to understand the fine points of difference. But these 
      differences do not mean one is good and the other is bad. The point is to 
      come to deeper understanding. For example, some aspects of Hinduism and 
      Shaivism seem so similar to Dzogchen. Are they really similar or not? 
      That’s a big question and it could be quite worthwhile to debate it.</P>
      <P>When it comes to the formless, every tradition has different ways to do 
      it. I always encourage students to listen to other teachers and to gain 
      more understanding, but it’s always important to have one thing that you 
      follow completely. That’s not a question of one being better than another; 
      it’s more a question of energy and time. If you’re focusing on too many 
      things, you might not have anything in the end.</P>
      <P>Formless meditation is supported by all sorts of forms in all sorts of 
      traditions. Not only that, it is supported by everyday human experience. 
      If you carry a big weight and walk for many miles and then you set it down 
      . . . imagine that moment. You say, “Aah,” and in that very moment you can 
      have a great life experience that does not belong to any tradition. It 
      needs no label. A moment of physical or emotional exhaustion can give you 
      great access to stillness. Everybody has that, even if they haven’t heard 
      one word of dharma.</P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000080"><I><STRONG>BUDDHADHARMA</STRONG><B>: Is that a 
      Dzogchen experience?</B></I></FONT></P>
      <P><STRONG>TENZIN WANGYAL</STRONG>: Sure. No doubt.</P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000080"><I><STRONG>BUDDHADHARMA</STRONG><B>: So the 
      Dzogchen tradition exists to bring about more of that kind of experience?</B></I></FONT></P>
      <P><STRONG>TENZIN WANGYAL</STRONG>: Yes, definitely. Dzogchen is unique in 
      that there is a sense of engaging less with the conceptual mind and 
      emotions. We do need to engage them to some degree because they are within 
      our experience, but we engage them minimally in achieving formless 
      experience.</P>
      <P><STRONG>GAYLON FERGUSON</STRONG>: Formless meditation is ultimately 
      about non-conceptual wisdom, so I would like to reiterate Reverend 
      Bennage’s point that the fruit of all of these practices, what we would 
      look for, would not be a matter of the technique or the practices 
      themselves. We would look for less fixation on self, more gentleness and 
      more compassion. That would be the proof of the pudding of formless 
      meditation.</P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000080"><I><STRONG>BUDDHADHARMA</STRONG><B>: Once a 
      student engages at the level of formless meditation practice, are there 
      still many obstacles and much work to do on the path? Are there still 
      dangers?</B></I></FONT></P>
      <P><STRONG>DAI-EN BENNAGE</STRONG>: This reminds me of when my Rinzai 
      master, Omori Sogen Roshi, gave <I>inka</I> to one of his monks. Even 
      though there is a certain sense of graduating at that point, an 
      acknowledgement of a level of understanding, Roshi still insisted that the 
      monk train with him three more years in order that he see with veracity 
      that he had that level of understanding and that he was not trapped by his 
      own understanding. Those three years turned out to be necessary.</P>
      <P>It is also important for those of us who have trained in a sangha to 
      see everyone as good dharma brothers or dharma sisters. It’s the notion of 
      “fare well.” I was once seen off with a farewell meal by a wonderful 
      Catholic priest, who was genuinely wishing me to fare well. If there is 
      someone whose nose-picking bothers you, you need to work on that kind of 
      thing as soon as possible, because you will focus on external objects 
      again and again. In my experience, our fellow monks and nuns were not only 
      our greatest challenges, they were also wonderful teachers. There were 
      times I wanted to quit and someone’s hands raised in gassho made me feel 
      ashamed and renewed my determination.</P>
      <P><STRONG>GAYLON FERGUSON</STRONG>: Taking pride in one’s practice or 
      building up one’s ego through practice is a possible obstacle at any point 
      along the path, whether we’re discussing practices with form or the 
      formless practices. One needs continual surrendering and giving in to the 
      genuineness of experience as opposed to building up any kind of conceptual 
      territory.</P>
      <P><STRONG>TENZIN WANGYAL</STRONG>: At this stage, one needs to look into 
      the nature of the obstacle itself. Take anger, for example. We think of 
      anger as having an external basis, so that if we let go of the source of 
      the anger, the anger is let go of. Again, we are focusing on the external 
      form. Better to look into the anger itself. It has energetic qualities, 
      pranic qualities. It travels in the channels [<I>nadis</I>] and on the 
      winds [<I>prana</I>]. There are subtler reasons for anger than the 
      appearance of pesky neighbors. One needs to go backward, inward, to the 
      subtlest karmic traces of mind.</P>
      <P>People want to change and transform, but by that they almost always 
      mean external situations. They continue to carry the same mind. If you 
      really need to change, you need to change not the appearance, but the 
      view.</P>
      <P><STRONG>AJAHN SUMEDHO</STRONG>: In the Theravada tradition, we speak of 
      progress on the path in terms of being released from the ten fetters. The 
      first ones have to do with being bound to the self as an individual 
      personality and then to our cultural conditioning. Then we are still stuck 
      with the existing conditions of consciousness in a human form and the 
      anger and fear that are not mere cultural conditioning. As further 
      awareness develops, attachment even to the body and subtle energies falls 
      away. The final relinquishment centers on a lingering sense of self. As we 
      give that up, we are accepted in the universe. For the arhat, there is no 
      more delusion.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, what keeps you going on the path is that as you 
      practice and develop, your sense of faith increases. I had a lot of doubt 
      and skepticism: did this brilliant philosophy have any practical 
      application to anything I was interested in doing? But as I began to 
      practice and live the life of the monk, I began to experience good 
      results. That began to increase my faith in the practice, which helped to 
      carry me through a lot of difficulties. You realize there is nothing else. 
      The vehicle is what you surrender to rather than trying to find the 
      perfect place to live, or the ideal companion to live with or a utopian 
      world. You are always balancing faith, <I>saddha</I>, with wisdom, <I>
      panna</I>. They work together.</P>
      <P>Eventually, I did a lot of meditation on space. The mind is always 
      looking for objects. In a monastery, for example, you get caught up with 
      your relationships with other monks and their personalities. I began to 
      develop an awareness of the spaces between the monks rather than simply 
      getting caught in, “This one I like; this one I don’t like.” I tell 
      students that instead of focusing on this one or that one, look 
      in-between, just using space.</P>
      <P>I found the most insight to sensory experience in listening to sounds 
      and recognizing the arising and ceasing of sound and then recognizing the 
      stillness, the still point in background of it all. That gave me a clear 
      sense of being very empty. It gave perspective. It wasn’t a style, but 
      rather a way of getting perspective on conditions as I experience them. 
      You begin working on levels of infinity, the immeasurableness of space, 
      stillness or silence. Then you are fully connected in consciousness to the 
      whole universe. You no longer feel separateness in terms of form or 
      convention. The formless doesn’t mean an absence of form. It just means 
      non-attachment to the form that exists in the present.</P>
