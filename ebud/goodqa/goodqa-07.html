    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">What do the terms wisdom and compassion mean in
    Buddhism? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some religions believe that compassion or love (the two
    are very similar) is the most important spiritual quality but they fail to develop any
    wisdom. The result is that you end up being a good-hearted fool, a very kind person but
    with little or no understanding. Other systems of thought, like science, believe that
    wisdom can best be developed when all emotions, including compassion, are kept out of the
    way. The outcome of this is that science has tended to become preoccupied with results and
    has forgotten that science is to serve man, not to control and dominate him. How,
    otherwise could scientists have lent their skills to develop the nuclear bomb, germ
    warfare, and the like. Religion has always seen reason and wisdom as the enemy of emotions
    like love and faith. Science has always seen emotions like love and faith as being enemies
    of reason and objectivity. And of course, as science progresses, religion declines.
    Buddhism, on the other hand, teaches that to be a truly balanced and complete individual,
    you must develop both wisdom and compassion. And because it is not dogmatic but based on
    experience, Buddhism has nothing to fear from science.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">So what, according to Buddhism, is wisdom? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The highest wisdom is seeing that in reality all phenomena
    are incomplete, impermanent, and not self. This understanding is totally freeing and leads
    to the great security and happiness which is called Nirvana. However, the Buddha
    doesn't speak too much about this level of wisdom. It is not wisdom if we simply
    believe what we are told. True wisdom is to directly see and understand for ourselves. At
    this level then, wisdom is to keep an open mind rather than being closed-minded, listening
    to other points of view rather than being bigoted; to carefully examine facts that
    contradict our beliefs, rather than burying our heads in the sand; to be objective rather
    than prejudiced and partisan; to take time about forming our opinions and beliefs rather
    than just accepting the first or most emotional thing that is offered to us; and to always
    be ready to change our beliefs when facts that contradict them are presented to us. A
    person who does this is certainly wise and is certain to eventually arrive at true
    understanding. The path of just believing what you are told is easy. The Buddhist path
    requires courage, patience, flexibility and intelligence. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">What is the point of Buddhism if only a few can
    practice it? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is true that not everyone is ready for Buddhism yet.
    But to say therefore that we should teach a religion that is false but easily
    understandable so everyone can practise it is ridiculous. Buddhism aims at the truth and
    if not everyone has the capacity to understand it yet, they perhaps will be ready for it
    in their next life. However, there are many who, with just the right words or
    encouragement, are able to increases their understanding. And it is for this reason that
    Buddhists gently and quietly strive to share the insights of Buddhism with others. The
    Buddha taught us out of compassion and we teach others out of compassion. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">What, according to Buddhism, is compassion? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Just as wisdom covers the intellectual or comprehending
    side of our nature. Like wisdom, compassion is uniquely human quality. Compassion is made
    up of two words. 'co' meaning together and 'passion' meaning a strong feeling. And this is
    what compassion is. When we see someone is in distress and we feel their pain as if it
    were our own, and strive to eliminate or lessen their pain, then this is compassion. So
    all the best in human beings, all the Buddha-like qualities like sharing, readiness to
    give comfort, sympathy, concern and caring - all are manifestations of compassion. You
    will notice also that in the compassionate person, care and love towards others has its
    origins in care and love for oneself. We can really understand others when we really
    understand ourselves. We will know what's best for others when we know what's
    best for ourselves. We can feel for others when we feel for ourselves. So in Buddhism,
    ones own spiritual development blossoms quite naturally into concern for the welfare of
    others. The Buddha's life illustrates this very well. He spent six years struggling
    for his own welfare, after which, he was able to be of benefit to the whole of mankind. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Isn't it selfish to say that we are best able to
    help others after we have helped ourselves. </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We usually see altruism, concern for others before
    oneself, as being the opposite of selfishness, concern for oneself before others,.
    Buddhism does no see it as either one or the other but rather as a blending of the two.
    Genuine self-concern will gradually mature into concern for others as one sees that others
    are really the same as oneself. This is genuine compassion. Compassion is the most
    beautiful jewel in the crown of the Buddha's teaching. </font></p>
