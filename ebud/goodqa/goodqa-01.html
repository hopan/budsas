    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-ooOoo-</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>What is Buddhism? </b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The name Buddhism comes from the word 'budhi' which means
    'to wake up' and thus Buddhism is the philosophy of awakening. This philosophy has its
    origins in the experience of the man Siddhartha Gotama, known as the Buddha, who was
    himself awakened at the age of 35. Buddhism is now 2,500 years old and has about 300
    million followers worldwide. Until a hundred years ago Buddhism was mainly an Asian
    philosophy but increasingly it is gaining adherents in Europe, Australia and America. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">So Buddhism is just a philosophy? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The word <I>&quot;philosophy&quot;</I> comes from two words 
    <I>'philo'</I> which
    means 'love' and <I>'sophia'</I> which means 'wisdom'. So philosophy is the love of wisdom or
    love and wisdom, both meanings describe Buddhism perfectly. Buddhism teaches that we
    should try to develop our intellectual capacity to the fullest so that we can understand
    clearly. It also teaches us to develop love and kindness so that we can be like a true
    friend to all beings. So Buddhism is a philosophy but not just a philosophy. It is the
    supreme philosophy. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Who was the Buddha? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the year 563 B.C. a baby was born into a royal family
    in northern India. He grew up in wealth and luxury but eventually found that worldly
    comforts and security do not guarantee happiness. He was deeply moved by the suffering he
    saw all around and resolved to find the key to human happiness. When he was 29 he left his
    wife and child and set off to sit at the feet of the great religious teachers of the day
    to learn from them. They taught him much but none really knew the cause of human suffering
    and how it could be overcome. Eventually, after six years study and meditation he had an
    experience in which all ignorance fell away and he suddenly understood.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From that day onwards, he was called the Buddha, the
    Awakened One. He lived for another 45 years in which time he travelled all over the
    northern India teaching others what he had discovered. His compassion and patience were
    legendary and he had thousands of followers. In his eightieth year, old and sick, but
    still happy and at peace, he finally died. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Wasn't it irresponsible for the Buddha to walk out
    on his wife and child?</strong> <br>
    <br>
    It couldn't have been an easy thing for the Buddha to leave his family. He must have
    worried and <br>
    hesitated for a long time before he finally left. But he had a choice, dedicating himself
    to his family or <br>
    dedicating himself to the whole world. In the end, his great compassion made him give
    himself to the whole world. And the whole world still benefits from his sacrifice. This
    was not irresponsible. It was perhaps the most significant sacrifice ever made. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha is dead so how can he help us? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Faraday, who discovered electricity, is dead, but what he
    discovered still helps us. Louis Pasteur who discovered the cures for so many diseases is
    dead, but his medical discoveries still save lives. Leonardo da Vinci who created
    masterpieces of art is dead, but what he created can still uplift and give joy. Noble men
    and heroes may have been dead for centuries but when we read of their deeds and
    achievements, we can still be inspired to act as they did. Yes, the Buddha is dead but
    2,500 years later his teachings still help people, his example still inspires people, his
    words still change lives. Only a Buddha could have such power centuries after his death. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Was the Buddha a god? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">No, he was not. He did not claim that he was a god, the
    child of a god or even the messenger from a god. He was a man who perfected himself and
    taught that if we follow his example, we could perfect ourselves also. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">If the Buddha is not a god, then why do people worship
    him? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are different types of worship. When someone
    worships a god, they praise him or her, making offerings and ask for favours, believing
    that the god will hear their praise, receive their offerings and answer their prayers.
    Buddhists do not indulge in this kind of worship. The other kind of worship is when we
    show respect to someone or something we admire. When a teacher walks into a room we stand
    up, when we meet a dignitary we shake hands,when the national anthem is played we salute.
    These are all gestures of respect and worship and indicate our admiration for persons and
    things. This is the type of worship Buddhist practise. A statue of the Buddha with its
    hands rested gently in its lap and its compassionate smile reminds us to strive to develop
    peace and love within ourselves. The perfume of incense reminds us of the pervading
    influence of virtue, the lamp reminds us of light of knowledge and the flowers which soon
    fade and die, reminds us of impermanence. When we bow, we express our gratitude to the
    Buddha for what his teachings have given us. This is the nature of Buddhist worship. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">But I have heard people say that Buddhists worship
    idols. </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Such statements only reflect the misunderstanding of the
    persons who make them. The dictionary defines an idol as &quot;an image or statue
    worshipped as a god&quot;. As we have seen, Buddhist do not believe that the Buddha was a
    god, so how could they possibly believe that a piece of wood or metal is a god? All
    religions use symbols to express various concepts. In Taoism, the ying-yang is used to
    symbolise the harmony between opposites. In Sikhism, the sword is used to symbolise
    spiritual struggle. In Christianity, the fish is used to symbolise his sacrifice. And in
    Buddhism, the statue of the Buddha also reminds us of the human dimension in Buddhist
    teaching, the fact that Buddhism is man-centred, not god-centred, that we must look within
    not without to find perfection and understanding. So to say that Buddhist worship idols is
    not correct. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Why do people burn paper money and do all kinds of
    strange things in Buddhist temples? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many things seem strange to us when we don't understand
    them. Rather than dismiss such things as strange, we should strive to find their meaning.
    However, it is true that Buddhist practice sometimes has its origin in popular
    superstition and misunderstanding rather than the teaching of the Buddha. And such
    misunderstandings are not found in Buddhism alone, but arise in all religions from time to
    time. The Buddha taught with clarity and in detail and if some fail to understand fully,
    the Buddha cannot be blamed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a saying: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">If a man suffering from a disease does not seek
      treatment even when there is a physician at hand, it is not the fault of the physician. In
      the same way, if a man is oppressed and tormented by the disease of defilements but does
      not seek the help of the Buddha, that is not the Buddha's fault. -- JN 28-9 </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nor should Buddhism or any religion be judged by those who
    don't practise it properly. If you wish to know the true teachings of Buddhism, read the
    Buddha's words or speak to those who understand them properly. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">If Buddhism is so good why are some Buddhist countries
    poor? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If by poor you mean economically poor, then it is true
    that some Buddhist countries are poor. But if by poor you mean a poor quality of life,
    then perhaps some Buddhist countries are quite rich. America, for example, is an
    economically rich and powerful country but the crime rate is one of the highest in the
    world, millions of old people are neglected by their children and die of loneliness in old
    people's homes, domestic violence and child abuse are major problems. One in three
    marriages end in divorce, pornography is easily available. Rich in terms of money but
    perhaps poor in terms of the quality of life. Now if you look at some traditional Buddhist
    countries you find a very different situation. Parents are honoured and respected by their
    children, the crime rates are relatively low, divorce and suicide are rare and traditional
    values like gentleness, generosity, hospitality to strangers, tolerance and respect for
    others are still strong. Economically backward, but perhaps a higher quality of life than
    a country like America. But even if we judge Buddhist countries in terms of economics
    alone, one of the wealthiest and most economically dynamic countries in the world today is
    Japan where 93% of the population call themselves Buddhist. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Why is it that you don't often hear of charitable work
    being done by Buddhists? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Perhaps it is because Buddhists don't feel the need to
    boast about the good they do. Several years ago the Japanese Buddhist leader Nikkho
    Nirwano received the Templeton Prize for his work in promoting inter-religious harmony.
    Likewise a Thai Buddhist monk was recently awarded the prestigious Magsaysay Prize for his
    excellent work among drug addicts. In 1987 another Thai monk, Ven.Kantayapiwat was awarded
    the Norwegian Children's Peace Prize for his many years work helping homeless children in
    rural areas. And what about the large scale social work being done among the poor in India
    by the Western Buddhist Order? They have built schools, child minding-centres,
    dispensaries and small scale industries for self-sufficiency. Buddhist see help given to
    others as an expression of their religious practice just as other religions do but they
    believe that it should be done quietly and without self-promotion. Thus you don't hear so
    much about their charitable work. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Why are there so many different types of Buddhism? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are many different types of sugar: brown sugar,
    white sugar, rock sugar, syrup and icing sugar but it is all sugar and it all tastes
    sweet. It is produced in different forms so that it can be used in different ways.
    Buddhism is the same: there is Theravada Buddhism, Zen Buddhism, Pure Land Buddhism,
    Yogacara Buddhism and Vajrayana Buddhism but it is all Buddhism and it all has the same
    taste - the taste of freedom. Buddhism has evolved into different forms so that it can be
    relevant to the different cultures in which it exists. It has been reinterpreted over the
    centuries so that it can remain relevant to each new generation. Outwardly, the types of
    Buddhism may seem very different but at the centre of all of them is the Four Noble Truths
    and the Eightfold Path. All major religions, Buddhism included, have split into schools
    and sects. But the different sects of Buddhism have never gone to war with each other and
    to this day, they go to each other's temples and worship together. Such tolerance and
    understanding is certainly rare. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>You certainly think highly of Buddhism. I suppose
    you think your religion is right and all the others are wrong. <br>
    </strong><br>
    No Buddhist who understands the Buddha's teaching thinks that other religions are wrong.
    No one who, has made a genuine effort to examine other religions with an open mind could
    think like that either. The first thing you notice when you study the different religions
    is just' how much they have in common. All religions acknowledge that man's present state
    is unsatisfactory. All believe that a change of attitude and behaviours is needed if man's
    situation is to improve. All teach an ethics that includes love, kindness, patience,
    generosity and social responsibility and all accept the existence of some form of
    Absolute. <br>
    <br>
    They use different languages, different names and different symbols to describe and
    explain these things; and it is only when they narrow­mindedly cling to their one way of
    seeing things that religious intolerance, pride and self­righteousness arise. <br>
    <br>
    Imagine an Englishman, a Frenchman, a Chinese and an Indonesian all looking at a cup. The
    Englishman says, &quot;That's a <em>cup</em>&quot;. The Frenchman answers, &quot;No it's
    not. It's a <em>tasse</em>&quot;. The Chinese comments, You're both wrong. It's a <em>
    pei</em>&quot;.
    And the Indonesian laughs at the others and says &quot;What fools you are. It's a <em>cawan</em>.&quot;
    The Englishman gets a dictionary and shows it to the others <br>
    saying, &quot;I can prove that it is a<em> cup</em>. My dictionary says so&quot;.
    &quot;Then your dictionary is wrong&quot;, says the French­man &quot;because my
    dictionary clearly says it is a <em>tasse</em>&quot;. The Chinese scoffs at them. &quot;My
    dictionary is thousands of years older than yours, so my dictionary must be right. And
    besides, more people speak Chinese than any other language, so it must be a <em>
    pei</em>&quot;.
    While they are squabbling and arguing with each other, a Buddhist comes up and drinks from
    the cup. After he has drunk, he says to the others, &quot;Whether you call it a <em>cup</em>,
    a <em>tasse</em>, a <em>pei</em> or a <em>cawan</em>, the purpose of the cup is <br>
    to be used. Stop arguing and drink, stop squabbling and refresh your thirst&quot;. This is
    the Buddhist attitude to other religions. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Is Buddhism scientific?</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Before we answer that question it would be best to define
    the word 'science'. Science, according to the dictionary is: &quot;knowledge which can be
    made into a system, which depends upon seeing and testing facts and stating general
    natural laws, a branch of such knowledge, anything that can be studied exactly&quot;.
    There are aspects of Buddhism that would not fit into this definition but the central
    teachings of Buddhism, the Four Noble Truths, most certainly would. Suffering, the First
    Noble Truth, is an experience that can be defined, experienced and measured. The Second
    Noble Truth states that suffering has a natural cause, craving,which likewise can be
    defined, experienced and measured. No attempted is made to explain suffering in terms of a
    metaphysical concept or myths. Suffering is ended, according to the Third Noble Truth, not
    by relying on upon a supreme being, by faith or by prayers but simply by removing its
    cause. This is axiomatic. The Fourth Noble Truth, the way to end suffering, once again,
    has nothing to do with metaphysics but depends on behaving in specific ways. And once
    again behaviour is open to testing. Buddhism dispenses with the concept of a supreme
    being, as does science, and explains the origins and workings of the universe in terms of
    natural law. All of this certainly exhibits a scientific spirit. Once again, the Buddha's
    constant advice that we should not blindly believe but rather question, examine, inquire
    and rely on our own experience, has a definite scientific ring to it. He says:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Do not go by revelation or tradition,do not go by
      rumour, or the sacred scriptures, do not go by hearsay or mere logic, do not go by bias
      towards a notion or by another person's seeming ability and do not go by the idea 'He is
      our teacher'. But when you yourself know that a thing is good, that it is not blameble,
      that it is praised by the wise and when practised and observed that it leads to happiness,
      then follow that thing.&quot; </font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So we could say that although Buddhism in not entirely
    scientific, it certainly has a strong overtone and is certainly more scientific than any
    other religion. It is significant that Albert Einstein, the greatest scientist of the
    twentieth century said of Buddhism: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The religion of the future will be a cosmic
      religion. It should transcend a personal God and avoid dogmas and theology. Covering both
      natural and spiritual, it should be based on a religious sense arising from the experience
      of all things, natural and spiritual and a meaningful unity. Buddhism answers this
      description. If there is any religion that would cope with modern scientific needs, it
      would be Buddhism.&quot;</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
