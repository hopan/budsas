    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-ooOoo-</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Other religions derive their ideas of right and wrong
    from the commandments of their god or gods. You Buddhists don't believe in a god, so how
    do you know right from wrong? </b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Any thoughts, speech or actions that are rooted in greed,
    hatred and delusion and thus lead us away from Nirvana are bad and any thoughts, speech or
    actions that are rooted in giving, love and wisdom and thus help clear the way to Nirvana
    are good.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To know what is right and wrong in god-centred religions,
    all that is needed is to do as you are told. But in a man-centred religion like Buddhism,
    to know what is right and wrong, you have to develop a deep self-awareness and self
    understanding. And ethics based on understanding are always stronger than those that are a
    response to a command.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So to know what is right and wrong, the Buddhist looks at
    three things - the intention, the effect the act will have upon oneself and the effect it
    will upon others. If the intention is good (rooted in giving, loving and wisdom), if it
    helps myself (helps me to be more giving, more loving and wiser), then my deeds and
    actions are wholesome, good and moral. Of course, there are many variations of this.
    Sometimes I act with the best of intentions but they may not benefit either myself or
    others. Sometimes my intentions are far from good, but my actions helps others
    nonetheless. Sometimes I act out of good intentions and my acts help me but perhaps cause
    some distress to others. In such cases, my actions are mixed - a mixture of good and
    not-so-good. When intentions are bad and the action helps neither myself nor others, such
    an action is bad. And when my intention is good and my action benefits both myself and
    others, then the deed is wholly good.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">So does Buddhism have a code of morality?</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes it does. The five precepts are the basis of Buddhist
    morality. The first precept is to avoid killing or harming living beings. The second is to
    avoid stealing, the third is to avoid sexual misconduct, the fourth is to avoid lying and
    the fifth is to avoid alcohol and other intoxicating drugs. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">But surely it is good to kill sometimes. To kill
    disease-spreading insects, for example, or someone who is going to kill you?</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It might be good for you. But what about that thing or
    that person? They wish to live, just as you do. When you decide to kill a
    disease-spreading insect, your intention is perhaps a mixture of self-concern (good) and
    revulsion (bad). The act will benefit yourself (good) but obviously it will not benefit
    that creature (bad). So at times it may be necessary to kill but it is never totally good.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">You Buddhists are too concerned about ants and bugs.</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhists strive to develop a compassion that is
    undiscriminating and all-embracing. They see the world as a unified whole where each thing
    and creature has its place and function. They believe that before we destroy or upset
    nature's delicate balance, we should be very careful. Just look at those cultures where
    emphasis is on exploiting nature to the full, squeezing every last drop out of it without
    putting anything back, conquering and subduing it. Nature has revolted. The very air is
    becoming poisoned, the rivers are polluted and dead, so many beautiful animal species are
    extinct, the slopes of the mountains are barren and eroded. Even the climate is changing.
    If people were a little less anxious to crush, destroy and kill, this terrible situation
    may have not arisen. We should all strive to develop a little more respect for life. And
    this is what the first precept is saying.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">The Third Precept says we should avoid sexual
    misconduct. What is &quot;sexual misconduct&quot;?</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we use trickery, emotioal blackmail or force to compel
    someone to have sex with us, then this is sexual misconduct. Adultery is also a form of
    sexual misconduct because when we marry we promise our spouse that we will be loyal to
    them. When we commit adultery we break that promise and betray that trust. Sex should be
    an expression of love and intimicy between two people and when it is it contributes to our
    mental and emotional well-being. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Is sex before marriage a type of sexual misconduct?</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Not if there is love and mutual agreement between two
    people. However, it should never be forgotten that the biological function of sex is to
    reproduce and if an unmarried woman becomes pregnant it can cause a great deal of
    problems. Many mature and thoughtful people think it is far better to leave sex until
    after marriage.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">But what about lying? Is it possible to live without
    telling lies?</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If it is really impossible to get by in society or
    business without lying, such a shocking and corrupt state of affairs should be changed.
    The Buddhist is someone who resolves to do something practical about the problem by trying
    to be more truthful and honest.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Well, what about alcohol? Surely a little drink doesn't
    hurt!</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">People don't drink for the taste. When they drink alone it
    is in order to seek release from tension and when they drink socially, it is usually to
    conform. Even a small amount of alcohol distorts consciousness and disrupts
    self-awareness. Taken in large quantities, its effects can be devastating.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Drinking a small amount wouldn't be really breaking the
    precept, would it? It's only a small thing.</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, it is only a small thing and if you can't practise
    even a small thing, your commitment and resolution isn't very strong, is it?</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">The five precepts are negative. They tell you what not
    to do. They don't tell you what to do.</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Five Precepts are the basis of Buddhist morality. They
    are not all of it. We start by recognizing our bad behaviour and striving to stop doing
    it. That is what the Five Precepts are for. After we have stopped doing bad, we then
    commence to do good. Take for example, speech. The Buddha says we should start by
    refraining from telling lies. After that, we should speak the truth, speak gently and
    politely and speak at the right time. He says:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Giving up false speech he becomes a speaker of
      truth, reliable, trustworthy, dependable, he does not deceive the world. Giving up
      malicious speech he does not repeat there what he has heard here what he has heard there
      in order to cause variance between people. He reconciles those who are divided and brings
      closer together those who are already friends. Harmony is his joy, harmony is his delight,
      harmony is his love; it is the motive of his speech. Giving up harsh speech his speech is
      blameless, pleasing to the ear, agreeable, going to the heart, urbane, liked by most.
      Giving up idle chatter he speaks at the right time, what is correct to the point, about
      Dhamma and about discipline. He speaks words worth being treasured up, seasonable,
      reasonable, well defined and to the point</i>&quot;.</font></p>
