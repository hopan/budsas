    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-ooOoo-</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Buddhists should be vegetarians, shouldn't they? </b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Not necessarily. The Buddha was not a vegetarian. He did
    not teach his disciples to be vegetarians and even today, there are many good Buddhists
    who are not vegetarians. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">If you eat meat you are indirectly responsible the
    death of a creature. Isn't that breaking the first precept? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is true that when you eat meat, you are indirectly and
    partially responsible for killing a creature but the same is true when you eat vegetables.
    The farmer has to spray his crop with insecticides and poisons so that the vegetables
    arrive on your dinner plates without holes in them. And once again, animals have been used
    to provide the leather for your belt or handbag, oil for the soap you use and a thousand
    other products as well. It is impossible to live without, in some way, being indirectly
    responsible for the death of some other beings. This is just another example of the First
    Noble Truth, ordinary existence is suffering and unsatisfactory. When you take the First
    Precept, you try to avoid being directly responsible for killing beings. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Mahayana Buddhists don't eat meat ...</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">That is not correct. Mahayana Buddhism in China laid great
    stress on being vegetarian but both the monks, laymen and women of the Mahayana tradition
    in Japan and Tibet usually eat meat. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">But I still think that a Buddhist should be vegetarian.
    </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If there was a man who was a very strict vegetarian but
    who was selfish, dishonest and mean, and another man who was not a vegetarian but who was
    thoughtful of others, honest, generous and kind, which of these two people would be the
    better Buddhist? </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">The person who was honest and kind. </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Why? </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Because such a person obviously has a good heart. </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Exactly. One who eats meat can have a pure heart just as
    one who does not eat meat can have an impure heart. In the Buddha's teachings, the
    important thing is the quality of your heart, not the contents of your diet. Many
    Buddhists take great care never to eat meat buy they are not concerned about being
    selfish, dishonest, cruel or jealous. They change their diet which is easy to do, while
    neglecting to change their hearts, which is a difficult thing to do. So whether you are a
    vegetarian or not, remember that the purification of the mind is the most important thing
    in Buddhism. </font></p>
