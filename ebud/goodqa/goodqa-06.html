    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>What is meditation? </b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Meditation is a conscious effort to change how the mind
    works. The Pali word for meditation is <I>'bhavana'</I> which means 'to make grow' or 'to
    develop'. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Is meditation important? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, it is. No matter how much we may wish to be good, if
    we cannot change the desires that make us act the way we do, change will be difficult. For
    example, a person may realise that he is impatient with his wife and he may promise
    himself, &quot;From now on I am not going to be so impatient&quot; But an hour later he
    may be shouting at his wife simply because, not being aware of himself, impatience has
    arisen without him knowing it. Meditation helps to develop the awareness and the energy
    needed to transform ingrained mental habit patterns. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">I have heard that meditation can be dangerous. Is this
    true? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To live, we need salt. But if you were to eat a kilogram
    of salt ;it would kill you. To live in the modern world you need a car but if you
    don't follow the traffic rules or if you drive while you are drunk, a car becomes a
    dangerous machine. Meditation is like this, it is essential for our mental health and
    well-being but if you practise in stupid ways it could cause problems. Some people have
    problems like depression, irrational fears or schizophrenia, they think meditation is an
    instant cure for their problem. They start meditating and sometimes their problem gets
    worse. If you have such a problem, you should seek professional help and after you are
    better then take up meditation. Other people over reach themselves, they take up
    meditation. and instead of going gradually, step by step, they meditate with too much
    energy for too long and soon they are exhausted. But perhaps most problems in meditation
    are caused by 'kangaroo meditation'. Some people go to one teacher and do his meditation
    technique for a while, then they read something in a book and decide to try that
    technique, then a week later a famous meditation teacher visits town and so they decide to
    incorporate some of his ideas into their practise and before long they are hopelessly
    confused. Jumping like a kangaroo from one meditation technique to another is a mistake.
    But if you don't have any severe mental problems and you take up meditation and
    practise sensibly it is one of the best things you can do for yourself. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">How many types of meditation are there? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha taught many different types of meditation, each
    designed to overcome a particular problem or to develop a particular psychological state.
    But the two most common and useful types of meditation are Mindfulness of Breathing
    <I>(anapana sati)</I> and Loving-kindness Meditation <I>(metta bhavana)</I>. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">How do you practise Mindfulness of Breathing? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">You would follow this easy steps: the four Ps: place,
    posture, practice and problems. First, find a suitable place, perhaps a room that is not
    too noisy and where you are not likely to be disturbed. Second, sit in a comfortable
    posture. A good posture is to sit with your legs folded, a pillow under your buttocks,
    your back straight, the hands nestled in the lap and the eyes closed. Alternatively, you
    can sit in a chair as long as you keep your back straight. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Next comes the actual practice itself. As you sit quietly
    with your eyes closed you focus your attention on the in and out movement of the breath.
    This can be done by counting the breaths or watching the rise and fall of the abdomen.
    When this is done, certain problems and difficulties will arise. You might experience
    irritating itches on the body or discomfort in the knees. If this happens, try to keep the
    body relaxed without moving and keep focusing on the breath. You will probably have many
    intruding thoughts coming into your mind and distracting your attention from the breath.
    The only way you can deal with this problem is to patiently keep returning your attention
    to the breath. If you keep doing this, eventually thoughts will weaken, your concentration
    will become stronger and you will have moments of deep mental calm and inner peace. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">How long should I meditate for? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is good to do meditation for 15 minutes every day for a
    week and then extend the time by 5 minutes each week until you are meditating for 45
    minutes. After a few weeks of regular daily meditation you will start to notice that your
    concentration gets better, there are less thoughts, and you have moments of real peace and
    stillness. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">What about Loving Kindness Meditation? How is that
    practised? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once you are familiar with Mindfulness of Breathing and
    are practising it regularly you can start practising Loving Kindness Meditation. It should
    be done two or three times each week after you have done Mindfulness of Breathing. First,
    you turn your attention to yourself and say to yourself words like &quot;May I be well and
    happy. May I be peaceful and calm. May I be protected from dangers. May my mind be free
    from hatred. May my heart be filled with love. May I be well and happy.&quot; Then one by
    one you think of a loved person, a neutral person, that is , someone you neither like nor
    dislike, and finally a disliked person, wishing each of them well as you do so. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">What is the benefit of doing this type of meditation? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you do Loving Kindness Meditation regularly and with
    the right attitude, you will find very positive changes taking place within yourself. You
    will find that you are able to be more accepting and forgiving towards yourself. You will
    find that the feelings you have towards your loved ones will increase. You will find
    yourself making friends with people you used to be indifferent and uncaring towards, and
    you will find the ill-will or resentment you have towards some people will lessen and
    eventually be dissolved. Sometimes if you know of someone who is sick, unhappy or
    encountering difficulties you can include them in your meditation and very often you will
    find their situation improving. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">How is that possible? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The mind, when properly developed, is a very powerful
    instrument. If we can learn to focus our mental energy and project it towards others, it
    can have an effect upon them. You may have had an experience like this. Perhaps you are in
    a crowded room and you get this feeling that someone is watching you. You turn around and,
    sure enough, someone is staring at you. What has happened is that you have picked up that
    other person's mental energy. Loving Kindness Meditation is like that. We project
    positive mental energy towards and it gradually transforms them. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Do I need a teacher to teach me meditation? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A teacher is not absolutely necessary but personal
    guidance from someone who is familiar with mediation is certainly helpful. Unfortunately,
    some monks and laymen set themselves up as meditation teachers when they simply don't
    know what they are doing. Try to pick a teacher who has a good reputation, a balanced
    personality and one who adheres closely to the Buddha's teachings. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">I have heard that meditation is widely used today by
    psychiatrists and psychologists. Is this true? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, it is. Meditation is now accepted as having a highly
    therapeutic effect upon the mind and is used by many professional mental health workers to
    help induce relaxation, overcome phobias and bring about self-awareness. The Buddha's
    insights into the human mind are helping people as much today as they did in ancient
    times. </font></p>
