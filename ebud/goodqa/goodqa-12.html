    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-ooOoo-</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>What you say so far is very interesting to me. How do I
    become a Buddhist?&nbsp; </b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once there was a man called Upali. He was the follower of
    another religion and he went to the Buddha in order to argue with him and try to convert
    him. But after talking to the Buddha, he was so impressed that he decided to become a
    follower of the Buddha. But the Buddha said:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Make a proper investigation first. Proper
      investigation is good for a well-known person like yourself.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Now I am even more pleased and satisfied when the
      Lord says to me: 'Make a proper investigation first.' For if members of another religion
      had secured me as a discipline they would have paraded a banner all around the town
      saying: 'Upali has joined our religion.' But the Lord says to me: Make a proper
      investigation first. Proper investigation is good for a well-known person like
      yourself.&quot;</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Buddhism, understanding is the most important thing and
    understanding takes time. So do not impulsively rush into Buddhism. Take your time, ask
    questions, consider carefully, and then make your decision. The Buddha was not interested
    in having a large number of disciples. He was concerned that people should follow his
    teachings as a result of a careful investigation and consideration of the facts.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">If I have done this and find the Buddha's teaching
    acceptable, what would I do then if I wanted to become a Buddhist? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If would be best to join a good temple or Buddhist group,
    support them, be supported by them and continue to learn more about the Buddha's
    teachings. Then, when you are ready, you would formally become a Buddhist by taking the
    Three Refuges.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">What are the Three Refuges?</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A refuge is a place where people go when they are
    distressed or when they need safety and security. There are many types of refuges. When
    people are unhappy, they take refuge with their friends, when they are worried and
    frightened, they may take refuge in false hopes and beliefs. As they approach death, they
    might take refuge in the belief in an eternal heaven. But, as the Buddha says, none of
    these are true refuges because they do not give comfort and security based on reality.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">Truly these are not safe refuges,<br>
      not the refuge supreme.<br>
      Not the refuge whereby one is<br>
      freed from all sorrow.<br>
      But to take refuge in the <br>
      Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha<br>
      and to see with real understanding<br>
      the Four Noble Truths.<br>
      Suffering, the cause of suffering,<br>
      the transcending of suffering and<br>
      the Noble Eightfold Path that leads<br>
      to the transcending of suffering.<br>
      This indeed is a safe refuge,<br>
      it is the refuge supreme.<br>
      It is the refuge whereby one is<br>
      freed from all suffering.</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Taking Refuge in the Buddha is a confident acceptance of
    the fact that one can become fully enlightened of the fact that one can become fully
    enlightened and perfected just as the Buddha was. Taking Refuge in the Dhamma means
    understanding the Four Noble Truths and basing one's life on the Noble Eightfold Path.
    Taking Refuge in the Sangha means looking for support, inspiration and guidance from all
    who walk the Noble Eightfold Path. Doing this one becomes a Buddhist and thus takes the
    first step on the path towards Nirvana.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">What changes have taken place in your life since you
    first took the three refuges?</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Like countless millions of others over the last 2,500
    years, I have found that the Buddha's teachings have made sense out of a difficult world,
    they have given meaning to what was a senseless life, they have given me a humane and
    compassionate ethics with which to lead my life and they have shown me how I can attain a
    state of purity and perfection in the next life. A poet in ancient India once wrote of the
    Buddha: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">To go to him for refuge, to sing his praise, to do <br>
      him honour and to abide in his Dhamma is to <br>
      act with understanding.</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I agree with these words completely.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">I have a friend who is always trying to convert me to
    his religion. I am not really interested in his religion and I have told him so but he
    won't leave me alone. What can I do? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first thing you must understand is that this person is
    not really your friend. A true friend accepts you as you are and respects your wishes. I
    suspect that this person is merely pretending to be your friend so he can convert you.
    When people are trying to impose their will on you they are certainly not friends.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">But he says he wants to share his religion with me.</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sharing your religion with others is a good thing. But I
    suggest that your friend doesn't know the difference between sharing and imposing. If I
    have an apple, I offer you half and you accept my offer, then I have shared with you. But
    if you say to me &quot;Thank you, but I have already eaten&quot; and I keep insisting that
    you take half the apple until you finally give in to my pressure, this can hardly be
    called sharing. People like your 'friend' try to disguise their bad behaviour by calling
    it 'sharing', 'love', or 'generosity', but by whatever name they call it, their behaviour
    is still just rude, bad manners and selfish.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">So how can I stop him?</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is simple. Firstly, be clear in your mind what you
    want. Secondly, clearly and briefly tell him so. Thirdly, when he asks you questions like
    &quot;What is your belief on this matter?&quot; or &quot;Why don't you wish to come to the
    meeting with me?&quot;, clearly, politely and persistently repeat your first statement.
    <I>&quot;Thank you for your invitation but I would rather not come&quot;.</I></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Why not?&quot;<BR>
    <I>- &quot;That is really my business. I would rather not
    come.&quot;</I></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;But there will be many interesting people
    there.&quot;<BR>
    <I>- &quot;I am sure there will be but I would rather not
    come.&quot;</I></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I am inviting you because I care about you.&quot;<BR>
    <I>- &quot;I am glad you care about me but I would rather not
    come.&quot;</I></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you clearly, patiently and persistently repeat yourself
    and refuse to allow him to get you involved in a discussion he will eventually give up. It
    is a shame that you have to do this, but it is very important for people to learn that
    they cannot impose their beliefs or wishes upon others.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Should Buddhists try to share the Dhamma with others?</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, they should. And I think most Buddhists understand
    the difference between sharing and imposing. If people ask you about Buddhism, tell them.
    You can even tell them about the Buddha's teachings without their asking. But if, by
    either their words or actions, they let you know that they are not interested, accept that
    and respect their wishes. It is also important to remember that you let people know about
    the Dhamma far more effectively through your actions than through preaching to them. Show
    people the Dhamma by always being considerate, kind, tolerant, upright and honest. Let the
    Dhamma shine forth through your speech and actions. If each of us, you and I, know the
    Dhamma thoroughly, practise it fully and share it generously with others, we can be of
    great benefit to ourselves and others also.</font></p>
