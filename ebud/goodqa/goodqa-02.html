    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-ooOoo-</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">What are the main teachings of the Buddha? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All of the many teachings of the Buddha centre on the Four
    Noble Truths, just as the rim and spokes of a wheel centres on the hub. They are called
    'Four' because there are four of them. They are called 'Noble' because they ennoble one
    who understands them and they are called 'Truths' because, corresponding with reality,
    they are true. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">What is the First Noble Truth? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The First Noble Truth is that life is suffering. To live,
    you must suffer. It is impossible to live without experiencing some kind of suffering. We
    have to endure physical suffering like sickness, injury, tiredness, old age and eventually
    death and we have to endure psychological suffering like loneliness, frustrations, fear,
    embarrassment, disappointment, anger, etc. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Isn't this a bit pessimistic? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The dictionary defines pessimism as 'the habit of thinking
    that whatever will happen will be bad,' 'or 'The belief that evil is more powerful than
    good.' Buddhism teaches neither of these ideas. Nor does it deny that happiness exists. It
    simply says that to live is to experience physical and psychological suffering which is a
    statement that is so obvious that it cannot be denied. The central concept of most
    religions is a myth, a legend or a belief that is difficult or impossible to verify.
    Buddhism starts with an experience, an irrefutable fact, a thing that all know, that all
    have experienced and that all are striving to overcome. Thus Buddhism is truly a universal
    religion because it goes right to the core of every individual human being's concern with
    suffering and how to avoid it. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">What is the Second Noble Truth? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Second Noble Truth is that all suffering is caused by
    craving. When we look at psychological suffering, it is easy to see how it is caused by
    craving. When we want something but are unable to get it, we feel frustrated. When we
    expect someone to live up to our expectation and they do not, we feel let down and
    disappointed. When we want others to like us and they don't, we feel hurt. Even when we
    want something and are able to get it, this does not often lead to happiness either
    because it is not long before we feel bored with that thing, lose interest in it and
    commence to want something else. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Put simply, the Second Noble Truth says that getting what
    you want does not guarantee happiness. Rather than constantly struggling to get what you
    want, try to modify your wanting. Wanting deprives us of contentment and happiness. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">But how does wanting and craving lead to physical
    suffering? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A lifetime wanting and craving for this and that and
    especially the craving to continue to exist creates a powerful energy that causes the
    individual to be reborn. When we are reborn, we have a body and, as we said before, the
    body is susceptible to injury and disease; it can be exhausted by work; it ages and
    eventually dies. Thus, craving leads to physical suffering because it causes us to be
    reborn. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">If we stop wanting altogether, we would never achieve
    anything. </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">True. But what the Buddha says is that when our desires,
    our craving, our constant discontent with what we have and our continual longing for more
    and more does cause us suffering,then we should stop doing it. He asks us to make a
    difference between what we need and what we want and to strive for our needs and modify
    our wants. He tells us that our needs can be fulfilled but that our wants are endless - a
    bottomless pit. There are needs that are essential, fundamental and can be obtained and
    this we should work towards. Desires beyond this should be gradually lessened. After all,
    what is the purpose of life? To get or be content and happy. </font></p>
    <B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What is the 
    Third Noble Truth?</FONT></B><P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Third Noble Truth is that suffering can 
    be overcome and happiness attained. This is perhaps the most important of 
    the Four Noble Truths because in it the Buddha reassures us that true 
    happiness and contentment are possible. When we give up useless craving and 
    learn to live each day at a time, enjoying without restlessly wanting the 
    experiences that life offers us, patiently enduring the problems that life 
    involves, without fear, hatred and anger, then we become happy and free. 
    Then, and then only, do we begin to live fully. Because we are no longer 
    obsessed with satisfying our own selfish wants, we find that we have so much 
    time to help others fulfil their needs. This state is called Nirvana. We are 
    free from psychological suffering. </FONT></P>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">What or where is Nirvana? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is a dimension transcending time and space and thus is
    difficult to talk about or even think about. Words and thoughts being only suited to
    describe the time-space dimension. But because Nirvana is beyond time, there is no
    movement and so no aging or dying. Thus Nirvana is eternal because it is beyond space,
    there is no causation, no boundary, no concept of self and not-self and thus Nirvana is
    infinite. The Buddha also assures us that Nirvana is an experience of great happiness. He
    says: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Nirvana is the highest happiness&quot;.
      (Dhammapada 204 )</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">But is there proof that such a dimension exist? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">No, there is not. But its existence can be inferred. If
    there is a dimension where time and space do operate and there is such a dimension - the
    world we experience, then we can infer that there is a dimension where time and space do
    not operate - Nirvana. Again, even though we cannot prove Nirvana exists, we have the
    Buddha's word that is does exist. He tells us: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;<i>There is an unborn, a not-become, a not- made, a
      not-compounded. If there were not, this unborn, not-made, not-compounded, there could not
      be made any escape from what is born, become, made, and compounded. Therefore is there
      made known an escape from what is born, made, and compounded.&quot; -- Ud 80 </font></p>
      </i>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We will know it when we attain it. Until that time, we can
    practise. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">What is the Fourth Noble Truth? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Fourth Noble Truth is the Path leading to the
    overcoming of suffering. This path is called the Noble Eightfold Path and consists of
    Perfect Understanding, Perfect Thought, Perfect Speech, Perfect Action, Perfect
    Livelihood, Perfect Effort, Perfect Mindfulness, and Perfect Concentration. Buddhist
    practice consist of practising these eight things until they become more complete. You
    will notice that the steps on the Noble Eightfold Path cover every aspect of life: the
    intellectual, the ethical and economic and the psychological and therefore contains
    everything a person needs to lead a good life and to develop spiritually. </font></p>
