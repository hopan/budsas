    <P><B>The monastic institution is an important one in Buddhism. What is the 
    purpose of monks and nuns and what are they supposed to do? </B></P>
    <P>The Buddha's purpose in founding an order of monks and nuns was to 
    provide an environment in which spiritual development would be easier. The 
    lay community provide monks and nuns with their basic needs - food, 
    clothing, shelter, and medicine - so they can devote their time to the study 
    and practice of the Dhamma. The ordered and simple lifestyle of the 
    monastery is conducive to inner peace and meditation. In return, monks and 
    nuns are expected to share what they know with the community and act as an 
    example of how the good Buddhist should live. In actual practice this basic 
    mission has sometimes been extended far beyond what the Buddha originally 
    intended and today monks and nuns sometimes act as school teachers, social 
    workers, artists, doctors, even politicians. Some have argued that taking 
    such roles is alright if it helps promote Buddhism. Others point out that by 
    doing such things monks and nuns too easily get entangled in worldly 
    problems and forget the purpose they went to the monastery in the first 
    place. </P>
    <P><B>What kind of person becomes a monk or a nun?</B></P>
    <P>Most people have a variety of interests in their lives - family, career, 
    hobbies, politics, religion etc. Of these interests one will be primary, 
    usually family or career, while the others will be less important to them. 
    When the study and practice of the Buddha's teachings becomes the most 
    important thing in the person's life, when that takes precedence over all 
    other things, then that person will probably be interested in becoming a 
    monk or a nun. </P>
    <P><B>Do you have to be a monk or a nun to become enlightened? </B></P>
    <P>Of course not. Some of the Buddha's most accomplished disciples were lay 
    men and women. Some were spiritually developed enough to instruct the monks. 
    In Buddhism the level of one's understanding is the most important thing and 
    that has nothing to do with whether one wears a yellow robe or blue jeans, 
    or whether one lives in a monastery or a home. Some might find the 
    monastery, with all its advantages and disadvantages to be the best 
    environment in which to spiritually grow. Others may find the home, with all 
    its joys and sorrows, to be the best. Everyone is different. </P>
    <P><B>Why do Buddhist monks and nuns wear a yellow robe? </B></P>
    <P>When the ancient Indians looked into the jungle they could always tell 
    which leaves were about to drop from the tree, because they were either 
    yellow, orange or brown. Consequently, in India, yellow became the colour of 
    renunciation. Monks and nuns robes are yellow so they can act as a constant 
    reminder of the importance of not clinging, of letting go, of giving up.</P>
    <P><B>Becoming a monk is all very well but what would happen if everyone 
    became a monk? </B></P>
    <P>One could ask the same thing about any vocation. &quot;Becoming a dentist is 
    all very well but what would happen if everyone became a dentist? There'd be 
    no teachers, no cooks, no taxi drivers.&quot; &quot;Becoming a teacher is all very 
    well but what would happen if everyone became a teacher? There'd be no 
    dentists, etc. etc.&quot; The Buddha did not suggest that everyone should become 
    a monk or nun and indeed that is never going to happen. However, there will 
    always be people who are attracted to the life of simplicity and 
    renunciation and who take delight in the Buddha's teaching above all else. 
    And like dentists and teachers they have special skills and knowledge that 
    can be helpful to the community in which they live. </P>
    <P><B>That might be so with those who teach or write books. But what about 
    the monks and nuns who do nothing but meditate. What good are they to the 
    community? </B></P>
    <P>You might compare the hermit monk to the research scientist. Society 
    supports the research scientist as he sits in his laboratory conducting 
    experiments because it hopes that he will eventually discover or invent 
    something that will be for the general good. Likewise the Buddhist community 
    supports the meditating monk (and his needs are very meagre) because it 
    hopes that he will attain wisdom and insights that will be for the general 
    good. But even before this happens or even if it doesn't, the meditating 
    monk can still benefit others. In some modern societies it is 'The Lifestyle 
    of the Rich and Famous', with its extravagance, its conspicuous consumption 
    and its self-indulgence which is held up as the ideal to follow, or at least 
    to envy. The example that the meditating monk sets reminds us that one 
    doesn't have to be rich to be content. It shows us that the gentle and 
    simple lifestyle has its advantages too. </P>
    <P><B>I have heard that there are no more Buddhist nuns. Is this true? </B>
    </P>
    <P>The Buddha founded the order of nuns in his lifetime and for five or six 
    hundred years nuns played an important role in the spread and development of 
    Buddhism. But for reasons that are not clear nuns never commanded the same 
    esteem and consequently got the same support, as monks and in India and 
    South-east Asia the order died out. However in Taiwan, Korea and Japan the 
    order of nuns has continued to flourish. Today in Sri Lanka and Thailand 
    steps are being taken to reintroduce the order of nuns from Taiwan although 
    some traditionalists are not very enthusiastic about this. However, in 
    keeping with the Buddha's original intentions, it is only right that women 
    as well as men have the opportunity to live the monastic life and benefit 
    from it. </P>
