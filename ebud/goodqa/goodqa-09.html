    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">What did the Buddha teach about magic and fortune
    telling? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha considered such practices as fortune telling,
    wearing magic charms for protection, finding lucky sites for buildings, prophesising and
    fixing lucky days to be useless superstitions and he expressly forbade his disciples to
    practise such things. He called all these things 'low arts'.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Whereas some religious men, while living off food
    provided by the faithful make their living by such low arts, such wrong means of
    livelihood as palmistry, divining by signs, interpreting dreams, bringing about good or
    bad luck, picking the lucky site for a building, the monk Gotama refrains from such low
    arts, such wrong means of livelihood&quot;. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Then why do people sometimes practise such things and
    believe in them? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because of greed, fear and ignorance. As soon as people
    understand the Buddha's teachings, they realise that a pure heart can protect them
    much better than bits of paper, bits of metal and a few chanted words and they no longer
    rely on such things. In the teachings of the Buddha, it is honesty, kindness,
    understanding, patience, forgiveness, generosity, loyalty and other good qualities that
    truly protect you and give you true prosperity. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">But some lucky charms do work, don't they? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I know a person who makes a living selling lucky charms.
    He claims that his charms can give good luck, prosperity and he guarantees that you will
    be able to pick three numbers. But if what he says is true then why isn't he himself
    a multi-millionaire? If his lucky charms really work, then why doesn't he win the
    lottery week after week? The only luck he has is that there are people silly enough to buy
    his magic charms. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Then is there such a thing as luck? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The dictionary defines luck as 'believing that whatever
    happens, either good or bad, to a person in the course of events is due to chance, fate or
    fortune'. The Buddha denied this belief completely. Everything that happens has a specific
    cause or causes and there must be some relationships between the cause and the effect.
    Becoming sick, for example, has specific causes. One must come into contact with germs and
    one's body must be weak enough for the germs to establish themselves. There is a
    definite relationship between the cause (germs and a weakened body) and the effect
    (sickness) because we know that germs attack the organisms and give rise to sickness. But
    no relationship can be found between wearing a piece of paper with words written on it and
    being rich or passing examinations. Buddhism teaches that whatever happens does so because
    of a cause or causes and not due to luck, chance or fate. People who are interested in
    luck are always trying to get something,usually more money and wealth. The Buddha teaches
    us that it is far more important to develop our hearts and minds. He says: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">Being deeply learned and skilled; being well-trained
      and using well-spoken words - this is the best good luck. To support mother and father, to
      cherish wife and child and to have a simple livelihood - this is the best good luck. </font></p>
      </i>
