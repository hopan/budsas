    <h2 align="center"><font color="#800000" face="Times New Roman">Buddhism and the God-idea</font></h2>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-ooOoo-</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Do Buddhist believe in god?</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">No, we do not. There are several reasons for this. The
    Buddha, like modern sociologists and psychologists, believed that religious ideas and
    especially the god idea have their origin in fear. The Buddha says:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;<i>Gripped by fear men go to the sacred mountains,<br>
      sacred groves, sacred trees and shrines</i>&quot;. -- Dp 188</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Primitive man found himself in a dangerous and hostile
    world, the fear of wild animals, of not being able to find enough food, of injury or
    disease, and of natural phenomena like thunder, lightning and volcanoes was constantly
    with him. Finding no security, he created the idea of gods in order to give him comfort in
    good times, courage in times of danger and consolation when things went wrong. To this
    day, you will notice that people become more religious at times of crises, you will hear
    them say that the belief in a god or gods gives them the strength they need to deal with
    life. You will hear them explain that they believe in a particular god because they prayed
    in time of need and their prayer was answered. All this seems to support the Buddha's
    teaching that the god-idea is a response to fear and frustration. The Buddha taught us to
    try to understand our fears, to lessen our desires and to calmly and courageously accept
    the things we cannot change. He replaced fear, not with irrational belief but with
    rational understanding. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second reason the Buddha did not believe in a god is
    because there does not seem to be any evidence to support this idea. There are numerous
    religions, all claiming that they alone have god's words preserved in their holy
    book, that they alone understand god's nature, that their god exists and that the
    gods of other religions do not. Some claim that god is masculine, some that she is
    feminine and others that it is neuter. They are all satisfied that there is ample evidence
    to prove the existence of their god but they laugh in disbelief at the evidence other
    religions use to prove the existence of another god. It is not surprising that with so
    many different religions spending so many centuries trying to prove the existence of their
    gods that still no real, concrete, substantial or irrefutable evidence has been found.
    Buddhists suspend judgement until such evidence is forthcoming.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third reason the Buddha did not believe in a god is
    that the belief is not necessary. Some claim that the belief in a god is necessary in
    order to explain the origin on the universe. But this is not so. Science has very
    convincingly explained how the universe came into being without having to introduce the
    god-idea. Some claim that belief in god is necessary to have a happy, meaningful life.
    Again we can see that this is not so. There are millions of atheists and free-thinkers,
    not to mention many Buddhists, who live useful, happy and meaningful lives without belief
    in a god. Some claim that belief in god's power is necessary because humans, being
    weak, do not have the strength to help themselves. Once again, the evidence indicates the
    opposite. One often hears of people who have overcome great disabilities and handicaps,
    enormous odds and difficulties, through their own inner resources, through their own
    efforts and without belief in a god. Some claim that god is necessary in order to give man
    salvation. But this argument only holds good if you accept the theological concept of
    salvation and Buddhists do not accept such a concept. Based on his own experience, the
    Buddha saw that each human being had the capacity to purify the mind, develop infinite
    love and compassion and perfect understanding. He shifted attention from the heavens to
    the heart and encouraged us to find solutions to our problems through self-understanding.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>But if there are no gods how did the universe get
    here?</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All religions have myths and stories which attempt to
    answer this question. In ancient times, when many simply did not know, such myths were
    adequate, but in the 20th century, in the age of physics, astronomy and geology, such
    myths have been superseded by scientific fact. Science has explained the origin of the
    universe without recourse to the god-idea.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">What does the Buddha say about the origin of the
    universe?</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is interesting that the Buddha's explanation of
    the origin of the universe corresponds very closely to the scientific view. In the Aganna
    Sutta, the Buddha described the universe being destroyed and then re-evolving into its
    present form over a period of countless millions of years. The first life formed on the
    surface of the water and again, over countless millions of years, evolved from simple into
    complex organisms. All these processes are without beginning or end, and are set in motion
    by natural causes. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">You say there is no evidence for the existence of a
    god. But what about miracles?</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are many who believe that miracles are proof of
    god's existence. We hear wild claims that a healing has taken place but we never get
    an independent testimony from a medical office or a surgeon. We hear second-hand reports
    that someone was miraculously saved from disaster but we never get an eye-witness account
    of what is supposed to have happened. We hear rumours that prayer straightened a diseased
    body or strengthened a withered limb, but we never see X-rays or get comments from doctors
    or nurses. Wild claims, second-hand reports and rumours are no substitute for solid
    evidence and solid evidence of miracles is very rare.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, sometimes unexplained things do happen,
    unexpected events do occur. But our inability to explain such things does not prove the
    existence of gods. It only proves that our knowledge is as yet incomplete. Before the
    development of modern medicine, when people didn't know what caused sickness people
    believed that god or the gods sent diseases as a punishment. Now we know what causes such
    things and when we get sick, we take medicine. In time when our knowledge of the world is
    more complete, we will be able to understand what causes unexplained phenomena, just as we
    can now understand what causes disease.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">But so many people believe in some form of god, it must
    be true.</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Not so. There was a time when everyone believed that the
    world was flat, but they were all wrong. The number of people who believe in an idea is no
    measure of the truth or falsehood of that idea. The only way we can tell whether an idea
    is true or not is by looking at the facts and examining the evidence. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">So if Buddhists don't believe in gods, what do you
    believe in?</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We don't believe in a god because we believe in man.
    We believe that each human being is precious and important, that all have the potential to
    develop into a Buddha &#150; a perfected human being. We believe that human beings can
    outgrow ignorance and irrationality and see things as they really are. We believe that
    hatred, anger, spite and jealousy can be replaced by love, patience, generosity and
    kindness. We believe that all this is within the grasp of each person if they make the
    effort, guided and supported by fellow Buddhists and inspired by the example of the
    Buddha. As the Buddha says: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>&quot;No one saves us but ourselves,<br>
      No one can and no one may.<br>
      We ourselves must walk the path, <br>
      But Buddhas clearly show the way&quot;. -- Dp 165</em></font></p>
