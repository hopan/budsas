    Basic Buddhism: A Five-Minute Introduction</FONT></B></P>

    <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><FONT SIZE="3">* What is 
    Buddhism?</FONT></B><BR>
    <BR>
    Buddhism is a religion to about 300 million people around the world. The 
    word comes from 'budhi', 'to awaken'. It has its origins about 2,500 years 
    ago when Siddhartha Gotama, known as the Buddha, was himself awakened 
    (enlightened) at the age of 35.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><FONT SIZE="3">* Is Buddhism a Religion?</FONT></B><BR>
    <BR>
    To many, Buddhism goes beyond religion and is more of a philosophy or 'way 
    of life'. It is a philosophy because philosophy 'means love of wisdom' and 
    the Buddhist path can be summed up as:</FONT></P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(1) to lead a moral life,<BR>
      (2) to be mindful and aware of thoughts and actions, and<BR>
      (3) to develop wisdom and understanding.</FONT></P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><FONT SIZE="3">* How Can Buddhism Help 
    Me?</FONT></B><BR>
    <BR>
    Buddhism explains a purpose to life, it explains apparent injustice and 
    inequality around the world, and it provides a code of practice or way of 
    life that leads to true happiness.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><FONT SIZE="3">* Why is Buddhism Becoming 
    Popular?</FONT></B><BR>
    <BR>
    Buddhism is becoming popular in Western countries for a number of reasons, 
    The first good reason is Buddhism has answers to many of the problems in 
    modern materialistic societies. It also includes (for those who are 
    interested) a deep understanding of the human mind (and natural therapies) 
    which prominent psychologists around the world are now discovering to be 
    both very advanced and effective.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><FONT SIZE="3">* Who Was the Buddha?</FONT></B><BR>
    <BR>
    Siddhartha Gotama was born into a royal family in Lumbini, now located in 
    Nepal, in 563 BC. At 29, he realised that wealth and luxury did not 
    guarantee happiness, so he explored the different teachings religions and 
    philosophies of the day, to find the key to human happiness. After six years 
    of study and meditation he finally found 'the middle path' and was 
    enlightened. After enlightenment, the Buddha spent the rest of his life 
    teaching the principles of Buddhism — called the Dhamma, or Truth — until 
    his death at the age of 80.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><FONT SIZE="3">* Was the Buddha a God?</FONT></B><BR>
    <BR>
    He was not, nor did he claim to be. He was a man who taught a path to 
    enlightenment from his own experience.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><FONT SIZE="3">* Do Buddhists Worship 
    Idols?</FONT></B><BR>
    <BR>
    Buddhists sometimes pay respect to images of the Buddha, not in worship, nor 
    to ask for favours. A statue of the Buddha with hands rested gently in its 
    lap and a compassionate smile reminds us to strive to develop peace and love 
    within ourselves. Bowing to the statue is an expression of gratitude for the 
    teaching.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><FONT SIZE="3">* Why are so Many Buddhist 
    Countries Poor?</FONT></B><BR>
    <BR>
    One of the Buddhist teachings is that wealth does not guarantee happiness 
    and also wealth is impermanent. The people of every country suffer whether 
    rich or poor, but those who understand Buddhist teachings can find true 
    happiness.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><FONT SIZE="3">* Are There Different 
    Types of Buddhism?</FONT></B><BR>
    <BR>
    There are many different types of Buddhism, because the emphasis changes 
    from country to country due to customs and culture. What does not vary is 
    the essence of the teaching — the Dhamma or truth.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><FONT SIZE="3">* Are Other Religions 
    Wrong?</FONT></B><BR>
    <BR>
    Buddhism is also a belief system which is tolerant of all other beliefs or 
    religions. Buddhism agrees with the moral teachings of other religions but 
    Buddhism goes further by providing a long term purpose within our existence, 
    through wisdom and true understanding. Real Buddhism is very tolerant and 
    not concerned with labels like 'Christian', 'Moslem', 'Hindu' or 'Buddhist'; 
    that is why there have never been any wars fought in the name of Buddhism. 
    That is why Buddhists do not preach and try to convert, only explain if an 
    explanation is sought.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><FONT SIZE="3">* Is Buddhism Scientific?</FONT></B><BR>
    <BR>
    Science is knowledge which can be made into a system, which depends upon 
    seeing and testing facts and stating general natural laws. The core of 
    Buddhism fit into this definition, because the Four Noble truths (see below) 
    can be tested and proven by anyone in fact the Buddha himself asked his 
    followers to test the teaching rather than accept his word as true. Buddhism 
    depends more on understanding than faith.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><FONT SIZE="3">* What did the Buddha 
    Teach?</FONT></B><BR>
    <BR>
    The Buddha taught many things, but the basic concepts in Buddhism can be 
    summed up by the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><FONT SIZE="3">* What is the First Noble 
    Truth?</FONT></B><BR>
    <BR>
    The first truth is that life is suffering i.e., life includes pain, getting 
    old, disease, and ultimately death. We also endure psychological suffering 
    like loneliness frustration, fear, embarrassment, disappointment and anger. 
    This is an irrefutable fact that cannot be denied. It is realistic rather 
    than pessimistic because pessimism is expecting things to be bad. lnstead, 
    Buddhism explains how suffering can be avoided and how we can be truly 
    happy.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><FONT SIZE="3">* What is the Second Noble 
    Truth?</FONT></B><BR>
    <BR>
    The second truth is that suffering is caused by craving and aversion. We 
    will suffer if we expect other people to conform to our expectation, if we 
    want others to like us, if we do not get something we want,etc. In other 
    words, getting what you want does not guarantee happiness. Rather than 
    constantly struggling to get what you want, try to modify your wanting. 
    Wanting deprives us of contentment and happiness. A lifetime of wanting and 
    craving and especially the craving to continue to exist, creates a powerful 
    energy which causes the individual to be born. So craving leads to physical 
    suffering because it causes us to be reborn.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><FONT SIZE="3">* What is the Third Noble 
    Truth?</FONT></B><BR>
    <BR>
    The third truth is that suffering can be overcome and happiness can be 
    attained; that true happiness and contentment are possible. lf we give up 
    useless craving and learn to live each day at a time (not dwelling in the 
    past or the imagined future) then we can become happy and free. We then have 
    more time and energy to help others. This is Nirvana.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><FONT SIZE="3">* What is the Fourth Noble 
    Truth?</FONT></B><BR>
    <BR>
    The fourth truth is that the Noble 8-fold Path is the path which leads to 
    the end of suffering.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><FONT SIZE="3">* What is the Noble 8-Fold 
    Path?</FONT></B><BR>
    <BR>
    In summary, the Noble 8-fold Path is being moral (through what we say, do 
    and our livelihood), focussing the mind on being fully aware of our thoughts 
    and actions, and developing wisdom by understanding the Four Noble Truths 
    and by developing compassion for others.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><FONT SIZE="3">* What are the 5 Precepts?</FONT></B><BR>
    <BR>
    The moral code within Buddhism is the precepts, of which the main five are: 
    not to take the life of anything living, not to take anything not freely 
    given, to abstain from sexual misconduct and sensual overindulgence, to 
    refrain from untrue speech, and to avoid intoxication, that is, losing 
    mindfulness.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><FONT SIZE="3">* What is Karma?</FONT></B><BR>
    <BR>
    Karma is the law that every cause has an effect, i.e., our actions have 
    results. This simple law explains a number of things: inequality in the 
    world, why some are born handicapped and some gifted, why some live only a 
    short life. Karma underlines the importance of all individuals being 
    responsible for their past and present actions. How can we test the karmic 
    effect of our actions? The answer is summed up by looking at (1) the 
    intention behind the action, (2) effects of the action on oneself, and (3) 
    the effects on others.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><FONT SIZE="3">* What is Wisdom?</FONT></B><BR>
    <BR>
    Buddhism teaches that wisdom should be developed with compassion. At one 
    extreme, you could be a goodhearted fool and at the other extreme, you could 
    attain knowledge without any emotion. Buddhism uses the middle path to 
    develop both. The highest wisdom is seeing that in reality, all phenomena 
    are incomplete, impermanent and do no constitute a fixed entity. True wisdom 
    is not simply believing what we are told but instead experiencing and 
    understanding truth and reality. Wisdom requires an open, objective, 
    unbigoted mind. The Buddhist path requires courage, patience, flexibility 
    and intelligence.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><FONT SIZE="3">* What is Compassion?</FONT></B><BR>
    <BR>
    Compassion includes qualities of sharing, readiness to give comfort, 
    sympathy, concern, caring. In Buddhism, we can really understand others, 
    when we can really understand ourselves, through wisdom.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B><FONT SIZE="3">* How do I Become a 
    Buddhist?</FONT><BR>
    </B><BR>
    Buddhist teachings can be understood and tested by anyone. Buddhism teaches 
    that the solutions to our problems are within ourselves not outside. The 
    Buddha asked all his followers not to take his word as true, but rather to 
    test the teachings for themselves. ln this way, each person decides for 
    themselves and takes responsibility for their own actions and understanding. 
    This makes Buddhism less of a fixed package of beliefs which is to be 
    accepted in its entirety, and more of a teaching which each person learns 
    and uses in their own way.</FONT></P>
