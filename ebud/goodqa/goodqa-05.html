    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Where do beings come from and where are they going? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are three possible answers to this question. Those
    who believe in a god or gods usually claim that before an individual is created, he/she
    does not exist, then he/she comes into being through the will of a god. He/she lives their
    life and then, according to what they believe or do in their life, they either go to
    eternal heaven or hell. There are others, humanists and scientists, who claim that the
    individual comes into being at conception due to natural causes, lives and then at death,
    ceases to exist. Buddhism does not accept either of these explanations. The first gives
    rise to many ethical problems If a good god really creates each of us, it is difficult to
    explain why so many people are born with the most dreadful deformities, or why so many
    children are miscarried just before birth or are still-born. Another problem with the
    theistic explanation is that it seems very unjust that a person should suffer eternal pain
    in hell for 60 or 70 years of non-belief or immoral living. Likewise, 60 or 70 years of
    good living seems a very small outlay for eternal bliss in heaven. for what he/she did in
    those years on Earth The second explanation is better than the first and has more
    scientific evidence to support it but still leaves several important questions unanswered.
    How can a phenomenon so amazingly complex as consciousness develop from the simple meeting
    of two cells, the sperm and the egg? And now that parapsychology is a recognised branch of
    science, phenomena like telepathy are increasingly difficult to fit into the materialistic
    model of the mind. </font></p>
    <p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Buddhism offers the most satisfactory 
    explanation of where beings come from and where they are going. When we die, 
    the mind, with all the tendencies, preferences, abilities and 
    characteristics that have been developed and conditioned in this life, 
    re-establishes itself in a fertilised egg. Thus the individual grows, is 
    re-born and develops a personality conditioned both by the mental 
    characteristics that have been carried over. And by the new environment, the 
    personality will change and be modified by conscious effort; and 
    conditioning factors like education, parental influence and society and once 
    again at death, re-establishing itself in a new fertilised egg. This process 
    of dying and being reborn will continue until the conditions that cause it, 
    craving and ignorance, cease. When they do, instead of being reborn, the 
    mind attains a state called Nirvana and this is the ultimate goal of 
    Buddhism and the purpose of life.</FONT></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">How does the mind go from one body to another? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Think of it being like radio waves. The radio waves, which
    are not made up of words and music but energy at different frequencies, are transmitted,
    travel through space, and attracted to and picked up by the receiver from where they are
    broadcast as words and music. It is the same with the mind. At death, mental energy
    travels through space, is attracted to and picked up by the fertilised egg. As the embryo
    grows, it centres itself in the brain from where it later broadcasts itself as the new
    personality. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Is one always reborn as a human being? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">No, there are several realms in which one can be reborn.
    Some people are reborn in heaven, some are reborn in hell, some are reborn as hungry
    ghosts and so on. Heaven is not a place but a state of existence where one has a subtle
    body and where the mind experiences mainly pleasure. Some religions strive very hard to be
    reborn in a heavenly existence mistakenly believing it to be a permanent state. But it is
    not. Like all conditioned states, heaven is impermanent and when one's life span
    there is finished, one could well be reborn again as a human. Hell, likewise, is not a
    place but a state of existence where one has a subtle body and where the mind experiences
    mainly anxiety and distress. Being a hungry ghost, again, is a state of existence where
    the body is subtle and where the mind is continually plagued by longing and
    dissatisfaction. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So heavenly beings experience mainly pleasure, hell beings
    and ghosts experience mainly pain and human beings experience usually a mixture of both.
    So the main difference between the human realm and other realms is the body type and the
    quality of experience. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">What decides where we will be reborn? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The most important factor, but not the only one,
    influencing where we will be reborn and what sort of life we shall have, is karma. The
    word karma means action and refers to our intentional mental actions. In other words, what
    we are is determined very much by how we have thought and acted in the past. Likewise, how
    we think and act now will influence how we will be in the future. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The gentle, loving type of person tends to be reborn in a
    heaven realm or as a human being who has a predominance of pleasant experiences. The
    anxious, worried or extremely cruel type of person tends to be reborn in a hell realm or
    as a human being who has a predominance of painful experiences. The person who develops
    obsessive craving, fierce longings, and burning ambitions that can never be satisfied
    tends to be reborn as a hungry ghost or as a human being frustrated by longing and
    wanting. Whatever mental habits are strongly developed in this life will continue in the
    next life. Most people, however, are reborn as human beings. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">So if our lives are determined by our karma, can we
    change it? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of course we can. That is why one of the steps on the
    Eightfold Path is Right Effort. It depends on our sincerity, how much energy we exert and
    how strong the habit is. But it is true that some people singly go through life under the
    influence of their past habits, without making an effort to change them and falling victim
    to these unpleasant results. Such people will continue to suffer unless they change their
    negative habits. The longer the negative habits remain, the more difficult they are to
    change. The Buddhist understands this and takes advantage of each and every opportunity to
    break mental habits that have unpleasant results and to develop mental habits that have
    pleasant and happy results. Meditation is one of the techniques used to modify the habit
    patterns of the mind as does speaking or refraining to speak in certain ways, and acting
    or refraining to act in certain ways. The whole of the Buddhist life is a training to
    purify and free the mind. For example, if being patient and kind was a pronounced part of
    your character in your last life, such tendencies will re-emerge in the present life. If
    they are strengthened and developed in the present life, they will re-emerge even stronger
    and more pronounced in the future life. This is based upon the simple and observable fact
    that long established habits tend to be difficult to break. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, when you are patient and kind, it tends to happen
    that you are not so easily ruffled by others, you don't hold grudges, people like you
    and thus your experiences tends to be happier. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, let us take another example. Let us say that you come
    into life with a tendency to be patient and kind due to your mental habits in the past
    life. But in the present life, you neglect to strengthen and develop such tendencies. They
    would gradually weaken and die out and perhaps be completely absent in the future life.
    Patience and kindness being weak in this case, there is a possibility that in either this
    life or in the next life, a short temper, anger and cruelty could grow and develop,
    bringing with them all the unpleasant experiences that such attitudes create. We will take
    one last example. Let us say that due to your mental habits in the last life, you came
    into the present life with the tendency to be short-tempered and angry, and you realise
    that such habits only cause you unpleasantness and so you make an effort to change them.
    You replace them with positive emotions. If you are able to eliminate them completely,
    which is possible if you make an effort, you become free from the unpleasantness caused by
    being short tempered and angry. If you are only able to weaken such tendencies, they would
    re-emerge in the next life where with a bit more effort, they could be eliminated
    completely and you could be free from their unpleasant effects. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">You have talked a lot about rebirth but is there any
    proof that we will be reborn when we die? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Not only is there scientific evidence to support Buddhist
    belief in rebirth, it is the only after-life theory that has any evidence to support it.
    There is not a scrap of evidence to prove the existence of heaven and of course evidence
    of annihilation at death must be lacking. But during the last 30 years parapsychologists
    have been studying reports that some people have vivid memories of their former lives. For
    example, in England, a 5 year old girl said she could remember her other mother and father
    and she talked vividly about what sounded like the events in the life of another person.
    Parapsychologists were called in and asked her hundreds of questions to which she gave
    answers. She spoke of living in a particular village, in what appeared to be Spain. She
    gave the name of the village, the name of the street she lived in, her neighbours'
    names and details about her everyday life there. she also tearfully spoke of how she had
    been struck by a car and died of her injuries two days later. When these details were
    checked, they were found to be accurate. There was a village in Spain with the name the
    child had given. There was a house of the type she had described in the street she had
    named. What is more, it was found that a 23 year old woman living in the house had been
    killed in a car accident five years before.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now how is it possible for a five year old living in
    England who had never been to Spain to know all these details? And of course, this is not
    the only case of this type. Professor Ian Stevenson of the University of Virginia's
    Department of Psychology has described dozens of cases of this type in his books. He is an
    accredited scientist whose 25 year study of people who remember former lives is very
    strong evidence for the Buddhist teaching of rebirth. <em>(See &quot;Twenty Cases
    Suggestive of Reincarnation and Cases of Reincarnation Type&quot;, University Press of
    Virginia, Charlotteville, USA,&nbsp; 1975)</em>.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Some people might say that the so­called ability
    to remember former lives is the work of devils. <br>
    </strong><br>
    You simply cannot dismiss everything that doesn't fit into your belief as being the work
    of devils. <br>
    When cold, hard facts are produced to support an idea, you must use rational and logical
    arguments if you wish to counter them -- not irrational and superstitious talk about
    devils. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">You say that talk about devils is superstitious. Isn't
    talk about rebirth a bit superstitious too? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The dictionary defines superstition as a belief which is
    not based on reason or fact but on an association of ideas, as in magic. If you can show
    me a careful study of the existence of devils written by a scientist I will concede that
    belief in devils is not superstition. But I have never heard of any research into devils;
    scientists simply wouldn't bother to study such things, so I say there is no evidence
    for the existence of devils. But as we have just seen, there is evidence which seems to
    suggest that rebirth does take place. So if belief in rebirth is based on at least some
    facts, it cannot be a superstition. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Well, have there ever been any scientists who believe
    in rebirth? </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes. Thomas Huxley, who was responsible for having science
    introduced into the 19th century British school system and who was the first scientist to
    defend Darwin's theories, believed that reincarnation was a very plausible idea. In
    his famous book &quot;Evolution and Ethics and other Essays&quot;, he says: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;<i>In the doctrine of transmigration, whatever its
    origin, Brahmanical and Buddhist speculation found, ready to hand, the means of
    constructing a plausible vindication of the ways of the Cosmos to man....yet this plea of
    justification is not less plausible than others; and none but very hasty thinkers will
    reject it on the ground of inherent absurdity. Like the doctrine of evolution itself, that
    of transmigration has its roots in the world of reality; and it may claim such support as
    the great argument from analogy is capable of supplying</i>&quot;. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then, Professor Gust Stromberg, the famous Swedish
    astronomer, physicist and friend of Einstein also found the idea of rebirth appealing: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;<i>Opinions differ whether human souls can be
    reincarnated on the earth or not. In 1936 a very interesting case was thoroughly
    investigated and reported by the government authorities in India. A girl (Shanti Devi from
    Deli) could accurately describe her previous life (at Muttra, five hundred miles from
    Deli) which ended about a year before her 'second birth'. She gave the name of her husband
    and child and described her home and life history. The investigating commission brought
    her to her former relatives, who verified all her statements. Among the people of India
    reincarnations are regarded as commonplace; the astonishing thing for them in this case
    was the great number of facts the girl remembered. This and similar cases can be regarded
    as additional evidence for the theory of the indestructibility of memory</i>&quot;. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Professor Julian Huxley, the distinguished British
    scientist who was Director General of UNESCO believed that rebirth was quite in harmony
    with scientific thinking: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;<i>There is nothing against a permanently surviving
    spirit-individuality being in some way given off at death, as a definite wireless message
    is given off by a sending apparatus working in a particular ways. But it must be
    remembered that the wireless message only becomes a message again when it comes in contact
    with a new, material structure - the receiver. So with our possible spirit-emanation. It
    would never think or feel unless again &quot;embodied&quot; in some way. our personalities
    are so based on body that it is really impossible to think of survival which would be in
    any true sense personal without a body of sorts. I can think of something being given off
    which could bear the same relation to men and women as a wireless message to the
    transmitting apparatus for mind</i>&quot;. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even very practical and down-to-earth people like the
    American industrialist Henry Ford found the idea of rebirth acceptable. Ford was attracted
    to the idea of rebirth because, unlike the theistic idea or the materialistic idea,
    rebirth gives you a second chance to develop yourself. Henry Ford says: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;<i>I adopted the theory of Reincarnation when I was
    twenty six. Religion offered nothing to the point. Even work could not give me complete
    satisfaction. Work is futile if we cannot utilise the experience we collect in one life in
    the next. When I discovered Reincarnation it was as if I had found a universal plan I
    realised that there was a chance to work out my ideas. Time was no longer limited. I was
    no longer a slave to the hands of the clock. Genius is experience. Some seem to think that
    it is a gift or talent, but it is the fruit of long experience in many lives. Some are
    older souls than others, and so they know more. The discovery of Reincarnation put my mind
    at ease. If you preserve a record of this conversation, write it so that it puts
    men's minds at ease. I would like to communicate to others the calmness that the long
    view of life gives to us</i>&quot;. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So the Buddhist teachings of rebirth does have some
    scientific evidence to support it. It is logically consistent and it goes a long way in
    answering questions what the theistic and the materialistic theories fail to . It is also
    very comforting. What can be worse than a theory of life that gives you no second chance,
    no opportunity to amend the mistakes you have made in this life and no time to further
    develop the skills and abilities you have nurtured in this life. But according to the
    Buddha, if you fail to attain Nirvana in this life, you will have the opportunity to try
    again next time. If you have made mistakes in this life, you will be able to correct
    yourself in the next life. You will truly be able to learn from your mistakes. Things you
    were unable to do or achieve in this life may well become possible in the next life. What
    a wonderful teaching! </font></p>
