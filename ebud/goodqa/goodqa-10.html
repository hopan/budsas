    <h2 align="center"><FONT COLOR="#800000">The Buddhist Scriptures</FONT></h2>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-ooOoo-</font></p>
    <P><B>Nearly all religions have some kind of holy writings or Bible. What is 
    the Buddhist holy book?</B></P>
    <P>The sacred book of Buddhism is called the Tipitaka. It is written in an 
    ancient Indian language called Pali which is very close to the language that 
    the Buddha himself spoke. The Tripitaka is a very large book. The English 
    translation of it takes up nearly forty volumes.</P>
    <P><B>What does the Tipitaka mean?</B></P>
    <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is made up of two words, <I>ti</I> 
        means 'three' and <I>pitaka</I> means 'baskets'. The first part of the 
        name refers to the fact that the Buddhist scriptures consist of three 
        sections. The first section, called the Sutta Pitaka, contains all the 
        Buddha's discourses as well as some by his enlightened disciples. The 
        type of material in the Sutta Pitaka is very diverse which allows it to 
        communicate the truths that the Buddha taught to all different types of 
        people. Many of the Buddha's discourses are in the form of sermons while 
        others are in the form of dialogues. Other parts like the Dhammapada 
        present the Buddha's teachings through the medium of poetry. The 
        Jatakas, to take another example, consist of delightful stories in which 
        the main characters are often animals. The second section of the 
        Tipitaka is called the Vinaya Pitaka. This contains the rules for monks 
        and nuns, advice on monastic administration and procedure and the early 
        history of the monastic order. The last section is called the Abhidhamma 
        Pitaka. This is a complex and sophisticated attempt to analyse and 
        classify all the constituents that make up the individual. Although the 
        Abhidhamma is somewhat later than the first two sections of the Tipitaka 
        it contains nothing that contradicts them. </FONT>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Now for the word <I>'pitaka'</I>. In 
        ancient India construction workers used to move building materials from 
        one place to another by means of a relay of baskets. They would put the 
        baskets on their heads, walk some distance to the next worker, pass it 
        to him, and he would repeat the process. Writing was known in the 
        Buddha's time but as a medium it was considered less reliable than human 
        memory. A book could rot in the monsoon damp or be eaten by white ants 
        but a person's memory could last as long as they lived. Consequently, 
        monks and nuns committed all the Buddha's teachings to memory and passed 
        it on to each other just as construction workers passed earth and bricks 
        to each other in baskets. This is why the three sections of the Buddhist 
        scriptures are called baskets. After being preserved in this manner for 
        several hundred years the Tipitaka was finally written down in about 100 
        B.C. in Sri Lanka.</FONT>

    <P><B>If the scriptures were preserved in memory for so long they must be 
    very unreliable. Much of the Buddha's teachings could have been lost or 
    changed?</B></P>
    <P>The preservation of the scriptures was a joint effort by the community of 
    monks and nuns. They would meet together at regular intervals and chant 
    parts or all of the Tipitaka. This made it virtually impossible for anything 
    to be added or changed. Think of it like this. If a group of a hundred 
    people know a song by heart and while they are all singing it one gets a 
    verse wrong or tries to insert a new verse, what will happen? The sheer 
    number of those who know the song correctly will prevent the odd one making 
    any changes. It is also important to remember that in those days there were 
    no T.V.'s, newspapers or advertising to distract and clutter the mind which 
    together with the fact that monks and nuns meditated, meant that they had 
    extremely good memories. Even today, long after books have come into use, 
    there are still monks who can recite the whole Tipitaka by heart. Mengong 
    Sayadaw of Burma is able to do this and he is mentioned in the <I>Guinness 
    Book of Records</I> as having the world's best memory. </P>
    <P><B>How important are the scriptures to Buddhists?</B></P>
    <P>Buddhists do not consider the Tipitaka to be a divine, infallible 
    revelation from a god, every word of which we must believe. Rather, it is a 
    record of the teachings of a great man that offers explanations, advice, 
    guidance and encouragement and which we should read thoughtfully and 
    respectfully. Our aim should be to understand what the Tipitaka teaches, not 
    just believe it and thus what the Buddha says should always be checked 
    against our experience. </P>
    <P><B>Before you mentioned the Dhammapada. What is it?</B></P>
    <P>The Dhammapada is one of the smallest works in the first sections of the 
    Tipitaka. The name could be translated as 'The Way of Truth' or 'Verses of 
    Truth'. It consists of 423 verses, some pithy, some profound, some 
    containing appealing similes, some of considerable beauty, all spoken by the 
    Buddha. Consequently the Dhammapada is the most popular piece of Buddhist 
    literature. It has been translated into most major languages and is 
    recognised as one of the masterpieces of world religious literature.</P>
    <P><B>Someone told me that you should never put a book of the scriptures on 
    the floor or under your arm, but that it should always be placed in a high 
    place. Is this true? </B> </P>
    <P>Until recently in Buddhist countries as in medieval Europe, books were 
    rare and valuable objects. Therefore the scriptures were always treated with 
    great respect and some of the customs you have mentioned are examples of 
    this. However, while customs and traditional practices are alright, most 
    people today would agree that the best way to respect the Buddhist 
    scriptures would be to practice the teachings they contain. </P>
    <P><B>I find it difficult to read the Buddhist scriptures. They seem to be 
    long, repetitious and boring. </B></P>
    <P>When we pick up a religious scripture we expect to read words of 
    exaltations, joy or praise that will uplift and inspire us. Consequently, 
    someone reading the Buddhist scriptures is likely to be a bit disappointed. 
    While some of the Buddha's discourses contain considerable charm and beauty 
    most resemble philosophical thesis with definitions of terms, carefully 
    reasoned arguments, detailed advice on conduct or meditation and precisely 
    stated truths. They are meant to appeal to the intellect, not the emotions. 
    When we stop comparing the Buddhist scriptures to those of other religions 
    we will see that they have their own kind of beauty - the beauty of clarity, 
    of depth and of wisdom. </P>
