        </blockquote>
        <p><font color="#000099" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Whatever arises
        passes away.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the last talk of the rains
        retreat for 1999. It seems just a few days ago that I gave the first
        talk of this rains retreat. Now it's almost over. That is the nature of
        things: to rise and fall. To some people that creates a great deal of
        fear as if they've got no place to hold onto, as if even the ground
        beneath them is moving, is disintegrating, so there's no place to sit.
        And that indeed is the nature of our lives. At first we fear
        impermanence or <i><i><i>Anicca</i></i></i> but, after a while, when we
        understand the Lord Buddha's teachings (<i><i>Dhamma</i></i>), <i><i>Anicca</i></i>
        becomes a great comfort to us and a tool which we can use to accommodate
        the moods of life. There are times when we are confused. There are times
        when we are healthy. There are times when we are sad. And there are
        times when we are sick. This rise and fall is the very nature of life.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once a person understands the rise and
        fall of all phenomena, experiencing the worst that human life can give
        does not make one tremble. You know that it's something passing just
        like the wind passes your face. You don't know where that wind comes
        from, and you can't tell where that wind is going. All you know is that
        wind is blowing. You don't know when that wind is going to end, nor if
        it will get stronger or weaker. Like the weather, the forecast for moods
        is &quot;changeable&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">All feelings that arise in the mind and
        all feelings which impinge upon the body, <b>all of these</b>, arise and
        pass away. Even though you try as best as you can in your life to
        control these feelings, to try only to get the pleasant ones and to ward
        off the painful ones, you never know where they are coming from or when
        they will go.</font></p>
        <h4><font color="#000099" face="Times New Roman">All Is On Fire</font></h4>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">You're all old enough now, and you all
        have had sufficient experience, to have discovered that you cannot
        control these feelings (<i>Vedana</i>). They're beyond you. They just
        come when they want to, and they disappear when they want to. They're
        subject to laws of nature rather than our control. That's the message
        contained in the <i>Adittapariyaya Sutta</i> (&quot;The Discourse on
        Fire&quot; - SN,35,42). Essentially all experience is on fire, like
        flames raging higher and then receding to become small, going out and
        then flaring up again. That is the nature of our experience. If you have
        any sickness, then you know the nature of sickness is to die down and
        then flare up again.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's like that with the sickness of the
        mind. There are times when your mind is healthy and everything looks so
        wonderful, and there are times when it is depressed and fed up, and you
        want to go somewhere else. This is just the nature of the mind, that's
        all - just the worldly winds blowing through it. All the Thai Meditation
        Masters say not to follow those moods, but to stand your ground and to
        be just like an unshakeable rock, where the winds can blow as hard as
        they can but you don't even quiver at all. This is the sign of someone
        who understands the <i>Dhamma</i> [1], someone who doesn't tremble or
        get blown around. A person who hasn't got a foundation in the <i>Dhamma</i>
        gets blown all over the place. When you have your roots stuck in the <i>Dhamma</i>
        then you don't get moved by the rising and falling of different
        phenomena in the world.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">To be able to see those rising and
        falling phenomena is just seeing that things come and go. We have to
        look at this thing which we call experience. But not just experience, we
        have to look at the experiencer as well. I've used the analogy before of
        experience being like a television program on a television set. Often
        human beings, Buddhists included, want only to observe the content of
        the screen rather than the screen itself. All they want to look at is
        something out there rather than looking inside. This tendency is
        recognized by all philosophies and religions that have a mystical
        introspective inclination. People don't seem to go inside enough. They
        stop short of the goal. The whole idea of this investigation is to go
        deeper, and to go to the very core of that which we call the phenomena
        of &quot;world&quot;, &quot;self&quot;, &quot;God&quot;,
        &quot;existence&quot; or whatever.</font></p>
        <h4><font color="#000099" face="Times New Roman">Penetrating Beneath the
        Surface of Things</font></h4>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Instead of going inside, human beings
        tend to go outside. They go outside of &quot;this&quot; and on to
        something else in the future. They step ahead of themselves rather than
        step inside of themselves, and this is why human beings - even
        meditators - very often don't get the pure wisdom of the <i><i>Dhamma</i>.
        </i>That <i>Dhamma </i><a href="#two">2</a> lies right in the very
        moment, in the heart, in the center of all this.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As I've said, we often just stop at the
        surface of things and think that's all there is. We don't go deeper into
        the very core and see that there's nothing there! It's so important to
        be able to liberate oneself from the illusion of something permanent
        that knows the passing and fading away of phenomena, to liberate oneself
        from the illusion of a permanent solid screen, from the illusion that
        &quot;you&quot; are always there watching all these things come and go,
        but &quot;you&quot; don't come and go, &quot;you're&quot; always there. <b>That
        is the illusion which creates suffering in that world which you inhabit.</b>
        This is why I've been teaching throughout this rains retreat to develop
        the mind in <i>Samadhi</i> to such powerful states of sustained
        attention that you can let the mind rest on one thing courageously,
        firmly, without shaking or without wavering, long enough to penetrate
        its empty nature.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">What you want to see is this thing we
        call experience itself, and to be able to get deep into that you do need
        the ability to sustain your attention on something very, very subtle.
        The ordinary experience of life goes so fast that we cannot really
        discern its nature. It's like going through life in a fast car. We look
        out of the window and all we can see are just flashes of scenery as we
        go past. We may go through a town, but we cannot really read the sign
        posts or read the names of the shops because we are going too fast. As
        we slow down we can get more information. If we travel on a bicycle we
        can see much more. If we walk we can see even greater detail. If we
        stand still as we watch the scenery around us, then we find that we see
        the most.</font></p>
        <h4><font color="#000099" face="Times New Roman">Being Still and
        &quot;Seeing&quot; the Jewel in the Heart of the Thousand-Petal Lotus</font></h4>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you can sustain your attention on any
        part of nature long enough, nature opens up to you and reveals its
        secrets, whether it's watching a leaf on a tree or it's watching the
        moon in the sky or even watching the finger on your hand. Whatever it
        is, if you can sustain your attention unmoving and without comment,
        silent and still, you'll find the object in front of the mind will open
        up its secrets to you. And you'll see much more in there than you've
        ever seen before.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's like the simile that I've used
        before of the thousand-petal lotus. A thousandpetal lotus closes up at
        night-time. When the sun's rays hit that lotus at dawn it starts to
        open, one petal at a time. As long as the sun is heating that petal it
        will start to open up. Can you imagine how long the sun has to sustain
        its attention on the lotus to start the inner petals opening up? The sun
        stands for <i><i>Samadhi</i></i>. The lotus can stand for whatever
        phenomena we are placing our attention on. If we sustain our attention
        on this lotus, this phenomena, the outermost petals open up revealing
        the inner petals.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">You'll notice as you contemplate in this
        way, silently holding your attention without moving, that all the old
        labels disappear. All the old ideas which you had about that thing in
        front of you, are the &quot;outer petals&quot;. They start to disappear
        when you get to the petals underneath. You start to see things you've
        never seen before, experiences for which you don't have labels and which
        are beyond your learned perceptions. Most of our perceptions are just
        repeating what we already know from when we were told it at school.
        &quot;Cow&quot;, &quot;Dog&quot;, &quot;Policeman&quot;,
        &quot;Money&quot;, &quot;Car&quot;; all these are just labels which we
        are taught to attach to the objects in the world. Also, there are labels
        which we are taught to attach to the objects of the mind:
        &quot;thought&quot;, &quot;feeling&quot;, &quot;consciousness&quot; and
        &quot;self&quot;. All these are just that much - learned perceptions.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As we sustain our attention on the mind,
        we see that all those labels are the outer petals of the lotus. When
        they open, we know that there is more to this, that there's a deeper
        reality which is certainly beyond words. If we can keep on sustaining
        our attention on this thing which we call &quot;the mind&quot;,
        &quot;experience&quot;, &quot;the moment&quot;, or whatever we wish to
        call it, without moving, the innermost petals start to manifest and then
        finally the last, the thousandth petal, the innermost-of-the-innermost,
        opens up and reveals what is called &quot;the jewel in the heart of the
        lotus&quot; <b>The beautiful jewel of <i>Dhamma</i> which is emptiness -
        nothing there! </b>This will not be what you expect in the heart of a
        lotus, but that's what's there - the emptiness of all phenomena. Once
        you see that, it gives you a great shock that wakes you from the deep
        slumber of illusion.</font></p>
        <h4><font color="#000099" face="Times New Roman">Emptiness to the Core</font></h4>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the centre of all things is a great
        space of nothingness, of emptiness. All around are these fabrications (<i>Sankharas</i>),
        and it's only these fabrications which surround this empty core of
        nothingness. It's these fabrications that we take to be real, which we
        take to be &quot;me&quot;, which we take to be &quot;mine&quot;, and
        which we take to be a &quot;self&quot;. All of these things are what
        delude us. It's hard to go that deep inside the mind. There comes a time
        when we almost get to the innermost petal - but not the very innermost -
        and we think that's good enough. As we go deeper into that lotus, the
        petals are more and more golden, beautiful and brilliant. They are
        delightful, those innermost petals. Sometimes we come to the most
        beautiful petal, and we think, &quot;That's it. This must be it! It's so
        beautiful, so wonderful, so inspiring. This must be the <i>Dhamma</i>!&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, it's only in the emptiness, in
        the nothingness, that there can be an end. Ajahn Chah, my teacher,
        always liked to find the end of things, not things which create more
        problems and more things to do, but that which stops everything, which
        finishes the work, and which ends the burden. This is when a person
        becomes enlightened. Birth is destroyed (<i>Khina Jati</i>). The Holy
        Life has been lived (<i>Vusitam Brahmacariyam</i>). No more of all this
        (<i>Naparamitthattayati</i>).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Haven't you had enough of all this yet?
        Those of you who have had lots of suffering in the rains retreat, join
        the club. This is suffering. All we are trying to do is to find out that
        which ends all that suffering and finishes this Holy Life business. We
        want to end it and to see that the core of nothingness is where it is
        ended. Imagine what that might be like when you know, because you've
        seen to the very depth of all things, that there's nothing there. <b>That
        which you've taken to be consciousness, that which knows, you find that
        it's completely empty.</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha called the appearance of
        something solid a magician's trick. The &quot;magician&quot; makes you
        think that there is something solid in this consciousness [SN,22,95].
        But it is just things arising and passing away. That's all there is!
        That which knows is an empty process. Because it is empty it can stop.
        If there were something there, knowing would be endless. There is a
        basic law of physics called the &quot;law of the conservation of
        energy&quot;. Energy can mutate from one type to another as it passes
        through the whole of <i>Samsara</i>. But if there is nothing there, if
        consciousness is empty of substance, only then can it stop.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">To see that core of consciousness to be
        empty is liberating. It means that whether you know happiness or you
        know suffering, whether you know confusion or you know clarity, you
        realize that this is just empty consciousness playing a game with you,
        making you think that this is real. When you've actually seen the
        emptiness of consciousness, it's like finally seeing the television set
        disappear on which all of this drama of life is carried out.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As I mentioned earlier, I like to use
        the simile of televisions. Imagine six television sets in line - one is
        called &quot;sight&quot;, one is called &quot;hearing&quot;, one is
        called &quot;smell&quot;, one is called &quot;taste&quot;, one is called
        &quot;touch&quot;, and the last is called &quot;mind&quot;. Only one of
        these televisions is on at a time - just one, then another and another,
        flicking into existence and then out. It's easy to see the content on
        the screens and see the content rise and fall, but the way to become
        Enlightened is not only to see the content on the screen rise and fall,
        but to see the whole television set come into existence and then
        completely disappear.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the great advantages of attaining
        <i>Jhana</i>s is that as soon as you've got into a <i>Jhana</i> five
        &quot;television sets&quot; have completely vanished - not just popped
        out of existence for a moment, but popped out of existence for many
        hours. It's not as if there's nothing on the screen;<b> there's no
        screen any more!</b> There is no sight. There is no sound. There's not
        even any hearing. There's no smell. There's no taste. There's no touch.
        This is because there's no body when you're in <i>Jhana</i>. It is pure
        mental consciousness. That's why you can sit for long periods of time.
        The knees don't ache; the back doesn't ache; the nose doesn't itch
        because it's got hayfever. You've completely left the world.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Five &quot;television sets&quot;
        disappear, and you've just got this mind left. Be aware though that you
        can get stuck there. Some people with weak wisdom will think,
        &quot;That's it - the mind is the ultimate 'television set' that doesn't
        disappear.&quot; However you can either use inference, or you can take
        those <i>Jhanas </i>deeper, and you can see parts of that last
        &quot;television set&quot; get hacked away. From First <i>Jhana</i> to
        Second <i>Jhana</i> you hack away at half the &quot;television
        set&quot;, initial and sustained application of mind (<i>Vitakka and
        Vicara</i>). From Second to Third to Fourth <i>Jhana</i> you hack away a
        heap more of that &quot;television set&quot;. You hack away at more of
        the &quot;television set&quot; and you get into the Immaterial
        Absorptions (<i>Arupa Jhanas</i>). You keep hacking away until you get
        to cessation (<i>Nirodha Samapatti</i>), when the whole of that last
        &quot;television set&quot; is gone. Consciousness has disappeared. That
        which knows has vanished. You come out of that experience, and there is
        no way that you can miss the meaning. That which we thought to be real,
        pervasive and stable, <b>that which knows is a mirage!</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes people get afraid when I talk
        like this, and that's to be expected because I'm challenging the very
        heart of who they think they are. Challenging it to its very roots. But
        imagine for a while what it would be like to have no self. To have no
        self means that all of this happiness and suffering, this pain and
        pleasure, this delight and frustration which arises in the mind will not
        worry you any more. Why would it concern us when there is no one there
        who owns this pain in the body or pleasure in the body? All the
        frustration, the success or the failure, why would we worry about it?
        You know these are just things which rise and fall. They're not yours.
        There's no one to blame, and there's no one to praise. Praise and blame
        are worldly phenomena (<i>Dhamma</i>s). The Buddha said they don't
        belong to anybody. They just belong to nature.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Praise and blame are great to
        contemplate. When I was young I always tried to avoid blame like the
        plague, and I'd only seek praise. If I got blamed I would think there
        was something wrong with me, and I was quite skillful in trying to
        please others. But even though I tried my very best, I still got blamed
        for things which I didn't do. I also noticed that I got praised for
        things I didn't do as well, but I never complained about that. I would
        get fed up if someone blamed me unfairly. I really noticed how much of
        my early life was spent trying to please somebody. I was trying to
        please my parents, please my teachers at school, please my friends or
        please my girlfriend. Later on I spent so much time trying to please
        Ajahn Chah, please Ajahn Sumedho, please the Buddhist Society of Western
        Australia's management committee, or please the monks who were staying
        with me. Now I don't care if I please anyone or not. If you've had a
        rotten rains retreat, I don't care. Ha! Ha! Its just worldly <i>Dhamma</i>s;
        its got nothing to do with me. I take no responsibility if you got it
        right either. It's praise and blame, that's all. Isn't it wonderful when
        you see this is not Ajahn Brahm giving the talk? You don't have to worry
        about what is said, and you don't have to worry about trying to inspire
        people. It's just the play of <i>Dhamma</i>s, that's all it is.</font></p>
        <h4><font color="#000099" face="Times New Roman">Freedom From Suffering</font></h4>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">What I'm trying to say is that when one
        realizes non-self or anatta, there's a great freedom which comes from
        letting go of all that concern which caused you suffering. The Lord
        Buddha said that when there's a self, there are things that belong to it
        (MN,22). There's <b>my</b> reputation and what people think of<b> me</b>.
        There's <b>my</b> possessions; there's <b>my</b> body; there's <b>my</b>
        thoughts, <b>my</b> ideas,<b> my</b> views and there's<b> my </b>meditation.
        All of these things which begin with <b>&quot;my&quot;</b> happen when
        we have a self.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Imagine that there is no self. When
        there's no self, there's no core; there is no me, and there is no mine.
        Imagine what it's like to have no possessions. I don't just mean
        physical possessions. I don't just mean that you've got no hut, you've
        got no robes, you've got no money, you've got no honey or sugar. I mean
        you've got no body, no arms, no head, no teeth; and you have no
        thoughts! Thoughts are there but they are not yours. You have no
        happiness, and you have no suffering. Happiness and suffering come and
        go, but they are nothing to do with you. There is no one in here.
        Imagine what it's like to have nothing, truly to be without possessions
        and to have followed the path of renunciation far deeper than you first
        thought was possible. You don't just renounce worldly things, you
        renounce unworldly things too -- all things, any thing! Throw everything
        away until there's literally nothing left.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Imagine when you have absolutely
        nothing: no body, no mind, no consciousness. It all just belongs to
        nature. You give back the deeds of your life to its rightful owner.
        Nature owns all this, not you. If you could do that, imagine how free
        you would be. You would have absolutely no worries and no concerns.
        Whatever happens in the world, nature looks after it. Happiness,
        suffering, clarity, confusion, whatever occurs is just the play of
        nature. That's why the Lord Buddha said, when there is not a self then
        there is nothing belonging to a self. If there is no &quot;mine&quot;,
        there is no craving any more.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Why do you want to grab onto things? To
        grab onto happiness is to grab onto suffering as well. People are crazy.
        They grab onto both praise and blame. When someone tells you off and
        tells you how stupid you are, you grab onto that, &quot;I'm stupid! Why
        do they call me stupid? I'm not really stupid&quot;. You're just holding
        onto that. When there is pain in the body you think, &quot;I hurt. This
        is painful&quot;. Why are you holding onto that? You're just making
        yourself suffer.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Craving is not just for pleasant things.
        Stupid people will crave for suffering! They just crave for anything
        because they're into craving. It's like someone going into a shop; they
        decide they are going to buy something whether they like it or not.
        They'll even buy rubbish. That's what craving is like. You'll eat
        anything when you're hungry, and attach to anything when you're stupid
        and craving - even suffering. This is all because deep inside of us we
        still think we are there. Therefore we want to do something; we want to
        get something, and we want to own something. The whole function of
        having a self, of having an ego, is to do, to possess and to have power
        over our possessions. Big egos in the world like to be prime ministers,
        presidents, kings and queens. They like to own so much and to have so
        much power over everything. The extent of your ego is your desire for
        power over others. Someone who has got no ego doesn't exert power over
        others.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I remember some of the great monks that
        I have known, Enlightened Ones (<i>Arahants</i>) of the Forest
        Tradition. Sometimes people thought they were fearsome because they
        would always tell you what to do. But according to my memory they were
        just so soft and kind. They were freeing you, not controlling you. They
        gave to you; they never tried to take possession of you. One can even
        say that the whole purpose of a teacher is to get rid of disciples, not
        to get more. That's why I try to get rid of each one of you, to make you
        enlightened and free. That's the purpose of a teacher, not to possess
        you but to liberate you. The purpose of the Teaching (the <i>Dhamma</i>)
        is to liberate.</font></p>
        <h4><font color="#000099" face="Times New Roman">The Driverless Bus</font></h4>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Often when you start to delve into
        non-self, there comes a time when you don't want to go any further
        because you're afraid. I'm not talking about ordinary fear; I'm talking
        about fear that goes to what you take to be your very &quot;core&quot;.
        You're challenging all you ever thought about yourself, and you're
        undermining your whole essence of existence. Your whole reason to be is
        being challenged by imagining what it would be like if there were
        nothing there. If you have the courage and the faith to go through that
        fear and find that what you were afraid of was nothing, you will receive
        the most beautiful gift - the gift of freedom. The gift of the ending of
        things, of the work being finished.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Years ago I gave the simile of &quot;the
        driverless bus&quot;. It's like you're driving through life in a bus,
        and you get pleasant experiences and unpleasant experiences. You think
        it's your fault; or you think that it's the driver's fault. &quot;Why is
        it that the driver doesn't drive into pleasant country and stay there
        for a long time? Why does he always drive into unpleasant territory and
        stay there a long time?&quot; You want to find out who is controlling
        this journey called &quot;my life&quot;. Why is it that you experience
        so much pain and suffering? You want to find out where the driver is,
        the driver of these five aggregates (Khandhas): body, feeling,
        perception, mentality and consciousness - the driver of you. After doing
        a lot of meditation and listening to the <i>Dhamma</i>, you finally go
        up to where the driver's seat is in the bus, and you find it's empty!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It shocks you at first, but it gives you
        so much relief to know there's no one to blame. How many people blame
        somebody when there is suffering? They either blame God, or they blame
        their parents, or they blame the government, or they blame the weather,
        or they blame some sickness they have, and in the last resort if they
        can't find anyone else to blame, they blame themselves. It's stupidity.
        There is no one to blame! Look inside and see it's empty, &quot;a
        driverless bus&quot;. When you see non-self (<i>Anatta</i>), you see
        there is no one to blame; it's <i>Anatta</i>. The result is that you go
        back into your seat and just enjoy the journey. If it's a driverless
        bus, what else can you do? You sit there when you go through pleasant
        experiences, &quot;just pleasant experiences that's all&quot;. You go
        through painful experiences, &quot;just painful experiences, that's
        all&quot;. It's just a driverless bus.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">You think that you have driven a course
        through these three months of the Rains Retreat, that your success or
        failure, your happiness or suffering is due to you.<b> It's not, it's
        just nature.</b> You've got no one to blame, and you've got no one to
        praise. Whatever has happened is just that; so stop shouting at the
        driver. Stop cursing the driver. There's no one there; you're wasting
        your breath. Just sit in your seat and &quot;cop it sweet&quot; [2].
        When there are nice times, have fun. When there are unpleasant times,
        have fun. When you've got no one to blame, you might as well enjoy the
        journey. This is the simile of the driverless bus.</font></p>
        <h4><font color="#000099" face="Times New Roman">&quot;The Answer is
        'There Is Nothing&quot;</font></h4>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I remember one of the teachings Ajahn
        Chah gave me personally. He used to come to our monastery at Wat Pah
        Nanachat every week because we had built a sauna for him there. He found
        the sauna beneficial as his health was failing by this stage. When he
        came it was great because he would give us a talk as well. That day he'd
        come to give a talk. We had fired up the sauna, and as soon as it was
        ready a few monks went to help him. I would help him sometimes; other
        times I let other people help.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This time, after giving a very inspiring
        talk to all the Western monks, he went off to the sauna, and I let some
        other monks look after him. I went to the back of the hall, sat outside,
        and had a deep, peaceful meditation. After coming out of my meditation I
        thought I would check out how Ajahn Chah was, to see if I could help
        him. Walking from the hall to the sauna, I saw he was already finished
        and was walking in the opposite direction with a couple of Thai lay
        people.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ajahn Chah took one look at me, saw that
        I'd been in a deep meditation, and he said, &quot;Brahmavamso,<b>
        Why?&quot;</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I was completely surprised and confused,
        and replied, &quot;I don't know&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Afterwards he said, &quot;If anyone ever
        asks you that question again, the correct answer is, 'There is
        nothing'&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Do you understand?&quot; Ajahn
        Chah asked me.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yes,&quot; I said.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;No you don't,&quot; he replied.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So if you've been asking that question,
        Why? Why? Why?, I've given you the answer now. It's straight from a
        great meditation master, Ajahn Chah. The answer to the question &quot;<b>Why?</b>&quot;
        is, &quot;<b>There is nothing</b>&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">He was really great, Ajahn Chah, and he
        was correct. That will always remain with me, &quot;There is
        nothing&quot;. This is emptiness. There is no doer. There is no knower,
        it's completely empty! To be able to get to that emptiness, encourage
        yourself by knowing that if you do find that emptiness, it's wonderful!
        All the Enlightened Ones that I have known have always been happy; they
        haven't regretted finding out that there's nothing there. No one has
        said to me, &quot;I wish I hadn't found this out&quot;. It's liberating
        when you see there is nothing there. There is nothing to hold onto, and <b>when
        you don't hold onto anything, there's no suffering any more.</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">All of the craving, all of the
        attachment, and all of the pain that arises because of those cravings
        and attachments, all have their origin in the illusion of self. That
        illusion of self creates a sense of &quot;me&quot; and a sense of
        &quot;mine&quot;, all that I want, all the praise and blame, the &quot;I
        am&quot; conceit (<i>Asmimana</i>): &quot;I am as good as the next
        person&quot;; &quot;I am better&quot;; &quot;I am worse&quot;. How many
        of you are still suffering because of comparing yourselves to someone
        else? You don't have to compare yourself to anybody. You're not there!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is no more comparison anymore once
        you can give the &quot;self&quot; away. You don't even need to worry
        about what people think about you: because there is no one there to
        think about. How much suffering comes from worrying about what you think
        other people think about you, especially what I think about you because
        I'm the teacher here? What do I think about you? I don't think anything
        about you, because you are just not there!</font></p>
        <h4><font color="#000099" face="Times New Roman">Letting Go of
        Everything!</font></h4>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another simile that I like to use is
        that as long as there is a hand you will go on picking up things. That's
        what a hand does. If you've got a hand and a nose, you'll pick your nose
        from time to time when no one is looking. When there is no hand, when
        you have cut the hand off, then you won't pick things up which create
        suffering for you and which create the burden of ownership.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those of you who have started renouncing
        can understand that the more you give up, the freer you feel. You give
        up your house; you give up your car; you give up your possessions; you
        give up sex; you give up entertainment; you give up all these things,
        and you find the more you give up, the more liberated you are. It's like
        a person with a big rucksack on their back, carrying all these rocks,
        who has come to realize that they don't have to carry all these things.
        So on the journey up the mountain to Nibbana they keep throwing things
        out: throwing out all their possessions, throwing out their body,
        throwing out their thoughts, throwing out their worries and throwing out
        their illusion of self. On the last few steps up the mountain, they
        throw out the &quot;doer&quot;, next they throw away the
        &quot;knower&quot;. Then there is nothing left. <b>When there is nothing
        left then they are free. </b>When we say this is the path of
        renunciation, we really mean renouncing. When we say it's the path of
        letting go, it's <b>really</b> letting go of <b>everything</b>. Don't
        keep even a small thing left over.</font></p>
        <h4><font color="#000099" face="Times New Roman">The End</font></h4>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Have you the courage to do it? It's
        really worthwhile becoming Enlightened. It's to be recommended. Don't
        you want to become Enlightened? Don't you want to be free of all this?
        Haven't you had enough of <i>samsara</i>? Haven't you had enough of
        going to work? Haven't you had enough of this body, and pain, and going
        to the doctors, and having kids, and worrying about whether you're happy
        or sad, and all these thoughts which run through your mind and create
        problems and difficulties? One minute happy, the next minute sad.
        Haven't you had enough of all that?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Meditate! Make the mind still! Look at
        this thing we call the mind, let the lotus open up and see the most
        beautiful jewel there could ever be - nothingness. There's nothing
        better than nothingness, and there's no jewel greater than the <i><i><i>Dhamma</i>.</i></i></font></p>
