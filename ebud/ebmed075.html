        TASSA BHAGAVATO ARAHATO SAMMASAMBUDDHASSA</i></font></h4>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">I</font>n the Buddhist
        world today, there is much discussion among meditators about the
        relevance of <i>Jhana</i> (to be explained below). The first question
        usually asked is &quot;Must one achieve <i>Jhana</i> first to become
        fully Enlightened (<i>Arahant</i>), or is it possible to reach the
        Supreme Goal without any experience of <i>Jhana</i>?&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who ask this question are usually
        those who have not yet experienced <i>Jhana</i> themselves. It is
        difficult to do what is necessary to realise <i>Jhana</i>; so most
        people ask this question wanting to be told that <i>Jhana</i> is not
        essential. They want to be told that their inability is not an obstacle.
        They want a quick and easy way to <i>Nibbana</i>. Such people will be
        pleased and even inspired by a teacher who tells them what they wanted
        to hear anyway - that these <i>Jhana</i> states are unnecessary - and
        they will follow this teaching because it is convenient. Unfortunately,
        Truth is seldom convenient, and rarely agrees with what we want to hear.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the other hand, a meditator who has
        familiarity with <i>Jhanas</i> will recognise them as blissful states of
        letting go, and it is right there, in the experience of letting go,
        letting go that the relevance of <i>Jhana</i> is known. The First <i>Jhana</i>
        is the natural result of letting go of the concern for sensory pleasure
        (<i>Kama Sukha</i>), by which is meant all concern, even for mere
        comfort, in the realm of the five external senses (sight, sound, smell,
        taste and touch). In the First <i>Jhana</i>, through sustained and
        complete removal of all interest in these five senses the meditator
        loses all sense of the body, and these five external senses disappear.
        They abide wholly in the sixth sense that is pure mind, and are still,
        in blissful inner silence. The Buddha called this &quot;The Bliss of
        Renunciation&quot;, or the bliss of letting go. The Second <i>Jhana</i>
        is the natural result of abandoning a very subtle movement of attention
        towards and holding onto this blissful mind object. When this final
        'wobbling' of attention is let go of, one experiences the even more
        pleasurable bliss of full inner stillness (<i>Samadhi</i>), where the
        mind is absolutely one -pointed and motionless. The Third <i>Jhana</i>
        is the natural result of letting go of the subtle excitement of rapture,
        and the Fourth <i>Jhana</i> is the natural result of letting go of
        happiness itself, so as to enjoy the most profound and immovable mental
        equanimity.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Buddhism, experience, not
        speculation, and even less blind belief, is the criterion for
        understanding. A meditator simply does not realise what stillness,
        rapture, happiness or equanimity fully mean until they have become
        familiar with the <i>Jhanas</i>. But the experience of the <i>Jhanas</i>,
        these stages of letting go, give one direct understanding through
        experience of these mental phenomena, in particular happiness (<i>Sukha</i>)
        and suffering (<i>Dukkha</i>).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is similar to the tadpole who has
        spent her whole life in the water but who can have no understanding of
        water because she has known nothing else. Then, when she grows up into a
        frog, lets go of the water, and attains to dry land, she knows both the
        nature of water and the way to go beyond it. In this simile, the water
        stands for <i>Dukkha</i>, the dry land for <i>Jhana</i> (not <i>Nibbana</i>
        - the frog still carries a little water on her skin upon dry land!), and
        the way to go beyond stands for letting go.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this way, the practice of <i>Jhana</i>
        reveals the Path to fully ending <i>Dukkha</i>. The meditator who
        achieves <i>Jhana</i> will eventually ask &quot;Why are these <i>Jhanas</i>
        so profoundly blissful? They will discover for themselves the obvious
        answer -&quot;Because they are stages of letting go of that which they
        now see as fine forms of suffering!&quot; When one is familiar with <i>Jhana</i>,
        and realises the origin of the bliss therein, one will come to see for
        oneself that all worldly pleasures, that is, of the five external senses
        (which include sexuality), are merely <i>Dukkha</i>. The attachment to
        the body and its sensory adventures will begin to fade away. One will
        understand clearly why all Enlightened Ones are celibate. Then, as one
        progresses onwards to the higher <i>Jhanas </i>and contemplates why each
        further one is ever more pleasing, one comes to understand that it is
        because one is letting go of refined mental attachments, such as the
        attachment to rapture, happiness and equanimity. It becomes clear that
        even these most lofty of mind states are just refined forms of
        suffering, because when one lets them go, then more suffering goes too.
        The higher one goes , the more <i>Dukkha</i> is let go of and through
        this process <i>Dukkha</i> becomes known. One cannot know fully the
        Truth of Suffering, and thus the Buddha's Four Noble Truths, except by
        letting go of suffering through the experience of <i>Jhana</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is very odd, therefore, that some
        suggest that the practise of <i>Jhana</i> leads to attachment. How can,
        what is the practice of letting go, lead to attachment? Indeed, the
        Buddha repeatedly said that these<i> Jhanas</i> should not be feared,
        but should be developed, and that when these<i> Jhanas </i>are indulged
        in regularly they lead to <i>Sotapanna, Sakadagami, Anagami</i>, and <i>Arahant</i>,
        the four stages of Enlightenment. (See the <i>Pasadika Sutta </i>of the <i>Digha
        Nikaya</i>).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once Full Enlightenment is reached and
        all attachments are removed, then letting go into <i>Jhana</i> becomes
        as natural as a leaf released from a tree falling downwards to the
        ground. Indeed, one's present ability to let go and experience the <i>Jhana</i>
        is a measure of one's true understanding of the Dhamma and consequent
        lack of attachment.</font></p>
