        we believe? Amid the shifting sands of opinion, is there a solid rock of 
        certainty on which to stand? The Buddha insisted that personal 
        experience must be the ultimate criterion. But for the unenlightened, 
        personal experience can be ambiguous, even misleading. To complicate 
        matters further, in these times of information overload there is a 
        bewildering diversity of teachers and teachings, all claiming to be 
        based on experience. In this work I aim to address, not the question of 
        the Kalamas – ‘How do we decide between different religious teachings?’ 
        &#8209; but rather: ‘How do we decide between different interpretations of the 
        Buddha’s teachings?’ This question also arose for the Buddha’s followers 
        as his life drew near its end. His answer, known as the four great 
        references, is recorded as follows:</SPAN></P>

        aware of the possibility of breakdown in transmission, nevertheless 
        trusted the <I>Sangha</I> to adequately preserve his teachings; most 
        practitioners and scholars today agree this has occurred. The <I>suttas</I> 
        offer the seeker a unique opportunity to engage with a direct expression 
        of perfect enlightenment. Lucid, immediate, and pragmatic, this <I>
        Dhamma</I> emerged at a time when experiments in democracy could form a 
        model for organization of the <I>Sangha</I>; when freedom of religious 
        creed and practice was unquestioned; and when the religious 
        establishment was straining under the weight of the rituals, 
        hierarchies, and mystifications of age-old tradition, unable to address 
        the issues most relevant to people's lives. The spirit of inquiry 
        responded to these conditions with a bewildering diversity of religious 
        sects, of which the Buddha's best stood the test of time. The universal, 
        timeless quality of the Buddha’s words, like an arrow aimed straight at 
        the heart of the human condition, inspired an unprecedented effort to 
        preserve his Teachings ‘for those who feel’. The following passage 
        clarifies both what the Buddha meant by ‘sutta’ and why this standard is 
        important.</SPAN></P>

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The texts relied on here are the 
        only ones considered authoritative by all schools of Buddhism. My 
        intention is to establish an interpretation of the crucial features of 
        the path acceptable to all Buddhists by not relying on later authorities 
        peculiar to any particular school. These texts are the five <I>Nikayas</I>

        some extraneous additions even within this limited body of texts; yet 
        such additions seem to be limited to supplementary matter, especially 
        verse, and do not substantially affect the doctrine. These <I>Nikayas</I> 
        correspond to the <I>Agamas</I> preserved in the Chinese and Tibetan 
        traditions. Where they differ, the <I>Nikayas</I> usually seem to be

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">I have been conscious throughout 
        of avoiding writing a ‘fundamentalist’ critique of contemporary schools 
        of meditation or of the traditional commentaries. It seems that the 
        commentaries in particular have become a favorite target of criticism, 
        particularly for Western scholars. This might be influenced by the 
        generally odious image of institutionalized medieval monasticism in the 
        West. But time and again initially plausible critiques turn out to be 
        shortsighted, and, worse, the critics then proceed to make as many or 
        more new blunders. In fact the commentaries are an invaluable mine of 
        information on <I>Dhamma</I>, <I>Pali</I>, history, and much else, and 
        any translator owes them a great debt. However, I am resolutely 
        committed to interpreting the <I>suttas</I> on their own terms, and try 
        as I might to see the matter from the commentarial position, I have in 
        several instances reached conflicting conclusions. I have noted some 
        important points of divergence; the points of agreement are too many to 
        mention. I have mentioned such differences, not out of desire to 
        criticize, but because the commentarial system is highly influential in 
        contemporary meditation circles and therefore has a direct effect on 
        people’s lives. I believe that a careful appraisal of the tradition in 
        the light of the <I>suttas</I> will facilitate appreciation of its true 
        value.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">I have yet to see any 
        satisfactory study along historical and comparative lines of the 
        development of <I>Theravadin</I> thought in these issues. I may simply 
        add that the commentaries universally praise <I>jhana</I> and devote 
        great lengths to explain what it is and how to develop it. However, 
        certain variations in their explanations of key points suggest that they 
        may incorporate some divergence of opinion. Thus ‘purification of mind’ 
        is defined in the <I>Digha</I> <I>Nikaya</I> commentary as ‘the 
        thoroughly mastered eight attainments [i.e. form and formless jhana] as 
        a basis for <I>vipassana’</I>, whereas in the <I>Visuddhimagga</I> it is 
        ‘the eight attainments together with access [<I>samadhi</I>]’. Again, 
        where the <I>Visuddhimagga</I> treats ‘mind’ as absorption and access <I>
        samadhi</I>, the <I>Samyutta</I> <I>Nikaya</I> commentary to the same 
        verse defines ‘mind’ simply as ‘the eight attainments’. Again, 
        ‘momentary <I>samadhi’</I> occurs only twice, both times subordinate to
        <I>jhana</I>, in the <I>Visuddhimagga</I>, but more often and with more 
        independence in its commentary. These differences could be explained 
        away as mere variations in the letter; but the natural conclusion in the 
        face of the evidence is that there is a divergence in meaning, perhaps a 
        historical development. Far from being a uniform emanation of 
        enlightened wisdom, the commentarial literature is a complex and 
        evolving scholasticism. The tradition itself is quite happy to chronicle 
        un-reconciled differences of opinion. In any case, the task I have set 
        myself is to explain what the <I>suttas</I> say, and so I have 
        throughout avoided relying on the commentaries. Nor, with two slight 
        exceptions, have I relied on the testimony of contemporary meditators, 
        as such testimony is diverse and unverifiable.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">A problem can arise: since even 
        learned scholars can disagree on the meaning of <I>sutta</I> passages, 
        is the above standard any use? Two related principles of interpretation 
        can help clarify obscure passages. One we call the principle of 
        proportion, the second, the principle of historical perspective.</SPAN></P>

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The principle of proportion 
        involves assessing the relative importance and reliability of <I>sutta</I> 
        passages using a variety of acceptable objective criteria. If there are 
        any gray areas, anomalies, or possible conflicts, then the more 
        important and reliable passage should take precedence. It is not 
        necessary to assume that there either are or are not contradictions in 
        the sutta texts as we have them, nor that the secondary passages are not 
        authoritative, simply that the primary passages should be granted 
        greater authority.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Consider how the <I>suttas</I> 
        were assembled. First, the Buddha would have taught; his followers would 
        memorize the teachings and later embed them in a framework of time and 
        place. This indicates that it is the doctrinal teachings themselves, 
        rather than background details or anecdotes, which should be accorded 
        greater weight. This can be shown by comparing the following two 
        passages, each introducing the same <I>sutta</I>, the <I>Samannaphala</I>. 
        The first is from the <I>Vinaya</I> <I>Culavagga</I>, recounting the 
        history of the recitation of the <I>suttas</I> and <I>vinaya</I> by the
        <I>Sangha</I> after the Buddha’s passing away.</SPAN></P>

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Although the story is 
        essentially the same, the form is different and many details have been 
        added. Even the words ‘Thus have I heard’ are missing from the <I>
        Culavagga</I> account. From other contexts it seems that the phrase 
        ‘Thus have I heard’ is reserved for relating events Second-hand.<A HREF="#_edn7" NAME="_ednref7" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[7]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        If one was actually present, the phrase Face to face have I heard it’ is 
        used instead. ‘Thus have I heard’ therefore would not have been spoken 
        by Venerable Ananda, since he was present when many of the suttas were 
        delivered. The Buddha described his teaching as the ‘suttas spoken by 
        the <I>Tathagata’</I>, and it seems from the above account that his 
        early disciples also regarded the ‘<I>sutta’</I> in the most 
        authoritative sense as the doctrinal teachings spoken by the Buddha (or 
        his enlightened disciples), as distinct from the incidental details of 
        where it was spoken and to whom, etc.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Other common sense 
        considerations should also be borne in mind when interpreting the <I>
        suttas</I>. Minor teachings should concede precedence to central and 
        important themes, especially those given special significance by the 
        Buddha himself. Poetry is naturally less suited to precise and detailed 
        exposition of doctrinal points than prose; in addition, much of the 
        poetry of the <I>Tipitaka</I> seems to be of later date than the prose. 
        When quoting verses, therefore, we will try to restrict ourselves to the 
        earlier strata. Similes, inferences, and passages of dubious or 
        controversial interpretation are likewise of secondary consideration.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">For several centuries the suttas 
        were handed down orally, most reciters concentrating on learning texts 
        from a single <I>Nikaya</I>. The arrangers of the <I>suttas</I> would 
        naturally wish to edit their material so that the core teachings would 
        be found in each <I>Nikaya</I>, the fifth (minor) <I>Nikaya</I> being 
        only somewhat of an exception. In this way by learning one <I>Nikaya</I> 
        one should be able to come to an accurate understanding of all the major 
        teachings. The <I>Nikayas</I> differ in perspective and emphasis, but 
        not in doctrine. The interesting conclusion follows that it is unlikely 
        that a text crucial for deciding an important doctrinal point would be 
        found in only one or two <I>Nikayas</I>.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The Buddha clearly felt that at 
        least some of his discourses stood in no need of interpretation.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">‘These two misrepresent the 
        Tathagata... one who shows a sutta whose meaning requires further 
        explanation as not requiring further explanation; and one who shows a 
        sutta whose meaning does not require further explanation as requiring 
        further explanation</SPAN></I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">.’<A HREF="#_edn8" NAME="_ednref8" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[8]</SPAN></SPAN></A></SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">There is therefore no 
        justification for assuming that the <I>suttas</I> teach only a 
        provisional, conventional teaching, which the <I>abhidhamma</I> explains 
        in full detail; both of these methods are found within the suttas 
        themselves. The <I>suttas</I> are full of similes, parables, and brief 
        or enigmatic teachings that require interpretation. Sometimes the Buddha 
        would do so, or encourage a disciple to do so. Often it is left up to 
        the audience, the Buddha apparently recognizing that the process of 
        sincere investigation into meaning can be of more value than being 
        handed all the answers on a plate. But definitive statements of central 
        doctrinal importance surely belong to the category of statements that 
        are fully explained. Care should be taken, therefore, to avoid imputing 
        unjustified meanings to such passages.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">So what then are these central 
        teachings on practice? Shortly before the Buddha passed away he 
        emphasized a set of seven groups of <I>Dhammas</I>, later known as the

        crucial question underpinning the whole way of practice to a background 
        story, minor category, or dubious inference? Surely it is more 
        reasonable to suppose that he would have described the way of practice 
        very carefully, defined his terms clearly, and repeated them often. This 
        being so, when faced with gray areas or unclear passages, we should

        PERSPECTIVE</SPAN></B></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Our second interpretative 
        guideline is the principle of historical perspective. In the 2,500 years 
        since the Buddha, discussion, systematization, and perhaps modification 
        of the meaning of what he said has continued unabated. Without passing 
        judgment on the value of these discussions, it should be clear that it 
        is quite inappropriate to read terminology and concepts of a later era 
        into the texts of an earlier era. This error may occur in a number of 
        ways: new terminology may be invented for old ideas; old words may 
        acquire new meanings; or completely new concepts may be invented and 
        artificially imposed on the old texts.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Remember that in the text quoted 
        at the beginning of this paper the Buddha conferred sole authority on 
        the <I>sutta</I> and <I>vinaya</I>; no <I>abhidhamma</I> and certainly 
        no commentaries. It has been established by scholastic research that the 
        abhidhamma did not exist in the Buddha's lifetime, but, along with some 
        later works included in the <I>suttas</I>, was developed during a period 
        of approximately four centuries after the Buddha's passing away. The 
        commentaries were not finalized until 1,000 years after the Buddha, over 
        the same period when the <I>Mahayana</I> <I>Sutras</I> were composed. 
        Some say that even if these texts did not exist in their present form, 
        still their essence was spoken by the Buddha and his disciples. This 
        claim, while not altogether baseless, is misleading. Much of the 
        material in the <I>abhidhamma</I> and commentaries is perfectly in 
        accord with the suttas and may well be descended from sayings of the 
        Buddha. However, much of their teachings are radically different in both 
        form and content from the <I>suttas</I>, and it is precisely these 
        passages that give rise to controversy. We can fortunately, sidestep the 
        question of whether these teachings differ only in the letter or also in 
        the meaning as a strictly separate and secondary issue. The first of the 
        great references quoted above refers to a teaching that a monk claims to 
        have heard from the Buddha's lips; even this must only be accepted if it 
        is in line with the <I>suttas</I> and <I>vinaya</I>. So the <I>suttas</I> 
        can simply be taken on their own terms, and for all important matters 
        they should be sufficient. Anyone who reads the <I>suttas</I> cannot 
        help but be impressed by the clarity, consistency, and precision of the 
        Buddha's teaching. To hold that he was unable to explain what he meant 
        would be a curious aspersion on his ability.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The <I>Theravada</I> tradition 
        has coined a range of terminology and concepts which, although unknown 
        to the <I>suttas</I>, constitutes the standard vocabulary of much 
        contemporary Buddhist meditation teaching. These terms include 
        ‘momentary’ and ‘access’ <I>samadhi</I>; ‘<I>vipassana</I> <I>jhana’</I>, 
        ‘<I>samatha</I> <I>jhana’</I>, and ‘transcendental <I>jhana’</I>; the 
        ‘one whose vehicle is serenity’ and the ‘one whose vehicle is pure (or 
        dry) insight’. So prevalent is the influence of these terms that the 
        conception of the path of meditation they imply is tacitly accepted by 
        almost all books on meditation, and has been 'authorized' by inclusion 
        in standard reference works. Someone interested in Buddhist meditation 
        can thus pick up a wide variety of books from diverse sources, simple 
        and complex, all of which re-affirm the same ideas. The plain fact that 
        these special concepts are based on scholastic writings dated centuries 
        after the Buddha and peculiar to the <I>Theravada</I> school is 
        obscured. If we wish to understand the <I>suttas</I> as those who 
        listened to them, we must first carefully examine the contextual 
        significance of crucial terms. Sound textual analysis must proceed from 
        unambiguous contexts as a basis for inferring the meaning of ambiguous 
        contexts. Any interpretation which relies on reading non-standard 
        meanings into ambiguous passages should be rejected out of hand.</SPAN></P>

        This would seem to be difficult to square with the usual understanding

        doctrinal categories, nor are they shown as the direct outcome of 
        tranquility and bliss, but regularly follow after <I>jhana</I>. It may

        latter not. The series of four derivatives of ‘<I>jhana</I>’ augmented 
        with prefixes is always used in connection with the five hindrances, 
        never with the four <I>jhanas</I>. The mention of the four elements 
        seems to be an idiomatic reference to the four ‘form’ <I>jhanas</I>. To 
        preserve consistency, the text applies ‘<I>jhana</I>’ to the formless 
        attainments &#8209; a common usage in later literature but perhaps unique in 
        the <I>suttas</I>. The ‘<I>jhana</I>’ mentioned in the final phrase may 
        be the fruition attainment of <I>arahantship</I>. Notice that this 
        meditative experience of enlightenment is distinguished from the form 
        and formless <I>jhanas</I>. Although the text does not unequivocally 
        praise <I>jhana</I>, it is not the <I>jhana</I>, but the person 
        practicing it, who the Buddha criticizes, and then only by comparison 
        with the <I>arahant</I>. As we shall see below, the ideas of ‘food’ and 
        ‘dependence’ imply dependent origination; so all conditioned states are 
        being faulted here from the standpoint of ultimate wisdom as being still 
        bound up with rebirth. It should be re-emphasized that these broad 
        usages of the term ‘<I>jhana</I>’ &#8209; here mentioned for completeness &#8209; 
        are exceedingly rare.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">These are the only meanings of 
        the words ‘<I>jhana</I>’ and ‘<I>samadhi</I>’ which can be unambiguously 
        established from the early <I>suttas</I>. Since these two words occur so 
        often with such clear meaning, it seems reasonable to assume that they 
        refer to the four <I>jhanas</I> unless there is contextual evidence 
        otherwise. As <I>samadhi</I> may have a broader meaning on occasion, 
        however, it will be prudent to confirm the contextual meaning whenever 
        possible. The <I>Visuddhimagga</I> classifies meditation subjects 
        according to whether they produce absorption or only access <I>samadhi</I>. 
        But since access <I>samadhi</I> plays no role in the Buddha’s scheme of 
        meditation, it seems unlikely he would have taught any meditation not 
        capable of leading to <I>jhana</I>. Although it is difficult to 
        substantiate this for every meditation subject, we will see below that 
        in at least some cases, meditations traditionally believed to produce 
        only access can, according to the <I>suttas</I>, lead to absorption.</SPAN></P>

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The term ‘<I>vipassana jhana</I>’ 
        seems to stem from a historical development in the application of the 
        terms ‘<I>samatha</I>’ and ‘<I>vipassana</I>’. In the <I>suttas</I>, no 
        meditation technique is labeled, such as by saying ‘<I>kasinas</I> and 
        loving-kindness are <I>samatha</I>, <I>satipatthana</I> is <I>vipassana</I>’. 
        A growing tendency to segregate and systematize the various meditation 
        subjects developed into the prevailing practice of identifying <I>
        samatha</I> and <I>vipassana</I> with the meditation subjects 
        themselves, rather than with the mental qualities that the techniques 
        foster. Having thus labeled a certain technique as ‘<I>vipassana</I>’, 
        it was found that experiences of rapture, serenity, and bliss occur 
        during ‘<I>vipassana</I>’ which were then called ‘<I>vipassana jhana</I>’. 
        But these emotional qualities are precisely what ‘<I>samatha’</I> refers 
        to. This is not some new kind of ‘<I>jhana</I> happening in <I>vipassana</I>’, 
        it is just <I>samatha</I> pure and simple. One may hear that ‘<I>vipassana</I>’ 
        helps to relieve stress, solve psychological imbalances, or increase 
        compassion; but these things are aspects of <I>samatha</I>, ‘development 
        of the mind’, regardless of the label stuck on the technique. As long as 
        the mind is still moving, however, and as long as the five external 
        senses still impinge, it falls short of true <I>jhana</I> &#8209; the mind 
        absolutely content to rest still within itself.</SPAN></P>

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">There is one further concept to 
        be discussed: ‘transcendental <I>jhana</I>’, which has been pressed into 
        service as a substitute for ‘<I>samatha jhana</I>’ to fulfill the path 
        factor of right <I>samadhi</I>. According to the <I>Theravada</I> 
        commentarial tradition, derived it seems from the <I>Patisambhidamagga</I>, 
        one of the latest books in the <I>Sutta</I> <I>Pitaka</I>, this is a 
        special kind of <B><I>jhana</I></B> which occurs only at the time of 
        penetrating to the noble paths and fruitions. This <I>samadhi</I> can 
        apparently occur with the same mental factors as any of the four <I>
        jhanas</I>, but is distinguished by taking <I>Nibbana</I> as its object 
        and by permanently eradicating, rather than merely suppressing, the 
        defilements appropriate to each path. The four paths are each conceived 
        as lasting one ‘mind moment’<A HREF="#_edn28" NAME="_ednref28" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[28]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        &#8209; another <I>Theravada</I> commentarial concept &#8209; occurring once only, 
        while the fruition can be re-entered by the noble ones after appropriate 
        preparation. This ‘path-moment’ is supposed to last less than a 
        billionth of the duration of a flash of lightning.<A HREF="#_edn29" NAME="_ednref29" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[29]</SPAN></SPAN></A></SPAN></P>

        none of these ideas finds support in the <I>suttas</I>. The <I>
        Mahacattarisaka</I> <I>Sutta</I> distinguishes between the 
        transcendental and non-transcendental path for the first five path 
        factors, but does not maintain that distinction for the factors of the
        <I>samadhi</I> aggregate.<A HREF="#_edn31" NAME="_ednref31" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[31]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        The divergence in presentation is not arbitrary. The express purpose of 
        the <I>sutta</I> is to show how all the path factors function to support
        <I>samadhi</I> for one developing the noble path. The first five factors 
        are accordingly given special definitions appropriate in the context of
        <I>samadhi</I>. In particular, right view and right intention are 
        defined by way of cognitive function rather than objective content. But 
        the final three factors in their normal formulation already pertain 
        directly to samadhi, so stand in no need of any special definition here. 
        In any case, the mere mention of the words ‘noble, poison-free, 
        transcendental, a factor of the path’ even if they were applied to <I>
        jhana</I> would hardly imply the details of the commentarial theory.<A HREF="#_edn32" NAME="_ednref32" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[32]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        The definition of the spiritual faculty of <I>samadhi</I> is also relied 
        on to support this thesis. In the section dealing with the spiritual 
        faculties I offer an alternative interpretation, reserving a technical 
        critique of the commentarial position to Appendix 1.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">On these insubstantial grounds 
        rests the entire elaborate edifice of the commentarial theory. One may 
        wonder why the Buddha, normally so precise in wording, would choose to 
        use such terms as ‘path’ and ‘person’ to describe a ‘mind-moment’. Such 
        ideas may have evolved from the recorded instances of apparently sudden 
        penetration to the <I>Dhamma</I>. It seems that the path is entered at 
        one time, developed gradually, and matures into the fruition at another 
        time, after a short or long interval.<A HREF="#_edn33" NAME="_ednref33" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[33]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        This is explained with such similes as chicks breaking out of their 
        shells after incubation, or the collapse of a ship’s rigging after 
        rotting away for a long time in the weather.<A HREF="#_edn34" NAME="_ednref34" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[34]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        We might note here that the word ‘path’ (<I>magga</I>), apart from a few 
        instances cited below, is hardly used in the <I>suttas</I> to denote 
        those developing the path; the synonym ‘way’ (<I>patipada</I>), defined 
        just as the noble eightfold path,<A HREF="#_edn35" NAME="_ednref35" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[35]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        is the usual term. Nor is the path normally divided into four as such; 
        the path is just the noble eightfold path, but those at different stages 
        practice for different immediate goals. This being so, the phrase ‘the 
        path to <I>arahantship’</I> that occurs below probably simply refers to 
        the eightfold path. Key <I>sutta</I> passages on the path are collected

        me? They are pointless, not pertaining to the fundamentals of the holy 
        life, not leading to repulsion, fading away, cessation, peace, direct 
        knowledge, enlightenment, Nibbana. Therefore they are undeclared by me. 
        And what is declared by me? This is suffering.... This is the origin of 
        suffering.... This is the cessation of suffering…. This is the way of 
        practice leading to the cessation of suffering. And what is that 
        declared by me? Because it has a point, it is pertaining to the
