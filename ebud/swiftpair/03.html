        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">These seven groups, totalling thirty-seven ‘wings 
        to enlightenment’, occur frequently in the <I>suttas</I>, were given 
        unique importance by the Buddha, and became a standard doctrinal 
        framework for all schools of Buddhism. As the most important and 
        comprehensive of these groups, we will discuss the noble eightfold path 
        first.</P>

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">In the Buddha’s first sermon, the <I>
        Dhammacakkappavattana</I> <I>Sutta</I>, he warned against pursuing two 
        extremes: devotion to sensuality and devotion to self-torment. He then 
        defined the famous ‘middle way’ of Buddhism which does not go anywhere 
        near the two extremes but leads to peace, direct knowledge, 
        enlightenment, <I>Nibbana</I>. This is precisely the noble eightfold 
        path: right view; right intention; right speech; right action; right 
        livelihood; right effort; right mindfulness; right <I>samadhi</I>. The 
        middleness of the middle way has nothing to do with compromise; it is 
        not the ‘mediocre’ way. It is rather the way that avoids seeking for a 
        solution to life’s problems in externals, in the pleasures and pains of 
        the body, but instead turns inwards to the peace of the mind.</P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I>‘Bhante, the Blessed One is not devoted to the 
        pursuit of pleasure in sensuality, which is low, vulgar, common, 
        ignoble, and pointless; nor is he devoted to self-torment, which is 
        painful, ignoble, and pointless. The Blessed One is one who gains the 
        four jhanas which constitute the higher mind, and are a blissful abiding 
        here and now at will, without trouble or difficulty</I>.’<A HREF="#_edn2" NAME="_ednref2" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[2]</SPAN></SPAN></A></P>

        initial and sustained application of mind, and rapture and bliss born of 
        seclusion. With the stilling of initial and sustained application of 
        mind, he enters and abides in the second jhana, where there is inner 
        clarity and unification, without initial and sustained application, but 
        with rapture and bliss born of samadhi. With the fading away of rapture 
        he abides in equanimity, mindful and clearly comprehending, personally 
        experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones say: “Equanimous and 
        mindful, one abides in bliss”, he enters and abides in the third jhana. 
        With the abandoning of bodily pleasure and pain, and the previous ending 
        of mental bliss and suffering, he enters and abides in the fourth jhana, 
        which is without pleasure and pain, but has mindfulness fully purified 
        by equanimity. This, monks, is right samadhi</I>.’<A HREF="#_edn6" NAME="_ednref6" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[6]</SPAN></SPAN></A></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">The first factor, right view, includes the 
        knowledge of the path itself. This, to start with, is wisdom in its 
        preliminary role of providing a theoretical understanding of the path as 
        a necessary prerequisite for setting out on the journey. A distorted 
        understanding of the path will surely act as an effective block to 
        successfully arriving at the destination. Indeed, there are many 
        meditators who, starting practice with wrong views, interpret their 
        meditation experiences so as to confirm and reinforce their 
        misconceptions.<A HREF="#_edn7" NAME="_ednref7" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[7]</SPAN></SPAN></A></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">But this intellectual understanding is not enough. 
        It must be accompanied by some feeling for the meaning of suffering, an 
        emotional response to the dilemmas of existence if it is to provide an 
        effective motivation for action. Hence, the second path factor is right 
        intention, the emotional counterpart of right view, which enables 
        understanding to mature into wisdom rather than lapse into cunning. 
        Endowed with these two, one can rightly undertake the virtues.</P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">Right practice of virtue also requires two 
        complementary qualities. Firstly, an understanding of what is right and 
        wrong together with skill in acting appropriately; secondly, a feeling 
        of compassion and fear of wrongdoing as motivation. These two qualities 
        will work together in meditation as <I>samatha</I> and <I>vipassana</I> 
        until they culminate in the universal compassion and transcendental 
        wisdom of the <I>arahant</I>.</P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">A key benefit of ethical conduct is that it ‘leads 
        to <I>samadhi</I>’.<A HREF="#_edn8" NAME="_ednref8" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[8]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        Of the basic moral precepts, those against killing and harsh speech 
        counter the hindrance of ill will, those against stealing and adultery 
        counter sensual desire, and those against lying and intoxicants counter 
        delusion. Diligence in executing ones duties and responsibilities<SPAN LANG="EN-US"> 
        &#8209; </SPAN>an important aspect of virtue<SPAN LANG="EN-US"> &#8209; </SPAN>
        combats sloth and torpor, while sense restraint and contentment further 
        reduce sensual desire. Each facet of virtue eliminates stress, conflict, 
        and suffering, giving rise to a quiet ease and confidence of heart. This 
        curbing of gross defilements lays the groundwork for the more subtle 
        task of <I>samadhi</I>. So it is that the Buddha declared that purity of 
        virtue and correct view are the ‘starting point of beneficial qualities’ 
        to be established before undertaking meditation.<A HREF="#_edn9" NAME="_ednref9" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[9]</SPAN></SPAN></A></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">The last three factors of the path constitute the 
        ‘aggregate of <I>samadhi</I>’. Right effort, the ‘requisite of <I>
        samadhi</I>’, eradicates the hindrance of sloth and torpor. The most 
        interesting of the four right efforts is the last. It points to the 
        importance of non-complacency with whatever good has been achieved. The 
        first task of the meditator who has reached a certain degree of calm is 
        not to rush ahead to insight, but to consolidate samadhi. It may also be 
        born in mind that ‘effort’ is not a synonym for ‘self-torture’.</P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I>‘A lazy person abides in suffering, overwhelmed 
        by evil, unbeneficial qualities, and destroys a great deal of their own 
        good. One with roused up energy abides in bliss, secluded from evil, 
        unbeneficial qualities, and fulfils a great deal of their own good. It 
        is not by the inferior that the topmost is attained; it is by the 
        topmost that the topmost is attained. This holy life, monks, is the 
        cream, and the Teacher is right in front of you</I> [Remembering that 
        the <I>Dhamma</I>-<I>vinaya</I> is to be the Teacher when the Buddha has 
        gone]<I>. Therefore you should rouse up energy for the attaining of the 
        unattained, for the achieving of the unachieved, for the witnessing of 
        the unwitnessed</I>.’<A HREF="#_edn10" NAME="_ednref10" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[10]</SPAN></SPAN></A></P>

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B>RIGHT MINDFULNESS</B></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">Right mindfulness, the ‘basis of <I>samadhi</I>’<A HREF="#_edn11" NAME="_ednref11" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[11]</SPAN></SPAN></A>, 
        is the gatekeeper who lets both <I>samatha</I> and <I>vipassana</I> 
        enter with their message in accordance with reality. Here, <I>nimitta</I>, 
        rendered as ‘basis’, may also mean ‘sign’, since <I>samadhi</I> is 
        certainly characterized by unobstructed mindfulness; but the intended 
        contextual meaning seems to be that <I>satipatthana</I> is a crucial 
        support for <I>samadhi</I>. We can further conclude that since 
        pre-Buddhist yogis practiced <I>samadhi</I>, they must also have 
        practiced mindfulness. In keeping with the theme of this essay, of the 
        mutual harmony between all aspects of the path, it may be worth looking 
        more closely at the relationship between mindfulness and <I>samadhi</I>.</P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">Mindfulness may be characterized as the quality of 
        mind which recollects and focuses awareness within an appropriate frame 
        of reference, bearing in mind the what, why, and how of the task at 
        hand. Mindfulness as a mental quality plays a crucial role in 
        recollecting the teachings and applying them to the present moment, thus 
        supporting right view. By reminding one of what is right and wrong, it 
        supports the sense of conscience which is vital for virtue. <I>
        Satipatthana</I>, the ‘establishing’s of mindfulness’, refers to a 
        specific and detailed set of contemplative exercises in which 
        mindfulness plays a prominent role. The ‘development of <I>satipatthana’</I> 
        refers to the advanced employment of the basic exercises for the 
        contemplation of impermanence. The ‘way of practice leading to the 
        development of <I>satipatthana</I>’ is the noble eightfold path.<A HREF="#_edn12" NAME="_ednref12" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[12]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        In this analysis, ‘<I>satipatthana</I>’ seems to have the function of 
        supporting <I>samadhi</I>, the ‘development of <I>satipatthana</I>’ that 
        of supporting insight, while both of these in the overall context of the 
        path lead to liberation. The idiom ‘a body in the body’ is elucidated 
        as: ‘the in-and-out breaths are a certain body [among the bodies].<A HREF="#_edn13" NAME="_ednref13" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[13]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        It therefore implies focussing on a specific aspect of the overall 
        framework. The explanation that the phrase means ‘contemplating the body 
        as a body (and not as a self or soul)’ does not quite ring true since 
        the phrase pertains as much to <I>samadhi</I> as to insight.</P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><I>Satipatthana</I> and the Hindrances</B></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">Each of the contemplations in satipatthana is 
        qualified by a set of four terms. The first term, ‘ardent’ refers to 
        energy; the second, ‘clearly comprehending’ to understanding; the third 
        is mindfulness itself. The fourth term indicates the abandoning of 
        desire and aversion, which are the chief of the five hindrances.<A HREF="#_edn14" NAME="_ednref14" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[14]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        The phrase is not further defined here, but the following verses may be 
        relevant. Bearing in mind that sequence in such verses is often quite 
        loose, we may note that these verses follow teachings chiefly on virtue, 
        including sense restraint, but <I>jhana</I> and <I>samadhi</I> have also 
        been mentioned.</P>

        through sense restraint, etc., prepares the mind for mindfulness 
        practice, which is the foundation for the complete eradication of 
        hindrances by right <I>samadhi</I>.</P>

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">Body contemplation then continues with development 
        of awareness of the body postures, parts of the body, elements, and 
        corpses. One who develops the contemplation on parts of the body and 
        corpses is said to ‘not neglect <I>jhana</I>’.<A HREF="#_edn29" NAME="_ednref29" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[29]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        Contemplation of body postures throughout daily activities seems 
        insufficient to induce <I>jhana</I>; but as the words ‘again and beyond’ 
        at the start of each section of the <I>Satipatthana</I>. <I>Sutta</I> 
        indicate, each exercise contributes a part of the overall meditative 
        development. Continuity of mindfulness through the day is crucial to 
        both <I>samatha</I> and <I>vipassana</I>. Of each of these 
        contemplations it is said:</P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I>‘As he abides thus diligent, ardent, and 
        resolute, his memories and intentions based on the household life are 
        abandoned. With their abandoning, his mind becomes steadied within 
        himself, settled, unified, and concentrated in samadhi. That is how a 
        monk develops mindfulness of the body</I>.’<A HREF="#_edn30" NAME="_ednref30" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[30]</SPAN></SPAN></A></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">The basic purpose of these final three 
        contemplations is to rise above sensuality. If one believes that 
        sensuality is an intrinsic quality of human nature, this objective will 
        seem perverse, an unnatural repression leading inevitably to neurosis. 
        Lust can indeed lead to neurosis if it is unacknowledged and denied. But 
        seeing sensual desire, not as a permanent property, but as a conditioned 
        phenomenon, one is free to investigate its effect on the happiness of 
        the mind. Sensual lust is fuelled by the perception of the 
        attractiveness of the body. By going against the stream of habit, 
        focussing attention on the unattractive aspect of the body, sensual lust 
        can be seen in sharp relief. It is in no way repressed; but deprived of 
        its fuel it simply ceases to operate, and the bliss beyond sensuality 
        can be experienced. Then one knows that the real repression, the real 
        perversion, the real neurosis is the addiction to sensual gratification, 
        locked in place by denying the futility of sense pleasures. But these 
        contemplations do not only bestow the emotional maturity, dignity, and 
        independence that come with freedom from addiction. Being based on 
        inquiry into reality, they also serve to deepen wisdom. The most 
        suggestive description of the contemplation of the parts of the body 
        treats this as a stepping-stone to understanding the consciousness that 
        does not die with the body.</P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I>‘There are, Bhante, these four attainments of 
        vision. Here, a certain contemplative or brahman by means of ardour, 
        striving, devotion, heedfulness, and right attention contacts such a 
        form of heart-samadhi that when his mind is in samadhi he reviews this 
        very body, up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the 
        hair, surrounded by skin and full of many kinds of impurities thus: “In 
        this body there are head hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, 
        sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, 
        lungs, large intestines, small intestines, contents of the stomach, 
        faeces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, spittle,

        in both places ‘heart-<I>samadhi’</I> definitely means <I>Jhana</I>. The 
        third attainment is the realization of the passing on of consciousness 
        according to dependent origination, and may therefore pertain to 
        stream-entry. The fourth attainment concerns the <I>arahant</I>. In the 
        following passage, the contemplation of the four elements forms a part 
        of the practice directed towards the ‘imperturbable’.</P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I>‘Again, monks, a noble disciple reflects thus: 
        “There are sensual pleasures here and now and sensual pleasures in lives 
        to come. Whatever physical form there is, is the four great elements and 
        physical form derived from the four great elements.” Practicing in this 
        way and frequently abiding thus, his mind becomes clear about this base. 
        When there is full clarity he attains to the imperturbable now or he 
        decides upon understanding. With the breaking up of the body, after 
        death, it is possible that his on-flowing consciousness will pass on to 
        the imperturbable</I>.’<A HREF="#_edn33" NAME="_ednref33" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[33]</SPAN></SPAN></A></P>

        receives the information conveyed through the senses, supplemented and

        at the crossroads’ it is the core of experience; but like any ruler it 
        can maintain its position only with the help of its auxiliaries. The 
        quality of the information received is the critical determinant of the 
        quality of awareness. Also like any ruler, it often seems that the

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Despite the best attempts of the 
        commentarial theorists, this statement remains incompatible with any 
        explanation of impermanence in terms of momentariness. An ‘ultimate’ 
        unit of time is a conditioned phenomenon. It therefore begins, changes 
        in the middle, and ends. But the ‘sub-moments’ are also conditioned, so 
        they too must have a beginning, middle, and end, and so on ad infinitum. 
        Moreover, if the beginning has a beginning, middle, and end; and the 
        middle and the end also have a beginning, middle, and end, the 
        distinction between these events is not evident &#8209; the theory lacks 
        explanatory power.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Similar considerations apply not 
        only in the ‘horizontal’ dimension of impermanence, but in the 
        ‘vertical’ dimension of not-self as well. According to the commentaries, 
        the so-called ‘person’ can be fully analyzed at the ultimate level into 
        a finite set of mental and physical constituents called ‘<I>dhammas’</I>, 
        with no further analysis possible. This is compared with breaking a 
        vehicle down into its parts. But this example reveals the flaw in 
        attempting to pin down ontological primacy to any particular level of 
        reality. The vehicle considered in one way is a whole, but considered in 
        another way is a part of a greater whole – ‘traffic’, for example. And 
        the parts of the vehicle considered in one way are parts, but considered 
        in another way are wholes &#8209; a whole wheel, for example &#8209; made up of 
        their constituents. Any mental or physical event – ‘<I>dhamma’</I> &#8209; is 
        a conditioned (‘compounded’) phenomenon. It can therefore be analyzed 
        into its constituents. But the constituents, too, are conditioned and 
        therefore analyzable &#8209; again we disappear into infinity. Just as any 
        ‘ultimate’ moment of time turns out to be a complex, evolving process, 
        any ‘ultimate’ constituent of being turns out to be a complex, 
        conditioned conglomerate.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Impermanence and not-self no 
        more imply ultimate units of time or being than conditionality implies 
        an ultimate first cause. No such theories are found in or derivable from 
        the <I>suttas</I>. ‘<I>Dhamma’</I> as used in the suttas does not refer 
        to discrete entities existing in their own right, but to aspects of 
        lived experience. The trend towards treating ‘<I>dhammas’</I> in terms 
        of an immutable, definitive set of highly specialized doctrinal 
        categories may have had the effect of ‘objectifying’ the domain of 
        insight, distracting attention from the essence of awareness. Venerable
        <I>Nanamoli</I>, the translator of the <I>Visuddhimagga</I>, once 
        commented that by reversing the invariable sutta presentation of the 
        five aggregates, the <I>Visuddhimagga</I> when describing consciousness 
        in fact mostly deals with the other aggregates. This trend might be 
        interpreted as the theoretical counterpart of the diminution of the role 
        of the pure consciousness of <I>samadhi</I> in the development of

        far, fast flowing, sweeping all before it, never pausing for a moment, a 
        second, an instant, but ever going on, rolling on, surging on.... Just 
        as a man might form a gob of spit on the tip of his tongue and spit it

        They support consciousness (<I>vinnana</I>, here equivalent to ‘mind’,
        <I>citta</I>) in a number of ways. Physical form directly supports 
        consciousness as the external objects of the senses, as well as in the

        mind-consciousness, retain certain physical qualities, such as color and 
        shape. In addition, physical form makes up the body, which provides a 
        roost for consciousness. The components of mentality can support 
        consciousness directly as object, or indirectly by performing essential 
        cognitive functions. These factors weld the diverse elements of 
        experience into the elaborate superstructures of language and concepts, 
        an aspect prominent in the <I>Pali</I> word for mentality &#8209; <I>nama</I>,

        so is not a blanket term for the four mental aggregates. All this is 
        external, or objective, to consciousness, defining, determining, and 
        delimiting subjective experience. This interdependent dualism forms the

        forgetting that all those fancyings, imaginings, and schemings are 
        nothing more than the projections of her own delusion. She is like 
        beautiful, pitiful Narcissus, stung by Cupid’s arrow and hopelessly 
        enchanted by his own image in the water that, when he bends to embrace 
        it, vanishes into ripples. The concept of self in turn services his 
        mother like a loving son, fertilizing the mind’s seeds to ensure an 
        abundant crop of suffering in times to come. It is this idea of self 
        which sticks a label saying ‘I, me, mine’ on the diverse items of 
        baggage in experience, which one then feels obliged to claim and lug 
        around. Moment to moment, year to year, life to life, the baggage 
        changes but the message on the labels stays the same. Thus the

        independently, in and of themselves. ‘Non-existence’ does not seem to

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">These theories, far from being 
        abstruse abstractions of the intellectual dilettantes, are right at home 
        here in the world of beings. In Buddhism, the ‘world’, or the ‘all’, 
        also means ‘that in the world by which one is a perceiver and conceiver 
        of the world’,<A HREF="#_edn82" NAME="_ednref82" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[82]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        that is, the six internal sense bases. These internal sense bases only 
        operate when stimulated by the six kinds of external sense objects, with 
        mind objects as sixth. The world of experience therefore depends on the 
        duality of inner and outer.<A HREF="#_edn83" NAME="_ednref83" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[83]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        The inner world is the nucleus around which orbits the outside world as 
        reported by the external sense objects. So most beings conceive 
        themselves at the center of the world. While relying on six-sense 
        experience it is impossible to go beyond the world; wherever we go we 
        take our world with us.<A HREF="#_edn84" NAME="_ednref84" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[84]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        Further: how we relate to or conceive the world of phenomenological 
        experience is tangled up with how we conceive ourselves. If the 
        phenomena of experience exist in their own right, not relying on 
        conditions, and hence not subject to cessation with the cessation of 
        conditions, our own self, the hub of the world, must likewise exist 
        externally. But if the phenomena of experience just vanish leaving no 
        trace, our self too must be cut off and annihilated. At this point 
        philosophical musings assume a stark urgency. The fear of death &#8209; the 
        basic motivation for spiritual practice &#8209; arises from the conception of 
        a self (i.e. grasping, <I>upadana</I>) existing in time (i.e. existence,
        <I>bhava</I>). It depends on the ability to infer beyond the immediate 
        sphere of experience, to imagine that one may or may not be able to have 
        more of this pleasure &#8209; or more of this pain &#8209; in the future. The views 
        of eternalism and annihilationism thus interpret lived experience in 
        relation to the destiny of the individual. The eternalist longs for 
        birth without death, an unnatural impossibility, while the 
        annihilationist, intent on gratification here and now, has destroyed any 
        possibility of transcendence through spiritual practice.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">We may postulate an approximate 
        correlation between the two dualities, that of existence and 
        non-existence, and that of inner and outer. One who emphasizes the inner 
        world, a ‘spiritual’ or ‘religious’ person, an ‘introvert’, is likely to 
        hold an eternalist view, such as of an eternally existing soul. One who 
        emphasizes the outer world, an ‘objective’ or ‘scientific’ person, an 
        ‘extrovert’, is likely to lean towards such opinions as that the mind is 
        merely an emergent property of matter or behavior and will disappear at 
        death. But since these views only allow part of experience, they fail to 
        account for the manifoldness of the world. The theory of a creator God, 
        for example, is notoriously unable to explain the fact of suffering. Any 
        such eternalist view encounters similar dilemmas. Placing the highest 
        spiritual good, conceived as god, soul, mind, or whatever, in any kind 
        of relation with anything in the world soils what should be free of 
        suffering with what must be bound up with suffering. Falling back on 
        non-existence solves nothing. The social and environmental devastation 
        accompanying the growth of a sophisticated technological science with 
        little ethical or spiritual dimension is a cogent reminder that external 
        development fails to meaningfully address the problem of suffering. Such 
        inadequacies generate tension between theory and reality, undermining 
        the solace afforded by these views.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Interestingly, the <I>sutta</I> 
        does not say that the world usually depends on one or other of the 
        extremes, but on the dualism of both. This suggests that the fact of 
        dualism itself, inherent in the structure of experience, is even more 
        fundamental than its expression as particular views. Dualism implies a 
        division, a marking-off, a boundary. Language delineates this boundary, 
        making a measurement. ‘This’ implies ‘not that’; ‘now’ implies ‘not 
        then; I implies ‘not you’. This dualistic paradigm, embedded in the 
        building blocks of language, is reflected in successively more 
        sophisticated linguistic structures, finally emerging as full-blown 
        conceptual theorems. The views tend to be framed in terms of one or 
        other of the extremes; but it is difficult to deny one necessary half of 
        experience. One of the blessings of stream-entry is the relief from such 
        tensions, as one’s whole psychic structure is attuned to one coherent 
        worldview. This occurs when the duality of the inner and outer sense 
        bases is seen as neither existing intrinsically nor vanishing without 
        trace but as coming to be dependent on conditions.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">'All these contemplatives and 
        brahmans who hold settled views about the past and the future, and

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The various views about the 
        world do not arise all at once as full-blown theories, but emerge 
        gradually. The initial encounter with the world seems innocuous enough, 
        but the gratification sets up a desire, then an expectation, then a 
        demand, and finally an unquestioned and absolute identification of a 
        ‘self’ with that experience. But it is right at that point that the most 
        radical tenet of the Dhamma turns the world on its head. That very 
        ‘self’ in which one invests such hopes, from which one derives such 
        solace, is nothing but suffering through and through. But suffering is 
        itself a conditioned phenomenon, so it too must pass away. The 
        contemplation of impermanence, by examining the world from the inside, 
        building up a view from experience rather than imposing it from 
        preconceptions, rejects all simplistic abstractions. It has nothing to 
        fear from any kind of experience.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The origin of the world is the 
        origin of suffering, which is ‘that craving which generates repeated 
        existence’. Understanding this, one could never commit the fallacy of 
        annihilationism. The cessation of the world is the cessation of 
        suffering, which is the realization of <I>Nibbana</I> as the ending of 
        craving. Understanding this, one could never commit the fallacy of 
        eternalism.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The contemplation of 
        impermanence by way of dependent origination not only avoids the 
        extremes of theory, but also the extremes of practice. By placing the 
        conditioned, fickle, yet tamable mind at the center of the world, 
        dependent origination avoids the complacency of indulgence and the 
        despair of self-torment. The twofold extremes of ‘existingness’ and 
        ‘non-existingness’ call for a twofold meditative response: <I>samatha</I> 
        and <I>vipassana</I>. <I>Samatha</I> is a joyous plunge into the inner 
        waters of the mind, and together with the dissolution of the five 
        external senses dissolves the cynical reductionism which insists that 
        only externals are real. <I>Vipassana</I> in its turn discloses the 
        radical discontinuity of consciousness, dispelling the smugly naive 
        belief in an eternal soul. Since it is only suffering that ceases, the 
        gradual stilling of activities is experienced as exquisite bliss by the 
        meditator. One can at last be truly independent, as one experiences for 
        oneself the fading away of suffering. Faith in this process of peace 
        enables the meditator to loosen, then untie the shackles binding the 
        mind to the world, free of the fear that there could be any kind of 
        existing ‘self’ to be destroyed. This is the right view of the 
        stream-enterer.</SPAN></P>

        knowing. This implies that it is the understanding of the mind itself, 
        the faculty of knowing, which is the crucial element in the delicate 
        process of disentanglement. Mind consciousness is the resort of the five 
        senses, the functional center coordinating experience, and the 
        subjective sense of individual identity linking life to life. While <I>

        only, without the diversity of sense consciousness; and this 
        mind-consciousness knows just one thing. ‘Point’ (or ‘acme’) has

        includes sensual desire, so ‘secluded from sensual pleasures’ should 
        refer to, or at least include, the sense objects. The <I>suttas</I>

        they arise they signify that one has fallen away from first <I>jhana</I>. 
        The following passage bears on this question.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">And then Venerable Maha

        to Venerable Maha Moggallana’s brief but troubled period of striving for

        required.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The four <I>jhanas</I> may be 
        regarded as the ultimate manifestation of the psychology of bliss. The 
        first jhana occurs with the ending of the five external senses and the 
        five hindrances. Relieved of these burdens, the mind is buoyant and at 
        ease, solely preoccupied with one object, the subtle reflection of the 
        mind derived from the basic meditation subject. Because of the nearness 
        of sense activity and defilement, however, the mind must still actively 
        apply itself to that object, first placing then pressing. This pressing 
        causes the object to recede slightly, so the mind must be re-placed, and 
        so on in an automatic process which causes a slight ripple or wavering 
        in awareness. As the mind gains more inner confidence it no longer needs 
        to apply itself, but can simply be at one with the object. The pulsing 
        effect fades away, leaving the clear stillness characteristic of the 
        second <I>jhana</I>. The third <I>jhana</I> is marked by a maturing of 
        the emotional response to blissful feeling. The refined thrill of 
        rapture deepens into the impartial watchfulness of equanimity. 
        Mindfulness and clear comprehension, though like equanimity present from 
        the first <I>jhana</I>, come to the fore as one is fully immersed in 
        bliss without being elated by it. But even that purified bliss exerts 
        the softest of pulls and must be let go as the mind settles down into 
        the fourth <I>jhana</I> &#8209; pure bright awareness. Equanimity is now 
        present as both affective tone and emotional attitude, allowing 
        mindfulness to reach its maximum clarity and power.</SPAN></P>

        as doubt or sensual desire, according to the stage of progress. 
        Furthermore, at the actual time of developing <I>samadhi</I>, the 
        previously developed right view manifests as a clear awareness of what 
        is beneficial and what is unbeneficial, as well as an understanding of 
        the causal relationships between mental factors leading to peace of 
        mind. The path factor of right intention manifests as undistracted 
        application to the meditation object, while the previously purified

        as noble right <I>samadhi</I> itself are similar in their basic

        path. However, due to the exceptional purity of the factors instrumental 
        in their attaining, they are singularly pellucid and tranquil, yielding 
        an intuitive flowering of wisdom. Upon emerging mindfully, the noble one 
        will review the <I>jhana</I> with wisdom. They will see that the bliss 
        in that <I>jhana</I> arose from letting go, and that continuing that

        motivation to do the work of purifying the mind. Effort is the actual 
        exerting of energy to do the work. The purified mind is the result of 
        that work. And in the clarity of the purified mind, the causes and 
        conditions for that purity can be discerned through inquiry. The manner 
        in which these qualities work together may be compared to an electric 
        light. Enthusiasm is like the voltage in the circuits. Energy is like 
        the current of electricity which flows when the switch is turned on. The 
        mind is like the globe lighting up. And when the room is lit, it is easy

        perfect virtue), energy in the four right efforts, mindfulness in the

        The description of understanding in the above passage may be seen as an 
        expansion of the usual definition as ‘the noble and penetrative 
        understanding of arising and ending which leads to the complete 
        evaporation of suffering’<A HREF="#_edn103" NAME="_ednref103" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[103]</SPAN></SPAN></A>. 
        The phrase ‘having made relinquishment the support, one gains <I>

        The spiritual powers are defined similarly, the sole difference being 
        the absence of the phrase ‘having made relinquishment the support.’<A HREF="#_edn105" NAME="_ednref105" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[105]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        Since the spiritual faculties and powers are identical, it may be 
        inferred that that phrase does not add anything crucial to the 
        definition, or justify extending the scope of the spiritual faculty of 
        samadhi beyond the four <I>jhanas</I>. Each of the spiritual faculties 
        and powers are further described as being developed together with each 
        of the four <I>jhanas</I>.<A HREF="#_edn106" NAME="_ednref106" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[106]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        One practicing in this way, even for the duration of a finger snap, 
        ‘does the Teacher's bidding, responds to instruction, and does not waste 
        the nation’s alms food.’</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Strikingly, the texts set the 
        spiritual faculties apart from the other sets comprised within the wings 
        to awakening by treating them under all four of the noble truths, not 
        just the fourth.<A HREF="#_edn107" NAME="_ednref107" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[107]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        This treatment foreshadows the terminological development, already 
        nascent in the <I>suttas</I>, of ‘faculty’ as a general phenomenological 
        classification parallel to the aggregates, sense bases, and elements. 
        The spiritual faculties themselves are conditioned; considered in this 
        way it becomes meaningful to speak of the ‘origin, ending, 
        gratification, danger, and escape’ in the case of mindfulness, <I>
        samadhi</I>, understanding, etc. ‘Origin and ending’ refers to the 
        conditioned nature of the spiritual faculties, to be understood by way 
        of dependent origination. This is the task of the spiritual faculty of 
        understanding itself, defined precisely as understanding rise and fall. 
        So to possess the faculties, one must understand the faculties; and to 
        understand the faculties, one must understand dependent origination. The 
        faculties should be seen as arising dependent on each other, and this 
        interdependence serves as a paradigm for understanding phenomenal 
        actuality in general. This ‘understanding in accordance with reality’ is 
        repeatedly identified with the stream-enterer.<A HREF="#_edn108" NAME="_ednref108" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[108]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        Hence, although as mental qualities they are to be developed by the 
        ordinary person, only with the entrance to the noble path do they gain 
        control, becoming the predominating dispositions in their own field, 
        thus meriting the title ‘spiritual faculties’. (Although the term 
        ‘spiritual faculties’ may be used in a more general sense, this is not 
        identified with the group of five.<A HREF="#_edn109" NAME="_ednref109" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[109]</SPAN></SPAN></A>) 
        Not only does the presence or absence of the spiritual faculties serve 
        to distinguish between the ordinary person and the noble ones, the 
        relative strength of the faculties is a key criterion for classifying 
        the noble ones in terms of spiritual potential, level of attainment, and 
        mode of practice.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The phrase ‘having made 
        relinquishment the support’ is probably best explained in the light of 
        such passages as the following, describing how the noble ones meditate. 
        In this passage, ‘taints of the mind’ does not refer, as elsewhere, to 
        the five hindrances, but to the manifestations of greed, anger, and 
        delusion abandoned by the stages of the noble path.</SPAN></P>

        “He gains inspiration in the meaning, inspiration in the Dhamma, 
        gladness connected with the Dhamma. In one who is glad, rapture is born. 
        In one whose mind is rapturous, the body becomes tranquil. One with 
        tranquil body feels bliss. The mind of one who is blissful enters 
        samadhi.”</I> ’<A HREF="#_edn110" NAME="_ednref110" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[110]</SPAN></SPAN></A></SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">‘Confirmed confidence’ is the 
        clarity from having undergone the experience of forever relinquishing 
        defilements, thereby walking in the Buddha's footsteps, seeing the <I>
        Dhamma</I>, and becoming one of the noble <I>Sangha</I>. Here, the 
        spiritual faculty of faith is predominant in the meditation subject; 
        energy is implied in the undertaking of meditation; while mindfulness is 
        the act of recollecting. <I>Samadhi</I> here is obviously ‘noble right
        <I>samadhi’</I>, equivalent to the spiritual faculty of <I>samadhi</I>. 
        The word for ‘relinquishment’ (<I>patinissagga</I>) is a slightly 
        different form than in the spiritual faculty of samadhi (<I>vossagga)</I>, 
        but the meaning here seems substantially identical. We may understand 
        that the unique occurrence of the phrase ‘having made relinquishment the 
        support’ before the <I>jhana</I> formula in the definition of the 
        spiritual faculty of <I>samadhi</I> is linked to the restriction of the 
        spiritual faculties to the noble individuals. Only they have their 
        course of meditation smoothed by the root-level eradication of 
        defilements. In the above <I>sutta</I>, the monk next develops the 
        divine abidings, and then wisdom is indicated:</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">‘He understands thus: “There 
        is this, there is the inferior, there is the superior, and beyond there 
        is an escape from this whole field of perception.” ’</SPAN></I></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The phrase ‘field of perception’ 
        invites comparison with such passages as the <I>Potthapada</I> <I>Sutta</I>.<A HREF="#_edn111" NAME="_ednref111" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[111]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        This would then refer to the divine abidings; ‘the inferior’ to the 
        sensual realm; ‘the superior’ to the formless liberations; while ‘the 
        escape’ is <I>Nibbana</I>. So the spiritual faculties, relying on the 
        partial relinquishment of defilements by the trainees, mature into the 
        total relinquishment of defilements by the <I>arahant</I>.</SPAN></P>

        regarded as an articulation of the meditative component of the path 
        complementary to the bases for psychic powers and the spiritual

        of <I>dhammas</I>, though including the recollection and investigation 
        of teachings, primarily refer to the discriminative contemplation of 
        presently arisen mental phenomena. ‘Energy’ and ‘tranquility’ include 
        both physical and mental aspects. ‘Rapture’ and ‘<I>samadhi’</I> occur 
        either with initial and sustained application of mind (in the first <I>
        jhana</I>) or without (in the higher <I>jhanas</I>). ‘Equanimity’ is the

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">An outstanding feature is the 
        opposition between the enlightenment factors and the five hindrances. 
        This is presented both as a general qualitative appraisal of the two 
        sets as leading to or obstructing enlightenment, and as a specific 
        analysis, especially in terms of the distinctive ‘nutriment’ for each 
        factor. The gradual assimilation of the nutriments through repeated 
        attention nurtures the growth of either good or bad qualities. Sometimes 
        a specific enlightenment factor opposes a specific hindrance. The 
        nutriment for ‘investigation of <I>dhammas’</I> &#8209; discriminating between 
        good and bad &#8209; is what starves the hindrance of doubt. The nutriments of 
        energy &#8209; the elements of arousal, of exertion, of persistence &#8209; starve 
        the hindrance of sloth and torpor. Tranquility opposes restlessness and 
        remorse. <I>Samadhi</I> is nurtured by ‘the basis of <I>samatha</I>, the 
        basis of not-many-pointedness’.<A HREF="#_edn114" NAME="_ednref114" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[114]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        The <I>suttas</I> do not directly oppose <I>samadhi</I> and rapture to 
        particular hindrances, but elsewhere the commentaries set them against 
        sensual desire and ill will respectively. Equanimity, along with 
        tranquility and <I>samadhi</I>, serves to pacify the excited mind, 
        whereas investigation, energy, and rapture rouse up the sluggish mind. 
        Mindfulness is always useful. Mindfulness, rapture, and equanimity are 
        not allocated specific nutriments; perhaps the Buddha is throwing us 
        back on our own ‘investigation of <I>dhammas’</I> to discern these.</SPAN></P>

          A1:20. Although I refer to this chapter a few times, it is a highly 
          schematic passage, probably assembled quite late, and in part 
          incongruous. For example, one who develops right speech is said to 
          ‘not neglect <I>jhana’</I>, which does not make much sense even if we 
          interpret <I>jhana</I> here as broadly as ‘meditation’.</DIV>

          This grouping occurs several times in the <I>suttas</I>, usually 
          glossed by the commentary as ‘<I>dhammas</I> pertaining to <I>samadhi’</I>, 
          but as far as I know only explained in the <I>suttas</I> at Iti 3.97 
          as ‘the seven <I>dhammas</I> that are wings to enlightenment’. Which 
          is often translated as ‘the seven sets of <I>dhammas</I> that are 
          wings to enlightenment’. Now it is well known that the thirty-seven 
          are not called ‘wings of enlightenment’ in the <I>suttas</I>. The term 
          is used of the spiritual faculties however, and as there are many 
          descriptive terms common to both the spiritual faculties and the 
          enlightenment factors, I feel it would be easier for an epithet to 
          transfer from one set to another than from one set to the whole group 
          of sets. Moreover, ‘<I>dhamma’</I> is more idiomatically used of the 
          members of the set rather than the set as a whole.</DIV>
