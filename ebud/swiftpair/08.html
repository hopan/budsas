        COUNTER-EXAMPLES</SPAN></B></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Having completed our survey, we 
        now turn to a discussion of some of the <I>sutta</I> passages that have 
        been taken to indicate that <I>jhanas</I> are not necessary for 
        liberation. We have seen that the <I>suttas</I> explain the path clearly 
        and explicitly, approaching the subject from different angles, but 
        always including <I>jhana</I> as an intrinsic element. If we are to 
        discover a <I>jhana</I>-less path we should expect a similar approach. 
        The principle of proportion and the principle of historical perspective, 
        which I proposed in the first chapter, now come to the fore. Minor 
        teachings should be seen in context. Background stories should be 
        carefully examined for authenticity. We should ask: ‘Is the Buddha here 
        altering the eightfold path, or describing a different path? Or is he 
        clarifying details, emphasizing particular aspects or modes of 
        practicing the eightfold path?’ As far as I can see, there are two 
        possible outcomes of this discussion. Either the counter-examples do 
        not, in fact, imply that <I>jhanas</I> are unnecessary, or there appears 
        to be a contradiction in the teachings. Obviously the first alternative 
        is preferable, so we will see if these passages can be interpreted in 
        line with the core teachings. Normally this is straightforward. If, 
        however, the interpretations we provide &#8209; some of which must remain 
        tentative in the absence of definitive statements in the passages 
        themselves, itself an indication of their secondary status &#8209; are not 
        felt to be acceptable in some cases, this should not be taken as 
        negating the authoritative <I>sutta</I> passages in the previous 
        chapters.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The <I>Susima</I> <I>Sutta</I> 
        has been regularly relied on to substantiate the claim that an arahant 
        need not possess jhana. According to the <I>Pali</I> version of the <I>
        sutta</I>, the wanderer Susima fraudulently entered the <I>Sangha</I> 
        desiring wealth and fame. He questioned a number of monks who had 
        declared <I>arahantship</I>, and they denied possessing psychic powers 
        or formless attainments. This is quite in line with the general position 
        of the <I>suttas</I>. <I>Jhana</I> is not mentioned. Their declaration 
        of <I>arahantship</I> included the phrase: ‘The holy life has been 
        lived’. This means they have fully developed the noble eightfold path. 
        They say they are ‘released by understanding’; we have seen above that 
        such an attainment regularly includes <I>jhana</I>, although, as here, 
        it may not include the formless attainments, which are extra and beyond 
        the four <I>jhanas</I>. Venerable Susima is obviously puzzled by the 
        monks’ statements, and goes to the Buddha. The Buddha does not 
        explicitly endorse the monks’ claims to <I>arahantship</I>,<A HREF="#_edn1" NAME="_ednref1" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[1]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        but explains the situation thus:</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">‘First there is the knowledge 
        of the regularity of natural principles; afterwards there is the 
        knowledge of Nibbana</SPAN></I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">.’<A HREF="#_edn2" NAME="_ednref2" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[2]</SPAN></SPAN></A></SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">This statement re-emphasizes the 
        importance of causality and the regular sequence of knowledge. Without 
        an understanding of the causal principles underlying suffering and the 
        causal principles of the practice to break free from suffering, it is 
        impossible to realize <I>Nibbana</I>. The Buddha then teaches Venerable 
        Susima a passage from the <I>Anattalakkhana</I> <I>Sutta</I> culminating 
        in the release of arahantship.<A HREF="#_edn3" NAME="_ednref3" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[3]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        This release is described in the <I>Anattalakkhana</I> <I>Sutta</I> as 
        ‘release of mind’. We saw above that this ‘mind’ (or ‘heart’) release is 
        due to the fading away of lust; and the fading away of lust is due to 
        the development of the mind through <I>samatha</I>.<A HREF="#_edn4" NAME="_ednref4" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[4]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        The Buddha goes on to teach dependent origination. Venerable Susima says 
        that he understands those teachings, and filled with remorse, confesses 
        his transgression to the Buddha.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Interestingly, in the Chinese 
        version of this text, though the basic doctrinal teaching of dependent 
        origination is similar and so original, the background story is quite 
        different. There, Venerable Susima, having fraudulently entered the <I>
        Sangha</I>, nevertheless quickly picked up enough doctrinal knowledge to 
        expose by cross-examining some monks who had falsely boasted of being 
        enlightened (one of the most serious <I>vinaya</I> offences). As this 
        text shows the monks in a very bad light it is unlikely to have been 
        forged. While the faults of monks are of necessity on display throughout 
        the <I>Vinaya</I> <I>Pitaka</I>, the suttas almost always focus on the 
        positive. We may surmise that the background story in the <I>Pali</I> 
        version was rewritten to whitewash faults in the <I>Sangha</I>. This 
        must have occurred when the <I>Pali</I> canon of the <I>Theravada</I> 
        school had already become separated from the version later preserved in 
        Chinese. This separation occurred no earlier than the Third Council, 
        over a century after the Buddha’s passing away.<A HREF="#_edn5" NAME="_ednref5" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[5]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        Perhaps the de-emphasis on <I>samadhi</I> in the <I>Pali</I> version of 
        the story, though not actually contradicting the original teachings, 
        marks an early stage in the development of the concept of ‘dry insight’ 
        without <I>jhana</I>.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">In several places the Buddha 
        talks about two ‘ways of practice’, which may be taken to indicate the 
        distinction between separate meditative paths on the basis of whether or 
        not they include <I>jhana</I>. The ‘painful way of practice’ consists of 
        the perceptions of the ugliness of the body, the repulsiveness of food, 
        boredom with the whole world, death, and the impermanence of all 
        activities. This ‘painful way of practice’ is contrasted (unfavorably) 
        with the ‘pleasant way of practice , which consists of <I>jhana</I>.’<A HREF="#_edn6" NAME="_ednref6" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[6]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        We may note that the painful mode is never identified with <I>vipassana</I>; 
        the basic purpose of most of these contemplations is to eradicate 
        sensual lust, which is an aspect of <I>samatha</I>. Nor has it anything 
        to do with contemplation of painful feelings. Moreover, the distinction 
        between these ways of practice was clearly not meant as a hard and fast 
        division. Venerable Sariputta's practice was of the pleasant mode, yet 
        he had also perfected body contemplation.<A HREF="#_edn7" NAME="_ednref7" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[7]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        Venerable Moggallana’s practice was of the painful mode, yet he 
        possessed mastery in all levels of <I>samadhi</I>.<A HREF="#_edn8" NAME="_ednref8" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[8]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        The distinction is merely a matter of emphasis. The pleasant practice of
        <I>jhana</I> does not supplant the other seven path factors; nor does 
        the painful practice supplant <I>jhana</I>. In fact, one practicing each 
        of the contemplations of the painful way of practice is said to ‘not 
        neglect <I>jhana’</I><A HREF="#_edn9" NAME="_ednref9" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[9]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        and to possess the five spiritual faculties, if only weakly.<A HREF="#_edn10" NAME="_ednref10" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[10]</SPAN></SPAN></A></SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Again, the Buddha says to 
        Mahanama the Sakyan that sensuality may arise in a noble one if they do 
        not attain <I>jhana</I>.<A HREF="#_edn11" NAME="_ednref11" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[11]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        However, this is phrased in the present tense, ‘does not attain’, not 
        ‘has never attained’. It seems that even after a stream-enterer has seen 
        the <I>Dhamma</I> their samadhi may fall away unless they devote 
        sufficient time to meditation, and therefore certain defilements may 
        re-arise.<A HREF="#_edn12" NAME="_ednref12" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[12]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        Stream-enterers and once-returners are not ‘perfected in <I>samadhi’</I>. 
        This does not imply that they have never experienced any <I>jhanas</I>, 
        only that they may not have experienced all four <I>jhanas</I>, or may 
        not be proficient in them.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Again, the six recollections &#8209; 
        the Buddha, <I>Dhamma</I>, <I>Sangha</I>, virtue, generosity, and 
        deities &#8209; are taught as a basis for <I>arahantship</I>,<A HREF="#_edn13" NAME="_ednref13" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[13]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        even though according to the <I>Visuddhimagga</I> they only lead to 
        access <I>samadhi</I>. Such suttas, which teach <I>samatha</I> for <I>
        arahantship</I> with no mention of <I>vipassana</I>, can hardly suffice 
        to establish the authenticity of a path of ‘pure <I>vipassana’</I>. 
        Moreover, the <I>suttas</I> say that these meditations will abandon the 
        five cords of sensual pleasures, so that the meditator dwells ‘with 
        heart become in every way like space &#8209; vast, exalted, measureless, free 
        from hatred and ill will.’<A HREF="#_edn14" NAME="_ednref14" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[14]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        They are called ‘blissful abidings here and now pertaining to the higher 
        mind, for the purification of the unpurified mind, for the brightening 
        of the dull mind.’<A HREF="#_edn15" NAME="_ednref15" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[15]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        They lead to the abandoning of the ‘taints of the mind’.<A HREF="#_edn16" NAME="_ednref16" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[16]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        Each of these phrases implies <I>jhana</I>. There is no distinction 
        derivable from the <I>suttas</I> between the <I>samadhi</I> which 
        results from these recollections and the <I>samadhi</I> which results 
        from any other meditation subject. The Buddha simply confirms this 
        straight-forward interpretation by saying that one who develops these 
        recollections ‘does not neglect <I>jhana’</I>.<A HREF="#_edn17" NAME="_ednref17" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[17]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        The chief reason why the <I>Visuddhimagga</I> thinks these recollections 
        cannot induce <I>jhana</I> is that they involve recollecting and 
        pondering over diverse qualities of the Buddha, etc., and so can lead 
        only to access <I>samadhi</I> (which is an incidental admission that 
        so-called access <I>samadhi</I> is not truly one-pointed).<A HREF="#_edn18" NAME="_ednref18" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[18]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        But there seems to be no reason why one could not leave off 
        contemplating diverse qualities and focus on just one quality to arouse
        <I>jhana</I>. A similar process is recommended in the <I>Visuddhimagga</I> 
        itself for some other meditations, such as the parts of the body. This 
        technique, based on the mental recitation of the word ‘Buddho’, is a 
        favorite method for developing <I>jhana</I> in contemporary Thailand.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Probably the most striking and 
        influential passages, which many believe to imply the superfluity of <I>
        jhana</I>, are the background stories of monastics and laypeople 
        attaining various levels of <I>Dhamma</I> with no mention of prior 
        meditative development, usually while listening to a talk. There is 
        usually nothing to positively rule out the possibility of previous 
        attainment of <I>jhana</I>, but in many cases this seems unlikely, 
        especially where laypeople are concerned. Regarded as extraordinary and 
        noteworthy, such cases of ‘instant enlightenment’ occur in a small 
        proportion of <I>suttas</I> (for example, about half a dozen times in 
        the <I>Majjhima</I> <I>Nikaya</I>), almost always when the Buddha 
        himself is teaching. The Buddha is, however, rarely personally credited 
        with confirming these attainments. In fact, he is at times reluctant to 
        do so, typically preferring to show how one can know for oneself.<A HREF="#_edn19" NAME="_ednref19" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[19]</SPAN></SPAN></A></SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The most common attainment is 
        stream-entry, so many conclude that such passages imply that this does 
        not require <I>jhana</I>. There are, however, a number of striking 
        descriptions of people attaining <I>arahantship</I> in circumstances 
        where it seems unlikely they had previously developed <I>jhana</I>. So 
        it seems that if such stories imply a <I>jhana</I>-less stream-enterer 
        we must also admit a <I>jhana</I>-less arahant. But I prefer to reverse 
        the logic: the texts unequivocally declare that arahants must have <I>
        jhana</I>, so these stories cannot prove the existence of <I>jhana</I>-less
        <I>arahants</I>. This being so, they cannot prove the <I>jhana</I>-less 
        stream-enterer either. Here I will advance three lines of argument to 
        support this conclusion. Firstly, such stories are often of questionable 
        authenticity. Secondly, they frequently describe a kind of <I>samadhi</I> 
        gained immediately prior to the enlightenment experience that could well 
        be <I>jhana</I>. And thirdly, they were meant to point to the path, not 
        replace it.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">First to historical matters. 
        Descriptions of ‘instant enlightenment’ are scattered through the canon, 
        but most characteristically in the first chapter of the <I>Vinaya</I> <I>
        Mahavagga</I>. I will therefore concentrate on this text, though I 
        believe many of the features I note here also occur in other contexts.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">This chapter tells of the 
        founding of Buddhism. It starts under the <I>Bodhi</I> tree with the 
        Buddha reflecting how <I>Dhammas</I> become clear to the ‘ardent brahman 
        in <I>jhana’</I>. It goes on to tell how the Buddha converted his first 
        followers and established a monastic order, thus serving to introduce 
        the <I>Vinaya</I>. This text, together with the <I>Maha</I> <I>
        Parinibbana</I> <I>Sutta</I> &#8209; with which it shares much in common &#8209; 
        forms the basis of all later biographies of the Buddha. The other early 
        schools also had their versions of this text, some of them extending it 
        to a full-fledged biography. Although the early <I>suttas</I> spare 
        little time for biography, later writers found that the Buddha's life 
        story gave the teachings that ‘personal touch’ ideal for popularizing 
        the teachings. The story was probably included to provide the <I>Vinaya</I> 
        students with some background and doctrinal teachings, rounding out 
        their education.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">And, adding zest to the 
        sometimes dry <I>Vinaya</I> material the chapter abounds in all manner 
        of wonderful and marvelous happenings &#8209; deities appearing; displays of 
        supernormal powers; the Buddha even does battle with a ferocious 
        fire-breathing dragon, tames it, and puts it in his bowl! This latter 
        event comes replete with a flowery but superfluous verse summary 
        (mistaken for prose in the PTS Pali and translation) &#8209; an obviously late 
        literary feature. Accounts of miraculous events are fairly restrained in 
        the early strata of the canon. They increase markedly in the later 
        strata, such as the <I>Maha</I> <I>Parinibbana</I> <I>Sutta</I> or the
        <I>Sagathavagga</I>, and proliferate wildly in later literature. Some of 
        the <I>Mahavagga</I> miracles must have had popular currency. At least 
        one, the story of the Buddha walking on water, later served as the 
        literary model for the well known story in the Christian Gospels.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Not least wonderful and 
        marvelous are the ‘miracles of conversion’. It is to be expected that 
        the codifiers of a religion should ascribe the maximum possible purity 
        to the first adherents. It seems that almost everyone the Buddha taught 
        in those first months became a stream-enterer at least. This includes, 
        for example, King Bimbisara together with a hundred thousand leading 
        householders of Magadha. (There is no mention of how such a vast 
        multitude managed to squeeze around the woodland shrine where the Buddha 
        was staying.) Such trends, too, proliferated in later writings; the <I>
        Milinda</I> <I>Panha</I> piously informs us that over a billion lay 
        followers had realized the <I>Dhamma</I>. There is surely an anomaly 
        here. Only a short while before, the Buddha, reflecting on the subtlety 
        of <I>Dhamma</I> and the strength of defilements, doubted anyone could 
        understand and famously hesitated whether to teach at all.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Professor AK Warder suspects a 
        political influence at work here. Although the Buddha’s main centre of 
        operations was in the neighboring kingdom of Kosala, there are no 
        comparable accounts of mass realizations there. During the period this 
        text was being assembled, the star of Kosala was waning, while that of 
        Magadha was waxing, following the aggressive expansionist policy 
        initiated by Ajatasattu and culminating in the pan-Indian Buddhist 
        empire of Asoka. It would have been most agreeable for the increasingly 
        politicized <I>Sangha</I> of the time to emphasize the early Buddhist 
        traditions of Magadha. It seems not too far-fetched to see in this 
        chapter's emphasis on biography, missionary activity, miracles, mass lay 
        conversion, and the liberating efficacy of listening to the teachings a 
        close connection with the popular, urbanized, scholastic Buddhism which 
        emerged in Asoka’s time.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">I suggest that this first 
        chapter of the <I>Mahavagga</I> was probably finalized around the same 
        period as the final chapter of the <I>Culavagga</I>, which tells of the 
        Third Council, that is, perhaps two hundred years after the Buddha's 
        passing away. Could this be connected with the schismatic thesis, 
        disputed by the <I>Theravada</I> at the Third Council, which claimed 
        that the path could be induced by a word? Although the doctrinal seeds 
        around which this text crystallized &#8209; the four noble truths, the 
        eightfold noble path, dependent origination &#8209; spring from the heart of 
        the Buddha's awakening, the details of the connecting biography record 
        popular tradition as much as enlightened revelation.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">As I have already noted, 
        ‘instant enlightenment’ also occurs elsewhere in the <I>Pali</I> canon. 
        Having seen the dubious authenticity of the text where these events 
        occur most prominently, we may well suspect that other occurrences may 
        be tarred with the same brush. Stories come to mind such as the 
        conversion of the assassins sent by Devadatta and the later conversion 
        of Devadatta’s entire retinue. Now I do not wish to suggest that all 
        such stories are spurious. Some of the doctrinal passages we will 
        examine below confirm that it is possible to realize <I>Dhamma</I> 
        during a talk, and many of the historical accounts may be genuine. 
        However, I do wish to suggest that the historical evidence attesting to 
        realization without prior <I>Dhamma</I> practice is slim. It is often 
        just those occasions when it seems least likely that the listener would 
        have previously developed <I>jhana</I> that turn out to be most 
        historically questionable.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">And so to my second line of 
        argument. The passages describing ‘instant enlightenment’ frequently 
        emphasize how the joy of listening to <I>Dhamma</I> purifies the mind in 
        readiness for realization. Although the texts are not completely 
        explicit on this point, the description of this mind state is certainly 
        consonant with <I>jhana</I>. The standard passage is as follows.</SPAN></P>

        he knew that the householder Upa1i’s mind was ready, soft, free of 
        hindrances, elated, clear of doubt, he expounded to him the special 
        teaching of the Buddhas: Suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the 
        path. just as a clean cloth with all the stains removed would take dye 
        evenly, so too while the householder Upali was sitting right there, the

        freedom from hindrances is equated with the first <I>jhana</I>; and how
        <I>samadhi</I> is the indispensable condition for seeing the four noble 
        truths. We have also seen that a stream-enterer knows that: ‘These

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">I have left the most important 
        line of argument until last. These passages were never intended to 
        supplant or modify the noble eightfold path. Their purpose is to 
        inspire, to rouse, to point to the teachings. They should encourage us 
        to investigate the teachings thoroughly and to apply our whole hearts to 
        the practice for the realization of the <I>Dhamma</I> in its fullness. 
        Let us not grab the snake by its tail. Exploiting such passages to opt 
        out of key aspects of the path surely confounds the very purpose of the 
        teachings.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">When all is said and done, 
        though, these passages remain the most difficult to square with the 
        integral importance of <I>jhana</I> in the path. Indeed, they rest 
        uneasily with our basic understanding that the attainment of <I>Dhamma</I> 
        is a direct inner realization transcending concepts. At some point in 
        the discourse, surely, the listener must apply the conceptual knowledge 
        they have gained to the direct contemplation of experience. This much is 
        implied by ‘paying attention to the root’. If this inner turning to <I>
        vipassana</I> can occur, there seems to be no hard and fast reason why 
        an inner turning to <I>jhana</I> cannot also occur.<A HREF="#_edn31" NAME="_ednref31" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[31]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        Certainly, there are no <I>sutta</I> passages that rule this out.

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">For practical purposes, the 
        question as to whether or not such events imply <I>jhana</I> is perhaps 
        not of overriding importance. At most they establish that some 
        individuals can make extremely rapid progress on the path. They never 
        constitute a separate path. The best way to maximize our chance of 
        realizing <I>Dhamma</I> while listening to a talk is to assiduously 
        develop <I>samatha</I> and <I>vipassana</I>. Right view is assisted not 
        just by learning, and not just by meditation, but by ‘virtue, learning 
        (or ‘listening’), discussion, <I>samatha</I>, and <I>vipassana’</I>.<A HREF="#_edn32" NAME="_ednref32" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[32]</SPAN></SPAN></A></SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The above passages all mention
        <I>samadhi</I>. <I>Dhamma</I> is often taught, however, without any 
        mention of <I>samadhi</I> at all. For example, neither the Buddha’s 
        second or third sermons mention <I>samadhi</I>, yet both led the

        How should this be understood? Elsewhere, <I>Dhamma</I> is taught with 
        no mention of wisdom. For example, the famous verses known as the 
        ‘Exhortation in the Code of Conduct’ primarily focus on virtue, but 
        include two phrases indicating meditation: ‘brightening the mind’ and 
        ‘higher mind’. These refer specifically to <I>samadhi</I>. <I>Vipassana</I> 
        constitutes the ‘higher understanding’ not mentioned here. Having taught 
        only virtue and <I>samadhi</I>, the Buddha sums up by saying: ‘This is

        bliss born of seclusion, is not tied, shackled, and fettered by the 
        fetter of gratification in the rapture and bliss born of seclusion.

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Venerable Maha Kaccana’s 
        exposition is typically subtle and precise. The three kinds of scrutiny 
        correspond with the threefold training. The first kind is closely linked 
        with sense restraint, an aspect of virtue. Note that ‘mental phenomena’ 
        are here treated as external to consciousness, just as the other sense 
        objects. The section on <I>samadhi</I> then follows as the natural 
        sequel to virtue. Here Venerable Maha Kaccana switches from 
        ‘consciousness’ to ‘mind’. Although generally having the same 
        denotation, the <I>suttas</I> tend to treat ‘consciousness’ in terms of 
        the first noble truth ‘to be fully known’ &#8209; and ‘mind’ in terms of the 
        fourth noble truth – ‘to be developed’. The analysis shows that the way 
        beyond attachment to spiritual bliss is not by avoiding <I>jhana</I>. 
        The monk ‘not stuck within’ practices <I>jhana</I> just the same, but 
        uses the subtle wisdom empowered by <I>samadhi</I> to avert attachment. 
        The <I>suttas</I> consistently recommend <I>samadhi</I> as part of the 
        practice to overcome attachment to <I>samadhi</I>.<A HREF="#_edn39" NAME="_ednref39" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[39]</SPAN></SPAN></A></SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">I did not include a translation 
        of the analysis of the phrase ‘by not grasping he is not anxious’. It 
        explains how, if the five aggregates are conceived in relation to a 
        ‘self’, anxiety arises when they change. Venerable Maha Kaccana does not 
        comment on the final phrase: ‘The production of birth, aging, death, and 
        the origin of suffering in the future’. The identical phrase occurs in 
        the <I>Maha</I> <I>Nidana</I> <I>Sutta</I> with reference to the 
        fixation of consciousness in mentality and physical form. It suggests 
        the dual role of consciousness, as the center of lived experience and as 
        the sense of identity flowing on in rebirths. The verse which follows 
        the same introductory summary in the <I>Itivuttaka</I> confirms that 
        rebirth is the issue.<A HREF="#_edn40" NAME="_ednref40" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[40]</SPAN></SPAN></A></SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">This ties up with the <I>
        Bodhisatta’s</I> famous rejection of his former teachers under whom he 
        reached the highest formless attainments.<A HREF="#_edn41" NAME="_ednref41" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[41]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        When the <I>Bodhisatta</I> first practiced with these teachers, he began 
        by studying the doctrinal theory. This is not explained in detail, but 
        would certainly have placed the practice of <I>samadhi</I> within a 
        conceptual framework, probably positing the eternal existence of a 
        blissful soul in the plane of rebirth corresponding to the <I>samadhi</I> 
        attainment. Any <I>samadhi</I> which results from such a wrong view is 
        of necessity wrong <I>samadhi</I>. The <I>Bodhisatta</I> nevertheless 
        credits his teachers with possessing faith, energy, mindfulness, 
        samadhi, and understanding (here these are not called ‘spiritual 
        faculties’), disposing of any idea that mindfulness and understanding 
        are unique to Buddhism. As well as understanding kamma and rebirth, 
        these teachers may well have pointed out that almost everything is 
        impermanent, suffering, and not-self, clinging only to a rarified view 
        of self. But the <I>Bodhisatta</I> set out on his spiritual quest in 
        search of what was not subject to birth, aging, and death, and so he 
        rejected this wrong <I>samadhi</I> of the sectarians, which leads only 
        to rebirth in exalted planes of existence. His respect and gratitude for 
        his former teachers is evident however, since they were the first people 
        he thought of teaching after his enlightenment; having long had ‘little 
        dust in their eyes’ they would quickly understand the <I>Dhamma</I>. He 
        did not extend the same honor to the self-mortifiers of the group of 
        five monks as he did to the <I>samadhi</I> practitioners, merely 
        commenting that ‘they were very helpful’.<A HREF="#_edn42" NAME="_ednref42" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[42]</SPAN></SPAN></A></SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">It is interesting that when the
        <I>Bodhisatta</I>, immediately before his enlightenment, reflected on 
        his past practice of samadhi, he skipped over his experience with the 
        sectarian teachers, recalling instead an isolated episode from his 
        youth. Perhaps this memory showed him that <I>samadhi</I> need not be 
        imprisoned within a dogmatic metaphysical framework, but in its essence 
        is simply a natural expression of the gracious flow of the <I>Dhamma</I>.</SPAN></P>

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">In summary, the passages that 
        have been used to throw doubt on the necessity for <I>jhana</I> consist 
        of minor doctrinal statements and background stories. Even if we were to 
        find a direct statement of the superfluity of <I>jhana</I> in such 
        material, could this outweigh the great mass of clear teachings on the 
        path? Better try to derail a freight train with a toothpick. And of 
        course, there is no such direct statement. The Buddha would hardly have 
        fixed <I>jhana</I> squarely in the heart of the path only to about face 
        and declare a path of all head, no heart.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">We should never forget that the 
        thoroughgoing treatment of causality is one of the most distinctive 
        features of the <I>Dhamma</I>, underlying the analysis of both the 
        existential problem and the practical solution. The specific factors of 
        the path, functioning as necessary conditions for their specific 
        results, exemplify specific conditionality of phenomena in general, that 
        is, dependent origination. Suggesting that one of the path factors may 
        be optional introduces a fuzziness to the path, retreating from a causal 
        to a correlative paradigm. The path becomes merely a collection of 
        skilful means, not an embodiment of universal principles. It is true 
        that some practices, such as the ascetic practices, formless 
        attainments, and psychic powers are useful but not essential. But these 
        do not occur in the wings to enlightenment or the dependent origination; 
        they are not key factors of the path in the sense under consideration 
        here.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Playing around with the key path 
        factors unleashes a further host of theoretical difficulties. If one 
        path factor is optional, what of the others? Perhaps there might be more 
        than one path? Then how many? How are the many benefits of <I>jhana</I> 
        accomplished without <I>jhana</I>? How to overcome sensuality when one 
        cannot withdraw from the senses? How to overcome restlessness when the 
        mind is still moving? How to transcend concepts when the mind is still 
        labeling? How to perceive subtle truths with coarse consciousness? If 
        one can go beyond hindrances with bare mindfulness, why can’t one simply 
        center the mind and go into <I>jhana</I>? What is hindering <I>jhana</I> 
        if not the hindrances? Being unable to realize the preliminary samatha 
        of <I>jhana</I>, how can one realize the ultimate samatha of <I>Nibbana</I>? 
        Deleting <I>jhana</I> from the path would take more than pointing to a 
        few suggestive passages; it would require a comprehensive model of the 
        path to account for such difficulties.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">We should be very reluctant to 
        draw from ambiguous passages inferences that entail modification of 
        central teachings. The <I>Dhamma</I> has a very fine and delicate 
        structure. Like a house of cards, removing one piece imperils the whole 
        edifice. Or again, like a pot brimful of pure water, with neither lack 
        nor excess &#8209; remove one cupful and every other drop must shift to fill 
        the space, leaving a pot that can never be called ‘full’.</SPAN></P>

          M138. MLDB overlooks the phrase ‘is fettered by the fetter of 
          gratification’ at M138.12. The traslation also errs in omitting <I>
          sukha</I> in the phrase ‘follows after the bliss and equanimity’. The 
          PTS <I>Pali</I> has <I>upekkha</I> at the first occurrence only; all 
          following and parallel occurrences have the (preferable) <I>
          upekkhasukha.</I></DIV>
