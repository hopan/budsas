        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">With this inspirational 
        proclamation the Buddha declared the freedom he had realized available 
        to all. Nothing less than escape from death itself was his promise, and 
        this goal was available to anyone willing to listen to his message with 
        a sincere and confident heart. Although many teachers had appeared &#8209; as 
        they still do today &#8209; with such extravagant claims, the distinctive 
        feature of the Buddha's teaching was a pragmatic course of spiritual 
        training leading step by step to the goal.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">This essay is an attempt to 
        clarify the meaning and function of <I>samatha</I> and <I>vipassana</I> 
        in Buddhist meditation. Much has been written on this topic, yet a cloud 
        of confusion persists. I am painfully aware of my presumption in 
        treading where so many more worthy have gone before; however, it seems 
        perhaps worthwhile to gather together many of the Buddha's own 
        statements on the subject in a form neither obscurely technical nor 
        patronizingly simplistic, and to present that material within a 
        consistent and reasonable framework of interpretation.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">This essay is intended neither 
        as a beginner's introduction nor as a guide to the nuts and bolts of 
        practice. Rather, it is intended for those who have some knowledge and 
        experience in Buddhist meditation, but who are confused by the diverse 
        and often conflicting opinions expressed by meditation teachers. All of 
        those teachers, however, are unanimous on one point &#8209; the greatest 
        Teacher, the Teacher of teachers, is the Buddha himself. To seek within 
        the Buddha's own sayings for a guide to the perfect conduct of life is 
        therefore an approach that is not to be faulted by any teacher of <I>
        Dhamma</I>. But it is to be hoped that this somewhat peculiar beast &#8209; an 
        essay on the theory of practice &#8209; can provide not only theoretical 
        clarity, but inspiration and practical tools for meditation as well. I 
        wish to emphasize that the sutta passages are the heart of this essay.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Despite, perhaps, appearances, I 
        include the vast array of references &#8209; like a massed body of soldiers or 
        of evidence &#8209; neither to obscure nor to intimidate, but to accord with 
        my conception of good scholarly procedure and, more fundamentally, 
        seeking to inspire a love, a reverence, for this most extraordinary 
        literature. I obviously have my own views on this matter, and offer 
        explanatory material accordingly, but this should be accepted only to 
        the extent that it aids understanding of the <I>suttas</I>. Never should 
        we forget the vast chasm that lies between the label, the word, and the 
        experience to which it points. How can ‘Swan River’ capture the dark 
        grace of a bird on wing? Or the brackish redolence of a lazy warm 
        memory? Still worse, how can it refrain from dragging in a welter of 
        others, of unseen rivers and unnoticed allusions? And if something so 
        banal is so fraught, what then the hope for concurrence in matters such 
        as these, anciently subtle and yet intensely, immediately personal? My 
        chief comfort is that the Buddha himself, having briefly flirted with 
        such thoughts, decided, and then demonstrated, that words could be good 
        enough. This is the distinction between caution and cynicism, not to be 
        forgotten by we who seek to rediscover his meaning.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Fear kills spirit. It is the 
        dedicated thirst for understanding, not the complacent acquiescence in a 
        hallowed body of theory, which gives rise to true wisdom. All too often 
        Buddhists come out trumpeting their commitment to free inquiry over 
        tradition, then content themselves with critiquing any tradition but 
        their own. So this work is offered, not as a set of dogmas, but as a 
        stimulus to creative engagement with the teachings. I hardly address the 
        question of how best to apply these teachings in a modem context. While 
        individuals will come to different solutions, I believe that a sincere 
        response will not be easy or comforting; it will not prop up our 
        complacent existence, but will sweep out our stays, precipitating a 
        radical realignment of lifestyle.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The most fundamental division of 
        the path is threefold: virtue, <I>samadhi</I>, and understanding. 
        Virtuous ethical conduct dams the poisonous outflow of defilements which 
        pollute behavior of body and speech, corrupting an individual’s 
        relations with the world outside. It conduces to peace and harmony in 
        relationships, in society, and in nature, for a moral person acts in a 
        responsible, co-operative, and non&#8209;afflictive manner. <I>Samadhi</I> 
        clarifies the still waters, cleansing the residual effluents that 
        pollute the mind, cloud the emotions and darken wisdom. It leads to 
        peace and harmony in the world within, with each mental factor 
        functioning appropriately, in balance and unity. And in these still 
        clear waters, understanding is able to locate and dry up the source of 
        pollution once and for all.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">‘Samadhi imbued with virtue 
        is of great fruit and benefit. Understanding imbued with samadhi is of 
        great fruit and benefit. The mind imbued with understanding is

        pleasures, existence, views, and ignorance.</SPAN></I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">’

        poisons become evaporated, and the unattained supreme security from 
        bondage becomes attained?’</SPAN></I></P>

        consciousness ... the base of nothingness ... </SPAN></I>
        <SPAN LANG="EN-US">[In all of these cases]<I> he reflects thus: “This

        treasure; so too when seeking one door to the deathless I have all at 
        once come to hear of eleven doors to the deathless. Just as if, Bhante, 
        a man had a house with eleven doors, and if that house were to burn down 
        he would be able to save himself through one or other of those doors; so

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Samatha</SPAN></I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">, 
        or peace of mind, is a gentle and unobtrusive quality. Meek and shy, she 
        sometimes seems unable to hold her own against the forthright boldness 
        of her brother, <I>vipassana</I>. And yet she has a unique contribution 
        to offer, no less precious for being unobvious. Persistent attempts have 
        been made to diminish the significance of <I>samatha's</I> role in 
        Buddhist meditation in the never-ending search for a shortcut to 
        happiness, so typical of our restless times. It is, however, precisely 
        because our post-modern world stresses the utility of analytical 
        intelligence so excessively that the complementary holistic qualities of 
        serenity and joy are sorely needed. Perhaps this essay may make some 
        small contribution towards rehabilitating <I>samatha</I> to her rightful 
        position as equal partner in that noblest of tasks, the development of 
        the mind.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">My original plan was simply to 
        investigate the role of <I>samatha</I> in the Buddha's scheme of 
        meditation. As I progressed, however, it became more and more apparent 
        that <I>samatha</I> can be fully understood only in relation to <I>
        vipassana</I>, and so I found myself being drawn into the deeper waters 
        of the Buddha's wisdom teachings. To some, <I>vipassana</I> is an 
        analysis of objective psychological reality, or a valuable therapeutic 
        tool for mental health, or simply the art of mindful living. To others 
        it is the unique Buddhist contribution to meditative science, while 
        still others regard it as a universal technique independent of 
        commitment to any particular dogma or belief. In my view none of these 
        descriptions do justice to the profundity of the Buddha's vision. Time 
        and again the texts indicate that key aspects of <I>vipassana</I>, 
        especially impermanence, must be understood in terms of dependent 
        origination &#8209; how the identification and involvement with experience 
        projects consciousness into future rebirth. Dependent origination is the 
        thread which ties this work together. Following is an attempt at a brief 
        explanatory synopsis of the standard series of twelve factors.

        <SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference">[4]</SPAN></A></SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Blundering about in the darkness 
        of <B>ignorance</B>, the unenlightened being fails to recognize how 
        their own craving gives rise to suffering. Delighting in <B>conceptual</B>
        <B>activities</B> and shunning peace, they form <I>kamma</I> &#8209; now good, 
        now bad &#8209; through body, speech, and mind. This creates a force which 
        propels consciousness &#8209; ever hungry for more experience &#8209; onward after 
        death into a new body. Like the thumb that grips in opposition to the 
        four fingers, consciousness establishes its identity in a new existence 
        supported by a complex of <B>mentality &amp; physical form</B>. As this 
        sentient organism matures, the <B>six senses</B> develop, through which 
        contact between consciousness and its objects stimulates <B>feelings</B> 
        of pleasure, pain, or indifference. <B>Craving</B> grows; for more 
        pleasure in this life or the next, or else bored, cynical, and 
        despairing, one looks forward to one's own annihilation. <B>Grasping</B> 
        at sensual pleasure and nurturing ideas revolving around a ‘self’ as the 
        essence of being, one’s thoughts and intentions conceive the embryo of 
        continued <B>existence</B> in a future life. But that seed, sprouting in 
        the springtime of <B>birth</B>, must fade in the autumn of <B>aging</B>, 
        and fall in the winter of <B>death</B>. This betrayal of life’s promise 
        is the essence of suffering.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Dependent origination combines 
        two complementary approaches to understanding. Through analysis the 
        various aspects or facets of the world are explored, while through 
        synthesis the relations between these facets are examined. Accordingly, 
        in this work the path is first examined with a comprehensive survey of 
        core doctrinal categories, emphasizing the role of <I>samatha</I>, and 
        including a specially detailed exposition of <I>satipatthana</I>, 
        treated as an integral component of the path. The spotlight then turns 
        to conditionality itself, attempting to pin down the precise nature of 
        the causal connection between key factors as a manifestation of a 
        meaningful response to suffering. The seven purifications are elucidated 
        with passages from the <I>suttas</I>. The all-important question, of 
        course, is how to actually walk the path. This is therefore described 
        next, showing the training for both monastics and laity. Given the 
        central importance of <I>samadhi</I> in all the above teachings, the 
        question naturally arises as to why it is so useful &#8209; how does <I>
        samadhi</I> work, and what do we get out of it? The highest benefit of
        <I>samadhi</I> is its support in attaining the various stages of 
        enlightenment, and so the exploration of the path concludes by 
        presenting the noble ones as living embodiments of the path. Lastly I 
        consider the most important of the <I>sutta</I> passages which have been 
        invoked to cast doubt on the necessity of <I>jhana</I>. Issues relating 
        to the translations have as far as possible been reserved for an 
        appendix so as to not burden the text. A brief selection of comments by 
        some of the most respected contemporary scholars and meditation masters 
        is included.</SPAN></P>
