        <SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size:14.0pt;color:maroon">ON THE 
        TRANSLATIONS</SPAN></B></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">In the interests of readability 
        and concision I have taken some liberties with condensing and 
        paraphrasing the translations, and have divorced the chosen passages 
        from their original contexts. On the other hand, I have treated 
        doctrinal terms and passages with rigorous consistency, occasionally 
        falling back on that last resort of the inept translator &#8209; word for word 
        literalism. Any conclusion based on such methodology can be no more than 
        provisional. I therefore encourage the reader to check these 
        translations with the <I>Pali</I> or with a reliable complete 
        translation. I have frequently relied on earlier translations, 
        particularly the wonderful works of Bhikkhu Na</SPAN>na<SPAN LANG="EN-US">moli 
        and Bhikkhu Bodhi, but the final choice of rendering is in all cases my 
        own. I have retained the <I>Pali</I> terms for the crucial meditation 
        terminology in all occurrences with the exception of ‘<I>satipatthana’</I>, 
        which I have occasionally rendered ‘establishing of mindfulness’. 
        Otherwise, <I>Pali</I> has been retained only for a few words probably 
        more familiar to Buddhists than their English equivalents &#8209; <I>arahant</I> 
        (accomplished one), <I>vinaya</I> (discipline), <I>sadhu</I> (it is 
        good!), <I>bhante</I> (venerable sir), <I>kasina</I> (meditation 
        device), <I>samsara</I> (course of rebirths). I have generally dispensed 
        with capitals for doctrinal terms as being justified neither by the <I>
        Pali</I> nor by current English. Since words such as <I>sutta</I>, <I>
        vinaya</I>, and <I>abhidhamma</I> may have a less specialized meaning in 
        early <I>Pali</I>, I capitalize only when unambiguously referring to 
        actual texts. Following is an explanation of my approach to some of the 
        technical terminology.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Anusaya</SPAN></I></B><SPAN LANG="EN-US">: 
        refers to the most fundamental mode of the defilements, which, even if 
        not presently active, will inevitably manifest under appropriate 
        conditions. ‘Tendency’, on the other hand, refers to a mere inclination. 
        I have used ‘inherent compulsion’.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Avakkanti</SPAN></I></B><SPAN LANG="EN-US">: 
        is usually rendered following etymology as 'descent', but it seems more 
        sensible to follow the unambiguous contextual meaning in dependent 
        origination and elsewhere of ‘reincarnation’. The contexts should 
        clarify that this refers to a conditioned stream of consciousness, not 
        an eternal soul.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Asava</SPAN></I></B><SPAN LANG="EN-US">: 
        has been rendered ‘poison’ rather than the feeble ‘taint’, which has 
        been used for <I>upakkilesa</I>.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Upanisa</SPAN></I></B><SPAN LANG="EN-US">: 
        has been derived by scholars from <I>upanisidati</I> (so the 
        sub-commentary), or from <I>upanissaya</I> (so the commentary). The 
        former supports the rendering ‘proximate condition’, the latter ‘vital 
        condition’. ‘Virtue is the <I>upanisa</I> for <I>samadhi’</I> is an 
        often-repeated, idiomatic usage of the term; but the proximate condition 
        for <I>samadhi</I> is not virtue but bliss. <I>Upanisa</I> can 
        substitute for <I>paccaya</I> as a general term for ‘condition’; but its 
        most idiomatic usage is in the dependent liberation, and there it means 
        primarily ‘vital condition’. We have met <I>upanisa</I> with this 
        meaning in the definition of right <I>samadhi</I> at M 117.1, etc. At 
        A9.1 good friendship, virtue, talk on wanting little, etc., energy, and 
        understanding are said to be the <I>upanisas</I> for the development of 
        the wings to enlightenment. Similarly, at A3.67, lending an ear (to 
        listen to <I>Dhamma</I>) is an <I>upanisa</I> for direct knowledge, etc. 
        These too are both necessary (<I>Sambuddhas</I> and <I>Paccekabuddhas</I> 
        notwithstanding &#8209; the context is the training for disciples) and, as the 
        passage emphasizes, strongly inductive, but not proximate, conditions. I 
        therefore take this as being the basic meaning, applied with some 
        flexibility in other contexts.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Kaya</SPAN></I></B><SPAN LANG="EN-US">: 
        usually means ‘body’, but in samadhi the five senses that make up the 
        body have disappeared. The formless attainments, the deathless, the 
        ultimate truth,<A HREF="#_edn1" NAME="_ednref1" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">[1]</SPAN></SPAN></A> and cessation are said to be 
        contacted ‘with the <I>kaya’</I>. This last also rules out the ‘<I>namakaya’</I> 
        (mentality body). At D27.9, <I>kaya</I> seems to be virtually synonymous 
        with ‘<I>bhuta’</I>: ‘has become <I>dhamma</I>, become holy’. In other 
        expressions also, for example the ‘<I>kaya</I>-witness’,<A HREF="#_edn2" NAME="_ednref2" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">[2]</SPAN></SPAN></A>
        <I>kaya</I> emphasizes the directness of personal engagement. This 
        meaning fits well in the <I>samadhi</I> contexts, so I have used 
        ‘person’ or ‘personally’. On the other hand, the ‘<I>kaya</I>-tranquility’ 
        that occurs before <I>samadhi</I> is surely parallel with the stage of 
        breath meditation consisting of ‘tranquilizing the <I>kaya</I>-activities’. 
        This is the in-and-out breaths, and so refers simply to the physical 
        body.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Khaya</SPAN></I></B><SPAN LANG="EN-US">: 
        is gentler than ‘destruction’, which is handled by other words in the <I>
        Pali</I>. It means ‘drying up’ (of a stream), ‘using up’ (of supplies), 
        ‘waning’ (of the moon), etc. I have used ‘evaporation’.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Dhamma</SPAN></I></B><SPAN LANG="EN-US">: 
        has been left un-translated, or rendered with ‘principle’, ‘quality’, 
        ‘phenomenon’, or ‘teaching’, rather than the incongruous ‘state’, which 
        is precisely what it is not. Bhikkhu Bodhi rather curiously asks us to 
        accept this rendering by divesting this word of both its chief 
        denotation &#8209; the existing condition of a person or thing &#8209; and 
        connotation &#8209; staticity (MLDB, pg. 54). The choice of this rendering may 
        be an expression of the ontological concretization of the concept of ‘<I>dhamma’</I>.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Nipaka</SPAN></I></B><SPAN LANG="EN-US"> 
        (adjective) or <B><I>nepakk</I></B><I>a</I> (noun): appear most 
        prominently as part of the compound <I>satinepakka</I> in the definition 
        of mindfulness as spiritual faculty, etc. The resemblance of this 
        compound to <I>satisampajanna</I> (mindfulness and clear comprehension) 
        may have influenced the commentaries to gloss <I>nepakka</I> with 
        ‘understanding’. But other contexts seem to indicate a closer connection 
        with the Sanskrit cognate meaning ‘chief, master’.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">‘You should abide with the 
        doors of the sense faculties guarded (gutta), with mindfulness protected

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The meaning as ‘mastery over the 
        senses’ may also apply in the sequence virtue, <I>nipaka</I>, <I>
        satipatthana</I> at M51.3, and at Sn144. As a quality of a good friend 
        (Sn45, Sn283) <I>nipaka</I> may mean ‘self-mastery, self-control’. <I>
        Nipaka</I> also occurs as a quality of <I>samadhi</I> at A5.27 (pg 71), 
        and in the compound <I>ekodinipaka</I> at S1.290 and Sn962. Here too it

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Nimitta</SPAN></I></B><SPAN LANG="EN-US">: 
        in the suttas probably never means ‘radiant reflex image in meditation’. 
        This was referred to rather as ‘light and vision of forms, the ‘radiant 
        mind’, etc. The commentarial usage of <I>nimitta</I> for this light is 
        possibly influenced by such passages as this.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">'When, good sirs, the

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">At A5.193 the various pollutants 
        and disturbances to water, compared with the five hindrances, prevent 
        one from seeing ‘the <I>nimitta</I> (reflection) of one's own face’. The 
        commentarial term ‘apprehending sign’ (<I>uggaha nimitta</I>) was 
        possible derived from passages such as A6.68 and S47-8; but here the 
        meaning seems to be ‘apprehending the character of the mind’, how the 
        mind responds to various ‘foods’. A6.68 shows that ‘apprehending the 
        nimitta of the mind’ is a preliminary stage of meditation, before 
        fulfilling right view and then right <I>samadhi</I>. In at least some 
        meditation contexts <I>nimitta</I> just means ‘cause’.<A HREF="#_edn6" NAME="_ednref6" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">[6]</SPAN></SPAN></A> It refers to some quality, 
        aspect, or feature of experience which, when paid attention to, promotes 
        the growth of a similar or related quality. This meaning fits in well 
        with the contexts in this work, so I have adopted the rendering ‘basis’ 
        rather than ‘sign', which does not carry a causal implication. A3.19 
        says that a monk who does not ‘carefully resolve’ on their <I>samadhi</I>
        <I>nimitta</I> (here = meditation subject, perhaps <I>satipatthana</I>) 
        in the morning, midday, or evening cannot grow in good qualities. At M 
        128.28 the phrase ‘I pay attention to the light-<I>nimitta’</I> occurs, 
        but even here I would regard the term ‘attention’ as hinting at a causal 
        implication, consistent with the usage earlier in the <I>sutta</I>.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Rupa</SPAN></I></B><SPAN LANG="EN-US">: 
        refers to the physical world as it appears to the mind. It includes 
        energy, the <I>tejodhatu</I>, and is thus broader than ‘matter’ or even 
        ‘materiality’. The rendering ‘physical form’ attempts to capture both 
        the breadth and the subjectiveness of <I>rupa</I>, and retains the 
        connection with <I>rupa</I> as the objects of sight, ‘visible forms’.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Vitakka</SPAN></I><SPAN LANG="EN-US"> 
        and <I>Vicara</I></SPAN></B><SPAN LANG="EN-US">: do not mean ‘thinking’ 
        in the context of <I>jhana</I>. Thinking necessarily involves a 
        succession of different mental objects and therefore cannot apply to the 
        still one-pointedness of <I>jhana</I>. <I>Jhana</I> is a state of 
        altered consciousness, and it is only to be expected that psychological 
        terms will take on new and more refined meanings. The following passage 
        brings out this distinction.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">‘I understood thus: “This 
        thought (vitakka) of renunciation ... non&#8209;ill will ... non-cruelty which 
        has arisen does not lead to the affliction of myself, of others, or of 
        both. It matures understanding, relieves stress, and leads to Nibbana. 
        But if I think on and consider on (anuvitakka, anuvicara) for too long, 
        my body will be strained. When the body is strained the mind is stirred 
        up, and a mind stirred up is far from samadhi.” So I steadied, settled, 
        unified, and concentrated my mind in samadhi within myself. For what

        If this implicit distinction is embodied in the translation, there is no

        as ‘distracting thoughts’. All thoughts, even thoughts about the <I>

        <I>karitva</I></SPAN></B><SPAN LANG="EN-US">: is interpreted by the 
        commentaries as meaning ‘taking <I>Nibbana</I> as the object [of the 
        mind in <I>samadhi</I>]’. This is identified as the transcendental <I>
        samadhi</I> of the noble path (moments) and fruits. Apart from our 
        general critique of the concept of the momentary path, there are several 
        reasons to doubt such an interpretation. Normally the <I>Pali</I> 
        absolutive &#8209; here signified by ‘having’ &#8209; expresses a subordinate action 
        completed before the main action of the sentence. This is the regular 
        verb form in phrases at the start of the <I>jhana</I> formula to signify 
        the ending of the obstructions to <I>jhana</I> or the fulfillment of the 
        qualities leading to <I>jhana</I>. For example: ‘quite secluded from 
        sensual pleasures’ or ‘having abandoned these five hindrances’. The 
        sentence: <I>‘Idha bhikkhave ariyasavako vossaggarammanam karitva 
        labhati samadhim labhati cittass’ekaggatam’</I> is syntactically 
        straightforward, so there is no reason to propose any non-standard 
        interpretation. Compare the formula for the bases for psychic powers: <I>
        ‘Chandam ce bhikkhave nissaya labhati samadhim, labhati 
        cittass’ekoggatam...’</I> The commentarial explanation, however, entails 
        the simultaneous occurrence of the main action with the subordinate 
        clause. This may just be grammatically possible (almost any grammatical 
        rule can admit some exceptions), but hardly likely. Bhikkhu Bodhi (CDB 
        page 1930), perhaps influenced by the commentary, takes <I>
        vossaggarammanam karitva</I> in apposition to ‘<I>samadhi’</I> 
        (grammatically the patient of the sentence, in accusative) rather than 
        ‘noble disciple’ (the agent, in nominative). This is certainly unusual; 
        Warder (Introduction to <I>Pali</I>, page 48) lists no such usage of the 
        absolutive.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The phrase may be compared with 
        the passage on the development of the six recollections: ‘Having made 
        this the support (<I>idam arammanam karitva</I>), some beings here are 
        purified.’<A HREF="#_edn10" NAME="_ednref10" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">[10]</SPAN></SPAN></A> Here, <I>arammanam karitva</I> 
        is obviously in apposition to ‘beings’, the agent. This passage also 
        gives a good idea as to the meaning of <I>arammana</I> as ‘support’ or 
        ‘basis’; the previously developed good qualities that underpin further 
        development. A related usage occurs at M21.11 &#8209; one develops loving 
        kindness towards one person, and then, relying on that (<I>tadarammanam</I>), 
        towards all beings. In such contexts the meaning approaches ‘meditation 
        subject’. This meaning is probably intended in the (late?) <I>Jhana</I>
        <I>Samyutta</I>.<A HREF="#_edn11" NAME="_ednref11" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">[11]</SPAN></SPAN></A> From here, perhaps, 
        developed the usage of <I>arammana</I> as ‘object (of consciousness)’, 
        dominant in the <I>abhidhamma</I> but absent from the <I>suttas</I>, on 
        which the commentaries rely to interpret <I>vossaggarammanam</I> <I>
        karitva</I>.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">There are other difficulties 
        with the commentarial explanation. The definitions of some of the other 
        spiritual faculties, for example that of mindfulness as ‘memory of what 
        was said and done long ago’, has obviously nothing to do with any ‘path 
        moment’. The commentaries therefore resort to a convoluted division of 
        the spiritual faculties as transcendental, non-transcendental, and 
        mixed. This directly contradicts the suttas restricting the spiritual 
        faculties to the noble individuals. Also, since ‘transcendental’ <I>
        samadhi</I> occurs before ‘non-transcendental’ understanding, it makes 
        nonsense of any notion of progressive development.</SPAN></P>

        has an active meaning in most of its occurrences, so I have reflected 
        this by rendering it as ‘activities’ rather than ‘formations’. This 
        preserves the link with its etymological sibling ‘action’ (<I>kamma</I>), 
        for which it often serves as a substitute. <I>Sankharas</I> as the 
        second link of dependant origination and the fourth aggregate are 
        defined as volition (<I>cetana</I>). However, particularly as the fourth 
        aggregate, the <I>abhidhamma</I> takes them to be broader than that, 
        encompassing a wide range of mental phenomena, from basic functions like 
        contact to sophisticated emotions like equanimity. While the rendering 
        ‘conceptual activities’ is too narrow for this, it is broader than 
        ‘volitional activities’, and it emphasizes the conceptual, linguistic 
        functions that are most typical of this aggregate, as well as the 
        pregnant, causative aspect.</SPAN></P>
