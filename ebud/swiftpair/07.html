        the <I>samadhi</I> of the noble ones are collected, starting with the

        but this sutta confirms that all <I>arahants</I> would have access to 
        fourth <I>jhana</I> after their attainment. Notice that this fourth <I>
        jhana</I> occurs with the tranquilizing of the breath. This obviously 
        refers to a gradual process of settling, occurring at the very least 
        over several minutes. This rules out any ‘momentary’ or transcendental 
        ‘path-moment’ <I>samadhi</I>. For the <I>arahant</I>, free from all 
        defilements, there is nothing to prevent the attainment of <I>jhana</I>.</SPAN></P>

        things one can enter and abide in the first jhana. What six? Sensual 
        desire, ill will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and remorse, doubt; and

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">To hold that an arahant may not 
        attain <I>jhana</I> is therefore tantamount to implying that they may 
        still be subject to residual defilements. The historical context here is 
        revealing. In virtually all other schools of Buddhism, a threefold 
        development occurred contemporaneous with the development of the <I>
        jhana</I>-less arahant in the <I>Theravada</I>. Firstly, the Buddha was 
        exalted from being a perfected human to being a god; secondly, the 
        arahant was downgraded, subject, it was felt, to residual sensuality, 
        lack of universal knowledge, even selfishness; and thirdly, the <I>
        Bodhisattva</I> ideal emerged from obscurity to fill the resulting gap 
        as an alternative way of practice. These trends culminated in the <I>
        Mahayana</I>. In an attenuated form, the first and third of these trends 
        are also evident in the <I>Theravada</I> commentaries. It should 
        therefore come as no surprise to find the status of the arahant being 
        gradually eroded. Some scholars, however, attempt to derive the <I>jhana</I>-less 
        arahant from one described in the <I>suttas</I> as ‘released by 
        understanding’.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">‘ “Released by understanding,

        The main point, then, is not which level of <I>samadhi</I> is achieved, 
        but the emphasis on wisdom at each level. Nowhere in the <I>suttas</I> 
        is it stated or implied that an arahant released by understanding does 
        not attain the four <I>jhanas</I>.</SPAN></P>

        lower fetters </SPAN></I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">[thereby becoming a 
        non-returner]<I>: that is not possible. Just as when there is a great 
        tree with heartwood standing, it is not possible that anyone could cut 
        out the heartwood without first cutting through the bark and sapwood.... 
        But that someone, by coming to that path, that way, could know and see 
        and abandon the five lower fetters: that is possible.</I></SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">‘And what, Ananda, is that 
        path? Here, with seclusion from belongings, the abandoning of 
        unbeneficial qualities, the complete tranquilization of bodily 
        disturbance, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from 
        unbeneficial qualities, a monk enters and abides in the first jhana ... 
        second jhana ... third jhana ... fourth jhana ... base of infinite space 
        ... base of infinite consciousness ... base of nothingness. Whatever 
        exists in there of feeling, perception, conceptual activities, and

        suffering, a disease, a tumor, a barb, a calamity, an affliction, alien, 
        disintegrating, empty, not-self. He turns his mind away from those 
        phenomena and directs it towards the deathless element thus: “This is 
        peaceful, this is sublime; that is, the samatha of all activities, the 
        relinquishment of all belongings, the evaporation of craving, fading 
        away, cessation, Nibbana.” Standing on that he attains the evaporation 
        of the poisons </I>[or to the state of non-return]<I>.... This is the

        just as necessary that they occur in the correct sequence: first the 
        bark, then the sapwood, then the heartwood. The samadhi here occurs with 
        the ‘tranquilizing of bodily disturbance’ (sometimes rendered ‘inertia’, 
        but one cannot tranquilize inertia). The remarks above on the 
        incompatibility of ‘path-moment’ samadhi with the tranquilizing of the 
        breath apply here also. This is confirmed yet again in the body of the 
        text, which treats <I>samadhi</I> exclusively as a basis for <I>
        vipassana</I>, not as an enlightenment experience. Realization then

        Although these terms are most commonly used to distinguish between those

        understanding or faith, in a few passages they seem to be used as

        This is reminiscent of the usage of the analogous terms ‘release of 
        heart, release by understanding’ which we briefly noted above (Chapter 
        two). In fact, the ‘<I>suttas’</I> treatment of the different 
        classifications of noble individuals (apart from the standard set of 
        four pairs) is somewhat loose, and must be sensitively judged in each 
        context. Even when they are differentiated, the <I>Dhamma</I>-follower 
        has the spiritual faculty of faith, while the faith-follower has the 
        spiritual faculty of understanding, leaving no doubt that the difference 
        is simply a matter of emphasis, and explaining how both terms can also 
        be applied to all the wayfarers without distinction. The following 
        passage compares the <I>Dhamma</I>-follower and the faith-follower with

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Those on the way to stream-entry 
        are contrasted with the stream-enterer in terms of their primary 
        cognitive mode. The stream-enterer ‘knows and sees’ directly, while the 
        wayfarers accept by faith or by pondering, i.e. with primarily emotive 
        or intellectual acquiescence to the teachings. These kinds of acceptance 
        are two of five ways of knowing mentioned elsewhere, which may lead to 
        either right or wrong conclusions, and which do not constitute 
        ‘awakening to the truth’. However, if correctly apprehended &#8209; as 
        provisional, not conclusive &#8209; they form part of the practice for 
        awakening.<A HREF="#_edn27" NAME="_ednref27" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[27]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        In fact, acquiescence in line with the teachings is necessary before one 
        can enter the way.<A HREF="#_edn28" NAME="_ednref28" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[28]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        Although this contrast is consistent with the normal ascription of 
        ‘knowledge and vision in accordance with reality’ to the stream-enterer, 
        elsewhere the noble ones as a whole are described as ‘directly knowing’ 
        in contrast with the ordinary person, who merely ‘perceives’.<A HREF="#_edn29" NAME="_ednref29" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[29]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        Rather than describing these wayfarers as directly knowing or not, it 
        seems more relevant to describe them as being in the process of coming 
        to know. Like the time just before sunrise: compared with midnight it is 
        light, but compared with midday it is still dark. When contrasted with 
        the ordinary person, then, it may be said that they have direct 
        knowledge, but when contrasted with the stream-enterer their knowledge 
        is primarily conceptual. The possession of the spiritual faculty of 
        understanding, though limited in this way, implies a degree of direct 
        introspective insight. Not having fully seen the <I>Dhamma</I>, they 
        also lack ‘confirmed confidence’. Earlier, we saw this as a key 
        ingredient of the ‘relinquishment’ that supports the <I>samadhi</I> of 
        the stream-enterer. The wayfarers would instead rely on their own 
        intrinsic qualities: love of the Buddha, freedom from doubt about the 
        teachings, and lack of remorse for doing evil.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">While the texts exhibit some 
        equivocation over the understanding and faith faculties of those on the 
        way to stream-entry, no such hesitation is expressed regarding their 
        samadhi faculty. The Buddha specifically addresses the question of the 
        level of <I>samadhi</I> required for the initial entry to the path. In 
        common with the <I>arahant</I> released by understanding (sometimes), 
        the wayfarers do not have the formless liberations. But they are 
        repeatedly declared to possess the spiritual faculty of <I>samadhi</I>, 
        i.e. <I>jhana</I>. Although the Buddha took pains to make the attainment 
        of the way to stream-entry appear accessible, emphasizing the qualities 
        that the <I>Dhamma</I>-follower and faith-follower lack, nowhere is <I>
        jhana</I> included among the qualities that they lack. The weakness of 
        the spiritual faculty of samadhi may be explained by the weakness of the 
        supporting ‘relinquishment’. The weakness of the faculty, it may be 
        noted, does not necessarily imply weakness of <I>samadhi</I>. Even 
        ordinarily people, while totally bereft of the faculties, may be highly 
        skilled in all <I>samadhi</I> attainments. The term ‘spiritual faculty’ 
        implies rather that these principles become the ascendant prevailing 
        dispositions, dominant in their own fields, and not to be overthrown. 
        For ordinarily people, the long-term prognosis is decline from the 
        heights they have attained, and eventually perhaps rebirth even in hell; 
        while for the trainees, though they may still have short-term 
        difficulties, the long term will bring only progress.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">If the wayfarers possess <I>
        jhana</I>, why then, as we saw above, is <I>samadhi</I> not directly 
        stated in the dependent liberation to be a vital condition for this 
        attainment? Consider the structure of the noble eightfold path. One 
        starts with conceptual right view, and then develops the remaining 
        factors culminating in right samadhi, which includes reviewing 
        knowledge, a wisdom practice. At this point all the path factors have 
        been fulfilled to a degree which may for some be sufficient for entering 
        the way. So it seems that the attainment of right <I>samadhi</I> may 
        itself be equivalent to entering the way. It therefore could not be said 
        that it is a condition for entering the way, since nothing can be a 
        condition for itself. This does not necessarily imply that all those 
        with right view who develop <I>samadhi</I> become noble ones; this would 
        depend on one’s spiritual maturity, especially one’s depth of wisdom or 
        faith.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Since the wayfarers must 
        inevitably attain stream-entry in this very life, even if prevented from 
        practicing by, say, grave illness or sudden death,<A HREF="#_edn30" NAME="_ednref30" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[30]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        it is difficult to escape the conclusion that they need not further 
        develop their meditation after the entry to the path. This makes sense 
        if we understand the attainment of the path as requiring development of 
        all the path factors to a sufficient degree, such that the conditions 
        for stream-entry are already fulfilled, requiring only time to bear 
        their fruit. There does not seem to be any method given to ascertain 
        exactly how much the path factors must be developed to reach this point. 
        Normally, of course, the character of such individuals would be to 
        delight in meditation, and the Buddha further exhorts them to put forth 
        effort to minimize their time in <I>samsara</I>.</SPAN></P>

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">All noble ones are consistently 
        and repeatedly said to be endowed with samadhi as a path-factor and 
        spiritual faculty, to possess the samadhi of a trainee, and to train in 
        the higher mind. These are all defined as <I>jhana</I>. In my opinion, 
        the conclusion is inescapable: <I>jhana</I> is necessary for all the 
        stages of noble liberation. The noble path has eight factors. <I>jhanas</I> 
        are one of those factors. Only with the fulfillment of all eight factors 
        can one be considered to be on the path. At the end of our labyrinthine 
        tour of the <I>suttas</I> we return to this simple, straightforward 
        principle. Our explorations of the subtle, sometimes enigmatic, world of 
        the <I>suttas</I> serve to illuminate this model, revealing unexpected 
        nuances, unappreciated depths. Like a fugue, where the main theme is 
        reflected in every note, not distorted but enhanced by the modulations 
        and transformations; so too the keynote of peace permeates the path. As 
        we will see below, this pervasion is so complete that the very passages 
        which at first glance may seem to introduce a new thematic paradigm, 
        with sensitive appraisal often turn out to enrich our appreciation of 
        the essential theme.</SPAN></P>
