        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The Buddha never divided the 
        themes of meditation into two classes: <I>samatha</I> and <I>vipassana</I>. 
        Nor did he divide meditators into two classes: the <I>samatha</I> 
        practitioners and the <I>vipassana</I> practitioners. He taught the 
        development of the mind for the ending of suffering. As mind is diverse, 
        so too are the means of development diverse. But hypostatizing these 
        different means into different paths only fractures the organic unity of 
        the <I>Dhamma</I>. Some may walk to the left, some to the right; some 
        faster, some slower; some with ease, some with difficulty; but the path 
        itself is one.</SPAN></P>

        So I have written this book with the sincere wish to enhance 
        understanding and harmony between all aspirants in our approach to the 
        Buddha's teachings. I am well aware that by insisting that there is only 
        one true path to liberation I court the risk of being labeled 
        intolerant. Many, rightly wary of the spectre of religious fanaticism, 
        seek common ground between religions or between branches of the same 
        religion by claiming that surface differences, arising as valid 
        responses to the circumstances of time and place, mask an underlying 
        unity. I believe this is mistaken. Certainly, the Buddha flat-out denied 
        that his teaching was the same as any other. While many differences do 
        indeed float only on the surface, in my opinion an honest appraisal 
        shows that, among many similarities, some .meaningful differences 
        persist even in the deep structures of religions &#8209; in their 
        philosophies, in the experiences of their sages, and in the sayings of 
        their founders. But of course, non-identity does not mean complete 
        separation or contradiction; it means distinct but related.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Anyway, mere tolerance is a 
        stingy virtue. We should do more than tolerate, we should celebrate 
        goodness wherever we find it. We should rejoice in whatever peace, 
        wisdom, and fulfillment any spiritual practitioner finds in their chosen 
        way. We should be happy to live together, talk together, and practice 
        together in an spirit of mutual respect, mutual harmony, and mutual 
        support even if we have differing views or practices.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Saying: ‘We should get along 
        with them because, in the end, they're the same as us’ is in fact 
        intolerant. We value others because they measure up to our standard; but 
        we should value others because of their intrinsic worth, because they 
        measure up to their own standard. More importantly, one treats the truth 
        shabbily. Truth is one, and bows not to the whims of fashion. Here, 
        surely, all would agree. The rich diversity of religious and 
        philosophical doctrines in the world are attempts to represent that 
        truth. The view that ‘It’s all the same in the end’ is just one more 
        view. But it is a view perilously intolerant of reasoned inquiry. 
        Declaring sensitive issues out of bounds for fear of disputes must be 
        the surest way to sap religion’s vitality, relegating it to stagnation 
        and irrelevance. Undertaking a reasoned, thoughtful critique grants 
        those views the dignity of attention, and it grants the adherents of 
        those views the dignity of taking part in such an inquiry. If the 
        critique is pertinent they can correct their ideas; if it is misguided 
        they can develop a more sophisticated account of their ideas. 
        Investigation can distinguish between trivial and important differences 
        of opinion, and clear the way for meaningful reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">‘Disputes about livelihood or 
        the code of conduct are trifling, Ananda. But should disputes arise in 
        the Sangha about the path or the way of practice </SPAN></I>

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">‘Only this is right &#8209; 
        everything else is stupid’: this is one extreme view. ‘It's all the same 
        in the end’: this is a second extreme view. The Buddha taught us to 
        avoid these extremes through analysis and inquiry: ‘What is the same? 
        What is different?’</SPAN></I></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">We may scour all the deserts on 
        this broad earth and not find even two grains of sand that arc 
        completely identical. Still less will we find two grains of sand that 
        are utterly different. The true basis of compassion and respect is not a 
        supposed identity of beliefs or paths, but our shared nature as sentient 
        beings. We all feel pain. We are together in this lifeboat earth, 
        drifting on the trackless seas, longing for a glimpse of land. As we 
        share our sorrows, so too we share our joys. And of all joys, none 
        compares with the joy of letting go. This joy belongs to no-one, lives 
        in no country. It knows not name or face. It is our common heritage as 
        children of the <I>Tathagata</I>.</SPAN></P>

        the bliss of peace, the bliss of enlightenment. I say that this bliss 
        should be cultivated, should be developed, should be made much of, and

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Meaning does not inhere in a 
        text. Still less can it be extracted and distilled into a definitive, 
        universal formula. Rather, it arises in the response of the reader. Each 
        reader will respond in their own way. But within the spectrum of 
        response one thing is sure &#8209; <I>Dhamma</I> does not stop short with the 
        written word.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">‘What, Bhante, does “abider 
        in Dhamma” refer to?’</SPAN></I></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">‘Here, a monk studies the 
        Dhamma &#8209; the suttas, chants, expositions, verses, inspired sayings, “so 
        it was said” sayings, birth stories, marvelous teachings, and 
        catechisms. He does not waste his days with that Dhamma he has studied, 
        he does not neglect retreat, he is devoted to samatha of the heart 
        within. Thus, monk, a monk is an “abider in Dhamma”.</SPAN></I></P>

        Dhamma. I have done for you what should be done by a Teacher seeking the 
        welfare of his disciples out of compassion. Here, monk, are roots of 
        trees, here are empty huts. Practice jhana, monk! Do not be negligent! 
        Do not regret it later! This is our instruction to you</SPAN></I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">.’<A HREF="#_edn5" NAME="_ednref5" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[5]</SPAN></SPAN></A></SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Dhamma</SPAN></I><SPAN LANG="EN-US"> 
        is no weekend pastime. A crash course in meditation cannot be expected 
        to effect any substantial, lasting transformation. If we want quick 
        results we are likely to end up either disappointed or deluded. But if 
        we allow our lives to yield to the soft touch of the <I>Dhamma</I>, our 
        minds will grow more and more peaceful as our attachments grow less and 
        less. <I>Samatha</I> is not about trying very hard to scale some far-off 
        mountain peak; it is about being content with the wholesome happiness of 
        the present moment. This is beyond no-one’s reach. We usually 
        underestimate the task; but we underestimate our own potential even 
        more. Though the road may seem long, none can take more than one step at 
        a time. Wherever we stand, forward is the only way.</SPAN></P>

        initial and sustained application of mind, and the rapture and bliss 
        born seclusion. I thought: “Might that be the path to enlightenment?”
