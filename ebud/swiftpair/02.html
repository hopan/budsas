        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">In ordinary usage, ‘<I>samatha</I>’

        here the meaning approaches ‘cessation’. The means of settling disputes 
        in the <I>Sangha</I> exemplify how <I>samatha</I> and <I>vipassana</I> 
        work together. The disputants should come together in harmony; 
        thoroughly examine the issues in accordance with <I>Dhamma</I>; and

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Here, two aspects of <I>
        vipassana</I> are brought forth. Firstly, the penetrative, clear-eyed 
        observation of what is occurring in the present moment. And secondly, 
        the ability to infer a correct conclusion by closely examining the 
        evidence before one's eyes, understanding it in line with valid general 
        principles. These two aspects are mirrored in the context of dependent 
        origination by ‘knowledge regarding <I>Dhamma</I>’ &#8209; understanding each 
        factor according to the four noble truths &#8209; and ‘knowledge regarding 
        entailment’ &#8209; understanding that all those who see the <I>Dhamma</I>,

        Another, similar, kind of knowledge is called the ‘knowledge of the 
        regularity of natural principles’ &#8209; understanding that the conditional 
        relations between the factors always operate the same way.<A HREF="#_edn5" NAME="_ednref5" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[5]</SPAN></SPAN></A></SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The precise denotation of the 
        terms ‘<I>samatha</I>’ and ‘<I>vipassana</I>’ in the context of 
        meditation can be derived from a passage quoted more fully below. <I>
        Samatha</I> is the steadying of the mind, its settling, unifying, and 
        concentrating in <I>samadhi</I>. It is therefore similar in meaning to 
        one-pointedness of mind, the most distinctive mental quality of <I>jhana</I> 
        or <I>samadhi</I>.<A HREF="#_edn6" NAME="_ednref6" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[6]</SPAN></SPAN></A>
        <I>Vipassana</I> is the seeing and exploring of activities. It therefore 
        refers to wisdom in its refined mode of investigation into the nature of 
        reality as experience. These definitions express the quintessence of 
        samatha and <I>vipassana</I>. However, <I>samatha</I> and <I>vipassana</I> 
        also occur as a comprehensive summary of the meditative aspect of the 
        path, and the next passage treats them as leading to the development of 
        the mind and of wisdom respectively. This implies that they may also be 
        taken in a more general sense as including those qualities of mind 
        leading to peace and to wisdom. They almost always occur as a pair in 
        the <I>suttas</I>, and are a pair of mental qualities to be developed by 
        means of the eightfold path.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">‘Monks, these two principles

        lust is not released; understanding tainted by ignorance is not

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Sometimes the phrases ‘release 
        of heart’ and ‘release by understanding’ denote different kinds of <I>
        arahants</I> distinguished by their giving chief emphasis to either <I>
        samadhi</I> or wisdom. Normally however, as here, they point to two 
        complementary aspects of the release of all <I>arahants</I>. Thus <I>
        samatha</I> and <I>vipassana</I> function as a pair, not only in the 
        preliminary training, but also right up to the ultimate liberation. This 
        is why the Buddha called <I>Nibbana</I> the ‘<I>samatha</I> of all 
        activities’, emphasizing that samatha points to the stilling, 
        tranquillizing, and pacifying of suffering.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Notice that <I>samatha</I> 
        brings about the fading of lust, <I>vipassana</I> the fading of 
        ignorance. Lust is a term for the emotional aspect of the defilements; 
        ignorance is a term for the intellectual aspect. At their most general, 
        then, <I>samatha</I> may be regarded as pertaining to emotional 
        development, <I>vipassana</I> as pertaining to intellectual development. 
        The terms ‘emotional’ and ‘intellectual’ are meant here in their 
        broadest possible connotation. They have been chosen because they offer 
        an established usage, easily understood, which approximates to this 
        context. No doubt we risk trivializing the concept of <I>samatha</I> and
        <I>vipassana</I>; but perhaps we may succeed instead in dignifying the 
        contemporary impoverished understanding of the emotions and the 
        intellect. By using the word ‘emotional’ we no more mean being moody and 
        impulsive than by ‘intellectual’ we mean mere reasoning and rational 
        thinking. Rather, we refer to that whole side of experience, half of our 
        mind or world that deals with feelings and intuitions, the soft feminine 
        side, and that, which deals with understanding and analysis, the 
        penetrating masculine side. All of us contain both of these aspects 
        within us. Each of these aspects contains some good and some bad and 
        must be developed in a balanced way if we are to achieve liberation &#8209; we 
        cannot enlighten only half our mind.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Many similes can illustrate this 
        mutual support. <I>Vipassana</I> only is like trying to cut down a tree 
        with a razor blade; <I>samatha</I> only is like using a hammer. Both 
        together is like using a sharp axe &#8209; both penetrating and powerful. Or
        <I>samatha</I> is like the underside of a postage stamp &#8209; it sticks &#8209; 
        while <I>vipassana</I> is like the top &#8209; it informs. Or <I>samatha</I> 
        is like the left foot, <I>vipassana</I>. like the right foot &#8209; one can 
        only move one foot forward by leaning on the other. Or <I>samatha</I> is 
        like the cool breeze at the mountain top, and <I>vipassana</I> is like 
        the view of the countryside. Or <I>samatha</I> is like the hand which 
        clings to the next rung up the ladder, <I>vipassana</I> like the hand 
        which lets go of the rung below. This simile contains a warning &#8209; if one 
        lets go of both ends before reaching the top, one is likely to end up as 
        a crumpled heap at the foot of the ladder.</SPAN></P>

        developed further. The only variation is the manner of preliminary 
        practice of <I>samatha</I> and <I>vipassana</I>. The ‘path’ here is 
        obviously the noble eightfold path. At its inception this is the way to

        This discourse indicates that all meditators who are to attain 
        liberation will develop both <I>samatha</I> and <I>vipassana</I> before 
        entering into the plane of the noble ones. There is no mode which 
        develops <I>vipassana</I> first and then <I>samatha</I> (as 
        transcendental <I>jhana</I>) simultaneous with the arising of the path.
