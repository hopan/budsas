        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Sensual desire is not restricted 
        to sexual desire, or desire for food, etc. These are only the coarse 
        manifestations of a hunger for stimulation which constantly obsesses the 
        minds of beings. Any interest or concern whatsoever connected with 
        experiencing pleasure, relief, or comfort through the eye, ear, nose, 
        tongue, or body, or any thoughts, memories, or expectations of such 
        experience fall within the range of this prime hindrance. This is the 
        defining characteristic of beings in the ‘sensual world’ and the chief 
        reason for taking rebirth in this realm. Having taken rebirth here, life 
        is for the most part dedicated to maximizing the experience of sensual 
        pleasure. Hardly a few seconds ever go by during the course of an entire 
        life truly free from free from harassment by concern for sensual 
        pleasure. Even the overwhelming majority of religious practitioners &#8209; 
        and here Buddhists are no exception &#8209; are motivated largely by sensual 
        desire, whether it be the desire to experience refined sensual objects 
        in a heavenly realm, or the desire to enjoy one’s relationships and 
        material comforts with mind at peace.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The pleasure of sensuality has 
        these properties. It is narrow, occurring in only a restricted zone of 
        the totality of awareness, thus forcing a constriction of consciousness. 
        It is evanescent, necessitating a constant toil to seek out new 
        pleasures. It is stimulating, agitating the mind so that it cannot 
        experience the pleasure fully, but keeps restlessly skipping about, thus 
        concealing the inadequacy of the gratification provided by the pleasure. 
        It is crude, coarsening the mind and blocking awareness of subtle 
        realities. It is always interwoven with painful feeling, pressuring the 
        mind to reject or deny part of experience. It is selfish, obstructing 
        relationships with others based on genuine compassion and altruism. And 
        because of all these things, it promotes the growth of unwholesome 
        thoughts and intentions, leading to suffering in future lives and 
        obstructing the path to <I>Nibbana</I>.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The bliss of the peaceful mind 
        shares none of these faults. It permeates the whole field of awareness, 
        so that the mind is spacious and relaxed. Though of course impermanent, 
        it is far more stable and enduring than sensual happiness. It is 
        peaceful, soothing the fevered mind, drawing the mind into the stillness 
        of deep, sustained contemplation. It is of surpassing subtlety, the 
        limits of feeling, pointing the way to the transcendence of feeling. It 
        is pure bliss without any admixture of pain, fostering a truly holistic 
        awareness. It removes any motivation for relationships based on selfish 
        desires; seeing the tenderness of one’s own heart, one would shrink away 
        from any act that would harm the heart of another. And because of all 
        these things, it is exclusively associated with wholesome thoughts and 
        intentions, leading to bliss not only in this life, but also to 
        unimaginable ages of bliss in the future, and constituting the 
        incontrovertible high road to the ultimate bliss of <I>Nibbana</I>.</SPAN></P>

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">According to fundamental 
        principles of Buddhist philosophy, it is the mind that creates the 
        world. The mind, fuelled with craving and attachments, cooks up the five 
        senses to feed, distract, and entertain it, to avoid at any cost the 
        ghastly possibility of having to confront the grisly reality behind its 
        cozy complacency. By assailing the mind with an overload of input, the 
        five hindrances, hand in hand with the five senses, confuse and sully 
        the ability to clearly know.</SPAN></P>

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The importance of this statement 
        can scarcely be overstated. It formulates in negative terms the 
        statement that one in samadhi knows and sees according to reality the 
        four noble truths. The practice of <I>jhana</I>, by cutting off the five 
        hindrances, starves ignorance of its food. But how exactly does <I>
        samadhi</I> accomplish this?</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">One of the key factors in 
        meditation is perception (<I>sanna</I>). Perception is a relatively 
        shallow mode of knowing which recognizes the surface features of 
        phenomena, interpreting them in terms of past experience. It marks off 
        one section of sense data so that it can be treated as a unit. For 
        example, it is perception that generalizes and summarizes the data in a 
        visual image, recognizing that ‘This is blue, this is yellow, this is 
        red.’ It filters, simplifies, and abstracts the sheer bewildering 
        quantity of sense data, processing it in terms of manageable 
        information, symbols, and labels. Perception forms the basis of 
        concepts. While perception recognizes common features of phenomena, 
        concepts combine a group or class of features into a mental image or 
        idea. In order to construct something as ephemeral as a concept, the 
        mind must be actively diverted from the clamor of sense experience and 
        applied inwards. The formation of a concept can be analyzed in two 
        stages. Firstly, there is the initial conception of a verbal idea, a 
        thought (<I>vitakka</I>). Secondly, a sustained series of these thoughts 
        is linked up to form a coherent consideration (<I>vicara</I>). At this 
        stage, this thinking and considering is still preoccupied with 
        perceptions of sense experience; but the mind is able for the first time 
        to be aware of a mental object distinct from that experience, and hence 
        by reflection to infer the existence of a ‘mind’ as experiencer. This 
        development, though crucial for both psychology and philosophy, 
        introduces a subtle distortion in experience. By representing the world 
        as more coherent and meaningful than it really is, it invites an 
        insidious obsession with the fantasy realm of concepts, the fairy 
        castles of the imagination, divorced from the uncertainties of reality.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">‘Dependent on the eye and 
        visible forms arises eye-consciousness. The coming together of the three 
        is contact. Due to contact there is feeling. What one feels, one 
        perceives. What one perceives, one thinks about. What one thinks about, 
        one proliferates about. What one proliferates about is the source from 
        which ideas derived from the proliferation of perceptions beset a person 
        regarding past, future, and present visible forms cognizable by the eye

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The first steps of this passage 
        form the basic exposition of the workings of conscious processes as 
        analyzed in dependant origination. They constitute the ‘given’, the raw 
        materials common to all sentient beings. With feeling, though, a new 
        syntactical structure appears, signifying a change in mood. The static 
        nouns are replaced by verbs &#8209; the momentum is picking up. The mind is 
        adding to experience, and here perception plays a key role, under the 
        influence of the four ‘perversions of perception’ &#8209; seeing permanence in 
        what is impermanent, happiness in what is suffering, self in what is 
        not-self, and beauty in what is ugly.'<A HREF="#_edn10" NAME="_ednref10" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[10]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        By noticing shared characteristics, with each phenomenon perception 
        suggests an association with further phenomena. These associations 
        become verbalized internally as mental images called ‘thinking’. The 
        following verse links ‘proliferation’ closely with ‘conceit’, the idea 
        of a ‘self’.</SPAN></P>

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">‘Proliferation seems to be a 
        term for the way the undisciplined mind, by identifying with and 
        delighting in this process of thinking, erupts in a profusion of trivial 
        and repetitious inner commentaries. So at this point the passage moves 
        on from analysis purely in terms of mental factors the ‘person’ is 
        introduced. Proliferation has given birth to the full-blown concept of a 
        ‘thinker’ who is being overwhelmed by the conceptual process by which 
        they were born, which is now spinning out of control. Significantly, at 
        the same point time is introduced. We have seen above the connection 
        between time, concepts, and the idea of an enduring self. The ‘ideas’ 
        spoken of in the passage lie close in meaning to ‘concepts’; but the 
        literal meaning ‘reckonings, classifications’ suggests rather more 
        specifically the mind’s calculating manipulation of the data of 
        experience, like an inner spin doctor reaffirming the self and its place 
        in the world. Given the integral significance here ascribed to the 
        process of conceptual proliferation in the generation of suffering, the 
        benefits of a meditation which can quell thought are not restricted to 
        short term psychological ease. We have met such a meditation before.</SPAN></P>

        should be developed to cut off thinking.</SPAN></I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">’<A HREF="#_edn12" NAME="_ednref12" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[12]</SPAN></SPAN></A></SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">It was seen above how perception 
        simplifies experience into meaningful units. This essential function is 
        undermined when proliferative thinking re-multiplies experience, so that 
        just one word can trigger minutes or hours of discursive inner 
        monologue. The special quality of mindfulness of breathing, shared to 
        some degree with other meditation subjects, is to cut this process 
        before it sprouts by staying with singleness of perception. When 
        disciplined through meditation, the simplifying function of perception 
        radically reduces the quantity of data in experience, allowing the 
        development of a more refined and sensitive awareness.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">What exactly is the ‘breath’? 
        There is a certain experience at the beginning of each breath, a 
        different experience in the middle, and yet another at the end. These 
        experiences are simply awareness of the air element; but it is 
        perception that marks them off as the ‘breath’. Only the physical impact 
        of the air on the nerve endings is registered by body consciousness. 
        That body consciousness ‘reports’ to mind consciousness, which performs 
        the more sophisticated cognitive tasks such as recognition, 
        interpretation, and so on. The function of <I>vitakka</I> to initiate 
        thoughts and <I>vicara</I> to sustain chains of thoughts is transformed 
        by applying them not to perceptions of verbal constructs but to 
        perceptions of the breath, actively directing the mind away from the 
        diversity of sense experience onto the breath. Doing so over and over, 
        the common features of the breaths become apparent. By combining the 
        shared features of the breaths recognized by perception and by ignoring 
        irrelevant data, the mind forms a stable and coherent concept or mental 
        image of the breath. As contemplation deepens, the physical breath 
        becomes very fine, so that its impact, originally overpowering, fades 
        and the settling mind gains more appreciation of the subtle mind 
        consciousness. Here, the meditator is going beyond the first four steps 
        of mindfulness of breathing which fall within body contemplation. A 
        numinous rapture arises; the mind floats up like a balloon relieved of 
        its ballast as the heavy burden of the body is disappearing. The subtle 
        reflection of the mind in the breath is now almost the sole object in 
        awareness. This refined concept, because of ignoring fluctuations in 
        detail, has an enduring quality which outlives the changing physical 
        phenomena it is derived from, in just the same way than the concept of 
        ‘self’ has an enduring quality which outlives the body.<A HREF="#_edn13" NAME="_ednref13" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[13]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        It normally appears to the meditator as a brilliant light of awesome 
        power, yet exquisite refinement. As the fluctuations in consciousness 
        even out, change fades away. One need no longer rely on memories of past 
        experiences to interpret the present moment. The contrast on which time 
        depends is not evident, and past and future disappear in the seamless 
        flow of the present: one-pointedness in time. The contents of experience 
        become so rarified that signs and summaries are rendered superfluous. A 
        deeper mode of knowing emerges.</SPAN></P>

        occurrence in the <I>suttas</I> indicates that they should not be 
        dismissed lightly. They include such important psychic powers as the 
        ability to recollect one’s past lives and to see how beings are reborn 
        according to their actions. These confirm through personal experience 
        the truth of action and rebirth, which constitutes non-transcendental 
        right view. This will ripen into the transcendental right view of the 
        four noble truths &#8209; how the process of rebirth works and how to bring it 
        to an end. These are distinct kinds of knowledge; but the clearer is the 
        knowledge of the details of rebirth, the easier will be the 
        understanding of the principles of rebirth. The practice of <I>jhana</I> 
        will naturally lead to this kind of understanding by demonstrating how 
        the mind can exist quite happily when relieved of the burden of the 
        body. Perhaps this may explain the intriguing reports of near-death 
        experiences &#8209; being drawn down a tunnel of light, meeting heavenly 
        beings, feeling great bliss &#8209; which are so similar to experiences 
        commonly met with on the threshold of <I>jhana</I>. To get into <I>jhana</I>, 
        one has to die to the body.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">It was also noted above how the 
        ability of the mind to form concepts is the basis of both the idea of 
        ‘self’ and the attainment of <I>jhana</I>. As the unseen seer, the ‘lord 
        of the city in the center at the crossroads’, the mind is the prime 
        resort of the ‘self’. Mind consciousness plays a role in the processing 
        of all the other kinds of consciousness, and therefore can easily be 
        mistaken for a permanent substratum of experience. Further, as it is 
        within the mind that the idea of ‘self’ is born, when the mind is 
        seeking for some aspect of experience to appropriate as ‘self’, it is 
        automatically prone to turn back in on itself rather than seek outside. 
        So we have seen that freedom from attachment to the mind is the 
        exclusive province of the noble ones. For those who start practice with 
        wrong views, then, the mind in jhana becomes the obvious locus for 
        theories of the self. But one who starts practice with right view will 
        instead use their <I>jhana</I> as a basis for insight into the nature of 
        awareness.</SPAN></P>

        Five coarse kinds of consciousness have disappeared, leaving only the 
        purified mind consciousness. Here, consciousness is directly accessible

        like a butterfly flitting in the twilight gloom of the forest, but 
        gazing at it face to face for a long time, like a butterfly caught and 
        pinned down under a brilliant light. Before, the ‘self’ could always 
        shift its ground when challenged. But now it is like an army in retreat, 
        besieged and surrounded in just one city. With nowhere to run, it cannot 
        hold out long. Soon the victorious army of insight will scale the walls 
        and storm the last stronghold of the self: consciousness itself. But why
