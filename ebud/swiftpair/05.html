        is a practical exemplification of the path described above in abstract. 
        Since it is an example, not a universal principle, it will naturally 
        admit of some variation when applied to the complexities of the real 
        world. Certainly not all practitioners will accomplish everything 
        described here; for example, it is not necessary to develop psychic 
        powers. Nevertheless, the prominence of the gradual training and its 
        central role in displaying the detailed workings of the path lend it 
        great authority. Indeed, development of all the key factors of the 
        gradual training is necessary in order to abandon suffering.<A HREF="#_edn1" NAME="_ednref1" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[1]</SPAN></SPAN></A>

        none can rival the <I>Samannaphala</I> <I>Sutta</I>. This very long 
        discourse is the record of a conversation between the Buddha and the 
        newly crowned King Ajatasattu. This is a truly regal discourse, a 
        literary classic, and a tragedy of Oedipal proportions; and yet the 
        desperate psychological struggle of the king remains in the background, 
        barely hinted at in the discourse. Unfortunately there is no room for a 
        proper translation here, so we must remain content with an abridgement. 
        The king, tormented by remorse over a terrible crime, asks the Buddha 
        about happiness.</SPAN></P>

        point out such a fruit of the contemplative life apparent here and now, 
        pertaining to this life?’</SPAN></P>

        deities and humans, enlightened, blessed. He makes known this world with 
        its deities, Maras, and Brahmas, this generation with its contemplatives 
        and brahmans, princes and people, having witnessed it himself with 
        direct knowledge. He teaches the Dhamma, beautiful in the beginning, 
        beautiful in the middle, beautiful in the end, meaningful and well

        absolutely fulfilled and purified as a polished shell. What if I were to 
        shave off my hair and beard, put on the dyed robe and go forth from the 
        home to homelessness?” And after some time, having abandoned a small or

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">King Ajatasattu is an archetype 
        for the dilemmas of worldly people searching for inner peace. He 
        obviously had great spiritual potential, and respect for those pursuing 
        the path of renunciation. But, goaded on by the evil monk Devadatta, he 
        had murdered his father King Bimbisara, a stream-enterer, for the sake 
        of the throne, thus destroying his chance of seeing the <I>Dhamma</I>. 
        It is because of the inevitable conflict between worldly ambitions and 
        spiritual aspirations that the Buddha laid such stress on the way of 
        renunciation. The gradual training is the key paradigm for monastic 
        practice. Such meticulous care and attention to refinement of conduct, 
        seclusion, restraint, contentment, and discipline, day in day out, year 
        in year out, provides the optimum supporting conditions for the refined 
        states of mind that lead to liberation. So close was the connection 
        between meditation and the life of seclusion in the forest that often 
        they were virtually equated, as in the Buddha’s critique of the brahmans 
        which follows, so sadly prophetic of the course Buddhism was to take. 
        There is a pun in the Pali: the word for scholar (<I>ajjhayaka</I>) also 
        means ‘non-<I>jhana</I> meditator’.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">‘They made leaf huts in the 
        forest and practiced jhana in them. They went to the city or village to 
        gather alms... and then returned to their huts to practice jhana. People 
        saw this and noticed how they meditated so they introduced the title 
        “jhana meditator” for them... But some of them, being unable to do 
        jhana, settled around towns and villages and composed scriptures. People 
        saw them doing this and not meditating, so they introduced the title 
        “scholars” for them... At that time it was regarded as a low 
        designation, but now it is the higher</SPAN></I><SPAN LANG="EN-US">.’<A HREF="#_edn5" NAME="_ednref5" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[5]</SPAN></SPAN></A></SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">However, the Buddha never 
        insisted that his followers must leave the lay life. As in all things, 
        he relied on the maturity of the individual to choose the appropriate 
        course of action. For those who choose to remain in the household life, 
        he would point out how to live that life well, to restrain the 
        defilements, and to incline gradually towards <I>Dhamma</I>. What lay 
        people should not do is to try to incline the <I>Dhamma</I> gradually 
        towards lay-life, watering down the teachings and making renunciation 
        seem like unnecessary complication.</SPAN></P>
