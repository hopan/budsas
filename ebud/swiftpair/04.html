        <SPAN STYLE="font-size: 14.0pt; color: navy">Causality</SPAN></B></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">I have coined the term ‘dependent liberation’ for 
        this doctrinal framework, elsewhere known as ‘transcendental dependent 
        origination’. Many versions occur in the <I>suttas</I>, but with a 
        common pattern, displaying the conditional unfolding of liberation as an 
        evolution of ever more refined qualities. All of the variations follow 
        the sequence virtue, <I>samadhi</I>, wisdom. Often these broad 
        categories are subdivided, revealing their inner structure as comprised 
        of further conditional sequences. Such passages as the above, which 
        treat the <I>samadhi</I> section in most detail, occur throughout the <I>
        suttas</I>. An important version explicating the virtue section is given 
        below, starting with ‘mindfulness and clear comprehension’. Variations 
        of this version occur often, but only in the <I>Anguttara</I> <I>Nikaya</I>, 
        reflecting the pragmatic orientation of that collection. Wisdom is 
        highlighted in the seven purifications.</P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">Some understanding of the principles of causality 
        is helpful to fully appreciate the significance of this teaching. Causes 
        can be analysed as two kinds: necessary conditions and sufficient 
        conditions. A necessary condition is one whose absence makes it 
        impossible for the result to occur. For example, a necessary condition 
        for being a woman is being a human being; if one is not a human being, 
        it is impossible to be a woman. A sufficient condition is one whose 
        presence makes it inevitable that the result will occur. For example, a 
        sufficient condition for being a human being is being a woman; if one is 
        a woman, it definitely follows that one is a human being. The two need 
        not, as in the examples above, be exclusive. For example, a necessary 
        and sufficient condition for being a human being is being a featherless 
        biped; if one is not a featherless biped, one cannot be a human being 
        and if one is a featherless biped, it definitely follows that one is a 
        human being. Or a condition may be neither necessary nor sufficient. For 
        example, being a boy is neither necessary nor sufficient condition for 
        becoming an adult human being, but merely conducive.</P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">This distinction is critical. If in the 
        thought-world of the <I>suttas</I> ‘x is a condition for y’ means ‘x is 
        a sufficient condition for y’, this leaves open the question whether 
        other things may also be sufficient. Virtue, samadhi, and understanding 
        lead to <I>Nibbana</I>; but there may be another, or a myriad of other 
        paths up the same mountain. If however, ‘x is a condition for y’ means 
        ‘x is a necessary condition for y’, we must regard all ‘x’ -- each of 
        the factors subsumed within such a causal relationship -- as being 
        indispensable. One mountain, one path. The general formula for causality 
        in dependent origination, known as ‘specific conditionality’, is this:</P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I>‘When this exists, that is; due to the arising 
        of this, that arises.</I></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I>‘When this does not exist, that is not; due to 
        the cessation of this, that ceases</I>.<A HREF="#_edn2" NAME="_ednref2" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[2]</SPAN></SPAN></A></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">The first pair of principles appears to imply 
        sufficient conditionality. However, a close contextual examination 
        reveals that this is not so.</P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I>‘That noble disciple, content with the virtues 
        beloved of the noble ones, does not try further for seclusion by day and 
        retreat by night. Abiding thus negligent, gladness does not arise. When 
        there is no gladness, there is no rapture. When there is no rapture, 
        there is no tranquillity. When there is no tranquillity, he abides in 
        suffering. The mind of one who suffers does not enter samadhi. Dhammas 
        do not manifest in a mind without samadhi. Because dhammas do not 
        manifest he is called an abider in negligence</I>.<A HREF="#_edn3" NAME="_ednref3" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[3]</SPAN></SPAN></A></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">If such sequences were based on sufficient 
        conditionality, there would be no point in making an effort. Further, 
        the phrase ‘feeling is the condition for craving’ would render the holy 
        life ineffectual. There are in fact many conditions left un-stated in 
        these contexts. The <I>suttas</I> make no claim to completeness rather 
        than usefulness in their analysis of causality. In the context of 
        practice, sufficiency applies only in that a noble disciple must 
        eventually attain liberation even if, as above, they are ‘mightily 
        negligent’.<A HREF="#_edn4" NAME="_ednref4" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[4]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        The second pair of clauses are explicitly identified as necessity:</P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I>‘If there were not the birth of those various 
        kinds of beings into the various states [of existence]; when all kinds 
        of birth do not exist, due to the cessation of birth, would aging and 
        death be found?’</I></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I>‘No Bhante</I>.’<A HREF="#_edn5" NAME="_ednref5" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[5]</SPAN></SPAN></A></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">Below we shall see the kinship between dependent 
        origination and dependent liberation, like an image and its reflection, 
        expressed in various ways in the <I>suttas</I>. All the main similes 
        illustrating dependent liberation likewise imply necessity -- the rain 
        filling the mountain streams, the leaves sustaining the tree, or each 
        stage of a journey bringing one to the next.<A HREF="#_edn6" NAME="_ednref6" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[6]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        This means that these passages embody an invariable law of nature: 
        unless these conditions are fulfilled, it is impossible that the result 
        can occur.</P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">Our first passage above, however, shows a more 
        active process than mere necessity, a vigorous positive inducement. The 
        main emphasis is not that the absence of the conditions immediately 
        destroys the resultant phenomena, but that without the supporting 
        conditions the results are not nourished to fulfilment and completion. 
        Although this does not apply to all causal relationships found in the <I>
        suttas</I>, it is an important aspect of the contexts dealing with 
        practice -- they have a direction, a forward impetus. Following the way 
        of the world, the sequence of dependent origination starting with 
        ignorance, one is swept along the stream of birth, aging, and death. But 
        the sequence starting with faith and virtue will sweep one along to <I>
        Nibbana</I>.</P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">Some writers have tried to reduce Buddhist 
        conditionality to the ‘mutuality condition’, that is, when two factors 
        act as a mutual support for each other, as when two sheaves of straw 
        lean against one another. But this type of condition, though important, 
        is restricted to a few contexts. In many contexts, this relation is 
        expressly denied.<A HREF="#_edn7" NAME="_ednref7" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[7]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        It would be difficult to establish from the <I>suttas</I> that the 
        normal expressions for conditional relations can mean, in and of 
        themselves, co nascent (or 'mutuality') condition. The few occasions 
        where such a relation is discussed emphasize how abstruse and unusual 
        this was regarded.<A HREF="#_edn8" NAME="_ednref8" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[8]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        And even here the standard conditional clause does not alone bear the 
        burden of expressing two-way conditionality. Co nascence is explained 
        instead with two separate mirror image statements of one-way 
        conditionality.</P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">This lack of full mutuality is explicitly affirmed 
        in the relationship between samadhi and wisdom. In the <I>Potthapada</I>
        <I>Sutta</I>, the Buddha first describes ‘perception’ in terms of the 
        successive refinement of perception through the jhanas leading to 
        insight knowledge. Perception deals with how things seem; knowledge with 
        how they are.</P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I>‘But Bhante, does perception arise first and 
        knowledge afterwards, or does knowledge arise first and perception 
        afterwards?’</I></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I>‘Perception, Potthapada, arises first, knowledge 
        afterwards; due to the arising of perception there is the arising of 
        knowledge. One understands thus: “It seems that my knowledge arose due 
        to that condition</I>.”<A HREF="#_edn9" NAME="_ednref9" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[9]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        I</P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">This is like a mother's relationship with her 
        child. A child as they mature may give their mother as much support and 
        help as they are able, but can never repay the gift of life. Similarly, 
        wisdom can act as a supporting condition to deepen clarity of awareness, 
        but can only see its way to do so dependent on clarity already present.</P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">Three main modes of the wisdom which precedes <I>
        samadhi</I> can be discerned. Firstly, conceptual understanding from 
        hearing and reflecting on the teachings. Second, investigation into the 
        causes of samadhi. Third, <I>vipassana</I> proper -- the clear-eyed 
        discernment of conditioned reality. Now obviously these three aspects 
        are closely linked, and the mention of any one of them is a particular 
        context should normally understood by way of emphasis, not exclusion. A 
        thread unifying all these modes is that wisdom is described in some sort 
        of relation to <I>samadhi</I>, not apart from it. This preliminary 
        understanding serves various preparatory functions, but only with the 
        ripening of the other path factors does it mature into the wisdom that 
        really counts – ‘knowledge and vision in accordance with reality’. The 
        prevailing general paradigm -- that clarity of awareness is necessary 
        for understanding -- for all its vagueness of application elsewhere, 
        assumes in this highest sense a rigorous invariability.</P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I>‘It is, monks, just like a house with a peaked 
        roof. As long as the roof peak has not been set in place, the rafters 
        are not steady, not stable. But when the roof peak has been set in 
        place, then the rafters are steady and stable. So too, as long as noble 
        knowledge has not arisen in the noble disciple, the </I>[other]<I> four 
        spiritual faculties are not steady, not stable. But when noble knowledge 
        has arisen in the noble disciple, the </I>[other]<I> four spiritual 
        faculties are steady and stable</I>.’<A HREF="#_edn10" NAME="_ednref10" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[10]</SPAN></SPAN></A></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">The rafters of faith, energy, mindfulness, and 
        samadhi must be set up before the roof peak of noble understanding can 
        be set in place. They are the necessary antecedent conditions for 
        liberating wisdom. Understanding in its turn fortifies and firmly fixes 
        the four already existing faculties. This kind of ‘feedback loop’ may 
        have quite a general application -- any subsequent quality can 
        strengthen previously developed qualities. However, this should not 
        distract from the prevailing paradigm of sequential conditions.</P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I>‘That one could fulfil the aggregate of 
        understanding without having fulfilled the aggregate of samadhi: that is 
        not possible</I>.’<A HREF="#_edn11" NAME="_ednref11" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[11]</SPAN></SPAN></A></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">The Buddha did not teach causality with such 
        philosophical pleasantries as ‘Everything is interrelated.’ He taught 
        specific conditionality -- this is the cause of that. The same patterns 
        occur over and over. Craving is the cause of suffering; but just as the 
        lotus grows in the mud, the experience of suffering is the essential 
        motivation for the spiritual practice which will end suffering.</P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">In the <I>Upanisa</I> <I>Sutta</I>, the connection 
        between the normal dependent origination and the liberating sequence is 
        made explicit.<A HREF="#_edn12" NAME="_ednref12" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[12]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        The sequence starts out as usual with ignorance leading up to birth and 
        suffering; but suffering gives rise not to despair, but to faith. This 
        is the difference made by paying attention to the root. In the spiritual 
        faculties, virtue is included in faith.<A HREF="#_edn13" NAME="_ednref13" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[13]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        This emotional conviction then triggers the same sequence of joy, 
        rapture, tranquillity, bliss, <I>samadhi</I>, insight, and release that 
        was described above beginning with virtue. The sequence of twelve 
        factors, beginning with suffering, is the positive counterpart of the 
        twelve factors of the cessation mode of the normal dependent 
        origination. Intriguingly, dependent origination in the mode of 
        origination is called ‘the wrong way of practice’, just as the wrong 
        eightfold path, while the mode of cessation is called ‘the right way of 
        practice’, just as the right eightfold path. This collapses the 
        distinction between theory and practice, between the middle teaching and 
        the middle way.<A HREF="#_edn14" NAME="_ednref14" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[14]</SPAN></SPAN></A></P>

        also describes the ending of suffering in positive terms, by focussing 
        on two kinds of arahants. The first is ‘released by understanding’. Here 
        this is described as understanding the origin, ending, gratification, 
        danger, and escape in the case of the seven stations of consciousness 
        and two bases. These are all planes into which rebirth can occur 
        depending on the level of development of consciousness, with particular 
        emphasis on meditative attainments. Here the identity is clear between 
        consciousness as a link in dependent origination, as the mind states 
        developed in meditation, and as the stream of consciousness flowing on 
        to rebirth in the various worlds. The second kind of <I>arahant</I> is 
        the ‘both sides released’, who is distinguished by fluency in all the 
        meditative attainments. Thus the transparent mind of <I>samadhi</I> has 
        a key role throughout in unravelling the tangle of <I>samsara</I>.</P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><I>‘This dependent origination is profound, and 
        appears profound. Not awakening to and not penetrating this principle, 
        this generation has become like a tangled ball of string, matted like a 
        bird’s nest, entangled like a mass of coarse grass, and does not evolve 
        beyond lower realms, bad destinies, the abyss, and samsara</I>.’<A HREF="#_edn16" NAME="_ednref16" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[16]</SPAN></SPAN></A></P>

        suffering. Therefore with the breaking up of the body, the sage does not 
        pass on to a </I>[new]<I> body. He is released from birth, aging, death, 
        sorrow, lamentation, bodily pain, mental suffering, and despair; he is

        Its application in this context is illustrated in the <I>
        Mahatahasankhaya</I> <I>Sutta</I>. This is one of the most important 
        discourses on dependent origination, set up specifically to refute the 
        view that it is this ‘very same consciousness’ which fares on through 
        the round of rebirths. It is one of the contexts which suggests that the 
        word ‘consciousness’ was established pre-Buddhist parlance for the 
        principle underlying rebirth. As he often did, the Buddha accepted the 
        conventional terminology, but redefined it according to his own system, 
        insisting that consciousness arises according to conditions. We should 
        note that although consciousness is the normal term used in the context 
        of rebirth, this does not imply that it flows on alone, without the 
        support of <SPAN LANG="EN-US">mentality and physical form.<A HREF="#_edn19" NAME="_ednref19" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[19]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        Rather, consciousness is mentioned as it is of key importance here; it 
        is the ‘seed’ that performs the decisive function of transferring the 
        information necessary to establish the new organism. The Buddha adopted 
        not only terminology but also a brahmanical idea that reincarnation of 
        the embryo occurs concurrent with three things: the coming together of 
        the mother and father; the mother is fertile; and the being to be reborn 
        is present.<A HREF="#_edn20" NAME="_ednref20" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[20]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        Having taken rebirth, one is nourished by the mother, plays childish 
        games, and, as the sense faculties mature, engages in favoring and 
        opposing feelings, giving rise to craving and future rebirth. The round 
        of cessation is shown with the full gradual training, from the 
        appearance of the <I>Tathagata</I> and the going forth, to the

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">The commentaries treat ‘knowledge and vision in

        be so, since vipassana may be developed prior to <I>jhana</I>. 
        ‘Knowledge and vision in accordance with reality’ regularly refers not 
        to <I>vipassana</I> but to the stream-enterer’s ‘vision of the <I>
        Dhamma’</I>. <I>Vipassana</I> as such seems to be one of the un-stated 
        but implied factors in such sequences. Perhaps the advanced <I>vipassana</I> 
        which, empowered by <I>samadhi</I>, issues directly in penetration can 
        be included as a preliminary stage of ‘knowledge and vision in 
        accordance with reality’. In any case, this passage is a strong support 
        for the necessity of <I>jhana</I> for stream-entry. It may not, however, 
        in and of itself confirm the necessity of <I>jhana</I> for those on the 
        way to stream-entry, since they may not unambiguously possess ‘knowledge 
        and vision in accordance with reality’.</P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">More on these path-attainers below.</P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">This passage further clarifies two points in the 
        interpretation of other descriptions of dependent liberation or the path 
        in general. Firstly, <I>samadhi</I> as a crucial support for liberation 
        means right <I>samadhi</I>, which is the four <I>jhanas</I>. When we 
        came across other descriptions of the path that refer to or imply <I>
        samadhi</I> in less explicit terms, we can therefore infer that <I>jhana</I> 
        is meant. The sequence gladness, rapture, tranquillity, bliss, and 
        samadhi in fact normally serves to introduce the four <I>jhanas</I>;<A HREF="#_edn23" NAME="_ednref23" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[23]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        sometimes too the divine abidings;<A HREF="#_edn24" NAME="_ednref24" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[24]</SPAN></SPAN></A>

        Secondly, this right <I>samadhi</I> is an essential component of the 
        path, not an optional extra. In contexts such as the gradual training, 
        which include extras such as psychic powers, we must therefore 
        understand that <I>samadhi</I>, no less than virtue or wisdom, cannot be 
        skipped over.</P>

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">The seven purifications shed further light on 
        ‘dependent liberation’. They occur only once in the <I>suttas</I>, and 
        once again with two further purifications added, and are not analysed in 
        detail. Although of slight importance in the <I>suttas</I>, they were 
        utilized as the framework of the <I>Visuddhimagga</I>, thus assuming 
        great importance for the <I>Theravadin</I> exegetical tradition. Here 
        virtue and <I>samadhi</I> are treated summarily, the focus being on a

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">In this sequence, purification of view is the

        Purification of view in this group of four occupies the same place as, 
        in the seven purifications, purification of view, of overcoming 
        uncertainty, and of knowledge and vision of what is and what is not the 
        path. These correspond exactly with the three fetters abandoned by the 
        stream-enterer -- identity view, doubt, and misapprehension of virtue 
        and vows. A possible reading is that these three purifications 
        constitute an expanded explanation of purification of view, detailing 
        the sequence in which these fetters are abandoned during the course of 
        vipassana culminating in the vision of the four noble truths. Having 
        clearly seen what the path is, the stream-enterer is in a position to 
        perfect their purification of knowledge and vision of the way. This 
        occupies the equivalent position in this sequence as do ‘repulsion’ and 
        ‘fading away’ elsewhere. We noted earlier that these pertain exclusively 
        to the noble stages; and in the above passage too, the text changes from 
        ‘monk’ to ‘noble disciple’ for the final purification, the fading away 
        of lust after seeing the four noble truths.<A HREF="#_edn29" NAME="_ednref29" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[29]</SPAN></SPAN></A>

        The commentarial notion that these seven stages are completed by the 
        stream-enterer, and that the higher path attainers go around again, each 
        time repeating the sequence of <I>vipassana</I> knowledges,<A HREF="#_edn31" NAME="_ednref31" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[31]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        finds no support in the <I>suttas</I> and contradicts the basic texts 
        and similes, which speak of a one-way, step by step progression. The 
        purpose of developing purification of knowledge and vision is not for 
        the further purification of insight through the higher paths, but for 
        final <I>Nibbana</I> without grasping. Now it is true that in real life 
        things are not so straightforward, and Buddhist causality hinges on 
        these ramified complexities. But this does not empower us to simply 
        postulate interpretive paradigms without a textual basis. Such sequences 
        express the primary conditional sequence of practice, to which other 
        elements -- supplementary factors, feedback loops, etc. -- should be 
        considered as subordinate. This interpretation is somewhat complicated 
        by the nine purifications mentioned in the <I>Dasuttara</I> <I>Sutta</I>, 
        which add purification of understanding and purification of release to 
        the seven.<A HREF="#_edn32" NAME="_ednref32" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[32]</SPAN></SPAN></A> 
        These two extras, occurring only in this late and formalistic <I>sutta</I>, 
        may perhaps be read as an expanded explanation of purification of 
        knowledge and vision. The exact interpretation of the stages of 
        liberating insight, though, does not affect the necessity for <I>jhana</I> 
        as the purification of mind that precedes all these stages.</P>

        saw the beginning, the danger, the escape, and knowledge and vision of 
        what is and what is not the path. For him, because of seeing these 
        things, the attainment of the goal, the peace of the heart, is known.’

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">So this knowledge involves developing insight into 
        samadhi based on direct experience. The seven purifications thus involve 
        samadhi, not simply as the precondition for insight at purification of 
        mind, but at each step of the development of insight, specifically 
        including the stages of insight pertaining to stream-entry.</P>

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">In this chapter we have delved into the nature of 
        the conditional relations governing the path of practice. The path 
        embodies the principles of the <I>Dhamma</I> in practical form. The 
        practice and theory of <I>Dhamma</I> can only be provisionally 
        separated; for the sincere practitioner their every moment is a 
        reflection of <I>Dhamma</I>. The serenity they find in their daily life 
        and in their meditation is the experiential proof of the drying up of 
        the flood of defilements. The next chapter shows how these principles 
        find expression in a life of contemplative simplicity.</P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal">‘When the sky pours down rain in big drops on the 
        mountaintop, the water flows down and fills the mountain cracks and 
        crevices. When the mountain cracks and crevices are full, they fill the 
        little pools. When the little pools are full, they fill the great pools. 
        When the great pools are full, they fill the little rivers. When the 
        little rivers are full, they fill the great rivers. When the great 
        rivers are full, they fill the mighty ocean.’<A HREF="#_edn37" NAME="_ednref37" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[37]</SPAN></SPAN></A></P>
