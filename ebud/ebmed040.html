    <p>In meditation we can be alert, attentive; it's like
    listening, being with the moment as it is -- just listening.
    Now see if you can hear the primordial sound. It is like a
    high pitch -- it is quite difficult to describe really. Even
    if you plug your ears, put your fingers against your ears, or
    if you are underwater in a swimming pool or under the sea,
    you can hear it. It is a background sound, not dependent upon
    the ears, because when they are bunged up there is still this
    high-pitched, vibrating sound. We can use this in meditation,
    because what we are doing now is learning how to observe the
    way it is; that which we can experience which we can notice
    and be aware of -- even bad thoughts and bad moods can be
    used, rather than just rejected.</p>
    <p>What we are doing is bringing into awareness the way it
    is, noticing space and form, emptiness and form; the
    unconditioned and the conditioned. We can see this as the
    archetypal symbol: the male - the female; the space - the
    form.</p>
    <p>For example, we begin to notice the space in this room.
    Most people probably wouldn't notice the space, they would
    notice the things; they would notice the people, the walls,
    the floor, the shrine, the furniture. But to notice the
    space, what do you do? You withdraw your attention from the
    things, and bring your attention just to the space. This is
    not getting rid of the things, nor denying the things in the
    room -- their right to be here; it is merely not
    concentrating on them, not going from one thing to another.</p>
    <p>Beginning to notice the space around people is a very
    different way of looking at somebody, isn't it? We look at
    the space around them rather than looking at them. This is a
    way of beginning to open oneself. When one has a spacious
    mind, then there is room for everything. When one has a
    narrow mind, then there is only room for a few things;
    everything has to be manipulated and controlled, so that you
    have only what you think is right -- what you want is there
    -- and everything else has to be pushed out. Now life on that
    level is always suppressed and constricted; it is always a
    struggle -- there is always tension to keep every thing in
    order all the time. If you have got just a very narrow view
    of life, the disorder of life always has to be ordered for
    you, so you are always busy, manipulating the mind, pushing
    things out or holding on to things. This is the <b><i>dukkha</i></b><i>
    </i>of ignorance, which comes from not understanding things.</p>
    <p>Now the spacious mind has room for everything. It is like
    the space in this room, which is never harmed by what goes in
    and out of this room. In fact, we say 'the space in this
    room', but actually the room is <b><i>in the space</i></b>;
    the building is in the space. When the building has gone the
    space will still be here. So we can have a perspective, we
    have the actual walls and the shape of the room, and the
    space. Right now we can see the limit of this room, and the
    space of this room is contained by the limits of this
    building.</p>
    <p>Space is something that we tend not to notice, because it
    doesn't grasp our attention, does it? It is not like a
    beautiful flower something really beautiful, or something
    really horrible -- which pulls your attention right to it.
    You can be completely mesmerised in an instant by something
    exciting, fascinating, horrible or terrible; but you can't do
    that with space, can you? To notice space you have to calm
    down -- you have to contemplate it.</p>
    <p>This is because spaciousness is not extreme, it has no
    extreme qualities. It is just spacious, whereas flowers can
    be extremely beautiful, with beautiful bright reds and
    oranges and purples, beautiful shapes -- extremely beautiful
    shapes -- that are just so dazzling to our minds. Our
    something else can be really ugly and disgusting.</p>
    <p>But space is not dazzling, it is not disgusting, and yet
    without space there would not be anything else; we couldn't
    see. If you had just this room, and filled it up with things
    so it became solid, or filled it up with cement -- a big
    cement block -- there'd be no space left in this room. Then,
    of course, you couldn't have beautiful flowers or anything
    else; it would just be a big block. It would be useless,
    wouldn't it? So we need both; we need to appreciate the form
    and the space, because they are the perfect couple, the true
    marriage, perfect harmony -- space and form. We contemplate
    this, we reflect, and from this comes wisdom. We know how
    things are, rather than always trying to create things the
    way we might want them to be.</p>
    <p>Now apply this to the mind. Use the 'I' consciousness to
    see space as an object to the 'I'. We can see that mentally
    there are the thoughts, emotions -- the mental conditions --
    that arise and cease. Usually we are dazzled, repelled or
    just bound by the thoughts and emotions; we go from one thing
    to another -- trying to get rid of them or reacting,
    controlling and manipulating them. So we never have any
    perspective in our lives, we just become obsessed with
    repression and indulgence; we are caught in those two
    extremes.</p>
    <p>With meditation we have the opportunity to contemplate the
    mind. The silence of the mind is like the space in the room;
    it is always there, but it is subtle. It doesn't stand out,
    it doesn't grab your attention. It has no extreme quality
    which would stimulate and grasp your attention, so you have
    to pay attention, you have to be attentive. Now one can use
    the sound of silence (or the primordial sound, sound of the
    mind, or whatever you want to call it) very skilfully, by
    bringing it up, paying attention to it. By concentrating your
    attention on that for a while, it becomes something that you
    can really begin to know. It is the mode of knowing in which
    one can reflect. It's not a concentrated state you absorb
    into, it's not a suppressive kind of concentration. The mind
    is concentrated in a state of balance and openness, rather
    than absorbed into an object, so that one can actually think
    and use that as a way of seeing things in perspective --
    letting things go.</p>
    <p>Now I really want you to investigate this so that you
    begin to see how to let go of things rather than just have
    the idea that you <b><i>should</i></b> let go of things. You
    might come away from this retreat with the idea that you
    should let go of things. Then, when you can't let go of
    things, you'd start thinking, &quot;I can't let go of
    things,&quot; -- but that is another ego problem that you
    have created. &quot;Only others can let go, but I can't let
    go. I <b><i>should</i></b><i> </i>let go -- Venerable Sumedho
    said everybody should let go.&quot; But that very simple
    thing is another &quot;I am&quot;, isn't it?</p>
    <p>Now you can take that simple thing and begin to notice,
    reflect and contemplate the space around those two words;
    rather than looking for something else, you just sustain
    attention on the space around those two words. It's like
    looking at the space in this room; you don't go looking for
    the space, do you? 'Where is the space in this room?'
    thinking, 'I am looking for the space in this room, have you
    seen it?' What do you do? You look at it; you are open to it
    because it is here all the time. It is not anything you are
    going to find in the cupboard or in the next room or under
    the floor. It is right here now -- so you open, you begin to
    notice.</p>
    <p>If you are still concentrated on the curtains, or the
    window or the people, you don't notice the space. But
    actually you don't have to get rid of all those things to
    notice the space; instead you begin just to open to the
    space, to notice it. Rather than focusing your attention on
    one thing, you are opening the mind completely; you are not
    choosing an object -- a conditioned object -- but the space
    where the conditioned objects are.</p>
    <p>It's the same with the mind, you can apply that inwardly.
    When your eyes are closed, you are not looking at something,
    but it is like listening to the inner voices that go on --
    those things that say, 'I am this, I should not be like
    that'... you use those for taking you to the space, rather
    than making a big problem about the obsessions and fears that
    go on in your mind. In this way, even the devil, or an evil
    thought, can take you to emptiness.</p>
    <p>This is very skilful, because it is no longer a battle
    where we are trying to get rid of evil and kill off the
    devil. It is letting the devil have his due. The devil is an
    impermanent thing it rises and ceases in the mind -- so you
    don't have to making anything out of it. Devil or angels --
    they are all the same really. Before, you'd think, 'devil!'.
    Now trying to get rid of the devil, or trying to grasp hold
    of the angels is<i> </i><b><i>dukkha</i></b><i>. </i>But if
    we take up this cool position of Buddha-knowing -- knowing
    the ways things are -- then everything becomes the truth of
    the way it is. So we see that the good, the bad, the skilful,
    unskilful, or neither skilful or unskilful <b><i>dhammas</i></b><i>
    </i>are all qualities that arise and cease.</p>
    <p>This is what we mean by reflections, beginning to notice
    the way it is. Rather than assuming that it should be any way
    at all, you are simply noticing. So what I am saying now is
    to encourage you to notice -- rather than telling you -- how
    it is. Don't go around saying, 'Venerable Sumedho told us the
    way it is.' I am not trying to convince you of this, but just
    trying to present a way for you to consider, a way of
    reflecting on your own experiences, on your own mind.
    Sometimes if these things are pointed out we begin to notice
    them, like the sound of silence -- you never notice it until
    somebody points it out. It is there all the time, but
    something that you've never really noticed. Because it
    doesn't have any particular quality to it, it doesn't stick
    in the mind as a memory until it is pointed out, and then you
    think, 'Oh yes!'</p>
