      <TD WIDTH="100%"><B></B><FONT SIZE="6">T</FONT>ake a look at the example 
      of the Buddha. Both in his own practice and in his methods for teaching 
      the disciples he was exemplary. The Buddha taught the standards of 
      practice as skillful means for getting rid of conceit, he couldn&#39;t do the 
      practice for us. having heard that teaching we must further teach 
      ourselves, practice for ourselves. The results will arise here, not at the 
      teaching.
      <P>The Buddha&#39;s teaching can only enable us to get an initial 
      understanding of the Dhamma, but the Dhamma is not yet within our hearts. 
      Why not? Because we haven&#39;t yet practiced, we haven&#39;t yet taught 
      ourselves. The Dhamma arises at the practice. If you know it, you know it 
      through the practice. If you doubt it, you doubt it at the practice. 
      Teachings from the Masters may be true, but simply listening to Dhamma is 
      not yet enough to enable us to realize it. The teaching simply points out 
      the way to realize. To realize the Dhamma we must take that teaching and 
      bring it into our hearts. That part which is for the body we apply to the 
      body, that part which is for the speech we apply to the speech, and that 
      part which is for the mind we apply to the mind. This means that after 
      hearing the teaching we must further teach ourselves to know that Dhamma, 
      to be that Dhamma. </P>
      <P>The Buddha said that those who simply believe others are not truly 
      wise. A wise person practices until he is one with the Dhamma, until he 
      can have confidence in himself, independent of others. </P>
      <P>On one occasion, while Venerable Sariputta was sitting, listening 
      respectfully at his feet as the Buddha expounded the Dhamma, the Buddha 
      turned to him and asked, </P>
      <P>&quot;Sariputta, do you believe this teaching?&quot; </P>
      <P>Venerable Sariputta replied, &quot;No, I don&#39;t yet believe it.&quot; </P>
      <P>Now this is a good illustration. Venerable Sariputta listened, and he 
      took note. When he said he didn&#39;t yet believe he wasn&#39;t being careless, he 
      was speaking the truth. He simply took note of that teaching, because he 
      had not yet developed his own understanding of it, so he told the Buddha 
      that he didn&#39;t yet believe -- because he really didn&#39;t believe. These 
      words almost sound as if Venerable Sariputta was being rude, but actually 
      he wasn&#39;t. He spoke the truth, and the Buddha praised him for it. </P>
      <P>&quot;Good, good, Sariputta. A wise person doesn&#39;t readily believe, he 
      should consider first before believing.&quot; </P>
      <P>Conviction in a belief can take various forms. One form reasons 
      according to Dhamma, while another form is contrary to the Dhamma. This 
      second way is heedless, it is a foolhardy understanding, micchaditthi, 
      wrong view. One doesn&#39;t listen to anybody else. </P>
      <P>Take the example of Dighanakha the Brahmin. This Brahmin only believed 
      himself, he wouldn&#39;t believe others. At one time when the Buddha was 
      resting at Rajagaha, Dighanakha went to listen to his teaching. Or you 
      might say that Dighanakha went to teach the Buddha because he was intent 
      on expounding his own views... </P>
      <P>&quot;I am of the view that nothing suits me.&quot; </P>
      <P>This was his view. The Buddha listened to Dighanakha&#39;s view and then 
      answered, </P>
      <P>&quot;Brahmin, this view of yours doesn&#39;t suit you either.&quot; </P>
      <P>When the Buddha had answered in this way, Dighanakha was stumped. He 
      didn&#39;t know what to say. The Buddha explained in many ways, till the 
      Brahmin understood. He stopped to reflect and saw... </P>
      <P>&quot;Hmm, this view of mine isn&#39;t right.&quot; </P>
      <P>On hearing the Buddha&#39;s answer the Brahmin abandoned his conceited 
      views and immediately saw the truth. He changed right then and there, 
      turning right around, just as one would invert one&#39;s hand. He praised the 
      teaching of the Buddha thus: </P>
      <P>&quot;Listening to the Blessed One&#39;s teaching, my mind was illumined, just 
      as one living in darkness might perceive light. My mind is like an 
      overturned basin which has been uprighted, like a man who has been lost 
      and finds the way.&quot; </P>
      <P>Now at that time a certain knowledge arose within his mind, within that 
      mind which had been uprighted. Wrong view vanished and right view took its 
      place. Darkness disappeared and light arose. </P>
      <P>The Buddha declared that the Brahmin Dighanakha was one who had opened 
      the Dhamma Eye. Previously Dighanakha clung to his own views and had no 
      intention of changing them. But when he heard the Buddha&#39;s teaching his 
      mind saw the truth, he saw that his clinging to those views was wrong. 
      When the right understanding arose he was able to perceive his previous 
      understanding as mistaken, so he compared his experience with a person 
      living in darkness who had found light. This is how it is. At that time 
      the Brahmin Dighanakha transcended his wrong view. </P>
      <P>Now we must change in this way. Before we can give up defilements we 
      must change our perspective. We must begin to practice rightly and 
      practice well. Previously we didn&#39;t practice rightly or well, and yet we 
      thought we were right and good just the same. When we really look into the 
      matter we upright ourselves, just like turning over one&#39;s hand. This means 
      that the <I>&quot;One Who Knows,&quot;</I> or wisdom, arises in the mind, so that it 
      is able to see things anew. A new kind of awareness arises. </P>
      <P>Therefore cultivators must practice to develop this knowing, which we 
      call <I>Buddho</I>, the One Who Knows, in their minds. Originally the one 
      who knows is not there, our knowledge is not clear, true or complete. This 
      knowledge is therefore too weak to train the mind. But then the mind 
      changes, or inverts, as a result of this awareness, called wisdom or 
      insight, which exceeds our previous awareness. That previous &quot;one who 
      knows&quot; did not yet know fully and so was unable to bring us to our 
      objective. </P>
      <P>The Buddha therefore taught to look within, opanayiko. Look within, 
      don&#39;t look outwards. Or if you look outwards then look within, to see the 
      cause and effect therein. Look for the truth in all things, because 
      external objects and internal objects are always affecting each other. Our 
      practice is to develop a certain type of awareness until it becomes 
      stronger than our previous awareness. This causes wisdom and insight to 
      arise within the mind, enabling us to clearly know the workings of the 
      mind, the language of the mind and the ways and means of all the 
      defilements. </P>
      <P>The Buddha, when he first left his home in search of liberation, was 
      probably not really sure what to do, much like us. He tried many ways to 
      develop his wisdom. He looked for teachers, such as Udaka Ramaputta, going 
      there to practice meditation... right leg on left leg, right hand on left 
      hand... body erect... eyes closed... letting go of everything... until he 
      was able to attain a high level of <I>absorption samadhi.</I> [1] But when 
      he came out of that <I>samadhi</I> his old thinking came up and he would 
      attach to it just as before. Seeing this, he knew that wisdom had not yet 
      arisen. His understanding had not yet penetrated to the truth, it was 
      still incomplete, still lacking. Seeing this he nonetheless gained some 
      understanding -- that this was not yet the summation of practice -- but he 
      left that place to look for a new teacher. </P>
      <P>When the Buddha left his old teacher he didn&#39;t condemn him, he did as 
      does the bee which takes nectar from the flower without damaging the 
      petals. </P>
      <P>The Buddha then proceeded on to study with Alara Kalama and attained an 
      even higher state of <I>samadhi</I>, but when he came out of that state 
      Bimba and Rahula [2] came back into his thoughts again, the old memories 
      and feelings came up again. He still had lust and desire. Reflecting 
      inward he saw that he still hadn&#39;t reached his goal, so he left that 
      teacher also. He listened to his teachers and did his best to follow their 
      teachings. He continually surveyed the results of his practice, he didn&#39;t 
      simply do things and then discard them for something else. </P>
      <P>Even when it came to ascetic practices, after he had tried them he 
      realized that starving until one is almost skeleton is simply a matter for 
      the body. The body doesn&#39;t know anything. practicing in that way was like 
      executing an innocent person while ignoring the real thief. </P>
      <P>When the Buddha really looked into the matter he saw that practice is 
      not a concern of the body, it is a concern of the mind.<I> 
      Attakilamathanuyogo</I> (self-mortification) -- the Buddha had tried it 
      and found that it was limited to the body. In fact, all Buddhas are 
      enlightened in mind. </P>
      <P>Whether in regard to the body or to the mind, just throw them all 
      together as Transient, Imperfect and Ownerless -- <I>aniccam, dukkham and 
      anatta</I>. They are simply conditions of Nature. They arise depending on 
      supporting factors, exist for a while and then cease. When there are 
      appropriate conditions they arise again; having arisen they exist for a 
      while, then cease once more. These things are not a &quot;self,&quot; a &quot;being,&quot; an 
      &quot;us&quot; or a &quot;them.&quot; There&#39;s nobody there, simply feelings. Happiness has no 
      intrinsic self, suffering has no intrinsic self. No self can be found, 
      there are simply elements of Nature which arise, exist and cease. They go 
      through this constant cycle of change. </P>
      <P>All beings, including humans, tend to see the arising as themselves, 
      the existence as themselves, and the cessation as themselves. Thus they 
      cling to everything. They don&#39;t want things to be the way they are, they 
      don&#39;t want them to be otherwise. For instance, having arisen they don&#39;t 
      want things to cease; having experienced happiness, they don&#39;t want 
      suffering. If suffering does arise they want it to go away as quickly as 
      possible, but even better if it doesn&#39;t arise at all. This is because they 
      see this body and mind as themselves, or belonging to themselves, and so 
      they demand those things to follow their wishes. </P>
      <P>This sort of thinking is like building a dam or a dike without making 
      an outlet to let the water through. The result is that the dam bursts. And 
      so it is with this kind of thinking. The Buddha saw that thinking in this 
      way is the cause of suffering. Seeing this cause, the Buddha gave it up.
      </P>
      <P>This is the Noble Truth of the Cause of Suffering. The Truths of 
      Suffering, its Cause, its Cessation and the Way leading to that 
      Cessation...people are stuck right here. If people are to overcome their 
      doubts it&#39;s right at this point. Seeing that these things are simply rupa 
      and nama, or corporeality and mentality, it becomes obvious that they are 
      not a being, a person, an &quot;us,&quot; or a &quot;them.&quot; They simply follow the laws 
      of Nature. </P>
      <P>Our practice is to know things in this way. We don&#39;t have the power to 
      really control these things, we aren&#39;t really their owners. Trying to 
      control them causes suffering, because they aren&#39;t really ours to control. 
      Neither body nor mind are self or others. If we know this as it really is 
      then we see clearly. We see the truth, we are at one with it. It&#39;s like 
      seeing a lump of red hot iron which has been heated in a furnace. It&#39;s hot 
      all over. Whether we touch it on top, the bottom or the sides it&#39;s hot. No 
      matter where we touch it, it&#39;s hot. This is how you should see things. </P>
      <P>Mostly when we start to practice we want to attain, to achieve, to know 
      and to see, but we don&#39;t yet know what it is we&#39;re going to achieve or 
      know. There was once a disciple of mine whose practice was plagued with 
      confusion and doubts. But he kept practicing, and I kept instructing him, 
      till he began to find some peace. But when he eventually became a bit calm 
      he got caught up in his doubts again, saying, &quot;What do I do next?&quot; There! 
      the confusion arises again. He says he wants peace but when he gets it, he 
      doesn&#39;t want it, he asks what he should do next! </P>
      <P>So in this practice we must do everything with detachment. How are we 
      to detach? We detach by seeing things clearly. Know the characteristics of 
      the body and mind as they are. We meditate in order to find peace, but in 
      doing so we see that which is not peaceful. This is because movement is 
      the nature of the mind. </P>
      <P>When practicing <I>samadhi,</I> we fix our attention on the in and 
      out-breaths at the nose tip or the upper lip. This &quot;lifting&quot; the mind to 
      fix it is called <I>vitakka</I>, or &quot;lifting up.&quot; When we have thus 
      &quot;lifted&quot; the mind and are fixed on an object, this is called <I>vicara</I>, 
      the contemplation of the breath at the nose tip. This quality of <I>vicara</I> 
      will naturally mingle with other mental sensations, and we may think that 
      our mind is not still, that it won&#39;t calm down, but actually this is 
      simply the workings of <I>vicara</I> as it mingles with those sensations. 
      Now if this goes too far in the wrong direction, our mind will lose its 
      collectedness, so then we must set up the mind afresh, lifting it up to 
      the object of concentration with <I>vitakka</I>. As soon as we have thus 
      established our attention <I>vicara</I> takes over, mingling with the 
      various mental sensations. </P>
      <P>Now when we see this happening, our lack of understanding may lead us 
      to wonder: &quot;Why has my mind wandered? I wanted it to be still, why isn&#39;t 
      it still?&quot; This is practicing with attachment. </P>
      <P>Actually the mind is simply following its nature, but we go and add on 
      to that activity by wanting the mind to be still and thinking &quot;Why isn&#39;t 
      it still?&quot; Aversion arises and so we add that on to everything else, 
      increasing our doubts, increasing our suffering and increasing our 
      confusion. So if there is <I>vicara</I>, reflecting on the various 
      happenings within the mind in this way, we should wisely consider...&quot;Ah, 
      the mind is simply like this.&quot; There, that&#39;s the One Who Knows talking, 
      telling you to see things as they are. The mind is simply like this. We 
      let it go at that and the mind becomes peaceful. When it&#39;s no longer 
      centered we bring up <I>vitakka</I> once more, and shortly there is clam 
      again. <I>Vitakka</I> and <I>vicara</I> work together like this. We use <I>
      vicara</I> to contemplate the various sensations which arise. When <I>
      vicara</I> becomes gradually more scattered we once again &quot;lift&quot; our 
      attention with <I>vitakka</I>. </P>
      <P>The important thing here is that our practice at this point must be 
      done with detachment. Seeing the process of <I>vicara</I> interacting with 
      the mental sensations we may think that the mind is confused and become 
      averse to this process. This is the cause right here. We aren&#39;t happy 
      simply because we want the mind to be still. This is the cause -- wrong 
      view. If we correct our view just a little, seeing this activity as simply 
      the nature of mind, just this is enough to subdue the confusion. This is 
      called letting go. </P>
      <P>Now, if we don&#39;t attach, if we practice with &quot;letting go&quot;...detachment 
      within activity and activity within detachment...if we learn to practice 
      like this, then <I>vicara</I> will naturally tend to have less to work 
      with. If our mind ceases to be disturbed, then <I>vicara</I> will incline 
      to contemplating Dhamma, because if we don&#39;t contemplate Dhamma the mind 
      returns to distraction. </P>
      <P>So there is <I>vitakka</I> then <I>vicara</I>, <I>vitakka</I> then <I>
      vicara</I>,<I>vitakka</I> then <I>vicara</I> and so on, until <I>vicara</I> 
      becomes gradually more subtle. At first <I>vicara</I> goes all over the 
      place. When we understand this as simply the natural activity of the mind, 
      it won&#39;t bother us unless we attach to it. It&#39;s like flowing water. If we 
      get obsessed with it, asking &quot;Why does it flow?&quot; then naturally we suffer. 
      If we understand that the water simply flows because that&#39;s its nature 
      then there&#39;s no suffering. <I>Vicara</I> is like this. There is <I>vitakka</I>, 
      then <I>vicara</I>, interacting with mental sensations. We can take these 
      sensations as our object of meditation, calming the mind by noting those 
      sensations. </P>
      <P>If we know the nature of the mind like this then we let go, just like 
      letting the water flow by. <I>Vicara</I> becomes more and more subtle. 
      Perhaps the mind inclines to contemplating the body, or death for 
      instance, or some other theme of Dhamma. When the theme of contemplation 
      is right there will arise a feeling of well-being. What is that 
      well-being? It is <I>piti</I> (rapture). <I>Piti</I>, well-being, arises. 
      It may manifest as goose-pimples, coolness or lightness. The mind is 
      enrapt. This is called <I>piti</I>. There are also pleasures, sukha, the 
      coming and going of various sensations; and the state of <I>ekaggata</I>rammana, 
      or one-pointedness. </P>
      <P>Now if we talk in terms of the first stage of concentration it must be 
      like this: <I>vitakka</I>, <I>vicara</I>, <I>piti</I>, sukha, <I>ekaggata</I>. 
      So what is the second stage like? As the mind becomes progressively more 
      subtle, <I>vitakka</I> and <I>vicara</I> become comparatively coarser, so 
      that they are discarded, leaving only <I>piti</I>, <I>sukha</I>, and <I>
      ekaggata</I>. This is something that the mind does of itself, we don&#39;t 
      have to conjecture about it, just to know things as they are. </P>
      <P>As the mind becomes more refined, <I>piti</I> is eventually thrown off, 
      leaving only sukha and <I>ekaggata</I>, and so we take note of that. Where 
      does <I>piti</I> go to? It doesn&#39;t go anywhere, it&#39;s just that the mind 
      becomes increasingly more subtle so that it throws off those qualities 
      that are too coarse for it. Whatever&#39;s too coarse it throws out, and it 
      keeps throwing off like this until it reaches the peak of subtlety, known 
      in the books as the Fourth <I>Jhana</I>, the highest level of absorption. 
      Here the mind has progressively discarded whatever becomes too coarse for 
      it, until there remain only <I>ekaggata</I> and upekkha, equanimity. 
      There&#39;s nothing further, this is the limit. </P>
      <P>When the mind is developing the stages of <I>samadhi</I> it must 
      proceed in this way, but please let us understand the basics of practice. 
      We want to make the mind still but it won&#39;t be still. This is practicing 
      out of desire, but we don&#39;t realize it. We have the desire for calm. The 
      mind is already disturbed and then we further disturb things by wanting to 
      make it calm. This very wanting is the cause. We don&#39;t see that this 
      wanting to calm the mind is <I>tanha</I> (craving). It&#39;s just like 
      increasing the burden. The more we desire calm the more disturbed the mind 
      becomes, until we just give up. We end up fighting all the time, sitting 
      and struggling with ourselves. </P>
      <P>Why is this? Because we don&#39;t reflect back on how we have set up the 
      mind. Know that the conditions of mind are simply the way they are. 
      Whatever arises, just observe it. It is simply the nature of the mind, it 
      isn&#39;t harmful unless we don&#39;t understand its nature. It&#39;s not dangerous if 
      we see its activity for what it is. So we practice with <I>vitakka</I> and
      <I>vicara</I> until the mind begins to settle down and become less 
      forceful. When sensations arise we contemplate them, we mingle with them 
      and come to know them. </P>
      <P>However, usually we tend to start fighting with them, because right 
      from the beginning we&#39;re determined to calm the mind. As soon as we sit 
      the thoughts come to bother us. As soon as we set up our meditation object 
      our attention wanders, the mind wanders off after all the thoughts, 
      thinking that those thoughts have come to disturb us, but actually the 
      problem arises right here, from the very wanting. </P>
      <P>If we see that the mind is simply behaving according to its nature, 
      that it naturally comes and goes like this, and if we don&#39;t get 
      over-interested in it, we can understand its ways as much the same as a 
      child. Children don&#39;t know any better, they may say all kinds of things. 
      If we understand them we just let them talk, children naturally talk like 
      that. When we let go like this there is no obsession with the child. We 
      can talk to our guests undisturbed, while the child chatters and plays 
      around. The mind is like this. It&#39;s not harmful unless we grab on to it 
      and get obsessed over it. That&#39;s the real cause of trouble. </P>
      <P>When <I>piti</I> arises one feels an indescribable pleasure, which only 
      those who experience can appreciate. <I>Sukha</I> (pleasure) arises, and 
      there is also the quality of one-pointedness. There are <I>vitakka</I>, <I>
      vicara</I>, <I>piti</I>, sukha and <I>ekaggata</I>. These five qualities 
      all converge at the one place. Even though they are different qualities 
      they are all collected in the one place, and we can see them all there, 
      just like seeing many different kinds of fruit in the one bowl. <I>Vitakka</I>,
      <I>vicara</I>, <I>piti</I>, sukha and <I>ekaggata</I> -- we can see them 
      all in the one mind, all five qualities. If one were to ask, &quot;How is there
      <I>vitakka</I>, how is there <I>vicara</I>, how are there <I>piti</I> and
      <I>sukha</I>?...&quot; it would be difficult to answer, but when they converge 
      in the mind we will see how it is for ourselves. </P>
      <P>At this point our practice becomes somewhat special. We must have 
      recollection and self-awareness and not lose ourselves. Know things for 
      what they are. These are stages of meditation, the potential of the mind. 
      Don&#39;t doubt anything with regard to the practice. Even if you sink into 
      the earth or fly into the air, or even &quot;die&quot; while sitting, don&#39;t doubt 
      it. Whatever the qualities of the mind are, just stay with the knowing. 
      This is our foundation: to have sati, recollection, and <I>sampajañña,</I> 
      self-awareness, whether standing, walking, sitting, or reclining. Whatever 
      arises, just leave it be, don&#39;t cling to it. Be it like or dislike, 
      happiness or suffering, doubt or certainty, contemplate with <I>vicara</I> 
      and gauge the results of those qualities. Don&#39;t try to label everything, 
      just know it. See that all the things that arise in the mind are simply 
      sensations. They are transient. They arise, exist and cease. That&#39;s all 
      there is to them, they have no self or being, they are neither &quot;us&quot; nor 
      &quot;them.&quot; They are not worthy of clinging to, any of them. </P>
      <P>When we see all <I>rupa</I> and <I>nama </I>[3] in this way with 
      wisdom, then we will see the old tracks. We will see the transience of the 
      mind, the transience of the body, the transience of happiness, suffering, 
      love and hate. They are all impermanent. Seeing this, the mind becomes 
      weary; weary of the body and mind, weary of the things that arise and 
      cease and are transient. When the mind becomes disenchanted it will look 
      for a way out of all those things. It no longer wants to be stuck in 
      things, it sees the inadequacy of this world and the inadequacy of birth.
      </P>
      <P>When the mind sees like this, wherever we go, we see <I>aniccam</I> 
      (Transience), <I>dukkham</I> (Imperfection) and <I>anatta </I>
      (Ownerlessness). There&#39;s nothing left to hold on to. Whether we go to sit 
      at the foot of a tree, on a mountain top or into a valley, we can hear the 
      Buddha&#39;s teaching. All trees will seem as one, all beings will be as one, 
      there&#39;s nothing special about any of them. They arise, exist for a while, 
      age and then die, all of them. </P>
      <P>We thus see the world more clearly, seeing this body and mind more 
      clearly. They are clearer in the light of Transience, clearer in the light 
      of Imperfection and clearer in the light of Ownerlessness. If people hold 
      fast to things they suffer. This is how suffering arises. If we see that 
      body and mind are simply the way they are, no suffering arises, because we 
      don&#39;t hold fast to them. Wherever we go we will have wisdom. Even seeing a 
      tree we can consider it with wisdom. Seeing grass and the various insects 
      will be food for reflection. </P>
      <P>When it all comes down to it they all fall into the same boat. They are 
      all Dhamma, they are invariably transient. This is the truth, this is the 
      true Dhamma, this is certain. How is it certain? it is certain in that the 
      world is that way and can never be otherwise. There&#39;s nothing more to it 
      than this. If we can see in this way then we have finished our journey.
      </P>
      <P>In Buddhism, with regard to view, it is said that to feel that we are 
      more foolish than others is not right: to feel that we are equal to others 
      is not right; and to feel that we better than others is not right... 
      because there isn&#39;t any &quot;we.&quot; This is how it is, we must uproot conceit.
      </P>
      <P>This is called lokavidu -- knowing the world clearly as it is. If we 
      thus see the truth, the mind will know itself completely and will sever 
      the cause of suffering. When there is no longer any cause, the results 
      cannot arise. This is the way our practice should proceed. </P>
      <P>The basics which we need to develop are: firstly, to be upright and 
      honest; secondly, to be wary of wrong-doing; thirdly, to have the 
      attribute of humility within one&#39;s heart, to be aloof and content with 
      little. If we are content with little in regards to speech and in all 
      other things, we will see ourselves, we won&#39;t be drawn into distractions. 
      The mind will have a foundation of sila, <I>samadhi</I>, and pañña. </P>
      <P>Therefore cultivators of the path should not be careless. Even if you 
      are right don&#39;t be careless. And if you are wrong, don&#39;t be careless. If 
      things are going well or you&#39;re feeling happy, don&#39;t be careless. Why do I 
      say &quot;don&#39;t be careless&quot;? Because all of these things are uncertain. Note 
      them as such. If you get peaceful just leave the peace be. You may really 
      want to indulge in it but you should simply know the truth of it, the same 
      as for unpleasant qualities. </P>
      <P>This practice of the mind is up to each individual. The teacher only 
      explains the way to train the mind, because that mind is within each 
      individual. We know what&#39;s in there, nobody else can know our mind as well 
      as we can. The practice requires this kind of honesty. Do it properly, 
      don&#39;t do it half-heartedly. When I say &quot;do it properly,&quot; does that mean 
      you have to exhaust yourselves? No, you don&#39;t have to exhaust yourselves, 
      because the practice is done in the mind. If you know this then you will 
      know the practice. You don&#39;t need a whole lot. Just use the standards of 
      practice to reflect on yourself inwardly. </P>
      <P>Now the Rains Retreat is half way over. For most people it&#39;s normal to 
      let the practice slacken off after a while. They aren&#39;t consistent from 
      beginning to end. This shows that their practice is not yet mature. For 
      instance, having determined a particular practice at the beginning of the 
      retreat, whatever it may be, then we must fulfill that resolution. For 
      these three months make the practice consistent. You must all try. 
      Whatever you have determined to practice, consider that and reflect 
      whether the practice has slackened off. If so, make an effort to 
      re-establish it. Keep shaping up the practice, just the same as when we 
      practice meditation on the breath. As the breath goes in and out the mind 
      gets distracted. Then re-establish your attention on the breath. When your 
      attention wanders off again bring it back once more. This is the same. In 
      regard to both the body and the mind the practice proceeds like this. 
      Please make an effort with it. </P>
