The Great Frames of Reference</h2>

</FONT></center>
<hr>
<P>
 I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in the
  Kuru country. Now there is a town of the Kurus called Kammasadhamma. 
 There the Blessed One addressed the monks, "Monks."
<p> 
 "Venerable sir," the monks replied.
<p> 
 The Blessed One said this: "This is the direct path for the 
 purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, 
 for the disappearance of pain and distress, for the attainment of the 
 right method, and for the realization of Unbinding -- in other words, 
 the four frames of reference. What four?
<p> 
 "There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in and of 
 itself -- ardent, alert, and mindful -- putting aside greed and distress 
 with reference to the world. He remains focused on 
 feelings...mind...mental qualities in and of themselves -- ardent, 
 alert, and mindful -- putting aside greed and distress with reference to 
 the world. 
<p> 
<h4>A. BODY</h4>
 "And how does the monk remain focused on the body in and of itself? 
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 <b>[1]</b> "There is the case where a monk -- having gone to the wilderness, 
 to the shade of a tree, or to an empty building -- sits down folding 
 his legs crosswise, holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to 
 the fore [lit: the front of the chest]. Always mindful, he breathes 
 in; mindful he breathes out.
<p> 
 "Breathing in long, he discerns that he is breathing in long; or 
 breathing out long, he discerns that he is breathing out long. Or 
 breathing in short, he discerns that he is breathing in short; or 
 breathing out short, he discerns that he is breathing out short. He 
 trains himself to breathe in sensitive to the entire body and to 
 breathe out sensitive to the entire body. He trains himself to 
 breathe in calming the bodily processes and to breathe out calming the 
 bodily processes. Just as a skilled turner or his apprentice, when 
 making a long turn, discerns that he is making a long turn, or when 
 making a short turn discerns that he is making a short turn; in the 
 same way the monk, when breathing in long, discerns that he is 
 breathing in long; or breathing out short, he discerns that he is 
 breathing out short....He trains himself to breathe in calming the 
 bodily processes, and to breathe out calming the bodily processes.  
<p> 
 "In this way he remains focused internally on the body in and of itself, 
 or externally on the body in and of itself, or both internally and 
 externally on the body in and of itself. Or he remains focused on the 
 phenomenon of origination with regard to the body, on the phenomenon 
 of passing away with regard to the body, or on the phenomenon of 
 origination and passing away with regard to the body. Or his 
 mindfulness that 'There is a body' is maintained to the extent of 
 knowledge and remembrance. And he remains independent, unsustained by 
 (not clinging to) anything in the world. This is how a monk remains 
 focused on the body in and of itself.
<p> 
 <b>[2]</b> "Furthermore, when walking, the monk discerns that he is walking.
    When standing, he discerns that he is standing. When sitting, he 
 discerns that he is sitting. When lying down, he discerns that he is 
 lying down. Or however his body is disposed, that is how he discerns 
 it.
<p> 
 "In this way he remains focused internally on the body in and of itself, 
 or focused externally...unsustained by anything in the world. This is 
 how a monk remains focused on the body in and of itself.
<p> 
 <b>[3]</b> "Furthermore, when going forward and returning, he makes himself 
 fully alert; when looking toward and looking away...when bending and 
 extending his limbs...when carrying his outer cloak, his upper robe and 
 his bowl...when eating, drinking, chewing, and savoring...when urinating 
 and defecating...when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking 
 up, talking, and remaining silent, he makes himself fully alert.
<p> 
 "In this way he remains focused internally on the body in and of itself, 
 or focused externally...unsustained by anything in the world. This is 
 how a monk remains focused on the body in and of itself.
<p> 
 <b>[4]</b> "Furthermore...just as if a sack with openings at both ends were 
 full of various kinds of grain -- wheat, rice, mung beans, kidney 
 beans, sesame seeds, husked rice -- and a man with good eyesight, 
 pouring it out, were to reflect, 'This is wheat. This is rice. These 
 are mung beans. These are kidney beans. These are sesame seeds. 
 This is husked rice,' in the same way, monks, a monk reflects on this 
 very body from the soles of the feet on up, from the crown of the head 
 on down, surrounded by skin and full of various kinds of unclean 
 things: 'In this body there are head hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, 
 skin, flesh, tendons, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, 
 pleura, spleen, lungs, large intestines, small intestines, gorge, 
 feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, skin-oil, saliva, 
 mucus, fluid in the joints, urine.'
<p> 
 "In this way he remains focused internally on the body in and of itself, 
 or focused externally...unsustained by anything in the world. This is 
 how a monk remains focused on the body in and of itself.
<p> 
 <b>[5]</b> "Furthermore...just as a skilled butcher or his apprentice, 
 having killed a cow, would sit at a crossroads cutting it up into 
 pieces, the monk contemplates this very body -- however it stands, 
 however it is disposed -- in terms of properties: 'In this body there 
 is the earth property, the liquid property, the fire property, and the 
 wind property.'
<p> 
 "In this way he remains focused internally on the body in and of itself, 
 or focused externally...unsustained by anything in the world. This is 
 how a monk remains focused on the body in and of itself.
<p> 
 <b>[6]</b> "Furthermore, as if he were to see a corpse cast away in a 
 charnel ground -- one day, two days, three days dead -- bloated, 
 livid, and festering, he applies it to this very body, 'This body, too: 
 Such is its nature, such is its future, such its unavoidable fate'... 
<p> 
 "Or again, as if he were to see a corpse cast away in a charnel 
 ground, picked at by crows, vultures, and hawks, by dogs, hyenas, and 
 various other creatures...a skeleton smeared with flesh and blood, 
 connected with tendons...a fleshless skeleton smeared with blood, 
 connected with tendons...a skeleton without flesh or blood, connected 
 with tendons...bones detached from their tendons, scattered in all 
 directions -- here a hand bone, there a foot bone, here a shin bone, 
 there a thigh bone, here a hip bone, there a back bone, here a rib, 
 there a chest bone, here a shoulder bone, there a neck bone, here a 
 jaw bone, there a tooth, here a skull...the bones whitened, somewhat 
 like the color of shells...piled up, more than a year old...decomposed 
 into a powder: He applies it to this very body, 'This body, too: Such 
 is its nature, such is its future, such its unavoidable fate.'
<p> 
 "In this way he remains focused internally on the body in and of itself, 
 or externally on the body in and of itself, or both internally and 
 externally on the body in and of itself. Or he remains focused on the 
 phenomenon of origination with regard to the body, on the phenomenon 
 of passing away with regard to the body, or on the phenomenon of 
 origination and passing away with regard to the body. Or his 
 mindfulness that 'There is a body' is maintained to the extent of 
 knowledge and remembrance. And he remains independent, unsustained by 
 (not clinging to) anything in the world. This is how a monk remains 
 focused on the body in and of itself.

<h4>B. FEELINGS</h4> 
 "And how does a monk remain focused on feelings in and of themselves? 
 There is the case where a monk, when feeling a painful feeling, 
 discerns that he is feeling a painful feeling. When feeling a 
 pleasant feeling, he discerns that he is feeling a pleasant feeling. 
 When feeling a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he discerns that 
 he is feeling a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.  
<p> 
 "When feeling a painful feeling of the flesh, he discerns that he is 
 feeling a painful feeling of the flesh. When feeling a painful 
 feeling not of the flesh, he discerns that he is feeling a painful 
 feeling not of the flesh. When feeling a pleasant feeling of the 
 flesh, he discerns that he is feeling a pleasant feeling of the flesh. 
 When feeling a pleasant feeling not of the flesh, he discerns that he 
 is feeling a pleasant feeling not of the flesh. When feeling a 
 neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling of the flesh, he discerns that he 
 is feeling a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling of the flesh. When 
 feeling a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling not of the flesh, he 
 discerns that he is feeling a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling not 
 of the flesh.
<p> 
 "In this way he remains focused internally on feelings in and of 
 themselves, or externally on feelings in and of themselves, or both 
 internally and externally on feelings in and of themselves. Or he remains 
 focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to feelings, on 
 the phenomenon of passing away with regard to feelings, or on the 
 phenomenon of origination and passing away with regard to feelings. Or 
 his mindfulness that 'There are feelings' is maintained to the extent 
 of knowledge and remembrance. And he remains independent, unsustained by 
 (not clinging to) anything in the world. This is how a monk remains 
 focused on feelings in and of themselves.
<p> 
<h4>C. MIND</h4> 
 "And how does a monk remain focused on the mind in and of itself? There 
 is the case where a monk, when the mind has passion, discerns that the 
 mind has passion. When the mind is without passion, he discerns that 
 the mind is without passion. When the mind has aversion, he discerns 
 that the mind has aversion. When the mind is without aversion, he 
 discerns that the mind is without aversion. When the mind has 
 delusion, he discerns that the mind has delusion. When the mind is 
 without delusion, he discerns that the mind is without delusion.
<p> 
 "When the mind is restricted, he discerns that the mind is restricted. 
 When the mind is scattered, he discerns that the mind is scattered. 
 When the mind is enlarged, he discerns that the mind is enlarged. 
 When the mind is not enlarged, he discerns that the mind is not 
 enlarged. When the mind is surpassed, he discerns that the mind is 
 surpassed. When the mind is unsurpassed, he discerns that the mind is 
 unsurpassed. When the mind is concentrated, he discerns that the mind 
 is concentrated. When the mind is not concentrated, he discerns that 
 the mind is not concentrated. When the mind is released, he discerns 
 that the mind is released. When the mind is not released, he discerns 
 that the mind is not released. 
<p> 
 "In this way he remains focused internally on the mind in and of itself, 
 or externally on the mind in and of itself, or both internally and 
 externally on the mind in and of itself. Or he remains focused on the 
 phenomenon of origination with regard to the mind, on the phenomenon 
 of passing away with regard to the mind, or on the phenomenon of 
 origination and passing away with regard to the mind. Or his 
 mindfulness that 'There is a mind' is maintained to the extent of 
 knowledge and remembrance. And he remains independent, unsustained by 
 (not clinging to) anything in the world. This is how a monk remains 
 focused on the mind in and of itself.
<p> 
 <h4> D. MENTAL QUALITIES </h4>
 "And how does a monk remain focused on mental qualities in and of 
 themselves? 
 <p> 
 <BLOCKQUOTE>
<b>[1]</b> "There is the case where a monk remains focused on mental 
 qualities in and of themselves with reference to the <i>five 
 hindrances</i>. And how does a monk remain focused on mental qualities 
 in and of themselves with reference to the five hindrances? There is 
 the case where, there being sensual desire present within, a monk 
 discerns that 'There is sensual desire present within me.' Or, there 
 being no sensual desire present within, he discerns that 'There is no 
 sensual desire present within me.' He discerns how there is the 
 arising of unarisen sensual desire. And he discerns how there is the 
 abandoning of sensual desire once it has arisen. And he discerns how 
 there is no further appearance in the future of sensual desire that 
 has been abandoned. (The same formula is repeated for the remaining 
 hindrances: ill will, sloth and drowsiness, restlessness and anxiety, and 
 uncertainty.)
<p> 
 "In this way he remains focused internally on mental qualities in and of 
 themselves, or externally on mental qualities in and of themselves, or 
 both internally and externally on mental qualities in and of themselves. 
 Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to 
 mental qualities, on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to 
 mental qualities, or on the phenomenon of origination and passing away 
 with regard to mental qualities. Or his mindfulness that 'There are 
 mental qualities' is maintained to the extent of knowledge and 
 remembrance. And he remains independent, unsustained by (not clinging 
 to) anything in the world. This is how a monk remains focused on mental
 qualities in and of themselves with reference to the five hindrances.
<p> 
 <B>[2]</B> "Furthermore, the monk remains focused on mental qualities in and 
 of themselves with reference to the <i>five aggregates for 
 sustenance/clinging</i>. And how does he remain focused on mental 
 qualities in and of themselves with reference to the five aggregates for 
 sustenance/clinging? There is the case where a monk [discerns]: 
 'Such is form, such its origination, such its disappearance. Such is 
 feeling... Such is perception...Such are processes...Such is 
 consciousness, such its origination, such its disappearance.' 
<p> 
 "In this way he remains focused internally on the mental qualities in 
 and of themselves, or focused externally...unsustained by anything in 
 the world. This is how a monk remains focused on mental qualities in 
 and of themselves with reference to the five aggregates for 
 sustenance/clinging.
<p> 
 <B>[3]</B> "Furthermore, the monk remains focused on mental qualities in and 
 of themselves with reference to the <i>sixfold internal and external 
 sense media</i>. And how does he remain focused on mental qualities in 
 and of themselves with reference to the sixfold internal and external 
 sense media? There is the case where he discerns the eye, he discerns 
 forms, he discerns the fetter that arises dependent on both. He 
 discerns how there is the arising of an unarisen fetter. And he 
 discerns how there is the abandoning of a fetter once it has arisen. 
 And he discerns how there is no further appearance in the future of a 
 fetter that has been abandoned. (The same formula is repeated for the 
 remaining sense media: ear, nose, tongue, body, and intellect.)
<p> 
 "In this way he remains focused internally on the mental qualities in 
 and of themselves, or focused externally...unsustained by anything in 
 the world. This is how a monk remains focused on mental qualities in 
 and of themselves with reference to the sixfold internal and external 
 sense media.
<p> 
 <B>[4]</B> "Furthermore, the monk remains focused on mental qualities in and 
 of themselves with reference to the <i>seven factors of awakening</i>. 
 And how does he remain focused on mental qualities in and of themselves 
 with reference to the seven factors of awakening? There is the case 
 where, there being mindfulness as a factor of awakening present 
 within, he discerns that 'Mindfulness as a factor of awakening is 
 present within me.' Or, there being no mindfulness as a factor of 
 awakening present within, he discerns that 'Mindfulness as a factor of 
 awakening is not present within me.' He discerns how there is the 
 arising of unarisen mindfulness as a factor of awakening. And he 
 discerns how there is the culmination of the development of 
 mindfulness as a factor of awakening once it has arisen. (The same 
 formula is repeated for the remaining factors of awakening: analysis 
 of qualities, persistence, rapture, serenity, concentration, and 
 equanimity.)
<p> 
 "In this way he remains focused internally on mental qualities in and of 
 themselves, or externally...unsustained by (not clinging to) anything 
 in the world. This is how a monk remains focused on mental qualities 
 in and of themselves with reference to the seven factors of awakening.
<p> 
 <B>[5]</B> "Furthermore, the monk remains focused on mental qualities in and 
 of themselves with reference to the <i>four noble truths</i>. And how 
 does he remain focused on mental qualities in and of themselves with 
 reference to the four noble truths? There is the case where he 
 discerns, as it is actually present, that 'This is stress...This is 
 the origination of stress...This is the cessation of stress...This is 
 the way leading to the cessation of stress.'
<p> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>[a]</B> "Now what is the noble truth of stress? Birth is stress, aging 
 is stress, death is stress; sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and 
 despair are stress; not getting what is wanted is stress. In short, 
 the five aggregates for sustenance are stress.
<p> 
 "And what is <i>birth</i>? Whatever birth, taking birth, descent, 
 coming-to-be, coming-forth, appearance of aggregates, and acquisition of 
 [sense] spheres of the various beings in this or that group of beings, 
 that is called birth.
<p> 
 "And what is <i>aging</i>? Whatever aging, decrepitude, brokenness, 
 graying, wrinkling, decline of life-force, weakening of the faculties 
 of the various beings in this or that group of beings, that is called 
 aging.
<p> 
 "And what is <i>death</i>? Whatever deceasing, passing away, breaking 
 up, disappearance, dying, death, completion of time, break up of the 
 aggregates, casting off of the body, interruption in the life faculty 
 of the various beings in this or that group of beings, that is called 
 death.
<p> 
 "And what is <i>sorrow</i>? Whatever sorrow, sorrowing, sadness, inward 
 sorrow, inward sadness of anyone suffering from misfortune, touched by 
 a painful thing, that is called sorrow.
<p> 
 "And what is <i>lamentation</i>? Whatever crying, grieving, lamenting, 
 weeping, wailing, lamentation of anyone suffering from misfortune, 
 touched by a painful thing, that is called lamentation.
<p> 
 "And what is <i>pain</i>? Whatever is experienced as bodily pain, bodily 
 discomfort, pain or discomfort born of bodily contact, that is called 
 pain.

 "And what is <i>distress</i>? Whatever is experienced as mental pain, 
 mental discomfort, pain or discomfort born of mental contact, that is 
 called distress.
<p> 
 "And what is <i>despair</i>? Whatever despair, despondency, desperation 
 of anyone suffering from misfortune, touched by a painful thing, that 
 is called despair.
<p> 
 "And what is the stress of not getting what one wants? In beings 
 subject to birth, the wish arises, 'O, may we not be subject to birth, 
 and may birth not come to us.' But this is not be achieved by 
 wishing. This is the stress of not getting what one wants. In beings 
 subject to aging...illness...death...sorrow, lamentation, pain, 
 distress, and despair, the wish arises, 'O, may we not be subject to 
 aging...illness...death...sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and 
 despair, and may aging...illness...death...sorrow, lamentation, pain, 
 distress, and despair not come to us.' But this is not be achieved by 
 wishing. This is the stress of not getting what one wants.
<p> 
 "And what are the five aggregates for sustenance that, in short, are 
 stress? Form as an aggregate for sustenance, feeling as an aggregate 
 for sustenance, perception as an aggregate for sustenance, processes 
 as an aggregate for sustenance, consciousness as an aggregate for 
 sustenance: These are called the five aggregates for sustenance that, 
 in short, are stress. 
<p> 
 "This is called the noble truth of stress. 
<p> 
 <b>[b]</b> "And what is the noble truth of the origination of stress? The 
 craving that makes for further becoming -- accompanied by passion and 
 delight, relishing now here and now there -- i.e., craving for 
 sensuality, craving for becoming, craving for non-becoming.
<p> 
 "And where does this craving, when arising, arise? And where, when 
 dwelling, does it dwell? Whatever is endearing and alluring in terms of 
 the world: that is where this craving, when arising, arises. That is 
 where, when dwelling, it dwells.

 remainderless fading and cessation, renunciation, relinquishment,

"And what is right view? Knowledge with regard to stress, knowledge

 cessation of stress, knowledge with regard to the way of practice 
 leading to the cessation of stress: This is called right view.
<p> 
 And what is right aspiration?  Aspiring to renunciation, to freedom 
 from ill will, to harmlessness: This is called right aspiration.
<p> 
 "And what is right speech? Abstaining from lying, from divisive 
 speech, from abusive speech, and from idle chatter: This is called 
 right speech.
<p> 
 "And what is right action? Abstaining from taking life, from 
 stealing, and from sexual intercourse. This is called right action.
<p> 
 "And what is right livelihood? There is the case where a noble 
 disciple, having abandoned dishonest livelihood, keeps his life going 
 with right livelihood: This is called right livelihood.
<p> 
 "And what is right effort? There is the case where a monk generates 
 desire, endeavors, arouses persistence, upholds and exerts his intent 
 for the sake of the non-arising of evil, unskillful qualities that 
 have not yet arisen...for the sake of the abandoning of evil, 
 unskillful qualities that have arisen...for the sake of the arising of 
 skillful qualities that have not yet arisen...(and) for the 
 maintenance, non-confusion, increase, plenitude, development, and 
 culmination of skillful qualities that have arisen: This is called 
 right effort.

 remains focused on the body in and of itself -- ardent, alert, and mindful 
 -- putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world. He 
 remains focused on feelings in and of themselves...the mind in and of 
 itself...mental qualities in and of themselves -- ardent, alert, and 
 mindful -- putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world.  
 This is called right mindfulness.
<p> 
 "And what is right concentration? There is the case where a monk -- 
 quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful (mental) 
 qualities -- enters and remains in the first jhana: rapture and pleasure 
 born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought and evaluation. 
 With the stilling of directed thought and evaluation, he enters and 
 remains in the second jhana: rapture and pleasure born of composure, 
 unification of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation -- 
 internal assurance. With the fading of rapture he remains in 
 equanimity, mindful and alert, physically sensitive of pleasure. He 
 enters and remains in the third jhana, and of him the Noble Ones 
 declare, 'Equanimous and mindful, he has a pleasurable abiding.' With 
 the abandoning of pleasure and pain -- as with the earlier disappearance 
 of elation and distress -- he enters and remains in the fourth jhana: 
 purity of equanimity and mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. This 
 is called right concentration.

 <h4> E. CONCLUSION </h4>
 "Now, if anyone would develop these four frames of reference in this 
 way for seven years, one of two fruits can be expected for him: 
 either gnosis right here and now, or -- if there be any remnant of 
 clinging-sustenance -- non-return.
<p> 
 "Let alone seven years. If anyone would develop these four frames of 
 reference in this way for six years...five...four...three...two 
 years...one year...seven months...six 
 months...five...four...three...two months...one month...half a month, 
 one of two fruits can be expected for him: either gnosis right here and 
 now, or -- if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance -- 
 non-return.
<p> 
 "Let alone half a month. If anyone would develop these four frames of 
 reference in this way for seven days, one of two fruits can be 
 expected for him: either gnosis right here and now, or -- if there be 
 any remnant of clinging-sustenance -- non-return.
<p> 
 "'This is the direct path for the purification of beings, for the 
 overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the disappearance of pain and 
 distress, for the attainment of the right method, and for the 
 realization of Unbinding -- in other words, the four frames of 
 reference.' Thus was it said, and in reference to this was it said."
<p> 
 That is what the Blessed One said. Satisfied, the monks delighted in 
 the Blessed One's words.
