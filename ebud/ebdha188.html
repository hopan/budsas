    face="Times New Roman">WO WORDS -- <i>Mahayana </i>and <i>Hinayana -- </i>cause much
    confusion among Buddhists<i>, </i>I would like to offer a different way of looking at
    them. They concern the Buddhist approach to life.</font></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i><strong>Mahayana</strong></i>
    literally means &quot;Great Vehicle&quot; (of Liberation from <i>Samsara</i>, or the
    &quot;Wheel of Change&quot;), somewhat like a jumbo-jet, that carries many people. <strong><i>Hinayana</i></strong>
    is a derogatory term meaning &quot;Small Vehicle&quot; or &quot;Inferior Vehicle&quot;
    (like a skateboard, which carries only one), used by people who claim to follow the
    &quot;Mahayana&quot; to refer to followers of the <i>Theravada</i> school or &quot;Way of
    the Elders&quot;, as if they themselves have already passed that stage. They say
    &quot;Hinayanists&quot; are selfish, thinking only of their own salvation, instead of --
    like them -- the salvation of &quot;all beings&quot;. There is tremendous egoism
    underlying this claim, and we can be sure than anyone making it has not understood much at
    all! Actually, the word &quot;Hinayana&quot; is a misnomer and should not be used to refer
    to people at all, for both &quot;Mahayana&quot; and &quot;Hinayana&quot;, as I will show,
    are not schools of Buddhism, but attitudes of mind.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Nowadays, Buddhism is little more than a
    thing of tradition in most parts of Asia, and &quot;Mahayana&quot; has degenerated into a
    system of worship and prayer to numerous Buddhas and Bodhisattvas that hope, fear and
    superstition have populated the cosmos with. Ignorant of the Buddha's Teachings about
    Karma and the importance of developing spiritual self-reliance, people weak-mindedly turn
    for help and salvation to celestial beings. They imagine Buddhas and Bodhisattvas as
    remote from them -- somewhere in the sky, perhaps -- similar to the deities of other
    religions. And so, they miss the whole point of the Buddha&quot;s parting injunction:
    &quot;Work out your own salvation with diligence&quot;. Enlightenment is an intimate inner
    experience, not something that comes to us from outside.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">All Buddhists -- regardless of the sect or
    school they might follow -- acknowledge the Bodhisattva-ideal as being the highest path,
    as it is the way of the aspirant to Buddhahood. Upon reaching his goal and becoming a
    Buddha, he then has the capacity to help others become Enlightened (not to forgive their
    sins and save them, but more in the sense of a school-teacher instructing his pupils and
    helping them wherever possible, so they might pass the exams and graduate; he can't pass
    the exams for them). Reaching Enlightenment he is a Bodhisattva no more, but a
    fully-fledged Buddha. While he <i>is </i>a Bodhisattva, as in the case of Prince
    Siddhartha until he was 35 years old, he is not yet fully-enlightened; indeed, he doesn't
    even know that he is a Bodhisattva. An <i>Arahant </i>is someone who, by following the
    Dharma of a Buddha, reaches Enlightenment, and the Enlightenment he reaches is the same as
    that of a Buddha (it being unconditioned and without grades or divisions). He, too, may
    assist others, but his capacity to do so is less than that of a Buddha. A Buddha is an
    Arahant, too, but an Arahant is not a Buddha, just as every doctor is a man (or woman, of
    course), but not every man or woman is a doctor. Both Buddha and Arahant are free from the
    chains of <i>Samsara </i>(phenomenal existence); they no longer have a sense of
    separateness and selfishness. (All this, of course, is from the scriptures, and not from
    my own experience).</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Far from being a way of petition and prayer
    for help from superior or celestial beings, Mahayana is a way of tremendous effort. A
    person on <i>that </i>Way does not pray to the Buddha or Bodhisattvas, but, by using the
    Dharma, strives to become a Bodhisattva himself. He does so, not by rejecting the world,
    but by understanding that he <i>is </i>the world, and that he does not -- <i>cannot</i>
    live by and for himself alone. Self-interest and fear for self decrease in direct
    proportion as to how much he sees himself as others, just as a sense of separateness and
    ego increase the fear for, and pain of, the self.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">As an illustration, let us say that there are
    three kinds of people in the world: (1) Blind people; (2) Selfish people; and (3) Self<i>less
    </i>people. Blind people -- <i>spiritually </i>blind, that is -- wander aimlessly through
    life, knowing and caring nothing about Dharma, infatuated with themselves, but acting in
    ways that are inimical to themselves and that only result in suffering; they think they
    love themselves, but actually they don't. They are not bad, <i>or </i>selfish, but
    foolish; selfishness is something above and beyond them, because selfish people know how
    to take care of themselves, at least, while blind and foolish people do not, and only hurt
    themselves. There are so many blind people in the world; the world is sinking beneath
    their weight. If they woke up, they would change their ways.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Selfish</i> people have seen something of <i>Dharma,
    </i>and try to live by it, but their insight is not deep, and they are motivated by
    self-interest. Though they would try not to hurt anyone, and do what is right and good, it
    is either out of fear of suffering or from desire for gain materially and/or spiritually.
    But if the world had more people of this kind, it would be a much better place, for <i>real
    </i>selfish people do not kill, steal, lie, cheat, start and perpetuate wars, etc.; it is
    the foolish people who do such things. Abstention from doing evil, and the goodness of
    selfish people, though motivated by thoughts of self, benefits the world in many ways, and
    keeps it afloat. Like the bud of a flower, however, goodness at this level is not full or
    complete, but it is a necessary stage of the Path; we must begin with self in order to
    understand and go beyond it.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Of course, selfishness here is not as
    generally understood, as something negative and anti-social; not at all! This kind of
    selfishness recognizes others and feels for them, even though it puts itself first. It may
    be called the <i>Hinayana </i>stage, and it shouldn't be looked down upon, but respected
    and praised, as it is already a high level. Often, we find that people claiming to be <i>Mahayanists</i>,
    and who look down on others they consider <i>Hinayanists</i>, have got little more than
    silly and empty names.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Going beyond self, to the third stage -- that
    of <i>Mahayana -- </i>is accomplished through seeing, clearly, that we do not live alone,
    by and for ourselves. Life is a Whole, with many parts, like a multi-faceted diamond; we
    are not separate and alone, but inter-exist with everything that is. And whereas, before,
    we were motivated by thoughts of self -- fear of suffering, old age, sickness, death, of
    not attaining Enlightenment, and of therefore remaining in <i>Samsara </i>indefinitely --
    now, through <i>insight, </i>we have power over the vicissitudes of life. We see that most
    of our suffering comes from ignorance and stupidity, and so can be avoided -- a discovery
    of tremendous importance! Instead of looking for the causes of our problems outside
    ourselves, we find them inside! It is then within our capacity to communicate this to
    others who might be ready for it, to shout it from the rooftops, to proclaim to others
    that the only chains that bind us are of our own forging. <i>This -- </i>and not a
    Buddhist sect or thinking with a separatist mind is <i>Mahayana; </i>it is the essence of
    Enlightenment, and available to all.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">We can follow the Mahayana, but nobody with
    any modesty would say that he does so; indeed, he would probably not be aware of it, and
    might even deny it! There are no outward signs by which a Bodhisattva might be recognized;
    certainly, he would not float around on a lotus-flower, as depicted in popular but
    misleading Buddhist art. And if a Bodhisattva can help someone, he will help; it is not
    necessary to pray to him, but only necessary to put oneself in a position where one can be
    helped by first helping others. If one does not prepare oneself in this way, one will have
    no basis for receiving help from others. We must first give out before we can receive, sow
    the seeds before reaping the harvest.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Conclusion: <i>Mahayana </i>and <i>Hinayana</i>
    are attitudes of mind or levels of consciousness, <i><strong>not</strong> </i>sects or
    schools of Buddhism./.</font></p>
