    <td width="100%"><font face="Times New Roman"><!--Last modified on 22.3.1998 by Jakub Bartovsky--><font size="+2"><b>Appendix</b></font> </font><p><font
    face="Times New Roman"><font size="6"><a name="p13-1"></a>A</font>t the beginning of the
    century, when the Buddha's Teaching had only recently come to widespread notice in the
    West, many questions were yet unsettled. Although it was already recognized except,
    perhaps, among those most hostile, that the Buddha was rather more than a primitive
    sun-myth, yet many other mistaken ideas were being put forward to explain, or to explain
    away, the Buddha and his Teaching. Some of these notions sound today quite as naive as the
    sun-myth theory: but others, despite the evidence, continue to be raised, hence the
    preceding essay. Doctrinal matters aside, the most fundamental of those concern the place
    of Pali as a language in Indian history and thought, and the dates of composition and
    compilation of the various Canonical texts. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-2"></a> Prof. T.&nbsp;W. Rhys Davids --
    unquestionably the most influential of the early scholars concerned with Buddhism -- dealt
    with these questions at length in various articles and books, the most comprehensive and
    easily available of which is <i>Buddhist India</i>. Published in 1903, although it is
    touched both by a lingering Victorian ethnocentricism and, doctrinal matters aside, by
    some lesser judgements since demonstrated to be erroneous, it is nevertheless the earliest
    general statement of what is, in the main, the accepted view on these questions today. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-3"></a> Although a scholarly examination of
    these questions will never yield an understanding of the Teaching, yet mistaken notions
    may well be an obstacle to comprehension. Some, therefore, will find a certain amount of
    investigation into these points to be of value. While the question of the place of Pali as
    a language and of the date of the Vinaya have not been part of our inquiry, yet it may be
    pertinent to quote briefly on these subjects. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-4"></a> On the first point, Rhys Davids
    concludes that there existed at the time of the Buddha &quot;a language common among the
    cultured laity ... which bore to the local dialect much the same relation as the English
    of London, in Shakespeare's time, bore to the various dialects spoken in Somersetshire,
    Yorkshire, and Essex&quot;; that this &quot;conversational dialect&quot; was in use
    &quot;not only throughout the Kosala dominions, but east and west from Delhi to Patna, and
    north and south from Savatthi to Avanti&quot;; and that on this dialect was based
    &quot;Middle High Indian, Pali, the literary language.&quot;[<a name="1ap" href="#n1ap">1</a>]
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-5"></a> A scholarly debate has been in
    progress for the last fifty years (with no end in sight) challenging and defending this
    judgement. It should be noted, then, that even a &quot;worst-case scenario,&quot; namely,
    a conclusive and convincing demonstration that Pali was not the language spoken by the
    Buddha (but see D.&nbsp;16 (ii,108)), would not require us to change anything in this
    essay. For if, as some contend, Pali is a western Prakrit while the Buddha spoke an
    Eastern dialect, all that would be demonstrated is that the final editorial work on the
    texts was done by monks who hailed from western India. In this regard we should note that
    the account of the Second Council in the Vinaya repeatedly describes the orthodox monks as
    being from the west, and the heretics as being from the east. And if, as others contend,
    Pali as we now have it postdates the Buddha by a century or more, then all that would be
    demonstrated thereby is that at the Second Council (and, for the Khuddaka, the Third) the
    decision was made to &quot;modernize&quot; the language.[<a name="2ap" href="#n2ap">2</a>]
    There would be in neither case any need to question the authenticity of the Teaching as we
    have it. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-6"></a> On the second point we may turn to
    Rhys David's <i>History and Literature of Buddhism</i> (the &quot;American Lectures&quot;)
    of 1896 wherein, early in Lecture VI, he remarks: <a name="p13-7"></a> </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">... the first disruption in the Order took place ... on
      matters connected with the regulation of the Order itself. One hundred years after the
      death of the Buddha, according to the oldest account ... there arose a certain party in
      the Order which proclaimed and practised a loosening of the rules in ten particulars ... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-8"></a> To put and end to the disputes upon
      these points, a Council of the leading members of the Order was held at Vesali and the
      heretical opinions were condemned. The long-continued struggle on the question -- as
      important for the history of Buddhism as the Arian controversy for that of Christianity --
      agitated the whole Buddhist world to its very center ... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-9"></a> Now the ten indulgences are each
      summed up in a single word: and these words are, each and all of them, conspicuous by
      their absence from the Books on the laws and regulations of the Order included in the
      canon (i.e. the Vinaya), except that they appear in an historical account added quite
      evidently as an appendix (i.e. the Twelfth Khandhaka, discussed in our essay), to the
      collection of treatises, or Khandhakas ... This fact is of the very greatest importance in
      determining the date at which those Khandhakas must have been composed. The ten points in
      dispute were all matters of ecclesiastical law. They all related to observances of the
      Brotherhood. Is it probable that, in a set of rules and treatises which seek to set forth,
      down to the minutest detail, and even with hair-splitting diffuseness, all that has any
      relation to the daily life of the Brethren and the regulation of the Buddhist Order -- is
      it probable that, in such a collection, if, when it was compiled, the struggle on these
      ten points had already burst into flame, there should be no reference at all, even in
      interpolations, to any one of these ten disputes? That the difference of opinion on each
      of the ten points remains altogether unnoticed in that part of the rules and treatises
      where, in the natural order of things, it would obviously be referred to -- that the rules
      are not in any way altered to cover, or to suggest, any decision on the points in dispute,
      -- and that they are mentioned only in an appendix (=&nbsp;the Twelfth Khandhaka), where
      the Council held to decide them is described, shows clearly that the rules and treatises,
      as we have them, must have been put together before the time when the Council of Vesali
      (=&nbsp;the Second Council) was held. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-10"></a></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lastly, on the question which has concerned us at length
    -- the date of the Suttas -- we offer relevant excerpts from Chapter X of <i>Buddhist
    India</i>: <a name="p13-11"></a> </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">... As to the age of the Buddhist canonical books, the
      best evidence is the contents of the books themselves -- the sort of words they use, the
      style in which they are composed, the ideas they express. Objection, it is true, has
      recently been raised against the use of such internal evidence. And the objection is valid
      if it be urged, not against the general principle of the use of such evidence, but against
      the wrong use of it. We find, for instance, that Phallus-worship is often mentioned, quite
      as a matter of course, in the Mahabharata, as if it had always been common everywhere
      throughout Northern India. In the Nikayas, though they mention all sorts of what the
      Buddhists regarded as foolish or superstitious forms of worship, this particular kind,
      Siva-worship under the form of the Linga, is not even once referred to. The Mahabharata
      mentions the Atharva Veda, and takes it as a matter of course, as if it were an idea
      generally current, that it was a Veda the fourth Veda. The Nikayas constantly mention the
      three others, but never the Atharva. Both cases are interesting. But before drawing the
      conclusion that, therefore the Nikayas, as we have them, are older than the existing text
      of the Mahabharata, we should want a very much larger number of such cases, all tending
      the same way, and also the certainty that there were no cases of an opposite tendency that
      could not otherwise be explained. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-12"></a> On the other hand, suppose a MS.
      were discovered containing, in the same handwriting, copies of Bacon's <i>Essays</i> and
      of Hume's <i>Essay</i>, with nothing to show when, or by whom, they were written; and that
      we knew nothing at all otherwise about the matter. Still we should know, with absolute
      certainty, which was relatively the older of the two; and should be able to determine,
      within a quite short period, the actual date of each of the two works. The evidence would
      be irresistible because it would consist of a very large number of minute points of
      language, of style, and, above all, of ideas expressed, all tending in the same direction.
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-13"></a> This is the sort of internal
      evidence that we have before us in the Pali books. Any one who habitually reads Pali would
      know at once that the Nikayas are older than the Dhamma Sangani; that both are older
      than the Katha Vatthu; that all three are older than the Milinda. And the Pali scholars
      most competent to judge are quite unanimous on the point, and on the general position of
      the Pali literature in the history of literature in India. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-14"></a> But this sort of evidence can
      appeal, of course, only to those familiar with the language and with the ideas. To those
      who are not, the following points may be suggestive: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-15"></a> On the monuments of the third
      century B.C. we find the names of donors of different parts of the building inscribed on
      those parts (pillars, rails, and bas-reliefs). When the names are common ones, certain
      epithets are added, to distinguish the donors from other persons bearing the same name.
      Such epithets are either local (as we might say, John of Winchester) or they specify an
      occupation (as we might say, John the carpenter, or John the clerk) or are otherwise
      distinctive. Among these epithets have been found the following: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-16"></a> 1. <i>Dhamma-kathika</i>. --
      &quot;Preacher of the system&quot; (the Dhamma) -- the &quot;System&quot; being a
      technical term in the Buddhist schools to signify the philosophical and ethical doctrine
      as distinguished from the Vinaya, the Rules of the Order. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-17"></a> 2. <i>Petakin</i>. --&quot;One who
      had (that is, knew by heart) the Pitaka.&quot; The Pitaka[<a name="3ap" href="#n3ap">3</a>]
      is the traditional statements of Buddhist doctrine as contained in the Sutta Pitaka
      (=&nbsp;the five Nikayas). The word means basket, and, as a technical term applied to a
      part of their literature, it is used exclusively by the Buddhists. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-18"></a> 3. <i>Suttantika</i>. -- &quot;A man
      who knows a Suttanta (=&nbsp;Sutta) by heart.&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-19"></a> 4. <i>Suttantakini</i>. -- &quot;A
      woman who knows a Suttanta by heart.&quot; Suttanta is, again, a technical term used
      exclusively of certain portions of the Buddhist canonical books, more especially of the
      Dialogues....[<a name="4ap" href="#n4ap">4</a>] </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-20"></a> 5. <i>Panca-nekayika</i>. --
      &quot;One who knows the Five Nikayas by heart.&quot; The five Nikayas, or
      &quot;Collections,&quot; as a technical term used of literary works, is applied to the
      canonical Buddhist texts, and to them only.... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-21"></a> The expressions here explained are
      used on Buddhist monuments and refer to Buddhist books. They are conclusive proof that
      some time before the date of the inscriptions (that is, roughly speaking, before the time
      of Asoka), there was a Buddhist literature in North India, where the inscriptions are
      found. And further, that that literature then had divisions known by the technical names
      of Pitaka, Nikaya, and Suttanta, and that the number of Nikayas then in existence was
      five. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-22"></a> But this is not all. Asoka, in his
      Bhabra Edict, addressed to the Buddhist Order (the Sangha), recommends to the Brethren and
      Sisters of the Order, and to the lay disciples of either sex, frequently to hear (that is
      to learn by heart) and to meditate upon, certain selected passages. And of these he, most
      fortunately, gives the names. They are as follows: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-23"></a> <i>Ariya-vasani</i> (now found in
      the Digha Nikaya, in the portion called the Sangiti Suttanta). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-24"></a> <i>Anagata-bhayani</i> (now found
      in the Anguttara Nikaya, vol. iii, pp. 105-108). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-25"></a> <i>Muni Gatha</i> (now found in
      the Sutta Nipata, verses 206-220). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-26"></a> <i>Moneyya Sutta</i> (now found in
      the Iti-vuttaka, p.&nbsp;67, and also in the Anguttara Nikaya, vol.&nbsp;i, p.&nbsp;272).
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-27"></a> <i>Upatissa Pasina</i>. -- &quot;The
      questions put by Upatissa&quot; (more commonly known as Sariputta). There are so many
      such questions in the books that opinions differ as to which of them is the one most
      probably referred to. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-28"></a> There is a word at the commencement
      of this list which may either be an adjective applied to the whole list or the name of
      another passage. However this may be, this Edict of Asoka's gives the actual titles of
      some of the shorter passages included, in his time, in those books, the larger divisions
      of which are mentioned in the inscriptions just referred to. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-29"></a> Now the existing literature, divided
      into the same larger divisions, contains also the shorter passages. To suppose that it was
      composed in Ceylon is to suppose that, by an extraordinary series of chances, the Ceylon
      writers happened to hit upon just the identical technical terms, two of them then almost
      fallen out of use, that had been used in these old inscriptions (of which they knew
      nothing) for the names they gave to the larger divisions of the literature they made. And
      we must further suppose that, by another extraordinary series of chances, they happened to
      include in those divisions a number of shorter passages, each of them corresponding
      exactly to those mentioned by name, long before their time, in Asoka's Edict, of which
      also they knew nothing. To adopt such a theory as the most probable explanation of the
      facts would be nothing less than absurd.... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-30"></a> We must take our Pali canonical
      books then to be North Indian, not Singhalese in origin: and the question as to whether
      they have suffered from their sometime sojourn under the palm groves of the mountain <i>viharas</i>
      in the south[<a name="5ap" href="#n5ap">5</a>] must be decided by a critical study of them
      in their present condition. Towards such a study there are some points that can already be
      made. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-31"></a> The books make no mention of Asoka.
      Had they undergone any serious re-editing after the reign of the great Buddhist Emperor
      (of whom the Buddhist writers, whether rightly or wrongly, were so proud), is it probable
      that he would have been so completely ignored? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-32"></a> The books never mention any person,
      or any place, in Ceylon; or even in South India.[<a name="6ap" href="#n6ap">6</a>] They
      tell us a goodly number of anecdotes, usually as introductions to, or in illustration of,
      some ethical point. It would have been so easy to bring in a passing reference to some
      Ceylon worthy -- in the same way as the brahmin Buddhaghosa does so often, in his
      Atthasalini, which <i>was</i> revised in Ceylon.[<a name="7ap" href="#n7ap">7</a>] If
      the Pitaka books had been tampered with, would not opportunity have been taken to yield to
      this very natural impulse? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-33"></a> We know a great deal now of
      developed or corrupted doctrine current in Ceylon, of new technical terms invented, of new
      meanings put into the older phrases. Not one single instance has yet been found of any
      such later idea, any such later form of language, any such later technical term in any one
      of the canonical books.... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-34"></a> It would seem, then, that any change
      that may have been made in these North Indian books after they had been brought into
      Ceylon must have been insignificant. It would be a great advantage if we should be able to
      find even one or two instances of such changes. We should then be able to say what sort
      and degree of alteration the Ceylon scholars felt justified in making. But it is clear
      that they regarded the canon as closed. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-35"></a> While the books were in North India,
      on the other hand, and the canon was not considered closed, there is evidence of a very
      different tone. One whole book, the Katha Vatthu,[<a name="8ap" href="#n8ap">8</a>] was
      added as late as the time of Asoka; and perhaps the Parivara,[<a name="9ap" href="#n9ap">9</a>]
      a mere string of examination questions, is not much older. One story in the Peta Vatthu[<a
      name="10ap" href="#n10ap">10</a>] is about a king Pingalaka, said in the commentary to
      have reigned over Surat two hundred years after the Buddha's time; and another refers to
      an event fifty-six years after the Buddha's death. The latter is certainly in its right
      place in this odd collection of legends. The former may (as the commentator thinks) have
      been added at Asoka's Council. Even if it were, that would be proof that they thought no
      harm of then adding to the legendary matter in their texts.[<a name="11ap" href="#n11ap">11</a>]
      And the whole of the Vimana Vatthu[<a href="#n10ap">10</a>] (really only the other half
      of one and the same work), is certainly very late in tone as compared with the Nikayas. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p13-36"></a> The same must be said of two other
      short collections of ballads. One is the Buddha Vamsa,[<a href="#n10ap">10</a>] containing
      a separate poem on each of twenty-five Buddhas, supposed to have followed one another in
      succession. The other is the Cariya Pitaka,[<a href="#n10ap">10</a>] containing
      thirty-four short Jataka stories turned into verse. Both of these must also be late. For
      in the Nikayas only seven Buddhas are known; and Jatakas, in the technical sense, are
      not yet thought of. This particular set of Jatakas is also arranged on the basis of the <i>paramitas</i>,
      a doctrine that plays no part in the older books. The Ten Perfections (<i>paramitas</i>)
      are qualities a Buddha is supposed to be obliged to have acquired in the countless series
      of his previous rebirths as Bodhisatta. But this is a later notion, not found in the
      Nikayas. It gradually grew up as the Bodhisattva idea began to appeal more to the Indian
      mind. And it is interesting to find already, in these latest of the canonical books, the
      germs of what afterwards developed into the later Mahayana doctrine, to which the
      decline of Buddhism, in the opinion of Professor Bhandarkar, was eventually so greatly
      due....&quot; </font></p>

    was an American Buddhist monk. Born in Detroit, Michigan, in 1939, he studied at the
    University of Iowa, specializing in Literature and Creative Writing. He embraced Buddhism
    in 1966 in India, where he was ordained at the Bengal Buddhist Association of Calcutta,
    and spent several years as a monk in Sri Lanka. After leaving the robe in 1971, in 1980 he
    again took ordination, this time in Thailand under the Venerable Somdet Nanasamvara of
    Wat Bovornives. In 1982 he returned to Sri Lanka, living mostly in the upcountry region of
    Bandarawela. In 1988, while on a return journey to the United States to join his father
    for the latter's eightieth birthday celebration, Ven. Bodhesako died from a sudden
    intestinal hernia while in Kathmandu. <br>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="n2ap"></a> <b>2.</b> In this regard we should
    note that at the time of the Second Council, North Indian settlements had evolved in
    social differentiation to the point of being on the verge of coalescing into the
    sub-continent's first empire (the Mauryan: Chandragupta, Bindusara, Asoka, etc.) of this
    inter-glacial period. These centuries were by all accounts times of great social
    upheavals, and it may be expected that -- as with English today -- language would have
    been subject to considerable diffraction. [<a href="#2ap">Back to text</a>] </font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="n6ap"></a> <b>6.</b> The single exception,
    overlooked by Rhys Davids, is in the Udana (Khuddaka Nikaya), wherein it is stated that
    Bahiya Daruciriya travelled from his dwelling at Supparaka to Savatthi to learn the
    Buddha's Teaching. Supparaka has been identified with Sopara, a town just north of
    Bombay. However, this instance strengthens,rather than weakens, Rhys Davids' argument, for
    it shows that the compilers of the Udana, though they knew something of South India, yet
    had no interest or reason to make more than this single passing reference to it. (Compare,
    on knowledge of distant parts, M.&nbsp;93 (ii,149).) This could hardly have been the case
    had there been editorial treatment of the texts at a time when the Teaching had already
    penetrated southward into Kalinga (Orissa) and beyond. [<a href="#6ap">Back to text</a>] </font></p>

    must beware of a few mass-marketed &quot;translations&quot; (particularly of the
    Dhammapada) which grossly misrepresent the Teaching, either by gratuitously mistranslating
    certain key terminology, or by acting so free and loose with the text in general as not to
    deserve to be called a translation. [<a href="#1post">Back to text</a>] </font></td>
