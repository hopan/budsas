    face="Times New Roman"><a name="p5-1"></a><font size="6">T</font>he Pali Suttas have their
    beginning in the Deer Park at Sarnath, not far from Benares (present-day Varanasi), where
    the Buddha first taught to others that which he had himself already realized through
    proper attention and right effort. The five monks who heard that first discourse would
    have had to pay close attention in order for understanding to arise. Thus, when they were
    thereby led to see for themselves that which the Buddha had already seen -- &quot;whatever
    is of a nature to arise, all that is of a nature to cease&quot; -- they would not forget
    the words which had so stirred them. Having now overcome -- at last! -- that aversion to
    seeing as it actually is, rather than -- mistakenly -- as something else, what had always
    been <i>there</i> to be seen, they would naturally delight in those words which had led
    them to this release from the inner tension of that aversion and, delighting therein,[<a
    name="6" href="#n6">6</a>] they would remember them well.[<a name="7" href="#n7">7</a>]
    They might for their own pleasure call to mind what they had heard; they might for their
    mutual pleasure repeat it to each other[<a name="8" href="#n8">8</a>] -- as we ourselves
    might often recall and recount something which has given us delight -- but they would not
    yet be doing so in order to instruct; for there was as yet but one teacher: the Buddha.
    All that was taught was what he taught; and there was therefore as yet no variance in the
    expression of that Teaching. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p5-2"></a> There came a time -- probably a few
    weeks later -- when as many as sixty, having been instructed, had come to full realization
    and now lived the holy life (<i>brahmacariya</i>) fulfilled as monks in the Buddha's
    Order. It was at this time that the Buddha spoke his oft-quoted instructions: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Monks, I am freed from all shackles, both heavenly
      and human. Monks, you too are freed from both heavenly and human shackles. Wander, monks,
      for the benefit, the happiness of the manyfolk, out of compassion for the world, for the
      welfare, the benefit, the happiness of royalty and men. Let not two go by one way. Teach
      the Teaching, monks, that in both word and spirit is wholesome in its beginning, wholesome
      its middle, wholesome in its conclusion. Proclaim a holy life that is utterly perfect and
      pure. There are beings with little dust in their eyes who, not hearing the Teaching, will
      be lost. But some will understand...&quot;[<a name="9" href="#n9">9</a>] </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p5-3"></a></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus the monks dispersed, to teach according to their
    individual abilities and proclivities.[<a name="10" href="#n10">10</a>] At first they may
    have repeated, for the most part, what they remembered. Surely they would differ in what
    they recalled. Surely they would differ in what they chose to repeat. Here a discourse
    would be repeated only in summary; there it would be given in full; elsewhere it would be
    expanded and expounded upon. As the monks gained in communicative skills, as they learned
    to recognize which facets of the Teaching best suited various auditors, they would -- at
    least some of them -- have supplemented or supplanted the remembered words of the Buddha
    with their own descriptions of &quot;the way things are&quot;, and many discourses by
    disciples have been preserved for us. The insight would be the same, but the descriptions
    would differ, depending on both the occasion and the individuals.[<a name="11" href="#n11">11</a>]
    And thus as the Teaching spread there would have been, unavoidably, a growing diversity in
    what was taught and remembered. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p5-4"></a> It could not have been long before
    there came to be monks in the Order who, though earnest, had not yet seen the Teaching for
    themselves. These would not have taken the same delight in the discourses as those whose
    insight had penetrated the Teaching thoroughly. Nor would they have had the same faculties
    for remembering them, for knowing the essentials, and for avoiding <i>mis</i>-remembering
    them. And hence there arose the need not only for listening but for <i>learning</i>. For
    unless the talks were memorized -- in those days there was neither paper nor ink -- those
    new monks might have, between themselves, exchanged naught but misconceptions and, in
    solitude foundered in confusion. Thus we find throughout the Suttas dozens of passages in
    which the need for learning, repeating and committing to memory is stressed and praise is
    given those with such learning, usually with the warning that <i>mere</i> learning,
    without application is inadequate.[<a name="12" href="#n12">12</a>] </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p5-5"></a> There were some who excelled at
    teaching, who were particularly inclined to do so, and who possessed those outward
    qualities which attract followings. Thus there arose large companies of monks each of
    which became separated from the others both by geography and by lifestyle. Some were
    forest dwellers, others lived near a town; some were sedentary, others roamed about; and
    so according to the preferences of each teacher, each company would have developed its own
    body of memorized discourses, with its own framework of summations and expansions, each
    group of teachings possessed of its own set phrases, conventions, and methods of
    exposition. Certain aspects of this variance and diversity would have been, among the
    as-yet-unenlightened, a source for confusion and disagreements. Indeed, some of these
    differences have been recorded. See, for example, the Bahuvedaniya Sutta, M.&nbsp;59
    (i,396-400) = S.&nbsp;XXXVI,19 (iv,223-28), wherein the Buddha settles a doctrinal dispute
    by explaining how it is that the various teachings he has set forth about feelings are,
    though different, not contradictory. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p5-6"></a> The Teaching was at this time
    established; it was well-remembered; it had spread. But it was as yet unco-ordinated,
    unstandardized; it was as yet not gathered together. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
    <br>
    <a name="thevenerable"></a> <font size="+2"><b>The Venerable Ananda</b></font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p6-1"></a> Within the first year after the
    Buddha's enlightenment, there entered the Order that individual who, apart from the Buddha
    himself, was best equipped to influence the development of the Suttas as an organized body
    of teachings, and to whom we therefore owe an immense debt. Without Venerable Ananda it
    is possible that we would not have the Suttas today at all. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p6-2"></a> Venerable Ananda, cousin of the
    Buddha, went forth from the lay life not long after the Buddha had visited his kinsmen,
    the Sakyans, at Kapilavatthu, where both had grown up; and from the time of his going
    forth it would seem that Venerable Ananda spent most of his time near the Buddha. Indeed,
    for the last twenty-five years of the Buddha's ministry Venerable Ananda served as the
    Buddha's devoted personal attendant, following him &quot;like a shadow&quot; -- Thag.
    1041-1043. He did many services for the Buddha, and he also did one for us: he listened. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p6-3"></a> At that time many people called on the
    Buddha: monks and nuns, lay followers, kings and ministers, even adherents of other
    teachers. Some asked for guidance or explanations, some made conversation or put to him
    prepared questions just to hear what the Buddha might say, and some even challenged and
    debated with him. To all, the Buddha taught about suffering and about the way to put an
    end to suffering. Some of these people became enlightened[<a name="13" href="#n13">13</a>]
    right then and there, while listening to the Buddha: M.&nbsp;140 (iii,247), etc. Others
    would bear in mind what had been said and, thinking it over and applying it, would achieve
    enlightenment at some later time: A.&nbsp;VIII,30 (iv,228-35), etc. Still others never
    succeeded to this extent but improved themselves and obtained a bright rebirth:
    S.&nbsp;XL,10 (iv,269-80), etc. And some, of course, went away without having benefited at
    all by their meeting: M.&nbsp;18 (i,109), etc. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p6-4"></a> To all these people the Buddha spoke
    only about suffering and the path leading to the end of suffering, but he did so in many
    different ways, explaining himself using various approaches. We must all begin from where
    we are; but we are not all in the same place, spiritually, when we begin. Different people
    will respond to different forms of expression. It is important to remember, when reading
    these Suttas, that they were not spoken in a vacuum: there was an actual person, or
    people, sitting before the Buddha, and what the Buddha said was spoken with the aim of
    resolving a particular conflict, usually internal. If we forget this point, we leave
    ourselves open to the danger of misconceiving the Teaching in mechanistic terms as an
    impersonal explanation rather than as good advice on how to live, and on how to develop a
    view of things that is free from attachment and unhappiness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p6-5"></a> So the Buddha explained about
    ignorance, conceit and suffering in many different ways; and Ananda was there. And he not
    only listened, he also remembered. So he did two services for us. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p6-6"></a> Among the monks the custom arose of
    teaching each other their favourite discourses through the techniques of sequential and
    simultaneous recitation, practices still found today. Venerable Ananda took a particular
    interest in talks worthy of preservation, and with his great capacity for recall[<a
    name="14" href="#n14">14</a>] he learned many discourses delivered by his fellow monks, as
    well as those given by the Buddha, thereby increasing his value as a repository of the
    Teaching.[<a name="15" href="#n15">15</a>] Since, further, he was well known as a monk who
    had heard much, learned much, and was approachable, willing to help whenever he could,
    there can be no doubt that he was often asked by others to teach them discourses or just
    to recite them so that they might be heard. So he taught others -- e.g. S.&nbsp;XXII,90
    (iii,133-4); A.&nbsp;IX,42 (iv,449) -- and helped to spread the Teaching among both his
    contemporaries and those who followed after. This is a third service by which we are
    indebted to Venerable Ananda. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p6-7"></a> The question had to arise: in what
    form should these discourses be taught? Clearly they could not include every word that had
    been spoken[<a name="16" href="#n16">16</a>] -- at least not in the case of every single
    Sutta -- lest the learning become so cumbersome as to be self-defeating. Although
    mindfulness is central to the practice of the Buddha's Teaching (S.&nbsp;XLVI,53 (v,115)),
    monks were not all equally gifted in the ability to memorize: the discourses had to be put
    into a format conducive to their being accurately remembered, while at the same time
    preserving their essence as teachings. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p6-8"></a> The solution that was chosen[<a
    name="17" href="#n17">17</a>] was to remove superfluous matters, to condense what had been
    said, to crystallize those aspects of the Teaching which are found repeatedly -- the four
    noble truths, the eightfold path, the method of right conduct, restraint of the faculties,
    mindfulness, the various levels of meditation, the five aggregates, dependent origination,
    and so on -- into the most concise descriptions possible, to couch the whole of this into
    a set pattern conducive to memorization, and to introduce as much repetition and
    re-iteration as possible. A typical Sutta, then, will begin by telling where the discourse
    took place, it will introduce the person or persons concerned and provide us with any
    other information necessary; then the theme will be stated concisely; each aspect of the
    theme will then be brought forward in its turn, repeated, developed with a copious use of
    synonyms, expanded, summarized and re-iterated. Similes may be introduced, in which case
    by means of parallel construction with the subject matter their relevance will be
    unmistakable. Each possible permutation will be dealt with in turn, the opening thematic
    statement will be recapitulated, and the Sutta will then conclude with remarks usually of
    approval and pleasure. The purpose is clear: to make absolutely certain that the matter at
    hand is stated so clearly that an intelligent person, open-minded, willing to listen, not
    bent on his own views, could not possibly misunderstand.[<a name="18" href="#n18">18</a>]
    Thus the arising of stock material and techniques, and also their spread, as they came
    into usage among the various companies of monks that flourished, took place during and not
    only after the Buddha's ministry, although, as we shall see, their influence was with
    limitations: there were those companies that kept to their own forms. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p6-9"></a> Some find the Suttas, with all of
    their re-iteration, excruciatingly boring. &quot;This,&quot; they suggest, &quot;could
    hardly be the message of a Fully Enlightened One.&quot; They suppose that because they
    themselves are not enthralled that therefore the message cannot be that of a Buddha. Not
    only do they fault the method, but the message as well; for were the message --
    renunciation -- delightful to them, its repetition would hardly be objectionable. But when
    the idea of non-attachment is appreciated and approved of, then in both their message and
    their method the Suttas will be found to be both memorable and rememberable.[<a name="19"
    href="#n19">19</a>] </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
    <br>
    <a name="thefour"></a> <font size="+2"><b>The Four Nikayas</b></font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p7-1"></a> Each company had its own core of
    favourite Suttas, which newcomers would learn at least in part. Some of these discourses
    would be derived from talks by the company's own teacher or stories of local monastic
    history; others would be drawn from the stock common to all groups. Thus we would expect
    few companies -- probably none -- not to have within their ranks those who could recite
    one version or another of such standard texts as deal in full or in brief with &quot;the
    gradual teaching,&quot; &quot;the foundations of mindfulness,&quot; and so on. However, we
    would also expect that from the common pool each company would choose largely not only
    those discourses whose subject matter appealed to them but also the <i>type</i> of
    discourse that appealed to them. Thus some groups would learn brief and pithy sayings
    while others would prefer discourses which developed their subject matter in detail. Still
    others would gravitate towards texts in which subject matter was intertwined with
    character and event, resulting in a story-form. This latter sort of text would have
    particularly appealed to monks living near villages or towns on two grounds. First, such
    monks would have had the leisure to learn these generally longer Suttas, for life near the
    towns is easier than life in remote jungle thickets; and second, when the laity would
    assemble on the new- and full-moon observance days, they would find such Suttas more
    interesting to listen to than those with little characterization and story. Hence it is
    the case that the collection of discourses which are long, called the Digha Nikaya,
    does, in fact, address itself to matters of concern to the laity far more frequently than
    any of the other collections. Indeed, nearly half the discourses in this collection are
    addressed to laypeople, and in most others layfolk play a significant role. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p7-2"></a> Life in the forest is not as easy as
    life near a town. Aside from time devoted to meditation, there are many time-consuming
    chores. Forest monks would have less time for the learning of long discourses and perhaps,
    less inclination: not only are forest monks often more given to meditation than are
    village monks, they are also less frequently visited by laypeople, and therefore have less
    need to accommodate lay interests. Many of them, however, would wish to know discourses
    which dealt instructively in detail with a subject. Thus, one who is practising perception
    of emptiness would likely find it worthwhile to learn at least one of the discourses which
    develops this theme.[<a name="20" href="#n20">20</a>] Many forest monks would wish to have
    at hand, for reference in their practice as well as for the joy of associating with the
    Good Teaching (<i>saddhamma</i>), discourses that consisted of something more than a pithy
    saying, but which yet were more concerned with instruction than with story and
    characterization. They would learn Suttas of a moderate length, and they would choose
    subject matter in accordance with the interests they were pursuing. Hence there is a
    collection of discourses which are of middle length (Majjhima Nikaya), rich in variety of
    subject matter, but of less immediate relevance to the concerns of the laity than the
    longer discourses, and in which the laity play a much smaller role, less than a quarter of
    these talks are addressed to laypeople. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p7-3"></a> Naturally many teachers taught by way
    of a particular subject, such as the practice of reflection in regard to the sense
    faculties, or the holding aggregates, or feelings, etc. As today, then, too, the followers
    of each teacher would of course take particular interest in learning discourses that
    pertained to the subject that concerned them or to some other point of interest: nuns
    would learn discourses involving nuns; the monks living in the forest of Kosala would
    remember events and talks which took place there, and so on. Hence there tended to
    coalesce, with no planning necessary, collections of discourses grouped according to
    subject matter, and today these exist as the Samyutta Nikaya. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p7-4"></a> We see, as we inquire into the
    Buddha's Teaching, that it is much given to enumeration: three kinds of feeling, four
    right efforts, five powers, six senses, seven factors of enlightenment, the eightfold
    path, and so on. This may be regarded as a device to serve both mnemonic and pedagogical
    purposes. Thus, the meditation levels known as <i>jhanas</i> are almost always enumerated
    as four and almost always described in accordance with a set pattern. That they need not
    be so enumerated and described is suggested by the Upakkilesa Sutta, M.&nbsp;188 (iii,162)
    (among others), wherein the same range of concentrative attainments is described in six
    stages. <a name="sekha"></a> Again, the usual description of those who have seen truth but
    not yet achieved full purification (i.e. the <i>sekha</i>, trainee, or <i>ariyasavaka</i>,
    noble disciple) is three-fold (viz, Stream-enterer, Once-returner, Non-returner); but at
    A.&nbsp;IX,12 (iv,380-1) we are given a nine-fold division. That these categories are in
    fact not invariably described according to their usual formulations is strong evidence
    that they need not be. (Again, higher than actuality stands possibility.) Since the
    purpose of the Buddha's Teaching is neither to classify nor to analyze but to lead one to
    see something about oneself, classification is used only for its mnemonic and pedagogical
    value, though herein its value is great. There are discourses which teach non-attachment
    to feeling and other aspects of experience without making any enumerations: S.&nbsp;XII,12
    (ii,13); XXXVI,4 (iv,206-7); 21 (iv,230-1), etc. The stock descriptions are commonly given
    because it was found to be generally easier, to use them both as an aid to memory and in
    the service of one's own practice. It would be expected, then, that some monks would avail
    themselves of this numerical device, which is an Indian literary style also found in
    non-Buddhist texts: Jaina Thananga is an example, and so would learn discourses
    according to the number of items discussed. Hence today there exists a collection of
    discourses arranged numerically, up to eleven: the Anguttara Nikaya.[<a name="21"
    href="#n21">21</a>] </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p7-5"></a> We can see, then, that even during the
    life of the Buddha these discourses were not distributed randomly: already they must have
    been organized, in an embryonic form, along the lines in which we now have them. Indeed,
    the texts themselves refer -- A.&nbsp;III,20 (i,117) etc. -- to <i>dhammadhara</i>, <i>vinayadhara</i>,
    <i>matikadhara</i>, or those who keep (=&nbsp;learn) the Teaching, those who keep the
    Discipline, and those who keep the Summaries, i.e. the Patimokkha. Their formal
    organization would not have been a radical and innovative leap, but the logical next step
    in a process that had already developed to some extent. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p7-6"></a> However, the Suttas were probably not
    formally organized into Nikayas during the Buddha's lifetime. During that time the Canon
    was still decidedly open and growing. When they became unwieldy in volume, then no doubt
    some loose organization was evolved -- &quot;Let <i>this</i> company learn <i>these</i>
    discourses; let <i>that</i> company learn <i>those</i> discourses&quot; -- but any formal
    structure would have been continuously interrupted, requiring recomposition in order to
    accommodate popular and important new discourses. Thus the Suttas never refer to
    themselves in terms of the Nikayas that we now have. <a name="nine-fold"></a> Rather, we
    find fairly often a nine-fold division of the texts: discourses, mixed prose and verse,
    expositions, verses, solemn utterances, sayings, birth stories, marvels, catechisms (<i>sutta</i>,
    <i>geyya</i>, <i>veyyakarana</i>, <i>gatha</i>, <i>udana</i>, <i>itivuttaka</i>, <i>jataka</i>,
    <i>abbhutadhamma</i>, <i>vedalla</i> -- M.&nbsp;22 (i,133), etc. This is not to suggest
    that the texts were ever organized along this nine-fold division The classification is
    probably taken from the broad tradition of monasticism existent at that time.[<a name="22"
    href="#n22">22</a>] This tradition no doubt included criteria according to which teachings
    could be judged, and the texts sometimes demonstrate (often to non-Buddhist ascetics, e.g.
    the wanderer, later the Venerable Vacchagotta at M.&nbsp;73 (i,489-97)) that the Teaching
    was complete in all its parts as judged by these standards (see also A.&nbsp;VII,55
    (iv,82-84)). But the use of this nine-fold classification shows that the texts do, in
    fact, describe themselves. Therefore their failure to do so in terms of Nikayas
    demonstrates that such a division did not come into existence until after the Canon was no
    longer fully open, i.e. after the Buddha's decease. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="n11"></a> <b>11.</b> See S.&nbsp;XXXV,204
    (iv,91-95), wherein four monks give four different answers, all commendable by the wise,
    to the question, &quot;To what extent is vision well-purified?&quot; See also the Maha
    Gosinga Sutta, M.&nbsp;32 (i,212-29). [<a href="#11">Back to text</a>] </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="n12"></a> <b>12.</b> E.g. Venerable Ananda:
    &quot;Here, friend Sariputta, a monk has mastered the Teaching...; the Teaching thus
    heard, thus mastered, he teaches to others in detail, he makes others recite in detail, he
    makes them repeat in detail. The Teaching thus heard, thus mastered he thinks and ponders
    upon in his heart and considers by mind. In whatever lodgings dwell monks who are learned,
    going by the rule, keepers of the Teaching, of the Discipline, of the Summaries, he comes
    to those lodgings (to stay) for the rainy-season (retreat). Approaching them from time to
    time he inquires and questions (of those monks): 'Sir, what is the purpose of this talk?'
    Those venerable ones disclose to him the undisclosed make clear the unclear, dispel doubt
    regarding multifarious doubtful things. In this way, friend Sariputta, a monk may hear a
    Teaching he has not heard; and Teachings he has (already) heard will become unconfused;
    and those earlier Teachings which had formerly touched his heart re-occur to him; and he
    recognizes what was unrecognized.&quot; -- A.&nbsp;VI,51 (iii,361-2). See also M.&nbsp;32
    (i,213). [<a href="#12">Back to text</a>] </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="n13"></a> <b>13.</b> In this essay the word
    &quot;enlightened&quot; is used of the <i>sekha</i> -- see <a href="#sekha">below</a> --
    as well as of the <i>arahat</i>, the latter being described as not only enlightened but
    also liberated. [<a href="#13">Back to text</a>] </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="n14"></a> <b>14.</b> At A.&nbsp;I,14 (i,24) is
    recorded the Buddha's declaration of Venerable Ananda as being foremost, among all monks,
    both in wide knowledge and in retentive memory, as well as in good conduct, resoluteness,
    and personal service. [<a href="#14">Back to text</a>] </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="n15"></a> <b>15.</b> In the Theragatha (v.
    1024) Venerable Ananda says that he knew 82,000 of the Buddha's discourses as well as
    2,000 by the monks. This works out, over a vigorous forty-five year ministry, to nearly
    five discourses a day. This is sizable, but many of them are but a few lines, so it is not
    impossible. However, we should bear in mind that the numerical precision so highly valued
    in Western culture has been and still is of little importance in Indian culture: these
    figures are best understood as &quot;a very great many&quot;. In India a different sort of
    precision -- Ananda's -- was valued. (See A.&nbsp;X,95 (v,193-5).) [<a href="#15">Back to

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="n16"></a> <b>16.</b> And, clearly, they do not.
    For example, in the Cula Saccaka Sutta, M.&nbsp;35 (i,227-37) we are given the account of
    a talk between the Buddha and Saccaka, who had previously boasted that in debate he would
    make the Buddha shake, shiver, tremble and sweat. We expect that in the face of such
    superior wisdom Saccaka will be reduced to silence and dismay; but in the text it requires
    but four pages of print to accomplish this. Surely Saccaka was a worthier opponent, with
    sufficient experience and skills at &quot;eel-wriggling&quot; (<i>amaravikkhepa</i>) to
    last longer than that! We must suppose that the actual talk was of greater length, and
    that the text gives us but the gist of what was said. [<a href="#16">Back to text</a>] </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="n17"></a> <b>17.</b> As to <i>how</i> it was
    chosen we are given no hint: the Suttas say nothing in this regard. Our information is
    derived entirely from the results: the Suttas are in fact constructed in the way
    described. [<a href="#17">Back to text</a>] </font></p>

    things lead to the stability, to the non-confusion, to the non-disappearance of the Good
    Teaching. Which five? Here, monks, the monks master a well-grasped discourse, well laid
    down by word and line. Monks, of what is well laid down, the purpose is well followed.
    This, monks, is the first thing that leads to the stability, to the non-confusion, to the
    non-disappearance of the Good Teaching...&quot; -- A.&nbsp;V,156 (iii,179). [<a href="#18">Back
