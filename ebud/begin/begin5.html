    </font><p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6"><a name="p12-1"></a>I</font>n spite
    of all this there are still those who will insist that the four Nikayas as we have them
    contain material that, though in the guise of earlier texts, are, in fact, later
    additions.[<a name="48" href="#n48">48</a>] Though few, perhaps, will go so far as to
    charge the monks with unscrupulous mendacity,[<a name="49" href="#n49">49</a>] some will
    nevertheless reject many texts as &quot;not original Buddhism.&quot; Their reason for
    doing so is, almost always, a personal disagreement with the descriptions or instructions
    found therein. They will often conceal this fact with phrases like &quot;historical
    doubts&quot;, but in the end it comes down to their unwillingness to believe that a Fully
    Awakened One could possibly teach anything that they themselves did not agree with. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p12-2"></a> We do not entertain such notions, for
    we have not forgotten that we started out by acknowledging our need for guidance, and we
    do not presume to know as well as (or even better than) our guide. (See Ud.&nbsp;77
    (90-1).) But even so it must be admitted that anyone, and particularly Westerners, coming
    fresh to this Teaching will almost certainly discover discourses containing material that
    sounds, to their contemporary ears, <i>improbable</i>. This is a real problem for many
    newcomers; for it is likely that they will encounter approaches and attitudes which are
    unfamiliar. Until one has mastered the unsurpassable art of acquiescence (<i>khanti</i>),
    without which learning is impossible, there will naturally be resistance to what demands
    of us that we surrender those notions and conceits which we hold most dear. This is the
    difficult part of the Teaching, and to pretend otherwise would be to do a disservice to
    both the Teaching and the inquirer. And among the first resistances to arise nowadays will
    be those involving differences in world views. Since the Teaching comes to us embedded
    within a cultural context that is in some ways alien to the viewpoint with which we are on
    comfortable and familiar terms, it is natural that we congratulate ourselves for being so
    much more advanced. It can be profoundly difficult to recognize that the truths offered by
    our own culture are neither eternal nor absolute, and need not be valued any more highly
    than other viewpoints. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p12-3"></a> An analogy: Suppose it was said that
    there exist in this very world invisible beings -- countless millions of them -- which
    have the power to affect our welfare. Some of them are helpful, but others, unfortunately,
    cause only trouble and illness. However, there are certain people who wear special
    costumes and who possess special and powerful means whereby they can actually see these
    invisible beings. Moreover, they have devised special powders and potions by means of
    which they can counteract the baneful influence of the harmful beings. True or false? Most
    Westerners have derided this notion, sometimes vehemently, with snorts and sighs aplenty.
    But suppose now it were added that these invisible beings are called &quot;germs&quot; and
    &quot;viruses&quot; and that they have been investigated by white-coated laboratory
    scientists who possess electron microscopes, and who have discovered antibiotics and other
    drugs. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p12-4"></a> &quot;Oh, but that's <i>different</i>!&quot;
    many will reply; and indeed it is. But what exactly <i>is</i> the difference? Language,
    certainly; but beyond that there is also a difference in the conceptual imagery used to
    account for the experience of illness. The imagery and vocabulary that are familiar are
    accepted while what is strange is rejected. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p12-5"></a> We do not wish to suggest by this
    analogy that the <i>only</i> difficulties in understanding the Buddha's Teaching are
    linguistic or cultural: there is, beyond them, the personal difficulty, the difficulty
    which started us on our quest. We need to assert, cherish, and develop the view that the
    real difficulty is our own failure to see, as they really are, that craving and conceit
    which are themselves the condition for our own failure to see, as they really are, that
    craving and conceit...[<a name="50" href="#n50">50</a>] But before ever coming to <i>that</i>
    difficulty a newcomer may find himself faced with thorny doubts, and he may not see the
    source of the thorns. He may assert that it rains due to appropriate meteorological
    conditions, and scoff at the Suttas' suggestion that it rains because the rain gods are
    active (A.&nbsp;V,197 (iii,243)). After all, who has ever seen a rain god? But who has
    ever seen a meteorological condition? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p12-6"></a> The difficulty may be illustrated by
    an example from the author's own experience. When I first began to inquire seriously into
    the Buddha's Teaching, I found -- in addition to much that impressed me most favourably --
    a discourse whose topic was &quot;the thirty-two marks of a great man&quot; and whose
    point (as I took it) was that these marks were <i>physical</i> and that the Buddha had
    such marks, <i>ergo</i> he was a great man. Coming from a rationalistic tradition, I was
    unable to accept this. It approached deification or worse, and seemed totally incompatible
    with the spirit of investigation that pervaded those Suttas that had most impressed me.
    Besides, some of these marks -- projecting heels, ankles midway in the legs, legs like an
    antelope's, no hollow between the shoulders, white hair growing between the eyes, head
    shaped like a turban, etc. -- seemed quite simply freakish. I asked several of the other
    young Western monks, who confessed that they, too, could not accept this discourse.
    &quot;Here,&quot; I then decided, &quot;is an <i>obvious</i> case of a later addition:
    this Sutta <i>had</i> to be invented by those who had never seen the Buddha.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p12-7"></a> This view was confirmed when I
    noticed, in the Samannaphala Sutta of the Digha that when King Ajatasattu visited the
    Buddha for the first and only recorded time, as he approached the pavilion where the
    company of monks sat, he asked his physician which one of the monks was the Buddha (i,50),
    and he was told that the Buddha was the one sitting against the middle pillar. &quot;Had
    the Buddha really been endowed with those peculiar, alien, and odious marks,&quot; I
    reasoned, &quot;the king would not have <i>had</i> to ask such a question. But even if he <i>did</i>
    ask, then the obvious answer to be given would have been that the Buddha was 'that
    funny-looking fellow in the middle'.&quot; And then I read the Dhatuvibhanga Sutta,
    M.&nbsp;140, wherein it is told how the Buddha, travelling alone, put up one night side by
    side with a monk who told him that he (the monk) was on his way to meet the Buddha for the
    first time. Only after hearing a teaching did this monk realize, from the profundity of
    the discourse, that his companion had to be the Buddha himself. &quot;<i>Surely</i>,&quot;
    I decided, &quot;if the Buddha had been endowed with those absurd marks, this monk would
    have known at once who his companion was.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p12-8"></a> And so I set aside that discourse on
    the thirty-two marks, and all was well, until ... I discovered <i>another</i> Sutta on the
    same subject, and then <i>another</i>, and <i>another</i>, and finally I realized (with
    some dismay) that the subject was dealt with, sometimes more than once, in every Nikaya
    except the Samyutta. Had it appeared only once, or maybe twice, I could have set it aside
    as an oddity and forgotten about it; but here it was popping up all over the place! My
    appreciation of the other discourses had been growing as their methodology became
    gradually more familiar and comfortable; but now my confidence in the authenticity of the
    collection as a whole was shaken. What was I to do? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p12-9"></a> &quot;Leave it alone,&quot; I was
    advised. &quot;Use the Suttas for what they're for: right-view guidance. There's no Sutta
    that teaches the existence of a permanent condition, or of a pleasurable condition, or of
    anything that can be taken as self. Don't reject what's precious just because you think
    you see a few wrinkles in it.&quot; And so for many years I did my best to ignore those
    &quot;thirty-two marks&quot; discourses and tried to make use of what was manifestly
    valuable. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p12-10"></a> During those years I came to a
    growing understanding of the importance of putting trust in one's teacher (see note <a
    href="begin1.html#n5b">5b</a>) and a growing conviction that
    &quot;they who have faith in the Buddha have faith in the highest: they who have faith in
    the highest have the highest results.&quot; -- A.&nbsp;IV,34 (ii,34) The Buddha knew that
    those who, trusting his advice, lived in accordance with it would do themselves the most
    good and therefore, with no conceit whatsoever, out of compassion for others, he did and
    said that which would achieve this end. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p12-11"></a> Everyone can and does change his
    appearance to some extent, as the situation requires. For example, when called in by the
    boss for a tongue-lashing, one may quite literally make oneself smaller by hunching the
    shoulders, etc., perhaps without even being aware of it; but when showing off before
    friends one may &quot;walk tall&quot;. Anyone who has practised meditation even to a
    modest extent is likely to come to an appreciation of the enormous powers that are
    available to one proficient in advanced levels of meditation. It becomes an easy matter to
    accept that the Buddha, or for that matter anyone meditatively advanced, even one who has
    not achieved enlightenment -- Devadatta, for example, could alter his appearance to a far
    greater extent than most people, even to the extent of appearing with all thirty-two
    marks. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p12-12"></a> These mark, each of those discourses
    tells us, belong to the lore of the brahmana caste. The Suttas, it seems, never assert
    the <i>correctness</i> of this lore; nor do they digress into a refutation of it. In each
    case a brahmana came to the Buddha intent upon judging the Buddha's worth as a teacher by
    whether he had these marks.[<a name="51" href="#n51">51</a>] Knowing that appearances
    don't matter but that rightly-placed confidence is of great value, the Buddha, it would
    seem, let those brahmanas see what would convince them of the truth that he is the
    &quot;incomparable trainer of men to be tamed&quot; and thereby won them over to
    acceptance of right conduct and, in some instances, to enlightenment: e.g. the brahmana
    Pokkharasadi of the Ambattha Sutta, D.&nbsp;3. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p12-13"></a> I am still not particularly
    impressed that the Buddha could display those thirty-two marks that the brahmanas
    believed to be the signs of a great man, for I suspect that even Devadatta could have done
    so; but these Suttas were not addressed to me. They were intended to inspire faith in the
    brahmanas, who believed in their lore as we do in ours. More impressive is the display of
    wisdom that uses, rather than disputes with, cultural limitations to lead one to what
    transcends such limitations. I still have no special use in my own practice for those
    &quot;thirty-two marks&quot; Suttas, nor for others which, it seems, are also intended for
    those with a different sensibility -- e.g. D.&nbsp;14 on previous Buddhas and the birth of
    Bodhisattas; M.&nbsp;129 on hell-realms and world-monarchs -- but they are no longer a
    basis for doubt and scepticism, or a barrier to acquiescence in what is beneficial.[<a
    name="52" href="#n52">52</a>] The lesson being, that it is not an act of wisdom to judge
    and reject discourses on the basis of personal preference or belief (ref. the Kalama
    Sutta, A.&nbsp;III,65 (i,188-93)), for if we do so, we then lose the possibility of
    transcending those preferences and beliefs. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p12-14"></a> Is it possible, then, to set forth a
    reasonable standard whereby, when we find ourselves encountering one of those &quot;thorny
    barriers,&quot; we can act reasonably? Perhaps the following will be relevant. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p12-15"></a> Having already acquired an overview
    of the Suttas -- as one might inspect the general contours of a road map prior to setting
    out on a journey, without excessive concern for specific details -- we will have noticed
    that certain passages are found repeatedly, with little variation, throughout the four
    Nikayas. If we have the Buddha's Teaching at all, then surely we have it here: it would
    be the wildest irresponsibility to assume that the gist of the Teaching is found only
    outside these core texts. Not only must we accept them as authentic, but also as
    fundamental, of the essence, for why else would they be so often repeated? These texts can
    be trusted as being that right-view guidance we have been seeking. Should any of these
    oft-repeated discourses seem discrepant with one another or with our own views, then this
    is evidence that there is a difficulty in our own understanding which needs to be
    uncovered and resolved or abandoned. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p12-16"></a> We should be in no rush to judge.
    These Teachings cannot be understood except from their own point of view, and coming to
    understand that point of view is a growth that takes, usually, more time than we think it
    will. And we should be careful to take the Suttas quite literally, as saying what they
    mean and meaning what they say. They speak often of knowing both the letter and the
    spirit; nowhere do they advise an interpretive approach. We need to change ourselves, not
    the world, and the world includes the Suttas. To interpret is still to follow our own
    notions, rather than right-view guidance. Indeed, to interpret is to <i>deny</i>
    (&quot;...when he says <i>black</i> what he <i>really</i> means is...&quot; ). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p12-17"></a> With this background established,
    then those discourses which are found but once or twice can be considered. The bulk of
    them will present no difficulty. They will be seen to be in accordance with the
    root-texts, being variations or expansions on a theme, as too will those texts which we
    have identified as later additions to the four Nikayas. But should any of them seem to be
    in contradiction with one's own understanding, then there is an opportunity to examine
    that understanding, to discover what needs to be surrendered.[<a name="53" href="#n53">53</a>]
    However, if one is not yet at a stage of development where such acquiescence is possible,
    then that Sutta can be set aside, which is not to say rejected, until a time when
    understanding and calmness have been developed sufficiently so that a reconsideration of
    the text will be useful. By following such a practice one can come to know that, indeed,
    this Teaching is well-expounded, immediate, non-temporal, evident, leading, to be known
    individually by the wise. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p12-18"></a> We set out in search of a guide
    whereby we could find the way to resolve the root-problem of our personal existence. We
    have discovered that the Teaching of a Fully Awakened One is at hand, and that there is
    reason to trust, not reason to doubt, that Teaching. What remains is to put that Teaching
    to use, make it a personal reality. Restraint, renunciation and purification are
    difficult, not easy. But indulgence, attachment and defilements can never lead to
    happiness and peace. What needs to be done is clear. We have reached an end of our inquiry
    ready, at last, to begin. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="n48"></a> <b>48.</b> Early and later Sanskrit
    Sutras of Mahayana as well a Tibetan scriptures and other late traditions are full of
    this. Those who wish to defend these traditions have been known to assume quite
    gratuitously that since these other traditions are manifestly full of invented material
    that the Pali Suttas must be also. But if the preceding account is largely correct, then
    this view must be erroneous. If such a view is nevertheless insisted upon, then its
    proponents would need to offer a description of the evolution of the Pali Suttas
    demonstrating a reasonable and human sequence alternative to the one offered herein. Such
    an account would have to be in accord not only with reason but with the known facts. Even
    if such an account were made, it could be at best an alternative interpretation, in no way
    devaluing what has been presented here; but to our knowledge such a description has never
    even been offered. [<a href="#48">Back to text</a>] </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="n49"></a> <b>49.</b> To such a distasteful charge
    there can (and should) be no reply (see A.&nbsp;IV,42 (ii,46)), for it is a product of the
    same attitude which seeks to understand the world in terms of conspiracies. If dishonesty
    is <i>assumed</i> then &quot;evidence&quot; will <i>inevitably</i> be
    &quot;discovered&quot; to confirm the assumption. The only way to resolve such a dilemma
    is to explore carefully the need to make the assumption in the first place. [<a href="#49">Back

    &quot;thirty-two marks&quot; Suttas will probably satisfy those who come to the Teaching
    from a rationalistic culture; but there may well be other explanations, suited to those
    with a different background, no less valid than what is offered here. Whatever increases
    faith in right-view guidance is proper. &quot;They who have faith in the noble eightfold
