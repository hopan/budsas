    face="Times New Roman" size="6">I</font><font face="Times New Roman">n the entire Vana
    Samyutta (IX (i,197-205)) we find no mention of the Buddha. And all but one of these
    fourteen discourses take place in Kosala. The monks living in the woods (<i>vana</i>) of
    Kosala apparently managed to get their own local tradition, much involved with deities,
    included in the Canon. So apparently did the followers of Venerable Sariputta, for
    although elsewhere in the Nikayas he is found frequently in discussion with the Buddha,
    in the Sariputta Samyutta (XXVIII (iii,235-40)) none of the ten discourses make mention
    of the Teacher; nine of them take place in Savatthi. Similarly the four consecutive
    Samyuttas (XXXVIII-XLI) named after, respectively, the wanderers Jambukhadaka and
    Samandaka, each containing sixteen conversations with Venerable Sariputta, the first set
    entirely in Magadha, the second among the Vajjians; Venerable Maha Moggallana, eleven
    discourses, all set in Savatthi, and the lay disciple Citta, ten discourses, all set at
    Macchikasanda, are apparently later additions to the Samyutta Nikaya of discourses
    already in existence when the First Council met, but not compiled by them. It should be
    noted that the Suttas concerned with Citta clearly reveal attitudes of lay devotees rather
    than of monks. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p9-13"></a> And there are further examples in
    both the Samyutta and Anguttara Nikayas; but we need not investigate them, for we can see
    by now that the method whereby any new material could be inserted into the collections had
    to involve a consensus as to its suitability and also to include in each case a
    &quot;warning label&quot; -- &quot;Venerable So-and-so was dwelling at...&quot; -- that
    the discourse is not part of the original compilation. There are about 200 such
    discourses, filling roughly 350 pages of print, which is about six per cent of the total. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p9-14"></a> And by the same evidence we can know
    that neither was any material lost nor were any of the Suttas arbitrarily altered. For
    exactly the same mechanism that required consensus in order to add to the Canon would have
    come into force had any attempt been made to alter a text. And we can well imagine the
    difficulty, the virtual impossibility from the very outset, of such a consensus being
    achieved in order to alter what had been laid down by those very monks who were venerated
    as the founders of the various lineages (see S.&nbsp;XIV,15 (ii,155-7)). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p9-15"></a> In order for any Sutta or part of a
    Sutta to have been lost, we should have to suppose either a collective amnesia among all
    the monks of all the companies who were reciters of that Sutta -- hundreds, or more
    probably thousands of ambulatory amnesiacs! -- or else the breaking up and disappearance
    of every single company responsible for a certain portion of the Suttas -- and this in a
    time when all the evidence indicates that the Order was thriving and growing -- together
    with the refusal or inability of any single monk (or ex-monk) from any of those lost
    companies to come forward to teach the texts to the surviving groups. A most improbable
    combination of events! No, the evidence shows clearly that there were additions to the
    texts, but to suppose either substantial changes or losses is contrary to reason. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p9-16"></a> It must be emphasized primarily for
    the benefit of scholarly readers that we did not begin by assuming that Suttas which do
    not refer to the Buddha in their introductory material are therefore later additions to
    the Canon. Rather, we first discovered a few Suttas that certainly describe events that
    had taken place after the Buddha's decease. Examining them, we noticed that they possessed
    one feature in common and in distinction to the great majority of discourses. We then
    looked at other texts which also displayed this feature and found therein further grounds
    to accept that those texts, too, were probably later additions to the Canon. We described
    in detail the evidence found in several of these texts and indicated in brief other Suttas
    providing additional evidence; but we do not propose to present the data to be found in a
    number of other texts, for to do so would require a very long and technical and
    uninteresting digression. We will note only that this evidence consists of a large number
    of small, and a few not-so-small, points, all tending in the same direction, with no cases
    of an opposite tendency.[<a name="35" href="#n35">35</a>] </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p9-17"></a> For how long did this process of slow
    accretion continue? We can be quite certain that by the time of the Second Council which
    met a century after the Buddha's decease, the process had already ended, the four Nikayas
    being regarded as closed, and that this view was ratified and finalized by that Council.
    The evidence: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p9-18"></a> All additional Suttas involve
    &quot;first generation&quot; monks, i.e. contemporaries of the Buddha but who, in some
    cases, outlived the Teacher.[<a name="36" href="#n36">36</a>] The only instance which can
    reasonably be considered an exception is that of Venerable Narada, whose talk with King
    Munda -- Ajatasattu's great-grandson, according to later accounts -- is recorded at
    A.&nbsp;V,50 (iii,57-62). However, even in this case we have a discourse at S.&nbsp;XII,68
    (ii,115-8) -- clearly earlier than the Anguttara Sutta, for there he is said to be already
    a worthy one (<i>arahat</i>), i.e. fully liberated, whereas here he is self-described as
    not yet <i>arahat</i>, still a <i>sekha</i> -- where Venerable Ananda also has a part. So
    if Venerable Narada was not contemporaneous with the Buddha, he was at least not far from
    it. Venerable Narada's discourse to King Munda is, as we have it, identical to a
    discourse to the monks spoken by the Buddha: A.&nbsp;V,48 (iii,54-56). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p9-19"></a> Later sources tell us that it was
    during the time of Kalasoka, the third Magadhese king after Munda, that the Second
    Council convened. The Vinaya's description of this Council is much more detailed than, and
    about twice the length of, its report on the First Council. The impetus for the meeting
    was the exposure and condemnation of certain relaxations of monastic discipline which had
    arisen among a company of monks centred in Vesali, the famous &quot;ten points&quot;,
    the most important of which concerned a relaxation of the prohibition against
    &quot;accepting, using, or consenting to the deposit of money&quot;. We are told of the
    politicking that went on before the Council met, and we are introduced to the main players
    in that drama, the leading monks of the day. Not one of these eight monks nor any of the
    lesser monks mentioned is known to the four Nikayas. If the four Nikayas had been then
    regarded as open to additional material, surely we would expect to find <i>these</i> monks
    represented.[<a name="37" href="#n37">37</a>] </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p9-20"></a> What happened is clear: however
    highly these monks might have been regarded individually, for of course some of them would
    have achieved full purification, those monks who were not contemporaries of the Buddha
    could never achieve the distinction of those who had known him personally. Later monks
    belonged, inevitably, to a particular lineage which (like caste) could not be transcended.
    Only the founding elders, those who had established the lineages, could be regarded as
    beyond those lines. If the doings and sayings of these second generation monks were
    admitted to the Nikayas, where would it end? The decision that needed to be reached if
    the Nikayas were to survive at all was that with the passing of the first generation the
    collections <i>had</i> to be closed. Had they been left open they would have become
    amorphous and protean -- not to be confused with &quot;rich and varied&quot;! -- and would
    have lost their very purpose. Therefore whatever pressures may have developed to
    incorporate this or that &quot;second generation&quot; discourse needed to be opposed and
    obviously were. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
    <br>
    <a name="thefifth"></a> <font size="+2"><b>The Fifth Nikaya</b></font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p10-1"></a> The material which was admitted to
    the Four Nikayas during the first century after the Buddha was but a fraction of what was
    remembered. Much of this material, which included a great deal of verse,[<a name="38"
    href="#n38">38</a>] must have been in common circulation, the preserve of no single
    lineage or group of companies; <a name="references"></a> for within the four Nikayas and
    also within the Vinaya we find not only one Sutta referring to another[<a name="39"
    href="#n39">39</a>] but also, here and there, Suttas referring to material which lies
    outside the first four Nikayas.[<a name="40" href="#n40">40</a>] There was also new
    material being generated to fulfil new needs as with the Payasi Sutta on rebirth, or to
    describe new events as with Ven. Narada's talk to King Munda. What was to be done with
    all of this? To add substantially to the Nikayas would have established an unfortunate
    precedent leading to the inevitable dissipation of their integrity; yet to leave the
    material disorganized would be to abandon much that was worthy to an early destruction.
    The solution chosen was the creation of the fifth collection, the Khuddaka Nikaya. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p10-2"></a> <i>Khuddaka</i> means
    &quot;small&quot; and at first the Khuddaka Nikaya was indeed small. Today, with fifteen
    separate sections, it is the most voluminous of the Nikayas, but originally it consisted
    of probably six or seven separate short texts, each of which had been compiled and
    preserved, prior to inclusion in the Nikaya, individually on its own merits. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p10-3"></a> The Theragatha and Therigatha,
    for instance, consist of the verses of various monks and nuns, respectively. Here there
    can be no doubt that some of the verses are by second generation disciples (e.g. Venerable
    Parapariya's verses, 920-948), and that the texts grew substantially after the First
    Council. This is only to be expected: the two collections do not pretend otherwise. The
    Dhammapada is a collection of popular verses. Quite a few are to be found elsewhere among
    the Suttas, but as many or more are unique to this compilation. Most of the verses stand
    alone, unconnected to the others. We have no direct evidence as to the date of its
    closure, but the arrangement and distribution of the verses suggest that it could well
    have grown during the first century. The Sutta Nipata is, like the Dhammapada, a
    collection of popular verse, but it differs in that its verses form longer poems, each of
    which is regarded as a discourse. Indeed, some of them have prose attached, as a sort of
    introductory bunting. A few of the poems appear within the four Nikayas; the remainder
    are the most popular of those longer poems that are not included therein. As such, a
    number of its passages are quoted within the four Nikayas (as noted <a href="#references">above</a>),
    which has given rise to the mistaken view that the Sutta Nipata contains the &quot;oldest
    layer&quot; of texts. Certainly some of the Sutta Nipata texts are contemporaneous with
    the first four Nikayas, but they do not <i>pre</i>-date them.[<a name="41" href="#n41">41</a>]
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p10-4"></a> The Udana is a collection of eighty
    solemn utterances spoken by the Buddha on special occasions. The Itivuttaka contains 112
    short Suttas, each accompanied by verses, the relevance of which is not always apparent.
    This fact together with some seeming textual corruptions suggest that it may have had an
    older and independent life before being incorporated into the Khuddaka Nikaya. If this is
    so, it indicates what happened to those texts that did not receive the formal protection
    of organization. </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The Jataka contains only the verses connected with
      the 547 tales of previous existences of the Buddha. The (prose) tales are in a commentary
      of the fifth century A.D., which claims to be translated from Sinhalese (to Pali).... <br>
      Professor T.&nbsp;W. Rhys Davids has stated that these tales are 'old stories, fairy
      tales, and fables, the most important collection of ancient folklore extant,' which we are
      not able to deny.&quot;[<a name="42" href="#n42">42</a>] </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since the Jataka verses are often incomprehensible
    without the prose commentary, it is difficult to see how they could predate the prose. The
    prose, however, would predate the fifth century commentary into which it was translated
    and collected. The origin of these verses, then, remains indeterminate. It is sometimes
    thought that since these three texts -- Udana, Itivuttaka, Jataka -- are mentioned as
    part of the ninefold description of texts (see <a
    href="begin2.html#nine-fold">above</a>) that they must be, like the
    Sutta Nipata, part of &quot;the oldest layer&quot; of texts that we now have; but it is
    more reasonable to suggest that they were so named because the ninefold description was
    already in existence. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p10-5"></a> The other eight texts that are today
    included within the Khuddaka Nikaya are generally regarded as late additions, and need
    not be discussed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p10-6"></a> The formation of this collection
    probably arose during the century between the two Councils rather than with the Second
    Council itself: such developments need time to generate strength and achieve general
    acceptance. By the time the Council assembled, the force of opinion would have already
    been in favour of including this new collection in the Canon: the Council's function
    herein would have been to ratify and reinforce this consensus and, no doubt, to decide
    upon its organizational details. They would also have had a hand in deciding final
    organisational details for the other Nikayas and for the Vinaya. It was possibly at this
    time, for example, that D.&nbsp;16 -- see Preface, <a
    href="begin1.html#p1-6">paragraph six</a> -- was expanded to its
    present form, or at least a previous expansion was at this time ratified, by including
    passages taken from the other parts of the Nikayas. And, too, those few texts, the
    &quot;six percent&quot; which had been added to their collections by the various <i>bhanakas</i>,
    would have been cast now into their final forms.[<a name="43" href="#n43">43</a>] </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p10-7"></a> It needed to be done, for the monks
    of the Vesali company, along with their supporters, seem (according to a non-Canonical
    text, the Dipavamsa, vv.&nbsp;32ff.) to have refused to accept the ruling of the Council,
    breaking away and forming their own council, wherein they re-arranged and, it seems, added
    to the texts to suit their own purposes. During the next 250 years this company split up
    and resplintered into numerous factions, each having evolved its own set of doctrines and
    disciplinary codes.[<a name="44" href="#n44">44</a>] None of these texts have survived:
    again, as with Venerable Purana, we learn the survival-value of organization.[<a
    name="45" href="#n45">45</a>] The fact that the Suttas and Vinaya[<a name="46" href="#n46">46</a>]
    have survived as coherent entities can now be seen to be itself strong evidence that they
    have survived unchanged. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
    <br>
    <a name="conclusions"></a> <font size="+2"><b>Conclusions</b></font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p11-1"></a> With the closing of the Second
    Council we have no further Canonical information regarding the history of the Suttas.
    Gleanings from later texts inform us that a Third Council was held in the time of King
    Asoka, at which meeting the rift which had opened up more than a century earlier, with the
    Second Council, now widened and variant forms of doctrine began to emerge which eventually
    formed what is now known as Mahayana. The four Nikayas were left unchanged while the
    Khuddaka Nikaya was cast essentially into the form in which we now have it. (A few of the
    very late additions to this collection -- notably the Buddhavamsa -- appear to have
    undergone slight further editing, perhaps at the Fourth Council. On this, see Adikaram's
    lucid, though technical, <i>Early History of Buddhism in Ceylon</i> (Gunasena, Colombo,
    1946), p.&nbsp;35.). Also, missions were sent to many countries and the Teaching was
    successfully transplanted in all directions. Of particular note, the Order was established
    in Ceylon from whence came many of the later reports and which became the center for
    study, preservation and practice of the Pali Suttas for many centuries. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p11-2"></a> About 450 years after the Buddha a
    famine struck Ceylon. For twelve years food was so scarce that the Order of monks was
    almost decimated partly, we are told, due to some of the laity turning to cannibalism.
    Some of the Suttas were in danger of being lost. Monks who were too weak to stand
    rehearsed the texts where they lay. When at last the famine ended, it was realized that
    the texts needed to be put into writing for their greater protection.[<a name="47"
    href="#n47">47</a>] Not only the famine but -- according to Adikeram (<i>op. cit.</i>,
    p.&nbsp;79) -- the danger of frequent invasions from South India, the entry into the Order
    of irresponsible and irreligious people (on which point see Mahavamsa 33,101), and the
    fickle favour of kings also played a part in this decision. Accordingly, a Fourth Council
    was convened, wherein this was accomplished. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p11-3"></a> In the centuries after this Council
    the texts continued to be preserved as much by recital as by manuscript, for making even
    one handwritten copy of the five Nikayas, of the Vinaya, and of all the material that had
    evolved and survived alongside them, the Abhidhamma, the Commentaries, the Chronicles, and
    so forth, would have been a labour of many years and then the manuscript had to be
    preserved against the manifold dangers of destruction. But by this time the Suttas were
    firmly embedded in the minds of those who learned them as being sacred and unalterable by
    as much as a single syllable. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p11-4"></a> The dangers we have seen to be
    inherent in an open Canon were long since past. It was no longer possible for additional
    material to be added to the texts. There still remained the dangers of accidental
    alteration (copyists' errors, etc: see previous <a href="#n47">footnote</a>) and of loss
    due to the disappearance of companies and sometimes the decline of the Order. We need not
    discuss these in any detail. We know what variations exist in manuscripts that were
    separated from each other by thousands of miles and hundreds of years, and we are
    confident that these differences are not significant. Although we cannot assert definitely
    that no material was lost, at most only a small amount could have disappeared without our
    knowing of it through the various records that were made relating to the texts, some of
    which, such as the Asokan edicts were engraved in stone. We can accept that the texts
    survived, at least for the most part, and with no more than insignificant changes, to the
    present, weathering various worldly vicissitudes which we need not trace; for we have now
    explored the origin of the Suttas and discovered how it is that these Suttas which we have
    today can be reliably regarded as being the actual Teaching of Gotama Buddha. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="n35"></a> <b>35.</b> Since this evidence --
    &quot;One time Venerable so-and-so dwelt at...&quot; -- once noted seems obvious, it may
    be wondered why it has been unreported until now. That the Commentaries should not remark
    upon it is not remarkable, not only because they lacked in the Fifth Century A.D. the
    scholarly apparatus available today -- word- and name-dictionaries, concordances, indexes,
    etc. and of course printed editions of the texts, annotated and convenient to use -- but
    also because India has been historically unhistorical-minded (see footnote <a
    href="begin2.html#n15">15</a>): a concern with dates has
    traditionally been regarded as secondary to the act of placing one's faith in a teaching.
    Historical questions are a particularly Western concern. As to why, therefore, modern
    scholars have failed to note this evidence, it may be kindest to allow each reader to form
    his own judgement. [<a href="#35">Back to text</a>] </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="n36"></a> <b>36.</b> A half dozen or so of these
    later discourses speak only of &quot;a certain (unnamed) monk,&quot; or &quot;a group of
    monks.&quot; Naturally in these cases we cannot know definitely that the monks were
    contemporaries of the Buddha. However, there is no reason to suppose otherwise: we find
    other texts wherein unnamed monks converse with the Buddha. There are another half-dozen
    or so Suttas involving monks who are mentioned nowhere else in the Canon and whose
    generation therefore cannot be established except by reference to post-Canonical works.
    Again, this is a feature found in some Suttas that are not later additions. At any rate,
    we would expect that were there any Suttas involving second generation monks, at least
    some of those monks would have been well-known leaders of companies, not the obscure or
    unnamed. No discourses involving nuns, it seems, are later additions. [<a href="#36">Back
    to text</a>] </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="n37"></a> <b>37.</b> One of these monks,
    Venerable Sabbakami, has some verses (453-58) in the Theragatha of the Khuddaka
    Nikaya (see <a href="#thefifth">below</a>) -- appropriately enough, on the subject of
    sensuality (<i>kama</i>). He is specifically identified in the report of the Second
    Council as being the oldest monk in the world, 120 years of age, and as having been a
    pupil of Venerable Ananda. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Westerners sometimes express surprise, or more than
    surprise, at the number of monks reported to have lived to extreme old age. However, it is
    recognized that the qualities that are co-adjuncts of mental calmness such as lack of
    bodily stress, etc. contribute to longevity; and since it is the business of monks to
    cultivate calmness, though not for the sake of long life, it is to be expected that monks
    would outlive the general populace. The Suttas tell us -- Dh.&nbsp;109, etc. -- that
    longevity is also linked to respect for one's elders. However, since this would not seem
    to be statistically quantifiable it is unlikely that Western medical science will ever be
    in a position either to confirm or disprove this thesis. [<a href="#37">Back to text</a>] </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="n38"></a> <b>38.</b> Surprise is sometimes
    expressed at the quantity of verse in the five Nikayas. But verse not only has obvious
    mnemonic value whereby the compilers would give it priority over prose passages, but less
    obviously but more importantly it has great inspirational value. It is sometimes suggested
    that not only was verse seldom spoken spontaneously as the texts often report, but also
    that much of it &quot;must have been&quot; created in a later, more literate time. Such is
    the prejudice of a prosaic era; but a more poetic age -- Elizabethan England, for example
    -- would not have shared this misconception. [<a href="#38">Back to text</a>] </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="n39"></a> <b>39.</b> Although we are unable to
    cite an example of such a referring Sutta which does not seem to be a later addition, at

    younger layers of text assumes, contrary to the evidence, that the first four Nikayas
    grew over a period of centuries by a process of heterogeneous accretion until they reached
    their present form. As such, it is part of the syncretistic approach which we have already
    rejected. Certainly some discourses are older than others inasmuch as they did not all
    appear simultaneously. Other than the few exceptions already discussed, it took about
    forty-five years for them to evolve; and it should be no great surprise that various
    individuals, including the Buddha, might, on occasion, refer to or even quote from what
    had already been said. [<a href="#41">Back to text</a>] </font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="n43"></a> <b>43.</b> That the Twelfth Khandhaka
    account of this Council makes no mention whatsoever of a recitation of the Suttas, nor any
    decisions as to the fifth Nikaya, nor the placement of later additions within the four
    Nikayas, does not mean that they were not done then. First, the report as given omits a
    number of other important details as well, such as the refusal of the Vesali company to
    accept the Council's decisions and to abandon their practices. Second, it would be
    expected by all monks as a matter of course that whenever a body of monks met, they would
    review their texts in order to prevent or discover variances. Third, the purpose of the
    account was to condemn the Vesali monks. The full list of ten points is censured, item
    by item, three times in the space of fifteen pages and denounced as a whole many times
    more. To have reported on other matters would have diluted the force of the
    anathematization. Finally, in the Bakkula Sutta (discussed <a
    href="begin3.html#bakkula">above</a>) a phrase is inserted --
    &quot;inasmuch as for eighty years Venerable Bakkula has...&quot; -- after each statement
    of Venerable Bakkula's achievements. This phrase (according to the Commentary: MA. iv,193)
    was inserted by the elders who made the recension of the Teaching. We are not told which
    elders, but from our own examination we can see clearly that it would have had to have
    been the elders of this Second Council. [<a href="#43">Back to text</a>] </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="n44"></a> <b>44.</b> Some scholars might question
    the identification of the Vesali company with the progenitors of the splinter groups or
    suggest, more modestly, that only some of these sects evolved from the Vesali monks, the
    remainder breaking away from the Councils' lineage at later dates. These are scholarly
    issues which it would be out of place to discuss here. Perhaps the fullest discussion,
    together with informative charts, is to be found in the Prefatory Notes to the Aung/Rhys
    Davids translation of the Katha Vatthu (<i>Points of Controversy</i>, Pali Text Society,
    London, 1915). [<a href="#44">Back to text</a>] </font></p>

    survived as collections, yet scattered fragments have been rediscovered in Sanskrit, and

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="n46"></a> <b>46.</b> The evolution of the Vinaya
    is parallel to that of the Suttas. A description of its evolution would be more complex,
    partly due to the need to consider what is nowadays known as the &quot;old
    commentary&quot;; but it would follow the same lines of reasoning used herein; and it
    would arrive at the same conclusions: like the four Nikayas, the Vinaya achieved
    essentially its final form during the first century following the Buddha. The question of
    when the &quot;old commentary&quot; came to be embedded in the text, and of how the
    Parivara became semi-attached to the Vinaya proper need not concern us. For a short note
    on this subject, see the <a href="begin6.html#appendix">Appendix</a>.

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="n47"></a> <b>47.</b> Although writing had been
    known in India for perhaps two centuries before the time of the Buddha, apparently the
    technology of paper and ink was as yet undeveloped. Messages, letters and the like might
    have been scratched onto the smooth underside of bark, then rubbed with black oil to
    &quot;ink&quot; the writing, but no way had then been found to preserve for long what was
    thus marked. No clay tablets have been found from this era, although two brick
    inscriptions of a Sanskrit Sutra, dating some centuries after the Buddha, have been found
    at Nalanda: <i>Epigraphia Indica</i> XXI, pp. 177-99. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Well before the time of the famine in Ceylon it had been
    discovered that when young ola leaves, scraped and boiled, were marked with treated carbon
    black, the writing produced could be legibly preserved for many years. Only then did
    recording become worth the effort involved. The results, however, are not entirely in
    favour of the written record. The critical editions of the texts strongly suggest that
    almost all the variant readings that are noted therein are the result of copyists' errors.
    Very rarely do these variant readings make a difference in meaning; usually it is a matter
    of a word being added or dropped, or differences as regards abridgement, spelling, and the
    like. [<a href="#47">Back to text</a>] <br>
