    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>hus, a few months after the
    Buddha's decease a meeting now known as the First Council was held in the hills outside of
    Rajagaha (modern Rajgir, in Bihar) in order to put the Vinaya and the Suttas into a
    formal structure for the sake of those who would come later. Venerable Upali, who had
    gone forth at the same time as Venerable Ananda, was designated responsible for the
    Vinaya, as was Venerable Ananda for the Suttas. The account of their stewardships
    consists of but a few lines of reportage, probably edited long after the event -- most
    likely together with the account of the Second Council, the report of which seems to be
    much more contemporaneous with its subject matter. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p8-2"></a> The evidence is twofold. First, we
    would expect the Culavagga to have, if not fewer, at least not <i>more</i> Khandhakas
    than the Mahavagga. In the Suttas we often encounter Maha/Cula pairs, and the Maha is
    invariably the longer. At any rate the Tenth Khandhaka of the Culavagga is concerned with
    the nuns. It would be inconsistent with attitudes displayed elsewhere in the texts for the
    nuns' disciplinary matters to be placed ahead of the monks' concerns, particularly at such
    an important convocation as the Council. Therefore, the account of the Councils must have
    been appended at a time when the Vinaya was already considered closed to interpolations.
    Indeed, the account of the Councils was almost certainly the final addition to the Vinaya
    texts. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p8-3"></a> Second, it is said in Khandhaka XI
    that Venerable Ananda recited <i>the five Nikayas</i>. Therefore the account could not
    have been edited until a time when the five Nikayas actually existed. Since the Suttas
    never refer to themselves as consisting of Nikayas at all, let alone as five, if we were
    to assume the account to be contemporary, we would be forced to suppose that this
    classification came into being quite dramatically. It is more reasonable to suppose that a
    body of material existed which, though not formally included in the First Council
    compilation, adhered to it as supplementary matter; that that material must have included
    an account of the Council itself; and that it, as well as certain other materials,
    eventually came to be included in the Canon before the Canon itself was regarded as
    closed. The account was included at a time when the five Nikayas already existed as
    formally organized bodies of texts, but probably was codified quite soon after, for the
    specification of the number <i>five</i> suggests an attempt to legitimize the last of
    them, the Khuddaka Nikaya. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p8-4"></a> Be that as it may, it is not
    difficult, despite the brevity of the reportage, to imagine what must have taken place.
    The Council was no mere recitation of texts: that had been going on for forty-five years
    and did not require a special assembly. The Council's aim must have been two-fold: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) To decide what, out of the vast store of material at hand, should be
    given the protection of formal organization; and <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) To set up a mechanism to preserve this material. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p8-5"></a> Obviously it couldn't <i>all</i> be
    saved. Not only were there the Buddha's discourses, all 82,000 of them,[<a name="24"
    href="#n24">24</a>] but also the discourses of many other monks, some of them learned,
    wise, enlightened, liberated. Some of the discourses were duplicates -- the monks from
    Savatthi remembering the Buddha saying a particular Sutta when he was there; the monks
    from Kusinagara remembering him saying quite the same thing on a visit to them -- others
    varied in greater or lesser extent. Some variations were revealing, others perhaps less
    so. These elders wanted this discourse included, those elders had other requests. In
    addition to the formal discourses there were events of some significance: the famine in
    Veranja and its effects on the Order, Devadatta's attempt at a schism, an attempt on
    Venerable Sariputta's life (Ud.&nbsp;IV,4 (39-41)), and so on. Which of these were worthy
    of preservation? Which would be of less value to those who came later? How much was
    enough, and how much too much? These decisions were, with regard to the Suttas, Venerable
    Ananda's responsibility as, with regard to the Vinaya, they were Venerable Upali's. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p8-6"></a> The selection being made, it was then
    necessary to assign to different teachers the responsibility of learning and passing on a
    certain portion of a collection; for even among the august members of the Council -- there
    were 500 elders, we are told, &quot;not one more, not one less,&quot; and all were
    liberated -- few would have been able to learn the Suttas in their entirety. If
    one-hundred of them took responsibility for the Vinaya, there would have been one-hundred
    each for the long discourses, the middle length discourses, the grouped collection, and
    the enumerated collection.[<a name="25" href="#n25">25</a>] Even though most monks could
    take responsibility for passing on to their following no more than a portion of a
    collection, yet every part of this organized recension would have been the responsibility
    of a large number of schools. Thus, if one or several schools died out, their tradition
    would not thereby be lost. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p8-7"></a> (A digression here on the question of
    memory may be worthwhile. Literate people sometimes express doubt that large segments of
    text could have been accurately remembered during the five centuries before they were
    first written down. But anthropologists have often remarked on the extraordinary and
    proven ability of their non-literate informants to remember accurately. It would seem that
    the comparatively poor memory of literate folk is due to their very literacy: they don't <i>need</i>
    to cultivate the faculty of memory. They forget (if they ever knew) that like all
    faculties, if they don't use it they lose it. In literate cultures that part of experience
    that is not readily recordable tends to become impoverished: literacy is not without it's
    drawbacks. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p8-8"></a> (Although Venerable Ananda was
    pre-eminent in the ability to learn discourses apparently possessing what today is called
    a &quot;photographic memory&quot;, the ability to remember segments of texts which, in
    print, take up a volume or more, was not an unusual ability. Even today, when we have
    authoritative editions of all the texts printed in a variety of scripts, the ability is
    not unheard of. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p8-9"></a> (In Burma government-regulated
    examinations are offered monks annually to test their recall of the texts, as well as
    their understanding of them. At present (1983) there are in Burma alone four monks who
    have demonstrated their ability to recite by memory not only the Vinaya and Sutta
    collections in their entirety, both of which are more voluminous today than in their
    original First Council recension, but also the seven volumes of the Abhidhamma. Since 1949
    when the examinations were first offered, 67 monks have passed the oral and written
    examinations for the five volumes of the Vinaya and 265 have done so for the Suttas
    comprising sixteen volumes. Additionally, well over 300 monks have passed oral and written
    examinations proving their perfect recall and understanding of one entire Nikaya (Digha:
    122; Majjhima: 89; Samyutta: 52; Anguttara: 55). The number who can recite large portions
    of a Nikaya -- a volume or more -- must be substantially higher. In Sri Lanka, where
    recitation is also greatly valued but where, however, examinations are not offered, one
    can find many more such reciters.[<a name="26" href="#n26">26</a>]) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p8-10"></a> When we remember that the cultivation
    of mindfulness and awareness is a central discipline in the Buddha's Teaching, that the
    Suttas were arranged in as mnemonic a manner as possible, that monks were encouraged to
    review often the discourses in their minds and that they were expected to meet frequently
    for group rehearsals, both within their own company and together with other companies, we
    will not be surprised that at a time when memorization was the <i>only</i> way to transmit
    the Teaching, such an ability, assiduously fostered, would be widespread and reliable. It
    will be seen, then, that it was not (as is often asserted) due to the writing down of the
    texts that they achieved their definitive form. Well before that time, when they had come
    to be regarded as sacred, there already existed a method whereby they could be transmitted
    from generation to generation without error. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p8-11"></a> Not everyone agreed with what was
    being done. A wandering monk, the leader of a large company, Venerable Purana, while
    travelling through the Southern Hills south of Rajagaha, came to the cave in the
    canebrake where the Council was meeting. At this time the Vinaya and Suttas had already
    been recited (i.e. organized, assigned and rehearsed). </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Friend Purana,&quot; the elders said to him,
      &quot;the Teaching and Discipline have been recited together by the elder monks. Please
      submit yourself to this recitation.&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Friends,&quot; he replied, &quot;the Teaching and
      Discipline are well-recited by the elders. But in the way I have heard them in the Exalted
      One's presence, in the way that I have received them in his presence, thus will I bear it
      in mind.&quot; -- Culavagga XI,l,11 (ii,288-9) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p8-12"></a></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thereby Venerable Purana rejected not only the
    organization of the Suttas into collections but, apparently, the structuring of the Suttas
    individually into the form in which they had been cast for transmission. The Council had
    no &quot;legal&quot; status by which it could compel other monks to submit to it.
    decisions nor is the notion of compulsion consistent with the spirit of the Suttas and the
    Vinaya: its strength lay in the collective repute, the upright conduct, and the wisdom of
    its individual members. They could urge, and perhaps generally receive, compliance; but
    they could not command it. Probably, then, Venerable Purana was not the only teacher who
    chose to go his own way. Others too, though acknowledging that the Council's recension was
    well-recited -- i.e. providing right-view guidance -- may have preferred to continue
    teaching according to their own methods. We don't know for sure for none of those other
    traditions have survived. The only record we have today of the Buddha's Teaching is that
    dependent upon the collective repute, the upright conduct, and the wisdom of the
    individuals who comprised the First Council. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
    <br>
    <a name="later"></a> <font size="+2"><b>Later Additions</b></font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p9-1"></a> &quot;But how do we know,&quot; it may
    be asked, &quot;that with the closing of the First Council the Sutta recension that they
    compiled remained intact, without additions? For if no additions were made later then,
    true enough, we would have here the actual Teaching of the Buddha. But what grounds are
    there for accepting this as so?&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p9-2"></a> A good and important question. The
    answer being, that we <i>don't</i> know that &quot;no additions were made later&quot;:
    quite the contrary, we <i>do</i> know they were made. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p9-3"></a> The Canon had been open and growing
    for nearly a half century. For it to be suddenly closed, and for there to be an immediate
    acceptance of that closure sufficiently widespread for it to be effective, is contrary to
    reason. Only when the compilation had come to be generally regarded as sacrosanct could
    the Canon be successfully closed; and such an attitude necessarily develops gradually. And
    the evidence of the Suttas themselves supports this view. There are, for example,
    discourses in which Venerable Ananda appears not as the Buddha's shadow but quite apart
    from the Buddha. In these discourses he is regarded, except by Venerable Maha Kassapa, as
    a respected elder; he is called <i>maha-acariya</i>, &quot;great teacher&quot; in
    A.&nbsp;X,96 (v,198) and in S.&nbsp;XVI,11 (ii,218) he is said to have been touring the
    Southern Hills leading a great company of monks. It is clear that at least some of these
    discourses took place after his attendancy on the Buddha had ended, with the decease of
    his master. Indeed, two of them -- Subha Sutta, D.&nbsp;10, and Gopaka-Moggallana Sutta,
    M.&nbsp;108 -- state specifically in their introductory material (D.&nbsp;i,204 and
    M.&nbsp;iii,7) that they took place &quot;not long after&quot; the Buddha's decease. And
    there are discourses involving monks other than Venerable Ananda in which the text itself
    informs us that the conversation took place after the Buddha's passing away.[<a name="27"
    href="#n27">27</a>] Nor can we reasonably suppose all these talks to have occurred during
    the few months between the Buddha's decease and the convening of the First Council. Some
    of them may have, but Madhura (of M.&nbsp;84), for instance, was in Western India, not so
    far from present-day Delhi but a great distance From Rajagaha, over very bad roads
    (A.&nbsp;V,220 (iii,256)): even if the discourse itself had originated before the Council
    met, it could hardly have become known in Rajagaha in such a short time, let alone become
    popular enough for inclusion in the recension. <a name="bakkula"></a> But even if such is
    maintained, there still remains the Bakkula Sutta, M.&nbsp;124 (iii,124-28), in which
    Venerable Bakkula asserts, at least thirty-three times, that he has been a monk for eighty
    years. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p9-4"></a> Now, all accounts agree that the
    Buddha's decease took place forty-five years after his awakening. Therefore even if
    Venerable Bakkula had been ordained very soon after the establishment of the Order,[<a
    name="28" href="#n28">28</a>] the discourse still had to have taken place at least
    thirty-five years after the closing of the First Council. And in all likelihood it took
    place even later than that although Venerable Bakkula could not have been spoken of by the
    Buddha unless his ordination took place during the Buddha's lifetime: i.e. the Bakkula
    Sutta postdates the First Council, but by less than eighty years. We can be quite certain,
    then, that the First Council did not produce the version of the texts that we now have.
    But we can be equally certain that the compilation they produced is in no way dramatically
    different from what we now have. Consider: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p9-5"></a> If we examine the seven Suttas just
    referred to, we will notice that they have in common a distinctive feature. Whereas the
    usual way the discourses begin is: &quot;One time the Exalted One was dwelling
    at...&quot;[<a name="29" href="#n29">29</a>] <i>these</i> discourses make no mention of
    where the Buddha dwelt. Rather, they begin: &quot;One time Venerable Ananda (or Venerable
    Udena, or whoever) was dwelling at...&quot; In other words, by this method they inform us
    at the very start that they are in fact later additions and are not to be taken as having
    been part of the First Council's compilation.[<a name="30" href="#n30">30</a>] There is no
    attempt to disguise the fact. On the contrary, there is a conscientiousness in its
    assertion. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p9-6"></a> And when we look through the Nikayas
    we find other discourses which follow this same form: &quot;One time Ven. So-and-so was
    dwelling at...&quot; Although they do not always otherwise declare themselves to be later
    additions -- for once should be enough -- yet often we can find further telltale evidence
    that this is so. Thus for example in the Digha Nikaya aside from the already-mentioned
    Subha Sutta, there is only one other discourse out of the thirty-four in that collection
    wherein we are told the dwelling not of the Buddha but of the main individual, Venerable
    Kumara Kassapa, in this case. This discourse -- the Payasi Sutta, D.&nbsp;23
    (ii,316-58) -- involves a long discussion between Venerable Kassapa and the chieftain
    Payasi, mainly on the subject of rebirth. The chieftain presents a series of thought-out
    reasonings as evidence that there is no rebirth. Venerable Kassapa presents
    counter-arguments, primarily in the form of elaborate similes,[<a name="31" href="#n31">31</a>]
    showing the flaws in Payasi's theses. In the end although Venerable Kassapa does not
    actually offer any arguments in <i>favour</i> of rebirth, Payasi declares himself to be
    both convinced and pleased. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p9-7"></a> Now, on numerous occasions the Buddha
    declared that for beings constrained by craving there is rebirth (S.&nbsp;XXII,25 (iii,26)
    etc). He said that he could remember his own past lives (M.&nbsp;4 (i,22) etc), that he
    could see the passing on of beings according to their deeds (M.&nbsp;4 (i,22-3) etc), and
    that by means of certain mental practices others could develop these abilities
    (A.&nbsp;X,102 (v,211) etc), and had done so: e.g. the Venerable Maha Moggallana and
    Anuruddha. But nowhere do the Suttas record the Buddha arguing in favour of rebirth on <i>logical</i>
    grounds; nor would we expect him to do so for rebirth is not a matter of logic. Yet
    despite Venerable Kassapa's assertion that until then he had neither seen nor heard of
    anyone sharing Payasi's views, there must have been many sceptics to judge both from the
    views ascribed by the texts to the various teachers of the day and from the frequency with
    which the Suttas assert rebirth; and most monks -- even among those who had personally
    achieved complete self-purification -- would have had to accept rebirth on the basis of
    confidence in the Buddha rather than from direct knowledge (see S.&nbsp;XII,70 (ii,122-3),
    and compare A.&nbsp;VII,54 (iv,78-82)). After the Buddha's decease, then, there was a
    strongly felt need for some sort of textual authority to lend support to these monks on
    the question of rebirth, just as the Madhura Sutta, mentioned earlier, seems to have been
    included to lend support to the Buddhist teaching of ethical equality between castes. It
    matters not at all that Venerable Kassapa's similes are unlikely to convince a modern
    sceptic: they were appropriate to their time; they filled an existing need. And that need
    would have been felt most strongly among the reciters and preservers of the long
    discourses. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p9-8"></a> The Payasi Sutta, which is obviously
    the model for the much later Milindapanha, could have been made much shorter -- and hence
    included in any of the other Nikayas -- by eliminating extraneous introductory and
    concluding material and some of the more elaborate similes; so it was not only due to
    considerations of length that it came to be included in the Digha Nikaya.[<a name="32"
    href="#n32">32</a>] Rather, questions about rebirth are more apt to be raised by the laity
    whose goal is to obtain a good rebirth than by monks whose aim is to transcend rebirth
    entirely, and in fact the arguments of the Payasi Sutta, concerned as they are with
    reasoning and simile, are more likely to convince a layperson than a practising monk who
    -- questions of relevance aside -- might be better convinced by evidence concerned with
    direct reflection and perception. Of the four Nikayas the Digha is, for reasons we have
    already noted, the one most directed to the interests of laypeople, thus lending
    substantiation to the Commentarial suggestion that Venerable Ananda was primarily
    responsible for this collection. Hence the monks who would most likely seek textual
    support on the question of rebirth would be the <i>digha-bhanakas</i>, the
    &quot;reciters of the Digha&quot;. There would have developed among the individuals of
    the various companies who shared the responsibility for various portions of the long
    discourses a consensus that the Payasi Sutta, until then a part of the peripheral
    material known by those reciters but not included in their texts, should be formally
    included in the Nikaya. Since the Digha is divided into three Vaggas, or sections, each
    about a volume in length, and since the Payasi Sutta, is now the last discourse of the
    second Vagga, the responsibility apparently was assigned to or taken up by those who
    recited the middle portion of the long discourses. However, it was not always the case
    that later Suttas came to be placed at the end of a Vagga, as the evidence shows. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p9-9"></a> The discourse makes no claim to being
    the <i>ipsissima verba</i> of the Buddha. It presents itself as being, in its central
    portion, a conversation between a certain fairly obscure monk and a certain layman,
    apparently mentioned nowhere else in the Suttas; there is no reason not to accept it on
    those terms. It acknowledges itself to be a later addition as the Commentator Dhammapala
    points out at Vimana Vatthu Commentary, p.&nbsp;297: indeed, every discourse identified
    by the traditional commentaries as post-First Council begins, it seems, with the &quot;One
    time Venerable So-and-so&quot; formula. But it was not a <i>haphazard</i> addition: the
    mechanism by which the Suttas were passed on necessitated, before the Canon was closed,
    that additional material could be inserted only when there was a common accord among those
    who were responsible for a portion of the texts. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p9-10"></a> Turning now to the Majjhima Nikaya
    we learn more about the process of adding discourses. Other than those already mentioned
    there are two discourses in the Majjhima that make no mention of the Buddha's dwelling
    place: the Anumana Sutta, M.&nbsp;15 (i,95-100) and the Maratajjaniya Sutta, M.&nbsp;50
    (i,332-8). Both begin: &quot;One time Venerable Maha Moggallana dwelt in the Bhagga
    Country...&quot; Since we know from S.&nbsp;XLVII,14 (v,163-5) that both Sariputta and
    Maha Moggallana predeceased the Buddha, the discourses themselves could not have taken
    place after the time of the First Council as was evidently the case with the Payasi
    Sutta; rather they were simply not included in that compilation.[<a name="33" href="#n33">33</a>]
    But we note that the two Majjhima Suttas have the same venue, and that the Bhagga Country
    was an out-of-the-way place, at least as measured by the infrequency of its mention in the
    Suttas.[<a name="34" href="#n34">34</a>] Since Venerable Maha Moggallana and Venerable
    Sariputta were the two chief disciples of the Buddha, the monks living among the Bhaggas
    would certainly have remembered the former's visit to them and would have kept in mind
    what he had said and done, as part of their local tradition. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p9-11"></a> There must have been in residence
    there some companies of <i>majjhima-bhanakas</i>, preserving at least the first third of
    the Majjhima Nikaya, which today contains 152 Suttas and, like the Digha, is divided
    into three volume-length Vaggas. They would be the ones to have wished to include these
    two discourses -- all the more precious for having taken place <i>there</i> -- in their
    collection, to raise them from the lower status of local tradition and to afford them
    additional protection against being lost. When meeting with neighbouring <i>majjhima-bhanakas</i>,
    as they must have done from time to time, not only to recite together, they successfully
    convinced their fellow-monks to include these two discourses in their own recitations.
    Thus, due in effect to local boosterism, the Canon grew. And when we look at the Samyutta

    elected head of the First Council. Culavagga Xl,1,1 (ii,284) [<a href="#23">Back to text</a>]

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="n24"></a> <b>24.</b> We noted earlier (footnote <a
    href="begin2.html#n15">15</a>) that Venerable Ananda knew 84,000
    discourses. The four Nikayas as we now have them comprise sixteen volumes; 5,500 pages in
    their abbreviated roman-script edition contain according to the Commentarial reckoning a
    total of 17,505 discourses although some are quite short. Though the precise number of
    discourses is problematical, we can see that in any case what was included, voluminous as
    it is, is but a fraction of what was available. [<a href="#24">Back to text</a>] </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="n25"></a> <b>25.</b> These figures -- other than
    the &quot;500&quot; -- are entirely speculative. Their purpose is only to demonstrate
    that, whatever the specific details, a mechanism for preserving the texts was entirely
    feasible. However, the Commentarial assertion -- Sumangalavilasini I,13 -- that primary
    responsibility for these four collections was assigned respectively to Venerable Ananda,
    the pupils of Venerable Sariputta, Venerable Maha Kassapa and Venerable Anuruddha, lends
    support to our suggestion. [<a href="#25">Back to text</a>] </font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="n27"></a> <b>27.</b> E.g. the Madhura Sutta,
    M.&nbsp;84 (ii,83-90), with Venerable Maha Kaccana and King Avantiputta of Madhura; the
    Ghotamukha Sutta, M.&nbsp;94 (ii,157-63), with Venerable Udena and the brahmana
    Ghotamukha. [<a href="#27">Back to text</a>] </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="n28"></a> <b>28.</b> This, however, is unlikely.
    Venerable Bakkula seems to be mentioned, in the whole of the four Nikayas, in only one
    other context: in A.&nbsp;I,14 (i,25) he is declared by the Buddha to be foremost among
    all monks in respect of good health. [<a href="#28">Back to text</a>] </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="n29"></a> <b>29.</b> Because the Samyutta and
    Anguttara Nikayas contain numerous short discourses, therein this formula is often
    abbreviated or omitted entirely. This almost certainly was done by the later scribes
    rather than the earlier reciters. In these instances we know that the Buddha is the
    speaker by his use of the term <i>bhikkhave</i>, the vocative form for &quot;monks&quot;;
    for in those days all monks addressed one another as <i>avuso</i>
    (=&nbsp;&quot;reverend&quot; or &quot;sir&quot;); only the Buddha used the term <i>bhikkhave</i>.
    [<a href="#29">Back to text</a>] </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="n30"></a> <b>30.</b> This is in distinction to
    those Suttas, presumably <i>not</i> later additions, in which although the Buddha plays no
    part whatsoever in the narrative, yet his dwelling place at that time is nevertheless
    given according to the usual formula. Examples will be found at D.&nbsp;34; M.&nbsp;5, 9,
    28, 69, 76, 127; S.&nbsp;V,1, VI,3, 6, 9; A.&nbsp;VI,34, etc. A comparison of
    S.&nbsp;LV,52 (v,405-6) and S.&nbsp;LVI,30 (v,436-7) points up the distinction. In neither
    case does the Buddha appear &quot;on stage&quot;; in both cases he is quoted; the first
    discourse begins &quot;One time the Buddha was dwelling at...&quot;; the second begins
    &quot;One time a number of senior monks were dwelling at...&quot; [<a href="#30">Back to
    text</a>] </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="n31"></a> <b>31.</b> Like Venerable Bakkula,
    Venerable Kumara Kassapa is mentioned elsewhere in the four Nikayas only at A.&nbsp;I,14
    (i,24), where he is declared foremost in respect of embellished speech. Had the Payasi
    Sutta not been appended to the Canon, we would have had no example of this. He is also
    mentioned once in the Vinaya. In affirming the validity of his admission to the Order, for
    which one must be at least twenty years of age, the Buddha stated that age is reckonable
    not from birth but from conception, declaring that it is in the womb that &quot;the mind (<i>citta</i>)
    first arises, consciousness (<i>vinnana</i>) first becomes manifest.&quot; --
    Mahavagga I,75 (i,92) [<a href="#31">Back to text</a>] </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="n32"></a> <b>32.</b> Nor is length an absolute
    criterion. There are at least fifteen Suttas in the other three Nikayas that are longer
    than the shortest of the Digha Suttas. [<a href="#32">Back to text</a>] </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="n33"></a> <b>33.</b> There are a number of other
    discourses which also begin &quot;One time Ven. So-and-so...&quot; but which similarly
    must have been delivered during the Buddha's lifetime. For example there are about 75 such
    Suttas involving either Ven. Maha Moggallana or Ven. Sariputta or both. There are also
    two Suttas (S.&nbsp;XLI,9 (iv,300-302) and A.&nbsp;II,36 (i,65-7)) wherein it is
    specifically stated in the dialogue that the Buddha was then living at Savatthi, in the
    latter instance, but in the former the location is not given. Therefore we cannot assert
    that all &quot;One time Ven. So-and-so...&quot; discourses were delivered after the
    Buddha's decease: only that they came to be included in the Canon at a later date. [<a
    href="#33">Back to text</a>] </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="n34"></a> <b>34.</b> A number of other &quot;One
    time Ven. So-and-so...&quot; discourses are also set in remote locales: Alavi, Avanti,
    Ceti, Madhura, etc., generally West of the centres where the texts locate, Venerable
    Ananda: Vesali, Pataliputta, Rajagaha, Kosambi. Although during the Buddha's day the
    West of India was still &quot;pioneer country&quot; as regards the Teaching, we know (as
    discussed in the <a href="begin6.html#appendix">Appendix</a>) that
    within a century of the First Council these western territories had risen to monastic
    prominence and, perhaps, cultural importance as well: Taxila was already a centre of
    learning even in the Buddha's day: Mahavagga VIII,1,6-7 (i,269-70). [<a href="#34">Back
