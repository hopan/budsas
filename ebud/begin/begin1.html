    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
    <a name="preface"></a> <font size="+2"><b>Preface</b></font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p1-1"></a> A discussion of beginnings would be
    entirely unnecessary were it not that beginnings seem invariably to precede whatever
    conclusions may exist. Therefore any who hope to arrive at a conclusion in their life must
    perforce begin. But where? The present work is concerned entirely with this question.
    Herein our discussion is, by design, twofold. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p1-2"></a> First, we will discuss the human
    situation, and the inherent need to discover a method, a way, whereby we may resolve the
    dilemma of that situation. This method must be coherent: we must have a standard whereby
    we can judge which actions will and which will not lead us towards a conclusion. Accepting
    a standard is, precisely, our beginning. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p1-3"></a> Second, we will discuss whether the
    collection of texts known as the Pali Suttas might not offer such a standard. These texts,
    the oldest we have from among the various Buddhist schools, have much to recommend them.
    However, objections have been raised concerning their authenticity. These objections refer
    to the very origins and the early transmission of the Suttas. In order to evaluate these
    objections an understanding is needed of how these texts came into being and how they were
    passed on. This is the second sense in which we are concerned about beginnings. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p1-4"></a> Although this historical point
    occupies the bulk of our essay, it is thematically subservient to our primary question --
    Where does one begin? -- and is relevant only to the extent that the primary question is
    seen to be relevant. This work, then, is not historical as such. Rather, it happens that
    an inquiry into the primary question turns out to involve an historical consideration. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p1-5"></a> The objection may be raised that any
    teaching which calls itself <i>akalika</i>, or non-temporal, as the Pali Suttas do, can
    never be understood by raising an historical question, which is necessarily temporal. This
    of course is perfectly true. The problem of existence, in its very nature, can never be
    resolved by such a method. It is only through a non-historical approach -- specifically,
    one that is personal, passionate, and persistent -- that our perilous situation in the
    world can ever be comprehended. In this sense the only basis for judging the Suttas would
    be to put their advice into practice and resolve the personal dilemma, thereby coming to
    know for certain that the Suttas are what they claim to be. But herein we are not yet at
    the point of discussing how to <i>proceed</i>. We are still involved with the prior
    question of whether these Suttas offer a standard which, if acquiesced to, will lead to an
    end. And although an historical inquiry can never in itself lead us to a <i>conclusion</i>,
    it is at least possible that it might lead us to a <i>beginning</i> inasmuch as it can
    serve as an initial indication to our question: Where does one begin? </font></p>
    <hr width="20%">
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p1-6"></a> Except where otherwise noted, all
    factual information in this essay is garnered from the Pali Suttas and their
    companion-piece, the Vinaya. In these texts we find accounts of the first months following
    the Buddha's awakening (Khandhaka&nbsp;I, Mahavagga, Vinaya), of the final months before
    his decease (Sutta 16, Digha Nikaya), of the events leading up to the First and Second
    Councils, together with an account of those Councils (Khandhakas XI and XII, Culavagga,
    Vinaya), and, scattered through the texts, incidental information and clues about the
    middle period of the Buddha's ministry. Considerable additional information is available
    in texts of later date, such as the Commentaries. However, for our purposes such data are
    not needed, for though our account in no way contradicts the known facts available from
    primary sources, it is our intention to present here not a factual history but an
    imaginative one. We may recall the dictum: &quot;Higher than actuality stands
    possibility.&quot; We are not attempting to set forth what <i>did</i> happen but what <i>must
    have happened</i>. Our account is more <i>reasoned</i> than <i>reportorial</i>. As such
    our methods are not those of scholars; nor do our conclusions rest upon ever finer points
    of contention, but rather upon a commonly-held understanding of how, in their broad
    outlines, things generally evolve: gradually and piecemeal rather than suddenly and
    definitively. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p1-7"></a> This is not to say that what follows
    will be of no interest to scholars. On the contrary, because of the broadness of the base
    upon which our findings rest, it is hoped that scholars may well regard them as a
    significant as well as an original contribution to their discipline. However, an
    understanding of what follows requires no knowledge of or interest in scholarly questions.
    For most, perhaps, this account will be sufficient. For those who feel that they would
    benefit by further exploration into the substantial scholarly literature on the early
    history of Buddhism, this account can serve as a standard for evaluating the various
    conflicting views and judgements that are to be encountered therein. Avoiding those
    conflicts, we offer herein, using the data of the texts themselves, the most <i>reasonable</i>
    account of their beginnings and a <i>reasonable</i> assessment of how much confidence we
    can place in them, in order to make our own beginning. </font></p>

    <a name="p2-1"></a></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">W</font><font
    face="Times New Roman">here does one begin? This is obviously the first question. And when
    the issue at hand is the manifest need to explore and resolve the root-problem of our
    personal existence, then this question takes on a primacy in terms not only of sequence
    but of importance. One begins, of course, from where one is, for from where else <i>can</i>
    one begin? Herein the intelligent person, he who does not shrink from unpleasant truths,
    will acknowledge the problem. He may describe it in any of a number of ways -- anxiety,
    loneliness, insufficiency, frustration, inconstancy, boredom, uncertainty, bondage,
    meaninglessness, impermanence, despair -- but however it appears it will be seen, if it is
    seen at all, to be fundamental, for it is bound up in one way or another with a sense of
    one's own mortality. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p2-2"></a> When we apprehend the ever-present
    possibility of our own immediate dying, -- the impossible possibility, says Heidegger, --
    then any notions we may have about our golden and glittering prospects in the world will
    be seen to be illusory inasmuch as they, and we as well, end in death.[<a name="1"
    href="#n1">1</a>] The gold is now seen for the leaden bondage that it really is, the
    alchemy has failed, and we see ourselves to be in perpetual subjugation to the uncertainty
    inherent in the world. And we then feel, deeply, the need to act. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p2-3"></a> There <i>must</i> be release from this
    overwhelming fact of our own mortality: we cannot believe otherwise. But, equally certain,
    we don't know the way to that release else, surely, we would already have taken it. Can we
    find this way? Fine and earnest people have tried before us -- that we know -- and have
    admitted failure. Our task, then, cannot be easy. But having recognized our existence in
    this world as <i>inherently</i> unsatisfactory, we now sense the utter <i>necessity</i> of
    seeking the means to transcend it. We are unwilling to plunge yet again -- again! -- into
    that endless round of pastimes wherein most people waste their lives in the effort to
    avoid facing the truth of their own mortal existence. Although we don't know the way
    ourselves, it is yet possible that there exists some teacher, some teaching, to provide
    guidance. And so we look about us, and we find... orators, teachers, therapists,
    hucksters, salvation-mongers, apostles, psychologists, preachers, gurus, swamis, saviours
    and salesmen by the score, each offering his own brand of salvation. And thus we arrive
    again at our original question: where does one begin? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p2-4"></a> They can't <i>all</i> be right. If it
    were <i>so</i> easy, we would have no need of a teacher, for we and everyone else would
    already have done the work ourselves. Besides, many of these teachings, anti-teachings,
    disciplines, non-disciplines and weekends are manifestly in contradiction with one another
    and sometimes even with themselves, both in doctrine and in practice. And therefore,
    unless we abandon consistency of both thought and effort, we must acknowledge the
    importance of choosing among them intelligently, unless we believe them to be uniformly <i>mistaken</i>,
    in which case the choice would again seem unimportant. For the choice we make will be our
    beginning, and from that beginning -- made wisely or foolishly -- everything else will
    follow. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p2-5"></a> Nor need we believe ourselves to be
    totally incompetent to make that choice. For although it is a truism that, as is sometimes
    argued, the only way to know for <i>certain</i> which teaching or teachings are in
    accordance with truth is to see truth for oneself, yet we can even now make a reasonable
    assessment of these teachings. To be unenlightened is not to know <i>nothing</i>; for were
    that the case we should not long survive in this uncertain world. We are free from
    confusion at least to the extent that we now see the need to free ourselves from it
    totally.[<a name="2" href="#n2">2</a>] Having acknowledged the problem, we can sort out
    from among those teachings which offer themselves to us those that at least address
    themselves to that problem from those that merely pander in one way or another to the
    world's proclivity for any comfortable, or even uncomfortable, notion in order to avoid
    facing the problem. For underlying each practice will be a doctrine or general attitude,
    and from this we can come to know the general nature of each teaching and can thereby
    separate the relevant from the superfluous. And thus it is that, eventually, we will come
    to the Buddha's Teaching. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
    <br>
    <a name="thebuddhas"></a> <font size="+2"><b>The Buddha's Teaching</b></font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p3-1"></a> The Buddha's Teaching: what images it
    conjures -- compassion, serenity, acquiescence, wisdom, bliss, selflessness. In such terms
    is it often described, even from afar, even among those who know only its general
    outlines. Such is the image of this Teaching that is in world-wide circulation; and with
    such qualities does it invite seekers of peace to take a closer look. With such a
    reputation it may perhaps prove to be the fount of advice and guidance we so need. And
    therefore we eagerly approach it, to find... Theravada Buddhism, Mahayana, Ch'an,
    Korean Zen, Vajrayana, Tantric and dozens of other sects and sub-sects, large and small,
    new and old, all claiming to be the Teaching of the Buddha. And so it is that again we
    return to out original question: Where does one begin? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p3-2"></a> Are these schools different in name
    only? Or do they differ as well in attitude, approach, doctrine and practice? Is all one?
    Is all a diversity? Does nothing really exist? Does everything really exist? Or are these
    disparate views merely worldly wisdom, best abandoned in favour of seeing that &quot;<i>Whatever
    is</i> arises dependent on conditions and is not without conditions&quot;? Must we save
    others before we will be able to save ourselves? Or must we save ourselves before we will
    be in a position to save others? Is everything already perfect? Or is it only suffering
    that arises, suffering that ceases? Do we all have Buddha Nature? Or is all existence
    empty, without essence? Will we all eventually arrive at eternal salvation? Or do only
    those achieve liberation who see that all conditions are impermanent? Is <i>nibbana</i>
    (Skt. <i>nirvana</i>) to be found in <i>samsara</i>, the round of existences, or are
    they mutually exclusive? What <i>is</i> the sound of one hand clapping? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p3-3"></a> If we accept that truth, whatever else
    it may be, is at least not self-contradictory, then the question necessarily arises: which
    among these paths, diverse and often at odds with one another, will offer us that way to
    liberation which we seek?[<a name="3" href="#n3">3</a>] And if these teachings <i>are</i>
    all different -- or even if they are <i>not</i> -- which of them is that Teaching set
    forth 2,500 years ago by a certain member of the Gotama family of the Sakyan clan, in
    northern India, known today as the Awakened One, the Buddha? If it were only possible to
    come to a reasonable judgement on this point, then we might be able with one stroke to cut
    through the tangle of confusion we meet with when we inquire into the nature of
    &quot;Buddhism&quot;. For we will then find -- if the Teaching lives up to its reputation
    -- one coherent, sufficient and, above all, <i>relevant</i> Teaching which can serve as a
    standard in our inquiry into the nature of our mortal existence. And perhaps this is
    possible. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p3-4"></a> We know that the Pali Suttas -- the
    discourses in the Pali language -- are acknowledged by all Buddhist schools to be the
    oldest record we have of the Buddha's Teaching. We know that nearly a century ago the
    scholars of the West performed an about-face from their original majority position and now
    fully acknowledge the primacy, as regards age, of those Suttas. But we also know that
    certain objections have been raised with regard to the origin and transmission of those
    discourses. Are these objections valid? What is the difference here, if any, between
    &quot;oldest&quot; and &quot;original&quot;? How trustworthy are these texts as we now
    have them? With what degree of confidence are we able to ascertain the truth of the
    matter? Fortunately, it <i>is</i> possible to know, with reasonable confidence, the way in
    which these texts were first gathered together and then handed down to us. Let us inquire.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
    <br>
    <a name="syncretism"></a> <font size="+2"><b>Syncretism?</b></font> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p4-1"></a> It may be objected at this point (or
    even sooner) that all this <i>inquiry</i> is absurd and that the &quot;obvious&quot;
    approach, for goodness sake, is to take <i>whatever</i> is useful <i>wherever</i> we find
    it and to get on with the thing already instead of dancing about the starting line for,
    after all, truth isn't the exclusive preserve of any one narrow sectarian doctrine, is it?
    And this eclectic attitude sounds very good until one <i>tries</i> to &quot;get on with
    the thing&quot; by <i>taking</i> &quot;whatever is useful&quot; etc., for it is at
    precisely this point -- the point of beginning -- that the question arises: what <i>is</i>
    useful? And what merely seems to our blind eyes to be so? Without a standard we would be
    unable to choose between meditation, ascetic austerities, or prayers to the heavens as
    paths to liberation. It is precisely this -- a standard -- that we felt ourselves to be in
    need of when we decided to seek guidance beyond our personal opinions and judgements. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p4-2"></a> Although the question of <i>specific</i>
    doctrines lies outside our present inquiry (for we are not yet well-placed to make the
    necessary distinctions), something can nevertheless be said about the <i>approach</i> to
    specific doctrines, i.e. making a beginning. Here the question is not &quot;<i>Where</i>
    does one begin?&quot; but &quot;<i>How</i> does one begin?&quot;: perhaps the question
    that immediately follows upon &quot;where?&quot; and which is still prior to any actual
    beginning. And there seem to be two general answers to this question, How does one begin?,
    which we can conveniently label as the &quot;syncretistic&quot; approach and the
    &quot;crystalline&quot; approach. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p4-3"></a> In the syncretistic approach one views
    spiritual teachings as if they were a smorgasboard spread out on an enormous table, to be
    partaken of by all who seek spiritual sustenance. The seeker, plate in hand, helps himself
    to whatever he cares to, in whatever quantity and variety appeals to him -- let's see now,
    a bit of TM on toast, some Karma Yoga and cole slaw, a dash of Sufism for spice, a bit of
    this, a bit of that -- and if he has chosen wisely, he will consume, spiritually, a
    satisfying and nutritious blend which -- who knows -- just <i>might</i> lead to.... </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p4-4"></a> The crystalline approach, on the other
    hand, assumes that no truth can be more consistent or relevant than the teaching by which
    it is revealed, and that therefore a teaching that truly <i>leads</i> -- i.e. is
    one-pointed and consistent rather than an amorphous collection of spiritualisms -- is akin
    to a many-faceted crystal, wherein each facet may reflect its own prismatic colours, but
    each is nonetheless inseparable from the crystal as a whole, for the crystal, being an
    organic unity, is indivisible. In this approach there can be no pick-and-choose attitude,
    for to fragment such a teaching is to miss its holistic essence. In such a case, having
    once made the decision that <i>this</i> is the standard we choose to follow, we will
    thereupon voluntarily subjugate our personal preferences in favour of the advice of our
    teaching, <i>even if it is directly contrary to our own wishes</i>. This does not preclude
    taking &quot;whatever is useful&quot;. Rather, it gives us a basis for judging what is and
    is not useful. And if it should happen that within our chosen teaching we already find all
    that we need in order to &quot;get on with it&quot;, then so much the better. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p4-5"></a> But if the charge of narrowness is
    nonetheless made, then we will note first that an arrow that is broad and wide is far less
    likely to hit its mark than one that is properly shaped for one-pointed flight; and second
    that the charge of narrowness is made without understanding. For <i>no</i> point of view
    can be understood except from its own frame of reference, an observation which already
    suggests the crystalline approach, for all that it is true of syncretistic views as well.[<a
    name="4" href="#n4">4</a>] It is most commonly the case that people do not question the
    assumptions that underlie their own basic attitudes -- after all, it's <i>obvious</i>,
    isn't it? -- but until they do so, they will be necessarily unable to understand a point
    of view that does not arise from those assumptions except from within their own viewpoint,
    which is to say that they will not be able to understand it at all. And the charge of
    narrowness is made from the syncretistic point of view without comprehending the
    crystalline point of view. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="p4-6"></a> The collection of discourses known as
    the Pali Suttas heartedly recommends itself to the concerned individual as being that
    guidance to the transcendental which he seeks. They inform the seeker firstly that his
    life-problem arises dependent for its condition upon a wrong view of things, and secondly
    that a right view, which would undermine and end that problem, is to be achieved by
    following right-view guidance, namely, the training-course set forth by the Buddha. There
    can be no doubt after even a brief look at these texts that they staunchly advocate the
    crystalline approach towards liberation. In many ways do they declare themselves to be
    all-of-a-piece,[<a name="5a" href="#n5a">5a</a>] a Teaching not to be understood by taking
    from it according to personal preference.[<a name="5b" href="#n5b">5b</a>] Therefore when
    inquiring into the Pali Suttas it is a necessity, if one hopes to understand what is meant
    therein by &quot;right view&quot;, to adopt the crystalline approach, and we do so here. </font></p>

    that truth is at least consistent with itself -- i.e. that truth is not false -- then this
    question will <i>not</i> arise. Instead, one will remain lost in one's inconsistencies and
    will fail to see that coherent movement wherein one can achieve freedom from confusion and
    anxiety. [<a href="#3">Back to text</a>] </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="n4"></a> <b>4.</b> An extreme extension of the
    eclectic view, common enough nowadays, is that &quot;all teachings lead to a common
    goal&quot; or, at least, that the <i>deepest</i> teachings (=&nbsp;&quot;those I most
    approve of&quot;) do. A discussion of this idea is beyond our scope; but since this view
    so accords with the spirit of the times that it is particularly liable to be accepted
    uncritically, it is worthwhile to note that if (as is the case) it is a mistaken view,
    then its adoption would be an insurmountable barrier to realization of that which
    transcends what is common. [<a href="#4">Back to text</a>] </font></p>

    the great ocean has but one flavour, the flavour of salt, so too this Teaching has but one
    flavour, the flavour of freedom.&quot; -- Culavagga IX,1,4 (ii,236) = A.&nbsp;VIII,19

    a teacher who dwells giving importance to material things, an heir to material things,
    conjoined with material things, haggling such as this would be untenable: 'If we have it
    so, then we will do it; if we don't have it so, then we won't do it.' What then, of a
    Perfect One who dwells unentangled with material things? Monks, a faithful disciple,
    having scrutinized the teacher's advice, proceeds in accordance with this: 'The Exalted
    One is the teacher. I am the disciple. The Exalted One knows. I do not know.'&quot; --
    M.&nbsp;70 (i,480): Kitagiri Sutta. Numerous additional passages could be quoted to
    support the two texts above; but perhaps it is not necessary to belabour the point: those
    who require more evidence can find it themselves, by going to the Suttas. [<a href="#5b">Back
