      <TD WIDTH="100%"><FONT SIZE="6">I </FONT>used to be a scientist. I did 
      Theoretical Physics at Cambridge University, hanging out in the same 
      building as the later-to-be-famous Professor Stephen Hawking. I became 
      disillusioned with such science when, as an insider, I saw how dogmatic 
      some scientists could be. A dogma, according to the dictionary, is an 
      arrogant declaration of an opinion. This was a fitting description of the 
      science that I saw in the labs of Cambridge. Science had lost its sense of 
      humility. Egotistical opinion prevailed over the impartial search for 
      Truth. My favourite aphorism from that time was:<BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><I>&quot;The eminence of a great scientist, is measured by the length of 
        timethat they OBSTRUCT PROGRESS in their field&quot;!</I></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>To understand real science, one can go back to one of its founding 
      fathers, the English philosopher Francis Bacon (1561 - 1628). He 
      established the framework on which science was to progress, namely &quot;the 
      greater force of the negative instance&quot;. This meant that, having proposed 
      a theory to explain some natural phenomenon, then one should try one's 
      best to disprove it! One should test the theory with challenging 
      experiments. One must put it on trial with rigorous argument. When a flaw 
      appears in the theory, only then does science advance. A new discovery has 
      been made enabling the theory to be adjusted and refined. This fundamental 
      and original methodology of science understood that it is impossible to 
      prove anything with absolute certainty. One can only disprove with 
      absolute certainty.</P>
      <P>For example, how can one prove the basic law of gravity that &quot;what goes 
      up comes down, eventually&quot;? One may throw objects up one million times and 
      see them fall one million times. But that still does not prove &quot;what goes 
      up comes down&quot;. For NASA might then 'throw' a Saturn rocket up into space 
      to explore Mars, and that never comes down to earth again. One negative 
      instance is enough to disprove the theory with absolute certainty.</P>
      <P>Some misguided scientists maintain the theory that there is no rebirth, 
      that this stream of consciousness is incapable of returning to a 
      successive human existence. All one needs to disprove this theory, 
      according to science, is to find one instance of rebirth, just one! 
      Professor Ian Stevenson, as some of you would know, has already 
      demonstrated many instances of rebirth. The theory of no rebirth has been 
      disproved. Rebirth is now a scientific fact!</P>
      <P>Modern science gives a low priority to any efforts to disprove its pet 
      theories. There is too much vested interest in power, prestige and 
      research grants. A courageous commitment to truth takes too many 
      scientists out of their comfort zone. Scientists are, for the most part, 
      brainwashed by their education and their in-group conferences to see the 
      world in a very narrow, microscopic, way. The very worst scientists are 
      those who behave like eccentric evangelists, claiming that they alone have 
      the whole truth, and then demanding the right to impose their views on 
      everyone else.</P>
      <P>Ordinary people know so little about science that they can hardly even 
      understand the jargon. Yet, if they read in a newspaper or magazine &quot;a 
      scientist says that?&quot;, then they automatically take it to be true. Compare 
      this to our reaction when we read in the same journal &quot;a politician says 
      that?&quot;! Why do scientists have such unchallenged credibility? Perhaps it 
      is because the language and ritual of science has become so far removed 
      from the common people, that scientists have become today's revered and 
      mystical priesthood. Dressed in their ceremonial white lab coats, chanting 
      incomprehensible mumbo jumbo about multi-dimensional fractal parallel 
      universes, and performing magical rituals that transubstantiate metal and 
      plastic into TV's and computers, these modern day alchemists are so 
      awesome we'll believe anything they say. Elitist science, as once was the 
      Pope, is now infallible.</P>
      <P>Some know better. Much of what I learnt 30 years ago has now been 
      proved wrong. There are, fortunately, many scientists with integrity and 
      humility who affirm that science is, at best, a work still in progress. 
      They know that science can only suggest a truth, but can never claim a 
      truth. I was once told by a Buddhist G.P. that, on his first day at a 
      medical school in Sydney, the famous Professor, head of the Medical 
      School, began his welcoming address by stating &quot;Half of what we are going 
      to teach you in the next few years is wrong. Our problem is that we do not 
      know which half it is!&quot; Those were the words of a real scientist.</P>
      <P>Some evangelical scientists would do well to reflect on the (amended) 
      old saying &quot;Scientists rush in where angels fear to tread&quot; and stop 
      pontificating about the nature of the mind, happiness and even Nirvana. 
      Neurologists are especially prone to such neuroses (Neurosis: an undue 
      adherence to unrealistic ideas of things). They are claiming that the 
      mind, awareness and will, is now adequately explained by activity in the 
      brain. This theory was disproved over 20 years ago by Prof. Lorber's 
      discovery of the student at Sheffield University with and IQ of 126, a 
      First Class degree in mathematics, but with virtually no brain (Science, 
      Vol. 210, 12 Dec 1980)! More recently, it was disproved by Prof. Pim Van 
      Lommel, who demonstrated the existence of consciousness activity after 
      clinical death, i.e. when all brain activity has ceased (Lancet, Vol. 358, 
      15 December 2001, p 2039).</P>
      <P>Although there may be correlation between a measurable activity in part 
      of the brain and a mental impression, such co-occurrence doesn't always 
      imply that one is the cause of the other. For instance, some years ago, 
      research showed a clear correlation between cigarette smoking and the 
      non-occurrence of Alzheimer's disease. It was not that smoking cigarettes 
      somehow caused immunity from Alzheimer's, as much as the tobacco companies 
      might have wished, it was only that many smokers did not live long enough 
      to get Alzheimer's disease! Thus a co-incidence of two phenomena, even 
      when repeated, does not mean that one phenomenon is the cause of the 
      other. To claim that activity in the brain causes awareness, or mind, is 
      plainly unscientific.</P>
      <P>Buddhism is more scientific than modern science. Like science, Buddhism 
      is based on verifiable cause-and-effect relationships. But unlike science, 
      Buddhism challenges with thoroughness every belief. The famous Kalama 
      Sutta of Buddhism states that one cannot believe fully in &quot;what one is 
      taught, tradition, hearsay, scripture, logic, inference, appearance, 
      agreement with established opinion, the seeming competence of a teacher, 
      or even in one's own teacher&quot;. How many scientists are as rigorous in 
      their thinking as this? Buddhism challenges everything, including logic.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting that Quantum Theory appeared quite illogical, even 
      to such great scientists as Einstein, when it was first proposed. It is 
      yet to be disproved. Logic is only as reliable as the assumptions on which 
      it is based. Buddhism trusts only clear and objective experience.</P>
      <P>Clear experience occurs when one's measuring instruments, one's senses, 
      are bright and undisturbed. In Buddhism, this happens when the hindrances 
      of sloth-and-torpor and restlessness-and-remorse are both overcome. 
      Objective experience is that which is free from all bias. In Buddhism, the 
      three types of bias are desire, ill will and sceptical doubt. Desire makes 
      one see only what one wants to see, it bends the truth to fit one's 
      preferences. Ill will makes one blind to whatever is disturbing or 
      disconcerting to one's views and it distorts the truth by denial. 
      Sceptical doubt stubbornly refuses to accept those truths, like rebirth, 
      that are plainly valid but which fall outside of one's comforting 
      worldview. In summary, clear and objective experience only happens when 
      the Buddhist 'Five Hindrances' have been overcome. Only then can one trust 
      the data arriving through one's senses.</P>
      <P>Because scientists are not free of these five hindrances, they are 
      rarely clear and objective. It is common, for example, for scientists to 
      ignore annoying data, which do not fit their cherished theories, or else 
      confine such evidence to oblivion by filing it away as an 'anomaly'. Even 
      most Buddhists aren't clear and objective. One has to have recent 
      experience of Jhana to effectively put aside these five hindrances 
      (according to the Nalakapana Sutta , Majjhima No. 68). So only 
      accomplished meditators can claim to be real scientists, that is, clear 
      and objective.</P>
      <P>Science claims to rely not only on clear and objective observation, but 
      also on measurement. But what is measurement in science? To measure 
      something, according to the pure science of Quantum Theory, is to collapse 
      the Schroedinger Wave Equation through an act of observation. Moreover, 
      the &quot;un-collapsed&quot; form of the Schroedinger Wave Equation, that is before 
      any measurement is made, is, perhaps, science's most perfect description 
      of the world. That description is weird! Reality, according to pure 
      science, does not consist of well ordered matter with precise massed, 
      energies and positions in space, all just waiting to be measured. Reality 
      is the broadest of smudges of all possibilities, only some being more 
      probable than others. Even basic 'measurable' qualities as 'alive' or 
      'dead' have been demonstrated by science to be invalid sometimes. In the 
      notorious 'Schroedinger's Cat' thought experiment, Prof. Schroedinger's 
      cat was ingeniously placed in a real situation where it was neither dead 
      nor alive, where such measurements became meaningless. Reality, according 
      to Quantum Theory, is beyond measurements. Measuring disturbs reality, it 
      never describes it perfectly. It was Heisenberg's famous 'Uncertainty 
      Principle' that showed the inevitable error between the real Quantum world 
      and the measured world of pseudo-science.</P>
      <P>Anyway, how can anyone measure the measurer, the mind? At a recent 
      seminar on Science and Religion, at which I was a speaker, a Catholic in 
      the audience bravely announced that whenever she looks through a telescope 
      at the stars, she feels uncomfortable because her religion is threatened. 
      I commented that whenever a scientist looks the other way round through a 
      telescope, to observe the one who is watching, then they feel 
      uncomfortable because their science is threatened by what is doing the 
      seeing! So what is doing the seeing, what is this mind that eludes modern 
      science?</P>
      <P>A Grade-One teacher once asked her class &quot;What is the biggest thing in 
      the world?&quot; One little girl answered &quot;My daddy&quot;. A little boy said &quot;An 
      elephant&quot;, since he'd recently been to the zoo. Another girl suggested &quot;A 
      mountain&quot;. The six-year-old daughter of a close friend of mine replied, 
      &quot;My eye is the biggest thing in the world&quot;! The class stopped. Even the 
      teacher didn't understand her answer. So the little philosopher explained 
      &quot;Well, my eye can see her daddy, an elephant, and a mountain too. It can 
      also see so much else. If all of that can fit into my eye, then my eye 
      must be the biggest thing in the world&quot;! Brilliant.</P>
      <P>However, she was not quite right. The mind can see everything that 
      one's eye can see, and it can also imagine so much more. It can also hear, 
      smell, taste and touch, as well as think. In fact, everything that can be 
      known can fit into the mind. Therefore, the mind must be the biggest thing 
      in the world. Science's mistake is obvious now. The mind is not in the 
      brain, nor in the body. The brain, the body and the rest of the world, are 
      in the mind!</P>
      <P>Mind is the sixth sense in Buddhism, it is that which encompasses the 
      five senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch, and transcends them 
      with its own domain. It corresponds loosely to Aristotle's &quot;common sense&quot; 
      that is distinct from the five senses. Indeed, ancient Greek philosophy, 
      from where science is said to have its origins, taught six senses just 
      like Buddhism. Somewhere along the historical journey of European 
      thinking, they lost their mind! Or, as Aristotle would put it, they 
      somehow discarded their &quot;common sense&quot;! And thus we got science. We got 
      materialism without any heart. One can accurately say that Buddhism is 
      science that has kept its heart, and which hasn't lost its mind!</P>
      <P>Thus Buddhism is not a belief system. It is a science founded on 
      objective observation, i.e. meditation, ever careful not to disturb the 
      reality through imposing artificial measurements, and it is evidently 
      repeatable. People have been re-creating the experimental conditions, 
      known as establishing the factors of the Noble Eightfold Path, for over 
      twenty-six centuries now, much longer than science. And those renowned 
      Professors of Meditation, the male and female Arahants, have all arrived 
      at the same conclusion as the Buddha. They verified the timeless Law of 
      Dhamma, otherwise known as Buddhism. So Buddhism is the only real science, 
      and I'm happy to say that I'm still a scientist at heart, only a much 
      better scientist than I ever could have been at Cambridge.</P>
