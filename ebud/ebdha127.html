<hr width="25%">

<blockquote>
  <p><b>&nbsp;</p>
  </b><p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Ood was a chatty little girl, but when
  she started talking about events that happened before she was born, her parents were
  shocked.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The girl's mother, Mrs Sam-ang Mungkerd
  recalls &quot;We were stricken by fear. Back in my home village in Khon Kaen, we believe
  that a child who remembers a past life will be taken away by the spirit of her old
  mother.&quot;</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">To suppress such &quot;weird&quot; behaviour,
  they threatened the baby that if she did not stop talking nonsense, they would stop taking
  her out. &quot;It worked, at least at home,&quot; she recalls.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Later, kindergarten teachers visited Mrs
  Sam-ang and asked if the child talked about strange things at home like she did at school.
  Now Ood is 16 and remembers nothing of her childhood quirkiness.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Suppression is the typical reaction of
  parents when children talk of a previous life,&quot; says Sutdya Vajrabhaya, 54, who has
  spent six years investigating and documenting the paranormal phenomenon. Some distraught
  parents, he adds, even go so far as burning the child with lit incense or throwing him or
  her from an upper floor as &quot;shock therapy&quot; to stop the child's eerie behaviour.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Although he believes baby Ood's story, it
  remains just a weak case without the testimonies or documentation. And, like most
  past-life memory stories that float around, it will end up merely a family fable of no
  scientific bearing.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Systematic investigation and documentation,
  he says, can change that.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Rebirth is an important Buddhist
  teaching. Believers, however, embrace it out of faith while many Thais today wrongly
  dismiss it as irrelevant to one's spiritual pursuits,&quot; he explains. &quot;But if we
  investigate and document the phenomenon systematically, strong empirical data on past life
  memories can scientifically confirm the Buddhist teachings on rebirth,&quot; he says.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism sees rebirth as part of Samsara, or
  the Wheel of Existence. It teaches that this unbroken chain of lifetimes driven by greed,
  anger and delusion is the root cause of human beings' sufferings.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">An understanding of rebirth is also central
  to the Buddhist doctrine of compassion, since it teaches that every being - whether human
  and animal - is related in one way or another as spouses, children, siblings, or relatives
  at a certain point in time across the inconceivable continuum of lifetimes.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Mr Sutdya wants to return respectability to
  the belief in rebirth. That is why he joined the research team of Prof Ian Stevenson, a
  world-famous US-based scholar in paranormal science, six years ago.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Mr Sutdya's task is to scout for Thai
  children who claim to remember previous lives. Then with Dr Jurgen Keil and Dr Jim Tucker,
  the team investigate the cases through methodical interviews with the subjects and primary
  witnesses, followed by cross-checking with the family of the deceased whom the child
  claims to remember. They also obtain evidence such as post-mortem and medical documents
  where necessary.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The case is considered to be verified when
  the child's statements - often involving family secrets - match unmistakably with the life
  of the deceased, and when there is strong evidences that the child could not have obtained
  the information from others.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Thai research is part of Prof Stevenson's
  worldwide study that he has been conducting for more than 30 years. To date, he has found
  over 2,600 rebirth cases in different cultures across the globe.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">As a psychiatrist and the director of the
  Division of Personality Studies at the University of Virginia, Prof Stevenson's interest
  in rebirth did not come from religious interests but from his dissatisfaction with modern
  theories of human personality.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">He believes that genetics and environmental
  influences often cannot explain many personality abnormalities that happen early in life.
  Some children, for example, show phobias in early infancy without having had any traumatic
  experiences, and with no history of similar abnormalities in their family. He also points
  out that some one-egg twins are also markedly different from each other.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Furthermore, there is little in conventional
  theories that can explain the existence of transsexuality or birthmarks. Why are some boys
  and girls born with the belief that they are trapped inside the wrong body? And why are
  some children born with certain birthmarks or birth defects affecting particular parts of
  the body and not other parts?</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Three decades of rigorous research has
  convinced him that rebirth is often a better explanation for a child's unusual behaviour.
  While most see past-life memory as a rare and bizarre phenomenon, Prof Stevenson's growing
  database has found similar behavioural patterns across cultures among children who claim
  to remember a past life.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">For example, these children start talking
  about a past life early in life, usually between the ages of two and four. They generally
  stop doing so between five and eight. They forget it all when they are adults. About
  one-third of them have phobias which are related to the manner of death of the person
  whose life they remember. More than half of these deaths are violent, or <i>tai hong</i>
  in Thai. Interestingly, over one-third of these children have birthmarks (moles or nevi)
  or birth defects that correspond to wounds, mostly fatal, on the deceased person.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">According to Mr Sutdya, up to eighty percent
  of cases are reborn as the same sex. For those who were reborn as the different sex, Prof
  Stevenson reports that many of them become transsexuals.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The research also claims that the time gap
  between death and rebirth of a child who remembers a past life is, on average, 10 years,
  says Mr Sutdya.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">With an eye for detail, the rebirth
  researchers look for the distance between the location of death and rebirth, the
  relationship between old and new families, the mother's dreams and cravings while
  pregnant, and the child's idiosyncrasies which correspond to the person whose life he or
  she remembers.</font></p>
  <u><p ALIGN="left"></u><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800080"><strong><em>Thai
  Findings</em></strong></font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">After six years of playing detective in the
  world of the supernatural, Mr Sutdya has found 50 rebirth cases. Among them:</font></p>
  <b><p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Tukata</b>:</font>
  At five, she stunned her parents by telling them that in her previous life, she died from
  dengue fever at the age of ten. Typical of most rebirth cases, Tukata insisted that her
  parents take her to see her old family. As in most strong rebirth cases, the two families
  lived far apart and never knew each other before.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">To see if the girl's claims were true or not,
  her parents dropped her in front of her old village. She ran unaided to her old house,
  jumped up to hug her old mother who was completely caught by surprise, called her brothers
  and sisters by their nicknames, and asked for the amulet which she wanted to have back.</font></p>
  <b><p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Guy</b>:</font> The
  boy was born with an infected wound on his head and a scar-like birthmark on his right
  hand. At about the age of three, he told his parents that in his past life he was named
  Sawat and worked as a spy for Communist guerrillas. He said he was shot while taking a nap
  with his right hand resting over his head; the bullet cut through his hand and forehead
  and killed him instantly.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The boy insisted that he go to see his old
  parents who happened to be in the same extended family. Once there, he correctly
  identified family members and belongings. The boy refused, however, to talk to Sawat's
  estranged wife, saying he still hated her. He also became angry when he saw that his
  possessions had been moved, typical behaviour in rebirth cases.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Relatives say the boy has the same tough-guy
  traits as the man whose life he remembers. Sawat used to kill buffaloes and eat the meat
  raw. When pregnant, Guy's mother had strong cravings for raw meat which stopped after
  delivery. The memory of slaughter, however, distressed Guy so much that he decided never
  to touch beef again.</font></p>
  <b><p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Bow</b>: </font>She
  was born with a deformed sternum, and from the age of about 17 months, she screamed in
  fright every time she saw a collapsible table. Now four years old, she told Mr Sutdya that
  in her previous life, she was named Or and died by being crushed by a collapsible table
  while playing under it at the age of six.</font></p>
  <b><p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Pao</b>:</font> The
  boy was born with ring-like marks around his ankles and fingers, and a scar on his nose.
  At three, he began talking in detail about how he died in his past life. He said he was
  looting the house of a villager named Tong who used a long sharp knife to kill him. He
  said his fingers were cut and his ankles were tied. He expressed the wish to get revenge
  on his killer.</font></p>
  <b><p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Tum</b>:</font> The
  boy was born with a black naevus on his right chest and only one testicle. At 14 months
  old, he started talking bout his past life as Ee, a relative who had died in a motorcycle
  accident. Ee's parents were convinced that Tum used to be their son due to the wounds he
  sustained in the accident: Ee's corpse only had one testicle left. His parents had also
  dabbed soot on the dead boy's right chest, telling his spirit to bring the sign back in
  his next life.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">When taken to his old family's house, Tum
  rightly identified Ee's picture, called his siblings by their nicknames and knew of the
  personal problems of other relatives.</font></p>
  <b><p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000080">Om</b>:</font> Her
  mother has an &quot;announcing dream&quot; in which a young relative named Lek asked to
  live with her. Lek had died from head wounds sustained in a motorcycle accident, and
  consequent brain surgery could not save him. When Om was born, four people saw blood gush
  from her head.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The girl insisted on going to see her old
  family who lived in another district. She correctly commented on the refurnishing of the
  house and asked for her personal belongings, a watch and a bank savings book. The girl
  also told one relative that he still owed Lek nine baht. That relative admitted that it
  was true.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">As for phobias, Om showed a great fear of
  needles. Her old parents said an undertaker had used needles to sew up Lek's mouth, a
  death ritual believed to prevent the spirit of a person who died young and in a violent
  manner from haunting the living.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Om also refused to climb trees, explaining
  that she fell from a tree and broke her arm in her previous life. Lek's family confirmed
  it. Om and Lek also shared similar tastes in food.</font></p>
  <u><p ALIGN="left"></u><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800080"><strong><em>Experimental
  Birthmarks</em></strong></font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Given the Christian belief that there is no
  life after death and the prevalent scepticism towards the paranormal, rebirth research and
  findings are looked upon with suspicion in the West. In Thailand, however, Prof
  Stevenson's research has strengthened the belief in rebirth, which is already part of
  Buddhist teachings.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Substantial data also helps return respect to
  some old beliefs in the paranormal - such as announcing dreams, strange cravings and the
  rebirth of ancestors into the same family - which young people often dismiss as fantasies.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In addition, Thailand also has a unique death
  ritual which has become an important indicator to rebirth researchers - that of applying
  soot or red lime to the corpse to identify the person when he or she is reborn.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Research data shows that this experimental
  marking does, in fact, work. Out of 28 rebirth cases Mr Sutdya found this year, 17 were
  born with these markings. Those made with soot become black nevi which stays for life, he
  says, while those made with red lime become red nevi which fade in adulthood.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Elsewhere, birthmarks or birth defects in
  rebirth cases generally correspond to the fatal wounds of the deceased. The death ritual
  of experimental marking only exists in Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries, says
  Mr Sutdya.</font></p>
  <u><p ALIGN="left"></u><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800080"><strong><em>Rebirth
  Questions</em></strong></font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><i><font face="Times New Roman">In many of Mr Sutdya's rebirth cases, the
  reborn Person does not seem to pay for their past bad deeds. Does that mean the law of
  karma is not true?</font></i></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">-- As far as the law of karma is concerned,
  he says the two lifetimes under scrutiny - namely, the present and the immediate past -
  constitute only a tiny fraction of a long, unbroken chain of rebirths. And while one can
  never escape the consequences of one's actions, the debt is not necessarily paid right
  away in the immediate next life.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">How long is the continuum of lifetimes
  exactly? Buddha one said to his disciples: &quot;Long time have you suffered the death of
  father and mother, of sons, daughters, brothers and sisters. And while you were thus
  suffering, you have, verily, shed more tears upon this long way than there is water in the
  four oceans.&quot;</font></p>
  <i><p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Since it is believed that fatal wounds can
  carry over into the next life in the form of birthmarks and defects, does it also mean
  that one should not donate organs after death?</font></i></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">-- As for organ donations, Buddhism focuses
  on one's intentions. Since donating organs comes from a virtuous intention, donors will
  certainly receive virtuous consequences in return, he reassures.</font></p>
  <i><p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">How can you tell a rebirth hoax from the
  real thing?</i> </font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">-- In cases involving children with past-life
  memories, rigorous investigation can help detect frauds, says Mr Sutdya.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">As for adults who advertise past-life
  memories, his suggestion is take them as frauds first, particularly those who claim to be
  grand personalities of the past.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If they do not want to make money, they
  are most likely mentally-ill patients suffering from delusions of grandeur,&quot; he says.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Although adults can recollect past lives
  under deep hypnosis, he warns against it because most of the images are historically
  incorrect.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">As for the images of past lives one sees
  during meditation sessions, most meditation masters say the images are illusions created
  by one's mind.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">This means genuine cases of adults who can
  recollect past lives are extremely small. According to Buddhism, only those who attain
  high levels of meditation can recollect past lives. But then again, Buddha forbids his
  followers from advertising these powers. Those who do are then questionable.</font></p>
  <u><p ALIGN="left"></u><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800080"><strong><em>End of
  Rebirth</em></strong></font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Mr Sutdya refuses to use the word
  &quot;reincarnation&quot; as often used in Prof Stevenson's studies because reincarnation
  implies a Hindu belief in immortal soul and self.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism, however, teaches <strong><i>anatta</i></strong>,
  or no-self. And the word rebirth in Buddhism implies there can be an end to it.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Buddha teaches that we can stop the
  Wheel of Existence and break the chain of rebirth if we work hard to deal with our likes
  and dislikes and to transcend our cravings, anger and delusions.&quot; Says Mr Sutdya, who
  is also a devout Buddhist.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Before taking on rebirth research, Mr Sutdya
  admits that he did not totally believe in life after death. &quot;Now I am one hundred
  percent convinced,&quot; he says.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The cases he encountered confirmed over and
  over again the futility of clinging, either to material possessions or to a beloved
  person. Which is why he now devotes himself to serious meditation practice in order to
  overcome those attachments.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">He hopes that scientific research on rebirth
  can help convince others of the reality of the Wheel of Existence and prompt them to
  overcome the causes of suffering in order to break the chain of rebirth.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If that is the case, then I have done
  my duty in this lifetime as a good Buddhist,&quot; he says.</font><u></p>
