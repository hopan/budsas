  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-oOo-</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">L</font>ast Sunday I gave you a brief
  outline - a very brief one too - of the life of our Lord Buddha, up to the moment of his
  attainment of Buddhahood. I am going to tell you today what his teachings are. Buddhist
  teachings are preserved in what we call the <i>Tipitakas, </i>consisting of the <i>Suttas </i>(Discourses),
  the <i>Vinaya </i>(Laws of discipline for <i>Sanghas, </i>or monks ) and the <i>Abhidhamma
  </i>( Philosophical Teachings). We have the <i>Tipitakas </i>in <i>Pali </i>in several
  volumes which will require an intelligent Pali scholar some months just to read through. I
  propose, therefore, to confine myself today only to essentials, that is to say, the
  fundamental Truths of Buddhism. Before Lord Buddha took upon himself the task of spreading
  his <i>Dhamma </i>(Teachings), he remained in silent meditation for a continuous period of
  49 days, viz;, seven days under the Bo tree and seven days each in six other spots nearby,
  enjoying at times the peace of Supreme <i>Nibbana </i>and at another going deeper in
  investigation into the most delicate problems of <i>Paramattha-Dhamma</i> (Ultimate
  Realities). On his complete mastery of the law of <i>Patthana </i>(the Law of Relations),
  in which the infinite modes of relations between thought moments are also dealt with,
  there emerged from his body brilliant rays of six colours, which eventually settled down
  as a halo of six-coloured rays around his head. He passed through this seven times seven
  days meditation without food. It is all beyond us to be without food for 49 days. The fact
  remains that he was throughout the period on a mental plane as distinct from a physical
  plane, in which mankind normally is. It is not material food that maintains the
  fine-material existence and life-continuum of beings in the Fine-material Worlds of the
  Brahmas, but the <i>Jhanic Piti</i>, which in itself is a nutriment. So also was the case
  with the Buddha, whose existence during this long period was on a mental rather than
  physical plane. Our experiments in this line of research have firmly convinced us that for
  a man of such high intellectual and mental development as the Buddha, this is a
  possibility.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It was the day break of the 50th day of his Buddhahood
  when he arose from this long spell of meditation. Not that he was tired or exhausted, but,
  as he was no longer in the mental plane, he felt a longing for food. At that time, two
  traders of a foreign land were travelling in several carts loaded with merchandise through
  the Uruvela forest. A <i>Deva </i>of the forest who was their relative in one of their
  previous existences advised them to take the opportunity of paying homage to the
  All-Enlightened Buddha who had just arisen from his meditation. They accordingly went to
  the place where the Buddha was seated, illumined by the halo of six coloured rays. They
  could not resist their feelings. They lay prostrate in worship and adoration before the
  Buddha and later offered preserved rice cakes with honey for the first meal of the Buddha.
  They were accepted as His lay disciples. On their request that they might be given some
  tokens for their worship, the Buddha presented them with eight strands of hair from His
  head. You will be surprised to know that these two traders were <i>Taphussa </i>and <i>Bhallika
  of Okkalapa</i>, which today is known as Rangoon, where you are at this moment. And the
  renowned Shwedagon, which you all probably have visited, is the Pagoda in which were
  enshrined all the eight hair-relics of the Buddha under the personal direction of the then
  ruler of <i>Okkalapa, </i>2540 years ago. It has been preserved and renovated till now by
  successive Buddhist kings and devout laymen. Unfortunately, however, these two traders of <i>Okkalapa,
  </i>who had the privilege of becoming the first lay disciples of the Buddha, were
  disciples only by faith, without a taste of the <i>Buddha-Dhamma </i>in actual practice,
  which alone would give them deliverance from suffering and death. Faith is, no doubt, a
  preliminary requisite, but it is the practice of the Teachings which really counts. The
  Buddha therefore said, <i><font COLOR="#800040">&quot;The Path must be trodden by each
  individual; Buddhas do but point the Way.&quot; </font></i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800080">The Teachings of the
  Buddha </font></h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Buddhism is not a religion according to its
    dictionary meaning because it has no centre in God, as is the case in all other religions.
    Strictly speaking, Buddhism is a system of philosophy coordinated with a code of morality,
    physical and mental. The goal in view is the extinction of suffering and death.&quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Four Noble Truths taught by the Buddha in his first
  sermon, known as the <i>Dhamma Cakka Pavattana Sutta</i> (viz. the Discourse to set in
  motion the Wheel of <i>Dhamma) </i>form the basis on which is founded this system of
  philosophy. In fact, the first three of the Four Noble Truths expound the philosophy of
  the Buddha, while the fourth (the Eightfold Noble Path which is a code of
  morality-cum-philosophy) serves as a means for the end. This first sermon was given to the
  five ascetics led by <i>Kondanna, </i>who were his early companions in search of the
  Truth. <i>Kondanna </i>was the first disciple of the Buddha in practice to become an <i>Arahat
  </i>(i.e Holy One who got beyond the limitations of all fetters).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now we come to the Four Noble Truths. They are: </font><ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">(i) <i>Dukkha Sacca </i>: The Truth of Suffering </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) <i>Samudaya Sacca</i>: The Truth of the Origin of
      Suffering </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) <i>Nirodha Sacca</i>: The Truth of the Extinction of
      Suffering </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">(iv) <i>Magga Sacca </i>: The Truth of the Path leading to
      the Extinction of Suffering</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To come to a complete understanding of the fundamental
  concepts in the philosophy of the Buddha, emphasis is laid on the need for the realisation
  of the Truth of Suffering. To bring home this point, Lord Buddha tackled the problem from
  two different angles.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Firstly, </b>by a process of reasoning. He made his
  disciples feel that life is a struggle, life is suffering; birth is suffering; old age is
  suffering; illness is suffering; death is suffering. The influence of sensuality is,
  however, so strong in mankind that they are normally apt to forget this themselves, to
  forget what they have to pay therefor. Just think for a moment how life exists in the
  pre-natal period; how from the moment of birth the child has to struggle for existence;
  what preparations he has to make to face life; what, as a man , he has to be struggling
  till he breathes his last. You can very well imagine what life is. Life is indeed
  suffering. The more one is attached to self, the greater is the suffering. In fact, what
  pains and sufferings a man has to undergo are suppressed in favour of momentary sensual
  pleasures which are but occasional spotlights in the darkness. But for the <i>Moha </i>(delusion)
  which keeps him away from the Truth, he would surely have worked out his way to
  emancipation from the rounds of &quot;Life, Suffering and Death.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Secondly</b>, the Buddha made it known to his disciples
  that the human body is composed of <i>Kalapas </i>(atomic units), each dying out
  simultaneously as it becomes. Each <i>Kalapa </i>is a mass formed of the following nature
  elements: </font><ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">(i) <i>Pathavi </i>: Extension (literally, earth) </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) <i>Apo </i>: Cohesion (lit., water) </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">(iii <i>Tejo </i>: Radiation (lit., heat and cold) </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">(iv) <i>Vayo </i>: Motion (lit., air) </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">(v) <i>Vanna </i>: Colour </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">(vi) <i>Gandha </i>: Smell </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">(vii) <i>Rasa </i>: Taste </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">(viii) <i>Oja </i>: Nutritive essence</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first four are called <i>Maha-Bhutas</i>, i.e.,
  essential material qualities which are predominant in a <i>Kalapa. </i>The other four are
  merely subsidiaries which are dependent upon and born out of the former. A <i>Kalapa </i>is
  the minutest particle noticeable in the physical plane. It is only when the eight nature
  elements (which have merely the characteristic of behaviour) are together that the entity
  of a <i>Kalapa </i>is formed. In other words, the coexistence of these eight nature
  elements of behaviour makes a mass which, in Buddhism, is known as a <i>Kalapa. </i>These <i>Kalapas,
  </i>according to the Buddha, are in a state of perpetual change or flux. They are nothing
  but a stream of energies, just like the light of a candle or an electric bulb. The body,
  as we call it, is not an entity as it seems to be, but a continuum of matter with life
  force coexisting.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To a casual observer, a piece of iron is motionless. The
  scientist knows that it is composed of electrons, etc., all in a state of perpetual change
  or flux. If it is so with a piece of iron, what will be the case for a living organism,
  say a human being? The changes that are taking place inside the human body must be more
  violent. Does man feel the rocking vibrations within himself? Does the scientist who knows
  that all is in a state of change or flux ever feel that his own body is but energy and
  vibration? What will be the repercussion on the mental attitude of the man who
  introspectively sees that his own body is mere energy and vibration? To quench thirst one
  may just easily drink a glass of water from a village well. Supposing his eyes are as
  powerful as microscopes, he would surely hesitate to drink the very same water in which he
  must see the magnified microbes. So also, when one comes to a realization of the perpetual
  change within himself (i.e., <i>Anicca </i>or Impermanence), he must necessarily come to
  the understanding as a sequel thereto of the Truth of Suffering in consequence of the
  sharp sense of feeling of the radiation, vibration and friction of the atomic units
  within. Indeed, Life is Suffering, both within and without, to all appearances and in
  ultimate reality.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When I say, Life is Suffering, as the Buddha taught,
  please be so good as not to run away with the idea that, if that is so, life is miserable,
  life is not worth living, and that the Buddhist concept of suffering is a terrible concept
  which will give you no chance of a reasonably happy life. What is happiness? For all that
  science has achieved in the field of materialism, are the peoples of the world happy? They
  may find sensual pleasure off and on, but in their heart of hearts they are not happy
  concerning what has happened, what is happening and what may happen next. Why? This is
  because, while man has mastery over matter, he is still lacking in mastery over his mind.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Pleasure born of sensuality is nothing compared with the <i>Piti
  </i>(or rapture) born of the inner peace of mind which can be secured through a process of
  Buddhist meditation. Sense pleasures are preceded and followed by troubles and pains, as
  in the case of a rustic who finds pleasure in cautiously scratching the itches over his
  body, whereas <i>Piti </i>is free from such troubles and pains either way. It will be
  difficult for you, looking from a sensuous field, to appreciate what that <i>Piti </i>is
  like. But I know you can enjoy it and have a taste of it for comparative evaluation. There
  is therefore nothing to the supposition that Buddhism teaches something that will make you
  feel miserable with the nightmare of suffering. But please take it from me that it will
  give you an escape from the normal conditions of life, a lotus as it were in a pond of
  crystal water immune from its fiery surroundings. It will give you that &quot;Peace
  Within&quot; which will satisfy you that you are getting not only beyond the day-to-day
  troubles of life, but slowly and surely beyond the limitation of &quot;Life, Suffering and
  Death.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What then is the Origin of Suffering? The origin of it,
  the Buddha said, is Tanha or Craving. Once the seed of desire is sown, it grows into greed
  and multiplies into craving or lust, either for power or for material gains. The man in
  whom this seed is sown becomes a slave to these cravings and he is automatically driven to
  strenuous labours of mind and body to keep pace with them till the end comes. The final
  result must surely be the accumulation of the evil mental forces generated by his own
  actions, words and thoughts which are motivated by <i>Loba </i>(desire) and <i>Dosa </i>(anger)
  inherent in him. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Philosophically again, it is the mental forces of actions <i>(Sankhara)
  </i>which react in the course of time on the person originating them, and which are
  responsible for this stream of mind and matter, the origin of suffering within.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800080">The Path Leading to the
  Extinction of Suffering</font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What then is the Path leading to the Extinction of
  Suffering? The Path is none other than the Noble Eightfold Path taught by the Buddha in
  his first sermon. This Eightfold Path is divided into three main stages, namely, <i>Sila,
  Samadhi</i> and <i>Panna.</i> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sila</b>
  (The Precept) </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Right Speech <br>
    2. Right Action <br>
    3. Right Livelihood </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Samadhi
  </b>(Tranquillity of Mind) </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. Right Exertion<br>
    5. Right Attentiveness<br>
    6. Right Concentration </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Panna
  </b>(Wisdom, Insight) </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">7. Right Aspiration<br>
    8. Right Understanding</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font color="#000080">(1) Sila.</font> </b>The three
  characteristic aspects of <i>Sila </i>are:</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. <i>Samma Vaca</i>; Right Speech<br>
    2. <i>Samma Kammanta</i>: Right Action<br>
    3. <i>Samma Ajiva</i>: Right Livelihood</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">By Right Speech is meant: Speech which must be true,
  beneficial and neither foul nor malicious.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">By Right Action is meant: The fundamentals of morality,
  which are opposed to killing, stealing, sexual misconduct and drunkenness.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">By Right Livelihood is meant: A way of living by trades
  other than those which increase the suffering of all beings - such as slave trading, the
  manufacture of weapons and traffic in intoxicating drugs.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">These represent generally the Code of Morality as
  initially pronounced by the Buddha in his very first sermon. Later, however, he amplified
  it and introduced separate Codes for the Monks and Lay disciples.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I need not worry you with what has been prescribed for
  monks. I will just let you know what the code of morality, or the precepts, for a Buddhist
  Lay Disciple is. This is called <i>Panca Sila</i>, or the Five Precepts, which are: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(i)<b> Panatipata:</b> Abstaining from killing any
    sentient being. (Life is the most precious thing for all beings and in prescribing this
    precept the Buddha's compassion extends to all beings.) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) <b>Adinnadana:</b> Abstaining from taking what is not
    given. (This serves as a check against improper desires for possessions.) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) <b>Kamesu-micchacara:</b> Abstaining from sexual
    misconduct. (Sexual desire is latent in man. This is irresistible to almost all. Unlawful
    sexual indulgence is therefore something which the Buddha prohibited.) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(iv) <b>Musavada:</b> Abstaining from telling lies. (This
    precept is included to fulfil by way of speech the essence of Truth.) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(v) <b>Surameraya: </b>Abstaining from intoxication.
    (Intoxication causes a man to lose his steadfastness of mind and the reasoning power so
    essential for the realization of Truth.) </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <i>Panca Sila</i> therefore is intended to control
  actions and words and to serve as a foundation for <i>Samadhi </i>(Equanimity of Mind).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font color="#000080">(2) Samadhi.</font> </b>Ladies
  and gentlemen, we now come to the mental aspect of Buddhism, which I am sure will greatly
  interest you. In the second stage of the Eightfold Noble Path, viz., <i>(Samadhi) </i>are
  included:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. <i>Samma Vayama:</i> Right Exertion <br>
    2. <i>Samma Sati:</i> Right Attentiveness <br>
    3. <i>Samma Samadhi:</i> Right Concentration</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Right Exertion is, of course, a prerequisite for Right
  Attentiveness. Unless one makes a determined effort to narrow down the range of thoughts
  of one's wavering and unsteady mind, one cannot expect to secure that attentiveness of
  mind which in turn helps one to bring the mind by Right Concentration to a state of
  One-pointedness and Tranquillity (or <i>Samadhi). </i>It is here that the mind becomes
  freed from hindrances - pure and tranquil, illumined within and without. The mind in such
  a state becomes powerful and bright. Outside, it is represented by light which is just a
  mental reflex, with the light varying in degrees from that of a star to that of the sun.
  To be plain, this light which is reflected before the mind's eye in complete darkness is a
  manifestation of the purity, tranquillity and serenity of the mind.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Hindus work for it. To go from light into the void and
  to come back to light is truly <i>Brahmanic. </i>The New Testament, in Matthew, speaks of
  &quot;a body full of light.&quot; We hear also of Roman Catholic priests meditating
  regularly for this very miraculous light. The Koran, too, gives prominence to the
  &quot;Manifestation of Divine Light.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This mental reflex of light denotes the purity of mind
  within, and the purity of mind forms the essence of a religious life, whether he be
  Buddhist, Hindu, Christian or Muslim. Indeed, Purity of Mind is the greatest common
  denominator of all religions. Love, which alone is a means for the unity of mankind, must
  be supreme, and it cannot be so unless the mind is transcendentally pure. A balanced mind
  is necessary to balance the unbalanced minds of others. &quot;As a fletcher makes straight
  his arrow, a wise man makes straight his trembling and unsteady thought, which is
  difficult to guard, difficult to hold back.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So said the Buddha. Exercise of the mind is just as
  necessary as exercise of the physical body. Why not, then, give exercise to the mind and
  make it pure and strong so that you may enjoy the &quot;<i>Jhanic </i>Peace Within.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Inner Peace begins to permeate the mind, you will
  surely progress in the knowledge of Truth.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Believe it or not, it is our experience that under a
  proper guide, this Inner Peace and Purity of Mind with light can be secured by <em>one and
  all</em> irrespective of their religion or creed, provided they have sincerity of purpose
  and are prepared to submit to the guide for the period of trial.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When by continued practice one has complete mastery over
  one's mind, one can enter into <i>Jhanic </i>states (trances) and gradually develop
  himself to acquire the attainments <i>(Samapattis) </i>which will give one supernormal
  powers like those exercised by <i>Kala-Devila, </i>the hermit teacher of King <i>Suddhodana.
  </i>This, of course, must be tried in penance and away from human habitations, but it is
  rather dangerous for those who still have traces of passion in them. Anyway, such a
  practice, which gives supernormal powers in this mundane field, was not encouraged by the
  Buddha, whose sole object of developing <i>Samadhi </i>was to have the purity and strength
  of mind essential for the realization of Truth. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We have in Buddhism forty methods of concentration, of
  which the most outstanding is <i>Anapana, </i>that is, concentration on the incoming and
  outgoing breath, the method followed by all the Buddhas.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font color="#000080">(3) Panna.</font> </b>Ladies and
  gentlemen, I will now take up the philosophical aspect of Buddhism in the third stage of
  the Noble Eightfold Path, - viz.,<i>Panna </i>or Insight. The two characteristic aspects
  of <i>Panna </i>are: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. <i>Samma-sankappa:</i> Right Aspiration <br>
    2. <i>Samma-ditthi:</i> Right Understanding</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Right Understanding of the Truth is the aim and object of
  Buddhism, and Right Aspiration (or Right Thought) is the analytical study of mind and
  matter, both within and without, in order to come to a realization of Truth.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You have heard of <i>Nama </i>and <i>Rupa </i>(mind and
  matter) so many times. I owe you a further explanation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Nama </i>is so called because of its tendency to
  incline towards an object of sense. <i>Rupa </i>is so called because of its impermanence
  due to perpetual change. The nearest terms in English to <i>Nama </i>and <i>Rupa </i>therefore
  are mind and matter. I say &quot;nearest&quot; because the meaning is not exact.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Nama, </i>strictly speaking, is the term applied to the
  following:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(i) Consciousness <i>: (Vinnana)</i><br>
    (ii) Feeling <i>: (Vedana)</i> <br>
    (iii) Perception <i>: (Sanna)<br>
    </i>(iv) Volitional Energies <i>: (Sankhara)</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">These, together with <i>Rupa </i>in the material state,
  make what we call the <i>Panca-kkhanda</i> or Five Aggregates. It is in these five
  aggregates that the Buddha has summed up all the mental and physical phenomena of
  existence, which in reality is a continuum of mind and matter coexisting, but which to a
  layman is his personality or ego.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In<i> Samma-sankappa</i> (Right Aspiration), the disciple,
  who by then has developed the powerful lens of <i>Samadhi, </i>focuses his attention into
  his own self and by introspective meditation makes an analytical study of the nature,
  first of <i>Rupa </i>(Matter) and then of <i>Nama </i>(mind and the mental properties). He
  feels - and at times he also sees - the <i>Kalapas </i>in their true state. He begins to
  realize that both <i>Rupa </i>and <i>Nama </i>are in constant change - impermanent and
  fleeting. As his power of concentration increases, the nature of the forces in him becomes
  more and more vivid. He can no longer get out of the impression that the <i>Panca-kkhandha</i>,
  or Five Aggregates, are suffering, within the law of Cause and Effect. He is now convinced
  that, in reality, all is suffering within and without and there is no such thing as an
  ego. He longs for a state beyond suffering. So eventually going beyond the bounds of
  suffering, he moves from the mundane to the supramundane state and enters the stream of <i>Sotapanna,
  </i>the first of the four stages of the <i>Ariyas </i>(Noble Ones). Then he becomes free
  from (i) ego, (ii) doubts and (iii) attachment to rules and rituals. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second stage is <i>Sakadagami </i>(Once-Returner), on
  coming to which sensuous craving and ill-will become attenuated. He ceases to have any
  passion or anger when he attains the third stage of <i>Anagami </i>(Non-Returner). <i>Arahatship
  </i>is the final goal. Each of the <i>Ariyas </i>can feel what <i>Nibbana </i>is like,
  even as a man, as often as he may choose by going into the fruition stage of <i>Sotapanna,
  </i>etc., which gives him the <i>Nibbanic </i>Peace Within.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This &quot;Peace Within&quot;, which is identified with <i>Nibbana,
  </i>has no parallel because it is supramundane. Compared to this, the <i>Jhanic Peace
  Within </i>, which I mentioned earlier in dealing with <i>Samadhi, </i>is negligible
  because while the <i>Nibbanic Peace Within </i>takes one beyond the limits of the
  thirty-one planes of existence, the <i>Jhanic Peace Within</i> will still keep one within
  these planes - that is to say, in the fine-material world of the <i>Brahmas.</i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ladies and gentlemen, just a word more. What I have said
  includes only some of the fundamental aspects of Buddhism. With the time at my disposal, I
  hope I have given you my best:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To come to a state of Purity of Mind with a light before
    you; <br>
    To go into a Jhanic state at will; <br>
    To experience for yourselves Nibbanic Peace Within. <br>
    These are all within your reach.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Why not, then, try for the first two at least, which are
  within the confines of your own religion? I am prepared to give you any help that you may
  require. </font></p>
  <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">May I again express my gratitude to you all for your
  patient listening. My thanks are also due to the Clergy of the Church for their kind
  permission.</font></em></p>
