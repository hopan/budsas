First Discourse of the Buddha</font></h2>

<blockquote>
    <p align="center"><font color="#800000">Sitagu International
    Buddhist Academy<br>
    Sagaing Hills, Sagaing, Myanmar</font></p>
    <hr width="30%">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Precisely two months after his Enlightenment at Buddhagaya
    on the full - moon day of Asalhi (July), the Buddha delivered
    the first discourse to group of five ascetics who had been
    His disciples previously.</p>
    <p>This discourse was expounded by the Buddha, while He was
    residing at Deer Park in Isipatana, near Baranasi. The
    Intellectual five monks were closely associated with Buddha
    for six years in Uruvela forest before his enlightenment.</p>
    <p>They were the only human beings that were present to hear
    the first sermon. Many other invisible beings such as devas
    and brahmas also were present on that great occasion. They
    took advantage of the golden opportunity of listening to the
    first sermon. The Buddha directly addressed His sermon to the
    five ascetics and the discourse was intended mainly for them.</p>
    <p><b>Dhammacakka</b> is the name given to this first
    discourse of the Buddha. Here in 'dhamma' means wisdom or
    knowledge and 'cakka' means founding or establishment.
    Therefore, Dhammacakka means the 'Founding of Wisdom, or the
    Establishment of Wisdom'. Dhammacakkapavattana means the
    Exposition of the Establishment of Wisdom. Dhamma may also be
    interpreted as Truth and cakka as wheel. Therefore, <strong>Dhammacakkapavattana</strong>
    would mean the Turning of the wheel of Truth.</p>
    <h3 align="left"><font color="#800000"><b>Two Extremes</b></font></h3>
    <p>In this most important discourse He cautioned His old
    disciples to avoid two extremes. His actual words were:
    &quot;There two extremes which should not be resorted to by a
    recluse who has renounced the world&quot;.</p>
    <p><b>One extreme was constant attachment to sensual
    pleasures. </b>The Buddha described this extreme as base,
    vulgar, worldly, ignoble and profit less. This extreme of
    self-indulgence retards spiritual progress of meditators. <b>Another
    extreme was self-motification which weakens the intellect. </b>This
    extreme is not practised by the ordinary man. The Buddha
    remarked that it is painful, ignoble, and profitless. Unlike
    the first extreme this is not described as base, worldly, and
    vulgar. The Buddha had painful experience of this profitless
    course, described it as useless. It only multiplies suffering
    instead of diminishing it.</p>
    <p>Ariya means Noble Ones who are free from passions. Attha
    means the Ultimate Good. For a Buddhist this is Nibbana, the
    complete emancipation from suffering. Therefore, <b>'anatthasamhita'
    </b>may be interpreted as not conducive to ultimate good.</p>
    <p>The Buddha said that by realizing the mistake of both
    these two extremes, He followed a middle path. He discovered
    this new path by Himself. The Buddha termed His new system <b>&quot;Majjhima
    patipada&quot;</b>, the <b>&quot;Middle Path&quot;.</b></p>
    <p>Unlike the two diametrically opposite extremes he
    rejected, this middle path produces spiritual insight and
    intellectual wisdom to see things as they truly are. When
    insight is clarified and the intellect is sharpened,
    everything is seen in its true perspective.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the Middle Path leads to the subjugation of
    passions and the multiplying of wisdom and peace. Above all
    it leads to the attainment of the four supramundane Path
    Knowledges of Sainthood, to the understanding of the Four
    Noble Truths and finally to the realization of the Ultimate
    Goal, Nibbana.</p>
    <h3 align="left"><font color="#800040">The Middle Path</font></h3>
    <p>Now, what is the Middle Path? <b>The Buddha replied: It is
    the Noble Eightfold Path.</b></p>
    <p>Then He elaborated the eight factors of this Noble Path.</p>
    <p><b>1. </b>The first factor is <font color="#000080"><b>Right
    Understanding</b></font>. This is the key-note of Buddhism.
    The Buddha started with Right Understanding in order to clear
    the doubts of the group of five monks, and guided them on the
    right way.</p>
    <p>Right Understanding deals with knowledge of oneself as one
    really is. It is explained as the knowledge the four Noble
    Truths also. These Truths are concerned with this
    &quot;one-fathom long body of man&quot;. Right understanding
    of the first Noble Truth leads to the eradication of the
    second Noble Truth which is the origin of the first Noble
    Truth.</p>
    <p>One who searches for supramundane happiness and final
    liberation must understand that the first Noble Truth is to
    be penetrated, the Second Noble Truth to be eradicated, the
    Third Noble Truth is to be realized and the Fourth Noble
    Truth is to be followed. This is the brief meaning of Right
    Understanding. The key-note of Buddhism is this Right
    Understanding.</p>
    <p><b>2.</b> Clear vision leads to clear thinking. The second
    factor of the Noble Eightfold Path, therefore, is <font
    color="#000080"><b>Right Thinking</b>.</font> This mental
    state may be called &quot;initial application&quot;. This
    important mental state eliminates wrong ideas or emotions and
    helps the other moral adjuncts to be directed towards
    Nibbana.</p>
    <p><b>Samma Sankappa (Right Thought) </b>serves the double
    purpose of eliminating evil thoughts and developing pure
    thoughts. In this particular connection, Right Thought is
    three-fold:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>a.<b> Nekkhamma Sankappa </b>- The Thought of
        Renunciation of worldly pleasures or the thought of
        selflessness. This is opposed to attachment, selfishness,
        and self-possessiveness.</p>
        <p>b. <b>Abyapada Sankappa </b>- The thought of
        loving-kindness or benevolence which is opposed to
        hatred, ill-will, or aversion.</p>
        <p>c. <b>Avihimsa Sankappa</b> - The thought of
        harmlessness or compassion, which is opposed to cruelty
        and callousness.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>These evil and good forces are latent in all mankind. As
    long as we are worldlings, these evil forces rise to the
    surface at unexpected moments in disconcerting strength. When
    once they are totally eradicated on attaining full
    enlightenment, ones stream of consciousness becomes perfectly
    purified.</p>
    <p>He whose mind is free from selfish desires, hatred and
    cruelty, and is saturated with spirit of selflessness,
    loving-kindness, and harmlessness, lives in perfect peace. He
    is indeed a blessing to himself and others.</p>
    <p><b>3.</b> Right Thought leads to <font color="#000080"><b>Right
    Speech</b></font>, the third factor. It deals with refraining
    from false speech, slandering, harsh words and frivolous
    talk.</p>
    <p>People should be truthful and trustworthy and should ever
    seeks the good and beautiful in others, instead of deceiving,
    defaming, denouncing, or disuniting of others. A harmless
    mind generated by loving-kindness can not give vent to harsh
    speech which first defaces the speaker and then hurts
    another. Whatever his utterance is not only true, but it must
    also be sweet and pleasant, useful, fruitful, beneficial and
    acceptable by others.</p>
    <p><b>4. </b><font color="#000080"><b>Right Action</b></font>
    follows after Right Speech, Right Action entails refraining
    from killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct. These three
    evil deeds are caused by craving and anger, associated with
    ignorance. By the gradual eliminating of these causes from
    the mind, blameworthy actions will find no expression. Being
    pure in mind, a person will lead a pure life.</p>
    <p><b>5. </b><font color="#000080"><b>Right Livelihood:</b></font>
    Purifying view, thoughts, words, and deeds at the outset, the
    spiritual pilgrim tries to purify his livelihood by
    refraining from the five kinds of trade which are for bidden
    to lay disciples. They are trading in 1) weapons, 2) humans,
    3) the slaughter of animals and 4) intoxicating drink and
    drugs. To show an appreciation for the beauty of life, all
    people should abstain from these five kinds of improper
    trade.</p>
    <p><b>6.</b> <font color="#000080"><b>Right Effort</b></font><font
    color="#800040"><b> </b></font>is fourfold, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>a. The endeavour to prevent the arising of evils not
        yet arisen.<br>
        b. The endeavour to discard evil that has already arisen.<br>
        c. The endeavour to cultivate good not yet arisen. <br>
        d. The endeavour to develop the good which has already
        arisen. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Right Effort plays a very important part in the Noble
    Eightfold Path. It is by ones own effort that deliverance is
    obtained; not by seeking refuge in others or by offering
    prayers.</p>
    <p>Both a rubbish-heap of evil and a store-house of virtue
    are found in men. By Right Effort one removes the
    rubbish-heap and cultivates the seeds of latent virtues.</p>
    <p><b>7.</b> Right Effort is closely associated with <font
    color="#000080"><b>Right Mindfulness</b></font>. It is
    constant mindfulness with regard to body, feelings, thoughts
    and mind objects. Mindfulness on these four objects tends to
    eradicate misconceptions with regard to desirability,
    so-called happiness, permanence and an immortal soul.</p>
    <p><b>8.</b> Right Effort and Right Mindfulness lead to <font
    color="#000080"><b>Right Concentration</b></font>, which is
    one-pointedness of mind. A concentrated mind acts a powerful
    aid to see things as they truly are by means of penetrative
    insight.</p>
    <p>Of these eight factors of the Noble Eightfold Path, the,
    first two are grouped under Wisdom, the second three under
    Morality, and the last three under Concentration. According
    to the order of development, <strong>Sila-Morality</strong>, <strong>Samadhi-Concentration</strong>,
    and <strong>Panna-Wisdom</strong> are the three stages of the
    Noble Path. All these factors denote the mental attitude of
    the aspirant who is striving to gain Deliverance.</p>
    <p>Having prefaced the discourse with a description of the
    two extremes and His newly discovered Middle Path, the Buddha
    expounded the Four Noble Truths in detail.</p>
    <h3 align="left"><font color="#800000">&quot;Sacca&quot;</font></h3>
    <p>Sacca is the Pali term for Truth which means what really
    is. Its Sanskrit equivalent is Satya which denotes an
    incontrovertible fact. The Buddha expressed definitely four
    such Truths, the foundations of His teaching, which are
    associated with the so-called being. Hence, His doctrine is
    homo-centric, in contrast to theo-centric religions. His
    teaching is inward looking rather than outward looking.
    Whether a Buddha arises or not, these Truths always exist. It
    is the Buddha who reveals these to the deluded world. Nobody
    can change them with time, space, or person, because they are
    Ultimate Truths. The Buddha did not depend upon anyone for
    His realization of the Noble Truths.</p>
    <p>He Himself said in this discourse: - <em><strong>&quot;With
    regard to this Dhamma unheard before, there arose in me the
    eye; the knowledge, the wisdom, the insight and the
    light&quot;</strong></em>. These words are very significant,
    because they testify to the originality of His new teaching.</p>
    <p>In Pali these truths are called <b>Ariya Saccani.</b>
    These were discovered by Ariya who is far removed from
    passions. Therefore, they are so- called Ariya Saccani, The
    Noble Truths.</p>
    <h3 align="left"><font color="#800000">The First Noble Truth </font></h3>
    <p>The First Noble Truth deals with <strong>dukkha</strong>
    which means suffering or misery. Here, &quot;du&quot; means
    emptiness and &quot;kha&quot; means feeling. Dukkha therefore
    means feeling of emptiness. Average men are only
    surface-seers.. An Ariya sees things as they truly are. To an
    Ariya all life is suffering and he finds no real happiness in
    this world which otherwise deceives mankind with illusory
    pleasures. Material happiness is merely the gratification of
    some desire.</p>
    <p>All beings are subject to birth (jati), decay (jara),
    disease (byadhi), and finally to death (marana). No one is
    exempt from these four causes of suffering. In the discourse
    the Buddha said <em><strong>&quot;Birth is suffering, decay
    is suffering, disease is suffering, death is suffering&quot;</strong></em>.</p>
    <p>Unfulfilled wishes are also suffering. As a rule, every
    body wishes to be associated either with beloved persons or
    pleasant things. No body wishes to be associated with hated
    persons or unpleasant things. We always wish to be associated
    with persons or things we like. However, our cherished
    desires are not always gratified. At times what we least
    expect or least desire is thrust on us. Sometimes, such
    unexpected unpleasant circumstances become so intolerable and
    painful that weak ignorant people are compelled to commit
    suicide; as if such an act would solve the problems of life.</p>
    <p>Real happiness is found within and it is not defined in
    terms of wealth, power, honours, or conquests. If such
    worldly possessions are forcibly or unjustly obtained or are
    misdirected or even viewed with attachment, they become a
    source of misery and sorrow for the possessors.</p>
    <p>Normally the enjoyment of sensual pleasures is the highest
    and only happiness for average people. There is no doubt some
    momentary happiness in the anticipation, gratification, and
    retrospection of such fleeting material pleasure, but this is
    illusory and temporary. According to the Buddha, non -
    attachment (viraga) to material pleasure, or transcending
    material pleasure is a greater bliss. In brief, this
    composite body of clinging is itself a great heap of manifold
    suffering.</p>
    <h3 align="left"><font color="#800000">The Second Noble Truth</font></h3>
    <p>It is said in the text, <em><strong>&quot;It is this
    craving which produces rebirth, accompanied by passionate
    clinging, delight now here this life, then there that life.
    It is the craving for sensual pleasures, craving for
    existence , and craving for non-existence&quot;</strong></em>.</p>
    <p>There are three kinds of craving. The first is the
    grossest form of craving, which is simple attachment to all
    sensual pleasures (kamatanha). The second is attachment to
    existence (bhavatanha). The third is attachment to
    non-existence (vibhava tanha). Of the three, the second
    craving is attachment to sensual pleasures connected with the
    belief in eternalism (sassataditthi), and the third craving
    is attachment to sensual pleasures connected with the belief
    in nihilism. (ecchedaditthi).</p>
    <p><b>Bhavatanha</b> may also be interpreted as attachment to
    the realms of form and <b>vibhavatanha</b> as attachment to
    the formless realms. (rupatanha and arupatanha) </p>
    <p>Craving is a powerful mental force latent in all beings.
    It is the chief cause of most of the miseries of life. This
    craving, gross or subtle, leads to repeated births in cycle
    of continuity of suffering. This craving makes beings cling
    to all forms of life. Right Understanding of the First Noble
    Truth leads to the eradication of craving.</p>
    <h3 align="left"><font color="#800000">The Third Noble Truth</font></h3>
    <p>This is said in the discourse. &quot;<em><strong>Now,
    Bhikkhus, this is the Noble Truth of the cessation of
    suffering. It is the complete separation from, and
    destruction of, this very craving; its forsaking,
    renunciation, libration therefrom, and non-attachment
    thereto.&quot;</strong></em></p>
    <p>The Third Noble Truth states that there is a complete
    cessation of suffering which is Nibbana, the ultimate goal of
    Buddhists. Nibbana can be achieved in this very life by the
    total eradication of all forms of craving. This Nibbana is to
    be realized by the eye of enlightenment by renouncing all
    attachment to the internal body and external world.</p>
    <p>This First Truth of suffering which depends on this
    so-called being and various aspects of life, is to be
    carefully examined, analysed, and understood. This
    examination leads to a proper understanding of oneself as one
    really is. The cause of this suffering is craving or
    attachment. It is stated in the Dhammapada: <em><strong>&quot;From
    craving springs grief; from craving springs fear; for him who
    is wholly free from craving, there is no grief, much less
    fear.&quot;</strong></em> (v.216)</p>
    <p>Craving leads to repeated births. This Second Truth
    indirectly deals with past, present and future births. This
    Second Truth of craving which produces rebirth and which is
    original cause of suffering, is to be totally eradicated,
    uprooted and destroyed without exception.</p>
    <p>This Third Truth of the cessation of suffering is to be
    realized by developing the Noble Eight Fold Path.</p>
    <h3><font color="#800000">The Fourth Noble Truth</font></h3>
    <p>When a person develops properly the Noble Eight Fold Path,
    he can eradicate craving which is cause of suffering. When he
    eradicates craving, he can stop completely the continuous
    cycle of suffering. When this craving and this suffering are
    removed completely, one can realize Nibbana. This is the
    power of the Noble Eight Fold Path. This unique path is the
    only straight way to Nibbana. This<font size="5"><b> </b></font><strong>Fourth
    Noble Truth</strong> is to be developed.</p>
    <p>Expounding the four Noble Truths in various ways the
    Buddha concluded the discourse with the forcible words; <em><strong>&quot;Bhikkhus,
    as long as the absolute true intuitive knowledge regarding
    these four Noble Truths under their three aspects, and twelve
    modes, was not perfectly clear to me, so long did I not
    acknowledge that I had gained incomparable Supreme
    Enlightenment.''</strong></em></p>
    <p><em><strong>&quot;When the absolute true intuitive
    knowledge regarding these Four Noble Truths become perfectly
    clear to me, then only did I acknowledge that I had gained
    incomparable Supreme Enlightenment.&quot;</strong></em></p>
    <p><em><strong>&quot;There arose in me the knowledge and
    insight; 'Unshakable is the deliverance of my mind, this is
    my last birth, and now there is no existence again.&quot;</strong></em></p>
    <p>At the end of the discourse Kondanna, the senior of the
    five disciples, understood the Dhamma and attained the first
    stage of Sainthood whereby he realized that whatever is
    subject to origination all that is subject to cessation - <b>Yam
    kinci samudaya dhammam sabbarm tam nirodha dhammam.</b></p>
    <p>When the Buddha expounded the discourse of the
    Dhammacakka, the earth-bound deities exclaimed: <em><strong>&quot;This
    excellent Dhammacakka, which could not be expounded by any
    ascetic, priest, god, Mara or Brahma in this world, has been
    expounded by the Exalted One at the Deer Park, in Isipatana,
    near Baranasi.&quot;</strong></em></p>
    <p>Hearing this, Devas and Brahmas of all the other planes
    also shouted the same in joyous chorus. A radiant light,
    surpassing the light of gods, appeared in the world. The
    light of the Dhamma illumined the whole world, and brought
    peace and happiness to all beings.</p>
