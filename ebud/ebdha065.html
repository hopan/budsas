<blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Characteristics
    of the Buddha</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After a stupendous struggle of six
    strenuous years, in His 35th year the ascetic Gotama, unaided
    and unguided by any supernatural agency, and solely relying
    on His own efforts and wisdom, eradicated all defilements,
    ended the process of grasping, and, realizing things as they
    truly are by His own intuitive knowledge, became a <i>Buddha</i>
    -- an Enlightened or Awakened One. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thereafter he was known as Buddha
    Gotama, one of a long series of Buddhas that appeared in the
    past and will appear in the future. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He was not born a Buddha, but
    became a Buddha by His own efforts. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Pali term Buddha is derived
    from <i>&quot;</i><strong><i>budh</i></strong><i>&quot;</i>,
    to understand, or to be awakened. As He fully comprehended
    the four Noble Truths and as He arose from the slumbers of
    ignorance He is called a Buddha. Since He not only
    comprehends but also expounds the doctrine and enlightens
    others, He is called a Samma-Sambuddha --a Fully Enlightened
    One -- to distinguish Him from <i>Pacceka</i> (Individual)
    Buddhas who only comprehend the doctrine but are incapable of
    enlightening others. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Before His Enlightenment He was
    called <strong><i>Bodhisatta</i></strong> which means one who
    is aspiring to attain Buddhahood. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Every aspirant to Buddhahood passes
    through the Bodhisatta Period -- a period of intensive
    exercise and development of the qualities of generosity,
    discipline, renunciation, wisdom, energy, endurance,
    truthfulness, determination, benevolence and perfect
    equanimity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In a particular era there arises
    only one Samma-Sambuddha. Just as certain plants and trees
    can bear only one flower even so one world-system <i>(lokadhatu)</i>
    can bear only one Samma-Sambuddha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha was a unique being. Such
    a being arises but rarely in this world, and is born out of
    compassion for the world, for the good, benefit, and
    happiness of gods and men. The Buddha is called <i>&quot;acchariya
    manussa&quot;</i> as He was a wonderful man. He is called <i>&quot;amatassa
    data&quot;</i> as He is the giver of Deathlessness. He is
    called <i>&quot;varado&quot;</i> as He is the Giver of the
    purest love, the profoundest wisdom, and the Highest Truth.
    He is also called <i>Dhammassami</i> as He is the Lord of the
    Dhamma (Doctrine). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As the Buddha Himself says,
    &quot;He is the Accomplished One <i>(</i><strong><i>Tathagata</i></strong><i>)</i>,
    the Worthy One <i>(</i><strong><i>Araham</i></strong><i>)</i>,
    the Fully Enlightened One <i>(</i><strong><i>Samma-Sambuddha</i></strong><i>)</i>,
    the creator of the unarisen way, the producer of the
    unproduced way, the proclaimer of the unproclaimed way, the
    knower of the way, the beholder of the way, the cognizer of
    the way.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha had no teacher for His
    Enlightenment. <i>&quot;</i><strong><i>Na me acariyo atthi</i></strong><i>&quot;</i>
    -- A teacher have I not -- are His own words. He did receive
    His mundane knowledge from His lay teachers, but teachers He
    had none for His a supramundane knowledge which He himself
    realized by His own intuitive wisdom. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If He had received His knowledge
    from another teacher or from another religious system such as
    Hinduism in which He was nurtured, He could not have said of
    Himself as being the incomparable teacher <i>(</i><strong><i>aham
    sattha anuttaro</i></strong><i>)</i>. In His first discourse
    He declared that light arose in things not heard before. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">During the early period of His
    renunciation He sought the advice of the distinguished
    religious teachers of the day, but He could not find what He
    sought in their teachings. Circumstances compelled Him to
    think for Himself and seek the Truth. He sought the Truth
    within Himself. He plunged into the deepest profundities of
    thought, and He realized the ultimate Truth which He had not
    heard or known before. Illumination came from within and shed
    light on things which He had never seen before. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As He knew everything that ought to
    be known and as He obtained the key to all knowledge, He is
    called <strong><i>Sabbannu</i></strong> -- the Omniscient
    One. This supernormal knowledge He acquired by His own
    efforts continued through a countless series of births. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><strong></strong></font>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Who
    is the Buddha?</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once a certain Brahmin named Dona,
    noticing the characteristic marks of the footprint of the
    Buddha, approached Him and questioned Him. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Your Reverence will be a Deva
    ?&quot; <br>
    &quot;No, indeed, brahmin, a Deva am I not,&quot; replied the
    Buddha. <br>
    &quot;Then Your Reverence will be a Gandhabba?&quot; <br>
    &quot;No indeed, branmin, a Gandhabba am I not.&quot; <br>
    &quot;A Yakkha then?&quot; <br>
    &quot;No, indeed, brahmin, not a Yakkha.&quot; <br>
    &quot;Then Your Reverence will be a human being?&quot; <br>
    &quot;No indeed, brahmin, a human being am I not.&quot; <br>
    &quot;Who, then, pray, will Your Reverence be?&quot; <br>
    The Buddha replied that He had destroyed Defilements which
    condition rebirth as a Deva, Gandhabba, Yakkha, or a human
    being and added: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&quot;As a lotus, fair and
        lovely,</i> <br>
        <i>By the water is not soiled,</i> <br>
        <i>By the world am I not soiled;</i> <br>
        <i>Therefore, brahmin, am I Buddha.&quot;</i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha does not claim to be an
    incarnation <i>(Avatara)</i> of Hindu God Vishnu, who, as the
    Bhagavadgita charmingly sings, is born again and again in
    different periods to protect the righteous, to destroy the
    wicked, and to establish the Dharma (right). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the Buddha countless
    are the gods (Devas) who are also a class of beings subject
    to birth and death; but there is no one Supreme God, who
    controls the destinies of human beings and who possesses a
    divine power to appear on earth at different intervals,
    employing a human form as a vehicle. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nor does the Buddha call Himself a <i>&quot;Saviour&quot;</i>
    who freely saves others by his personal salvation. The Buddha
    exhorts His followers to depend on themselves for their
    deliverance, since both defilement and purity depend on
    oneself. One cannot directly purify or defile another.
    Clarifying His relationship with His followers and
    emphasizing the importance of self- reliance and individual
    striving, the Buddha plainly states: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;You yourselves should
        make an exertion. <strong><i>The Tathagatas are only
        teachers</i></strong><i>.</i>&quot;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha only indicates the path
    and method whereby He delivered Himself from suffering and
    death and achieved His ultimate goal. It is left for His
    faithful adherents who wish their release from the ills of
    life to follow the path. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;To depend on others for
    salvation is negative, but to depend on oneself is
    positive.&quot; Dependence on others means a surrender of
    one's effort.&quot; </font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Be an island unto
        yourselves; be a refuge unto yourselves; seek no refuge
        in others.&quot;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These significant words uttered by
    the Buddha in His last days are very striking and inspiring.
    They reveal how vital is self-exertion to accomplish one's
    ends, and how superficial and futile it is to seek redemption
    through benignant saviours, and crave for illusory happiness
    in an afterlife through the propitiation of imaginary gods by
    fruitless prayers and meaningless sacrifices. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha was a human being. As a
    man He was born, as a Buddha He lived, and as a Buddha His
    life came to an end. Though human, He became an extraordinary
    man owing to His unique characteristics. The Buddha laid
    stress on this important point, and left no room for any one
    to fall into the error of thinking that He was an immortal
    being. It has been said of Him that there was no religious
    teacher who was &quot;ever so godless as the Buddha, yet none
    was so god-like.&quot; In His own time the Buddha was no
    doubt highly venerated by His followers, but He never
    arrogated to Himself any divinity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"></font>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>The
    Buddha's Greatness</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Born a man, living as a mortal, by
    His own exertion He attained the supreme state of perfection
    called Buddhahood, and without keeping His Enlightenment to
    Himself, He proclaimed to the world the latent possibilities
    and the invincible power of the human mind. Instead of
    placing an unseen Almighty God over man, and giving man a
    subservient position in relation to such a conception of
    divine power, He demonstrated how man could attain the
    highest knowledge and Supreme Enlightenment by his own
    efforts. He thus raised the worth of man. He taught that man
    can gain his deliverance from the ills of life and realize
    the eternal bliss of Nibbana without depending on an external
    God or mediating priests. He taught the egocentric,
    powerseeking world the noble ideal of selfless service. He
    protested against the evils of caste-system that hampered the
    progress of mankind and advocated equal opportunities for
    all. He declared that the gates of deliverance were open to
    all, in every condition of life, high or low, saint or
    sinner, who would care to turn a new leaf and aspire to
    perfection. He raised the status of down-trodden women, and
    not only brought them to a realization of their importance to
    society but also founded the first religious order for women.
    For the first time in the history of the world He attempted
    to abolish slavery. He banned the sacrifice of unfortunate
    animals and brought them within His compass of loving
    kindness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He did not force His followers to
    be slaves either to His teachings or to Himself, but granted
    complete freedom of thought and admonished His followers to
    accept His words not merely out of regard for Him but after
    subjecting them to a thorough examination, </font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;... as the wise would
        test gold by burning, cutting, and rubbing it on a piece
        of touchstone.&quot;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He comforted the bereaved mothers
    like Patacara and Kisagotami by His consoling words. He
    ministered to the deserted sick like Putigatta Tissa Thera
    with His own hands. He helped the poor and the neglected like
    Rajjumala and Sopaka and saved them from an untimely and
    tragic death. He ennobled the lives of criminals like
    Angulimala and courtesans like Ambapali. He encouraged the
    feeble, united the divided, enlightened the ignorant,
    clarified the mystic, guided the deluded, elevated the base,
    and dignified the noble. The rich and the poor, the saint and
    the criminal, loved Him alike. His noble example was a source
    of inspiration to all. He was the most compassionate and
    tolerant of teachers. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">His will, wisdom, compassion,
    service, renunciation, perfect purity, exemplary personal
    life, the blameless methods that were employed to propagate
    the Dhamma and His final success -- all these factors have
    compelled about one fifth of the population of the world to
    hail the Buddha as the greatest religious teacher that ever
    lived on earth. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Paying a glowing tribute to the
    Buddha, Sri Radhakrishnan writes: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>&quot;In Gotama the Buddha
        we have a master mind from the East second to none so far
        as the influence on the thought and life of the human
        race is concerned, and sacred to all as the founder of a
        religious tradition whose hold is hardly less wide and
        deep than any other. He belongs to the history of the
        world's thought, to the general inheritance of all
        cultivated men, for, judged by intellectual integrity,
        moral earnestness, and spiritual insight, he is
        undoubtedly one of the greatest figures in history.&quot;</em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the <em>Three Greatest Men in
    History</em>, H.G. Wells states: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&quot;In the Buddha you see
        clearly a man, simple, devout, lonely, battling for
        light, a vivid human personality, not a myth. He too gave
        a message to mankind universal in character. Many of our
        best modern ideas are in closest harmony with it. All the
        miseries and discontents of life are due, he taught, to
        selfishness. Before a man can become serene he must cease
        to live for his senses or himself. Then he merges into a
        greater being. Buddhism in different language called men
        to self-forgetfulness 500 years before Christ. In some
        ways he was nearer to us and our needs. He was more lucid
        upon our individual importance in service than Christ and
        less ambiguous upon the question of personal
        immortality.&quot;</i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Poet Tagore calls Him &quot;the
    Greatest Man ever born&quot;. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In admiration of the Buddha,
    Fausboll, a Danish scholar says -- &quot;The more I know Him,
    the more I love Him.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A humble follower of the Buddha
    would modestly say: --&quot;The more I know Him, the more I
    love Him; the more I love Him, the more I know Him.&quot;</font></p>
