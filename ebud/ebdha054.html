In 1971 when I was preparing to set off on a pilgrimage to the Buddhist
holy places in India on my way to Thailand and ordination, Venerable
Ajahn Chah was not yet a well-known name. But a monk who was then
staying at the Thai temple in London knew him and suggested I go to
him. I had other ideas. However, months later, sitting in a big monastery
in Bangkok where I was just about to ordain as a samanera, that monk
I�d known in London suddenly arrived and having supervised my ordination
insisted on whisking me off to Ubon and a visit to Wat Nong Pah Pong,
the principal monastery of Ven. Ajahn Chah.  Just before we went I
stepped out into a busy Bangkok street and saw coming towards me in
the distance an old and close friend whose judgement I valued.  He�d
taken off a couple of years ahead of me and I hadn�t seen him since.
 By the time we met again in Bangkok he�d already been in robes some little while and having
visited many monasteries was able to confidently tell me that the very best
place to ordain and train as a bhikkhu was with Ven. Ajahn Chah. 
So, on New Year�s Day I and the Thai monk from London went to the
North-East, to Ubon, and a few days later I paid my first visit to
Wat Nong Pah Pong and Luangpor Chah.

<P>It was not the most encouraging of beginnings. When we arrived in
the middle of the morning the gates were firmly shut and locked, and
a big notice proclaimed that Luangpor Chah was ill and resting.  It
was the only time I ever saw visitors discouraged, although it seemed we were forever expecting his health to collapse.  But that very first morning outside Wat Pah Pong we weren�t turned
away.  A message was sent in to him, then the gates were opened and
we were led in and invited to sit in the expanded area under his simple
dwelling where he usually received his many visitors.  He came
down the stairs and sat with his legs tucked up on the raised hard
wooden bench in front of us and sipped glasses of tea while he talked.
 He seemed tired, but smiling and jolly and we did our best to communicate,
with the friendly Thai monk from London not the most fluent of interpreters. 

<P>There were one or two things for me to clear up before I could stay
with him permanently, but having been accepted I lost no time in fulfilling
those few obligations back in Bangkok and returning as soon as possible to
begin my life under the guidance of Luangpor Chah. This was to turn
out to be not entirely a bed of roses! 

<P>Of course the problems were all mine.  But that�s often not how one
sees them and I�m afraid I found things to criticise.  But I stayed.
 And of course there was much that I appreciated and as the years
have rolled on I�ve come to value him and what I learnt and absorbed
from him more and more.  My love for him was slow to take, but it�s
grown and is growing steadily.  But life with Luangpor
Chah was not always easy, in fact it was sometimes downright impossible
and I well remember the frustrations of having for the umpteenth time
got it wrong - and in public too!   

<P>There was a way of doing everything,
much of it established by the Buddha in the Vinaya, but some personal
to Luangpor and while he could always tell me what was wrong, he wouldn�t
always tell me what was right!  I soon caught on that there was something
in this, although that didn�t necessarily make it any easier. 

<P> He
had his idiosyncrasies, he had style and he was on occasions wonderfully
theatrical with a gift for superb entrances.  I�ve never forgotten
cowering in the shelter of a grass roofed sala after a long wet hike
along flooded and boggy paths through thick forest when he�d sent
us on ahead to beat the impending storm, and watching him make his entrance
into the surrounding clearing like some grand opera star, his umbrella
in one hand, staff in the other and his enormous tummy bearing all
before it. 

<P>The traditional meditations that he advocated didn�t usually
include metta or loving-kindness, but I�m not sure I�ve ever met such
a loving or compassionate person.  One of my earliest recollections
during the first few months with him was hearing someone call me and
turning into the glare of the sunlight to be embraced by a feeling of the nearest
thing to pure love I�ve ever experienced - it was him just standing there smiling at me.  He took
good care of us too and although he sometimes scolded or made fun or brought us down to earth in other ways, you never felt that
there was anything but a deep and genuine concern for your welfare
behind it all - at least once you�d recovered.   

<P>He loved strolling
around the edge of the monastery in the morning just after his almsround
and while other monks who�d gone farther afield returned and the meal
was prepared.  Occasionally he�d be alone, but more often than not
he�d beckon another to go with him.  If you were in trouble or wobbling,
you might be that favoured companion.  When I was having a hard time
- or harder time - he took me for a few days and while I had great
difficulty understanding him - the convention of walking to one side
and slightly behind didn�t help - it pleased me enormously to have
that personal contact with him.  On one of those days as we came near
the front gate, just the two of us, he started fussing about and tidying
things up.  I remember there was a long, lumpy and ungainly branch that had fallen on the ground and he wanted it out of the way.  He motioned me to get hold of one
end while he lifted the other and then, in the moment when we held
it ready to throw, he looked up and his presence glowing in the early
morning sun, he asked, "Is it heavy?", and then again as we chucked
it into the forest, "Now is it heavy?"!   

<P>Like that, he taught us to
see the Dhamma in everything, to practice "letting go", and to see
everything we said or did as included in our practice.  It wasn�t
just a method of sitting in meditation that interested him, but a
wider cultivation that reached into every part of one�s life, baring
the worst and drawing out and encouraging the best.  Training with
him the rules, etiquette and forms of monastic life were not the tired
empty traditions of so many other monasteries.  They all became a
"skilful means", a part of the tool-kit with which one might fashion
an enlightened inner attitude.  And the purpose of our life we were
never allowed to forget: we are bhikkhus not for gain and fame, not
for status and worldly advancement, but in order that we may have
the best possible chance of facing our kilesas, all those spoiling
influences of our hearts and minds, of seeing and understanding them,
of casting them out and achieving a secure and lasting peace, the real
happiness of Nibbana.  But while there was this serious, highly committed
and even fierce side to him, there was also a tremendous warmth and
happiness.  A friend of mine once commented that his first impression
of him was of a big, happy frog sitting on his lily-pad.  With all
that Buddhism has to say about suffering, negative mental traits,
the analysis of mind and matter, and its incomprehensible terminology,
it often feels as though its relationship to life and living and the
happiness factor have been ignored.  Not so with Luangpor Chah!  He
exuded happiness and people were drawn to him and loved to be with
him.  But he never missed a trick.  He never bored people with long
dry lectures full of lists and Pali terms, but sat and enjoyed their
company, laughing and joking with them and listening to all their
rubbish, until the moment there was an opening, then, like a master
swordsman, he�d be in and striking right to the heart would deal them
some real, living Dhamma.  And he�d sit there doing this all day from
soon after the meal till late at night, while an almost continual,
ragged procession of visitors came and went.   

<P>There were always a
few of us waiting on him, but not many of us could stand it for long.
 I remember one day when I tried to do my bit in the heat of the day
and an old, deaf man with an extremely primitive hearing aid, a prototype
of one of the first ever built by the look of it, came to discuss
some benches he was to make for outside the dining-hall.  There was
Ajahn Chah yelling at him for all he was worth and even getting down
off his seat to squat in front of him and get a bit closer, and the
old boy frantically rattling and banging the ancient box of tricks
on his chest and - well, after a couple of hours of this I�m afraid
my endurance petered out and I trailed off into the forest to find
my kuti and some relief for my pounding head.  But patient endurance
was something that Luangpor valued highly and frequently drummed into
us.  "There�s nothing to it, just endure", he�d say and I know I was
one of those who�d groan and not feel very certain of all this.  But
I stuck it and I know now there�s a lot to be said for just waiting
and watching.   

<P>Life with him was never dull, but you had to be on
the ball, "like a good soldier, always ready". And of course his unpredictability
was made even worse when you weren�t very certain of what you thought
you might have understood.  Out with him on a tour of some of the
branch monasteries I was nearly frantic to get my stinking robes washed.
 Oh the joy when at one stop I saw the novices hurrying across to
the washing sheds with Luangpor�s robes to wash.  I grabbed mine and
dashed after them, with the other attendant monk who was in a similar
predicament hard on my heels.  Unfortunately, what we didn�t take
into account was that as his were first in the wash, they would also
be the first out, the first on the line and the first to be dry. 
Mine were just looking all right when I heard a shout and glancing
across the compound I saw the car ready to leave with Luangpor already
robed.  There was nothing else for it but to grab everything and get
moving.  My friend was not as fortunate as I - his robes had been
done after mine - and so, a very damp monk, he rode in the back of
the pick-up spreading what bits of his robe he could to dry in the
sun.   

<P>Luangpor looked after us but he didn�t coddle us, and as much
as possible left us to find out for ourselves.  I remember him listening
attentively as I laboured to explain some of the difficulties I�d
been having and then grinning and pointing to himself and saying,
"Me too!" - and that was it.  

<P> And he was amazingly tolerant.  Really,
with so many monks and a few really awkward ones, like me whose language
he couldn�t speak, it must have been an awful lot to put up with.
 But he never seemed to mind, except on one occasion when something
went badly wrong and then that jolly, happy old frog suddenly metamorphosed
into the most terrifying species of monk-eating tiger you can imagine. 
 
<P>He didn�t mess about.  I liked that. When something had to be done,
it had to be done and someone had to get on and do it.  When we were
preparing to come to England I had to go across to see him early one
morning and explain that through a telegram and telephone call we�d
discovered that the preparations for our visit were being delayed.
 He took me for a stroll across the monastery, then turned to me and
announced that there was nothing else for it, we would have to go
to Bangkok and get it sorted out.  

<P>That trip to England in 1977, his
first outside South-East Asia, was a great success.  While Wat Pah
Pong practically starved without him - not many came with food if
he wasn't there - he enjoyed a relatively relaxing time in Hampstead
and I felt so pleased to have him there in an area that I knew and
loved and where I had lived through some of my more formative and
important years.  The old Hampstead Vihara was also where I�d first
encountered Buddhism.  It was the closest time I had to him, but eventually
he went back and I had to stay.  

<P>During his months there, the dizziness
that was eventually to lead to his almost complete disability became
worryingly apparent.  I remember taking him on a train down South
to visit my parents for the Queen's Jubilee Weekend and wondering
whether I�d ever get him back to London, he was so bad.  

<P>After his
return to Thailand I didn�t see him again for nine and a half years
and then hearing he was dying I rushed to see him.  He didn�t die
that year, but he was dreadfully ill and practically helpless. I went
to see him every year after that.  Apparently, as he was declining
he�d said that this was his karma and there was no need for anyone
to do anything about it.  He was bed and chair bound, physically dependant
on others for everything for nearly ten years before his death in
January 1992.  We can�t know what he was doing in that time or why
it had to be that way, but after so many years so selflessly giving
himself to others, I like to think and hope that he had some time
to himself and that perhaps he may have finished his own task.  We
may never know, but I hope he ended his life an Enlightened Being
and that if he hadn�t quite made it he soon will. 

<P>I�ve been fortunate in my life to have known several remarkable people
and the best of them all has been Luangpor Chah.  He�s grown on me.
 And I respect and love him and am ever so grateful that I�ve had
the good fortune to be his disciple.  When the news came through that
he�d died, amongst my first thoughts was the determination to try
harder to be worthy of him and I really do hope that I can carry on
and keep alive in some small way something of what he has offered to
so many like me. 

<P>A week after he died I arrived in Thailand and went straight to Wat
Nong Pah Pong to pay my respects.  The huge ornate coffin was set
up in the new and hardly completed sala, flanked by wreaths from the
Royal Family and with his portrait and robes and bowl displayed by
the side.  A fifteen day period of practice had begun immediately
after his death and thousands were flocking from all over Thailand,
coming and going all the time, to pay their respects. Every day, out
under the trees and delivered from the place in the forest where he�d
first camped many years ago, there was a sermon.  Then in the evening
from soon after seven until midnight there was chanting and meditation
and another sermon. The atmosphere was electric.  A sense of loss
there was, but it was charged with love and the joy of being part
of what this very great man had created.  It was wonderful. He always
emphasised the Sangha and I am so happy to belong.  Thank you, Luangpor
Chah Subhatto.
