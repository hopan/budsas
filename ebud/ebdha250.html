        <SPAN LANG="EN-US">In Therav&#257;din and Mah&#257;yanic Buddhism there are 
        P&#257;ram&#299;s and it is very important not only for Two Buddhist schools but 
        also other religions if they want to practice them. P&#257;ram&#299;s lead one 
        nearer and nearer to Nibb&#257;na. As we know from all the past Bodhisattas, 
        everyone wanting to become a Fully-Enlightened One must follow the Ten 
        P&#257;ramis according to their temperaments-Paññ&#257;p&#257;r&#257;m&#299;, Sadd&#257;param&#299;, and 
        Viriy&#257;p&#257;ram&#299;. A real Bodhisatta who follows Paññ&#257;p&#257;ram&#299; must practice 
        throughout four asa&#7749;kkheyyas and one hundred thousand world cycles. A 
        real Bodhisatta who follows Sadd&#257;p&#257;ram&#299; must spend eight asa&#7749;kkheyyas 
        and one hundred thousand world cycles. And a real Bodhisatta who follows 
        Viriy&#257;param&#299; must be practiced sixteen asa&#7749;kkheyyas and one hundred 
        thousand world cycles. In the present time our Gotama Buddha also had 
        performed these Ten P&#257;ram&#299;s through four asa&#7749;kkheyyas and one hundred 
        thousand world cycles until he became the Fully-Enlightened One.</SPAN></FONT></P>

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 6.0pt"><FONT FACE="VU Times">
        <SPAN LANG="EN-US">Sumadh&#257; was a son of rich man at Aramavat&#299;, the royal 
        city. He was born in a rich family. His parents were of pure morality 
        and a high race at that time.</SPAN></FONT></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 6.0pt"><FONT FACE="VU Times">
        <SPAN LANG="EN-US">At the age of sixteen Sumedh&#257; had acquired enough 
        education. Unfortunately, his parents passed away when he was very 
        young. All of his parent's wealth was guarded by his parents' personal 
        treasurer (financier). When he had come of age, the financier handed 
        over all wealth of his parents to him together with the lists of various 
        things. When he saw his properties, he had a great thought to himself: 
        &quot;My great grandparents, grandparents and parents were only able to make 
        great collecting and save properties, but they did have not the ability 
        to take them along with them. As for me, I will carry all the wealth 
        along with me after my death.&quot; So at that moment a deep understanding of 
        life arose in him: &quot;If there is heat, there must be cold; in the same 
        way, if there is death, there must be deathlessness.&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 6.0pt"><FONT FACE="VU Times">
        <SPAN LANG="EN-US">After this deep thought about his future life, he 
        opened his treasure houses and gave all his possessions away such as 
        money-houses, silver-houses, golden-houses and so on. Afterwards he went 
        to Himavant&#257; and made himself an ascetic. Only within seven days, he 
        obtained supernormal-power. He could travel in the air.</SPAN></FONT></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 6.0pt"><FONT FACE="VU Times">
        <SPAN LANG="EN-US">Some time after, there was a golden occasion to 
        welcome the Buddha D&#299;pa&#7749;kar&#257; to Rammavat&#299; city. The people of Rammavat&#299; 
        city were repairing the road, and were very happy to wait for the coming 
        of Buddha Dipankara. While traveling through the sky, suddenly the 
        ascetic &#257; saw the people very cheerful in the road-reconstruction and 
        city-decoration. He came down and questioned them. They answered that 
        they were repairing the road in order to welcome Buddha D&#299;pa&#7749;kar&#257; and 
        his followers so they could tread on the road comfortably. The ascetic &#257; 
        felt very delighted and has a deep thought: &quot;Oh! It is very difficult to 
        hear the word 'Buddha' and it is indeed, harder to become a Buddha.&quot; So 
        he asked permission from them to give him a room to repair a part of the 
        path. </SPAN></FONT></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 6.0pt"><FONT FACE="VU Times">
        <SPAN LANG="EN-US">With his supernormal-power he could have finished the 
        path repairing quickly but he did not like to do so. So he used his own 
        labor with the purpose that he would gain more merit by using his labor 
        rather than by using his supernormal-power. Before he finished repairing 
        his portion, the Buddha and his disciples came. To protect the feet of 
        the Buddha and his disciples from getting soiled, he laid down on the 
        mud as a human-bridge. Among the welcoming people, there was a young 
        woman, named Sumitt&#257;. As soon as the young woman saw the ascetic, she 
        was very very happy and delighted. She therefore gave five lotus-flowers 
        to him and left three lotus-flowers in her hands. The ascetic a offered 
        the five lotus-flowers to the Buddha while lying on the muddy road.</SPAN></FONT></P>

        others wandering in Sams&#257;ra although I have enough energy to save all 
        beings. I will try to become a Buddha like Buddha Dipankara.&quot; So he 
        immediately decided with firm resolution to become a Buddha. Afterwards,

        down as a human-bridge, but the Buddha and his disciples did not tread 
        on him, only passed by him. The future Buddha, ascetic a, having 
        obtained the prophecy made by Buddha D&#299;pa&#7749;kar&#257;, got up and sat cross 
        legged with great joy. When he reviewed ways and means to be a Buddha, 
        he found the Ten Noble Perfections such as Charity, Morality and so on. 
        While he reflected on the Ten Perfections repeatedly, the earth shook 
        violently as if cheering the Bodhisattva.</SPAN></FONT></P>

        to banyan tree that was occupied by an ogre who had the power to catch 
        and eat everybody who passed nearby his area. His father returned home 
        after giving a promise to the ogre that he would come back on the next 
        day to be eaten by the ogre. When his son who named Al&#299;nasattu knew 
        about this situation, on behalf of his father, he himself went to the 
        place occupied by the ogre. When the ogre saw prince Al&#299;nasattu coming

        Ayoghara, he always lived in an iron cage because he wanted to escape 
        from the danger of ogres. He had to learn lessons there up to the age of 
        sixteen. When he reached sixteen, his father had an intention to give 
        him the throne and he was taken out of the cage. At that time, the

        effort in to studying we can not gain what we want to obtain. Therefore, 
        effort is very important in fulfilling the task. Looking at the many 
        past existences of our Lord Buddha. So we can see clearly whatever the 
        Bodhisatta had done in the past while fulfilling the perfection of 
        effort, he did not make less effort for ordinary tasks nor put forth 
        more energy for more arduous ones. He always made the same maximum 
        exertion whether for a small task or a great task. So his exertion was 
        constantly going on and on while he was fulfilling any wish of his life. 
        Therefore, in the Cp A 274 it is said that energy (v&#299;riya) is the 
        highest effort (uttama&#7747; padh&#257;na&#7747;), because it is able to bring one to

        strength and swam in the wide ocean for the seven days without taking a

        only escaped from the disaster with the help of the Goddess Manimekhal&#257;

        situation. Without effort our Lord Buddha could not be a Buddha at the

        having the desire to bring about the welfare of others. It is different 
        from the love with attachment such as the love between men and women 
        (Tanh&#257;-pema), a husband and wife, parents and children, and so on. 
        Loving-kindness has the nature of pure and noble will (adosa), and it is 
        also called the sublime state of mind (Brahmavih&#257;ra). One who can 
        cultivate loving - kindness is said to be living in the sublime abode.</SPAN></FONT></P>

        ascetic Suvannas&#257;ma was very remarkable. He lived in the forest and 
        looked after his parents who were blinded by a venomous snake. He took 
        care of his parents and whatever his parents commanded he fulfilled 
        willingly. He also loved with true loving-kindness, harmless to all 
        animals, as well as wild beasts such as tigers, lions, leopards, etc., 
        He cultivated loving- kindness firmly, and never felt angry even towards 
        the king, P&#299;liyakkha, who shot him with a poisoned arrow, thinking him 
        to be a beast. Later, by the power of loving-kindness and truthfulness, 
        the poison became ineffective and disappeared. Thus not only his life

        is a p&#257;li word meaning &quot;equanimity&quot; or &quot;equilibrium&quot; of the mind. It 
        means maintaining a neutral attitude towards pleasant and unpleasant 
        things without bias towards either of them, and not having a bias on 
        account of hatred or love. So, upekkh&#257;-p&#257;ram&#299; is the perfection to be 
        fulfilled with a balanced attitude without leaning towards the extremes 
        of love and hatred. The Bodhisatta fulfilled the perfection of 
        equanimity or equilibrium by maintaining a neutral attitude towards such 
        feelings as love, hatred, happiness or unhappiness, which arise in the 
        mind. Especially, Bodhisatta Lomahamsa was very famous in his 
        fulfillment of the perfection of equanimity or equilibrium (Lomaha&#7747;sa 
        J&#257;taka No. 94.Vol. 1). When his parents died, they left him much 
        propertiy such as gold, silver, money and so on. Then one day, he had a 
        deep thought of charity (d&#257;na). He gave all his property in donation and 
        went into a forest. Although he wished to become an ascetic, he did not 
        have a desire to be praised by people. So he wandered around with a 
        single set of clothing. He did not stay for a long time in a place where 
        he was well treated and revered. When he reached a village, though he 
        was jeered and mocked insolently by wicked children and drunkards, he 
        was not angry with them. In the cemetery, he slept with his head on a 
        skull. The wicked kids gathered, and insulted him by spitting and 
        discharging excrement and urine on him. He neither got angry with the 
        children nor blamed them, nor felt depressed. Some people offered him 
        flowers, good food and drinks. But he did not feel affectionate towards 
        them either. His attitude towards good and bad was indifferent. He 
        steadfastly maintained and equanimity of mind (upekkh&#257;) under any 
        situation.</SPAN></FONT></P>
