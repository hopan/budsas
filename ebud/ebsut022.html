<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
  By Canon it is meant the Tripitaka [Pali Tipitaka] of the Buddhists, both Theravada and
  Mahayana. Thus it is possible to speak of several Canons such as the Sthaviravada,
  Sarvastivada and Mahayana as well as in term of languages like Pali, Chinese and Tibetan.
  The word is used basically to refer to the literature, the authorship of which is directly
  or indirectly ascribed to the Buddha himself. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is generally believed that whatever was the teaching of
  the Buddha, conceived under Dhamma and Vinaya, it was rehearsed soon after his death by a
  fairly representative body of disciples. The later systematised threefold division, into <strong>Sutta,
  Vinaya and Abhidhamma</strong> is based on this collection. Sharing a common body of
  Dhamma and Vinaya, the early Buddhist disciples appear to have remained united for about a
  century. The Council of Vesali or the second Buddhist Council saw the break up of this
  original body and as many as eighteen separate schools were known to exist by about the
  first century B.C. It is reasonable to assume that each of these schools would have opted
  to possess a Tripitaka of their own or rather their own recension of the Tripitaka,
  perhaps with a considerably large common core. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It has long been claimed that the Buddha, as he went about
  preaching in the Gangetic valley in India during the 6<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup>
  centuries B.C., used Magadhi or the language of Magadha as his medium of communication.
  Attempts have been made to identify this Magadhan dialect with Pali, the language in which
  the texts of the Sthaviravada school are recorded. Hence we speak of a Pali Canon, i.e.,
  the literature of the Sthaviravadins which is believed to be the original word of the
  Buddha. At any rate, this is the only complete recension we possess and the Pali texts
  seem to preserve an older tradition much more than most of the extant Buddhist works in
  other languages. Further, the Sthaviravadins admit of two other major divisions of Pali
  Buddhist literature which are non-Canonical. They are: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Post-Canonical Pali literature including works like
    Petakopadesa and Milindapanha, the authorship of which is ascribed to one or more
    disciples. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. Pali Commentarial literature which includes: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(a) Atthakatha or Commentaries, the original version of
      which is believed to have been taken over to Sri Lanka by Thera Mahinda, the missionary
      sent by Asoka and<br>
      (b) the different strata of Tika or Sub-Commentaries contributions to which were made by
      Buddhist monks of Sri Lanka, India and Burma. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Besides this Pali recension of the Sthaviravada school
  there are fragmentary texts of the Sarvastivada or of the Mulasarvastivada which are
  preserved in Sanskrit. A large portion of their Vinaya texts in Sanskrit is preserved in
  the Gilgit manuscripts. But a more complete collection of the Sarvastivada recension
  (perhaps also of the Dharmapuptaka and Kasyapiya), i.e., a Sanskrit Canon, must have
  possibly existed as is evident from the Chinese translations preserved to us. These
  include complete translations of the four agamas (the equivalent of the Pali nikayas). Of
  the Ksudraka, (Pali: Khuddaka) only some texts are preserved in Chinese. In addition to
  these, the Chinese translations seem to preserve, to the credit of the Sarvastivadins, a
  vast Vinaya literature and an independent collection of seven Abhidhamma treatises. Thus
  what could be referred to as a Sarvastivada Canon ranges between fragments of texts
  preserved in Sanskrit and the more representative collection of the Tripitaka preserved in
  Chinese. It may be mentioned here that a version of the Mulasarvastivada Vinaya consisting
  of seven parts, even more faithful than the Chinese version, is preserved in Tibetan. Of
  the Abhidharma collection only the Prajnaptisastra appears to have been translated into
  Tibetan. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Speaking further of the Tripitaka in terms of language we
  have in Chinese different recensions of the Canon (preserved in part) belonging to
  different schools. These recensions are primarily based on the Tripitaka of Indian origin.
  In addition to the ancient texts which these recensions preserve they also contain
  independent expositions of the early doctrines or commentarial literature on them. The
  Chinese Canon preserves the Vinaya texts of as many as seven different schools. In place
  of the division into &#145;canonical groups&#146; of Sutra, Abhidharma and Vinaya, this
  new arrangement seems to reckon with a live and continuous tradition in accepting as
  authoritative both the Sutra or words of Buddha and Sastra or commentaries, treatises,
  etc. of disciples of a later date. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><font COLOR="#871F78">The Tibetan Canon</font></strong>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This tendency is best reflected in the stratification of
  the Tibetan Canon which consists of two major divisions. The first of these, the Kanjur
  (Bkahgyur) which is said to consist of the words or the sayings of the Buddha has the
  following subdivisions.. </font><ol>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Dulva or Vinaya (Mulasarvastivida version),</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Prajnaparamita,</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Avatamsaka,</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Ratnakuta,</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Sutra (prominence and precedence being invariably given to
      Mahayana sutras),</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Tantra.</font></li>
  </ol>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second, the Tanjur (Bstan-gyur) is a supplement to the
  former, or in other words, continuation of the tradition of the Kanjur. Among its contents
  are a collection of stories, the commentaries on the tantra section of the Kanjur and the
  commentaries on the sutra section. There are also works relating to Abhidharma and Vinaya
  as well as Madhyamika and Vijnanavada. Works coming under the sutra section of the Tanjur
  are not necessarily commentaries on the texts contained in the Mdo-section of the Kanjur.
  They are believed to be authoritative works some of which, however, are not even Buddhist
  in character. They deal with logic, grammar, lexicography, poetry and drama, medicine and
  chemistry, astrology and divination, painting and biographies of saints. Their inclusion
  in this part of the Tibetan Canon is perhaps justified on the acceptance of the position
  that they are necessary aids and accompaniments in the practice of the religion. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It becomes clear from the foregoing analysis that speaking
  of a Buddhist Canon one has to admit that it is both vast in extent and complex in
  character. While the earlier and more orthodox schools of Buddhism reserved the term
  Canonical to refer to the Body of literature the greater part of which could be reasonably
  ascribed to the Buddha himself, other traditions which developed further away from the
  centre of activity of the Buddha and at a relatively later date choose to lay under the
  term Canon the entire mosaic of Buddhist literature in their possession, which is of
  varied authorship and is at times extremely heterogeneous in character.</font></p>
