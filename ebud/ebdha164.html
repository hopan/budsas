        <p><em>The word religion comes from the Latin word religio, which means a bond. It
        suggests a binding to the divine, which engulfs one's whole being</em></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <b><p></b><font size="6">I</font>t is tempting to think that we understand religion
    because it is so ingrained in our cultural outlook. However, it's useful to contemplate
    and reflect on the true aim, goal or purpose of religion. </p>
    <p><b>S</b>ometimes people regard religion as belief in God or gods, so religion becomes
    identified with the theistic attitude of a particular religious form or convention. Often
    Buddhism is regarded by theistic religions as an atheistic form, or not even a religi on
    at all. It's seen as a philosophy or psychology, because Buddhism doesn't come from a
    theistic position. It's not based on a metaphysical or doctrinal position, but on an
    existential experience common to all humanity - the experience of suffering. The Buddhist
    premise is that by reflecting, by contemplating, and by understanding that common human
    experience, we can transcend all mental delusions that create human suffering. </p>
    <p><b>T</b>he word <i>religion</i> comes from the Latin word <i>religio</i>, which means a
    bond. It suggests a binding to the divine, which engulfs one's whole being. To be truly
    religious means you must bind yourself to the divine, or to the ultimate reality, and
    engage yo ur whole being in that bond, to the point where an ultimate realisation is
    possible. All religions have words like &quot;liberation&quot; and &quot;salvation.&quot;
    Words of this nature convey freedom from delusion, complete and utter freedom, and total
    understanding of ulti mate reality. In Buddhism we call this enlightenment. </p>
    <h4>Understanding the Nature of Suffering</h4>
    <b><p>T</b>he Buddhist approach is to reflect on the experience of suffering, because this
    is what all human beings share in common. Suffering doesn't necessarily mean a great
    tragedy or a terrible misfortune. It just means the type of discontentment, unhappiness ,
    and disappointment that all human beings experience at various times in their lives.
    Suffering is common to men and women, common to rich and poor. Whatever our race or
    nationality, it is the common bond. </p>
    <p><b>S</b>o in Buddhism, suffering is called a noble truth. It is not an ultimate truth.
    When the Buddha taught suffering as a noble truth, it was not his intention for us to bind
    ourselves to suffering and believe in it blindly, as an ultimate truth. Instead, h e
    taught us to use suffering as a noble truth for reflection. We contemplate: what is
    suffering, what is its nature, why do I suffer, what is suffering about? <b>A</b>n
    understanding of the nature of suffering is an important insight. Now contemplate this in
    your experience of life. How much of your life is spent trying to avoid or get away from
    anything that is unpleasant, unwanted? How much of our society is dedica ted to happiness
    and pleasure, trying to get away from anything unpleasant and unwanted? We can have
    instant happiness, instant absorption, something that we call &quot;non-suffering&quot;;
    excitement, romance, adventure, sensual pleasures, eating, listening to mus ic, or
    whatever. But all this is an attempt to get away from our own fears, discontentments,
    anxiety, and worry, things that haunt the human mind until it is enlightened. Humanity
    will always be haunted and frightened by life as long as human beings remai n ignorant and
    don't put forth effort to look at and understand the nature of suffering. </p>
    <p><b>T</b>o understand suffering means that we must accept suffering rather than just try
    to get rid of it and deny it, or blame somebody else for it. We can notice that suffering
    is caused, that it is dependent upon certain conditions: the conditions of the mind that
    we've created or that have been instilled into us through our culture and family. Our
    experience of life, and that conditioning process, start from the day we are born. The
    family, the group that we live with, our education, all instill into our min d various
    prejudices, biases and opinions, some good, some not so good. </p>
    <p><b>N</b>ow, if we don't really look at these conditions of the mind and examine them
    for what they truly are, then of course they cause us to interpret our life's experience
    from certain biases. But if we look into the very nature of suffering, then we begin to
    examine things like fear and desire, and then we discover that our true nature is not
    desire, is not fear. Our true nature is not conditioned by anything at all. </p>
    <h4>The Conditioned, The Unconditioned, and Consciousness</h4>
    <b><p>R</b>eligions always point to the relationship of the mortal, or the conditioned,
    with the Unconditioned. That is, if you strip any religion down to its very basic essence,
    you will find that it is pointing to where the mortal, the conditioned and time-bound ,
    ceases. In that cessation is the realisation and the understanding of the Unconditioned.
    In Buddhist terminology, it is said that &quot;there is the Unconditioned; and if there
    were not the Unconditioned, there could not be the conditioned.&quot; The conditioned
    arises and ceases in the Unconditioned, and therefore we can point to the relationship
    between the conditioned and the Unconditioned. Having been born into a human body we have
    to live a lifetime under the limitations and conditions of the sensory world. Birth
    implies that we come forth out of the Unconditioned and manifest in a separate,
    conditioned form. And this human from implies consciousness. Consciousness always defines
    a relationship between subject and object, and in Buddhism consciousness is regarded as a
    discriminative function of the mind. So contemplate this right now. You are sitting there
    paying attention to these words. This is the experience of consciousness. You can feel the
    heat in the room, you can see your surroundings, you can hea r the sounds. All this
    implies that you have been born in a human body and for the rest of your life, as long as
    this body lives, it will have feelings, and consciousness will be arising. This
    consciousness always creates the impression of a subject and an object, so that when we do
    not investigate, do not look into the true nature of things, then we become bound to the
    dualistic view of &quot;I am my body, I am my feelings, I am my consciousness.&quot; </p>
    <p><b>T</b>hus, a dualistic attitude arises from consciousness. And then, from our ability
    to conceive and remember and perceive with our minds, we create a personality. Sometimes
    we enjoy this personality. Other times we have irrational fears, wrong views, and an
    xieties about it. </p>
    <h4>Aspiration of the Human Mind</h4>
    <b><p>A</b>t the present time, for any society in the materialistic world, much of the
    human anguish and despair arises from the fact that we don't usually relate ourselves to
    anything higher than the planet we live on and to our human body. So the aspiration of t
    he human mind towards an ultimate realisation, towards enlightenment, is not really
    promoted or encouraged in modern society. In fact it often seems to be discouraged. </p>
    <p><b>W</b>ithout this relationship with the higher Truth, our lives become meaningless.
    We cannot relate to anything beyond the experiences of a human body on a planet, in a
    mysterious universe, all our life really amounts to is putting in time from birth to deat
    h. Then, of course, what is the purpose, what is the meaning of it? And why do we care?
    Why do we need a purpose? Why must there be a meaning to life? Why do we want life to be
    meaningful? Why do we have words, concepts, and religions? Why do we have that longing or
    that aspiration in our minds if all there ever is, or all there ever can be, is this
    experience based on the view of self? Can it be that this human body, with its
    conditioning process, simply lands on us fortuitously in a universal system tha t is
    beyond our control? </p>
    <p><b>W</b>e live in a universe that is a mystery to us. We can only wonder about it. We
    can intuit and gaze at the universe, but we cannot put it into a little capsule. We cannot
    make it into something in our mind. Therefore, materialistic tendencies in our minds
    encourage us not to even ask those questions. Or else these tendencies make us interpret
    all life's experience in the realm of logic or reason, based on the values of materialism
    and empirical science. </p>
    <h4>The Awakening Experience</h4>
    <p>Buddhism points to the universal or common experience of all sentient beings, that of
    suffering. It also makes a statement about the way out of suffering. Suffering is the
    awakening experience. When we suffer we begin to ask the questions. We tend to look,
    investigate, wonder, try to find out. </p>
    <p><b>I</b>n the story of Prince Siddhattha (the name of the Buddha before he was
    enlightened) we hear of his life as a prince in an environment where there was only
    pleasure, beauty, comfort, social advantages - all the best life could offer. Then, as the
    legend goes, at the age of 29, Siddhattha left the palace to look outside, and he became
    aware of the messengers of old age, sickness and death. </p>
    <p><b>N</b>ow one might say that he must have known about old age, sickness and death
    before the age of 29. In our way of thinking, it is quite obvious to us from an early age
    that everyone gets old, gets sick, and dies. However, this was something that the prince
    was merely aware of as a fact. It was something that did not awaken his mind until he
    reached the age of 29. </p>
    <p><b>S</b>imilarly, we can live our lives, here in England, and we can assume that
    everything is all right, and even the unhappiness or the disappointments that we might
    normally experience may not necessarily awaken us. We may wonder about them a bit, but
    there are so many opportunities to not look at it, to not notice. It's easy to blame our
    unhappiness on others, isn't it? We can blame it on the government, on our mother and
    father, on friends or enemies, on external forces. But the awakening of the mind to ol d
    age, sickness and death happens when we realise that it is going to happen to us. And that
    realisation comes not just as an abstract idea but as a real gut feeling, a real insight
    that this is what happens to all human beings. What is born gets old, deg enerates, and
    dies. </p>
    <p><b>T</b>he fourth messenger that the Buddha saw was a samana. A samana is a monk, or a
    religious seeker, someone who is devoted solely to the pursuit of the ultimate reality,
    the truth. The samana, as portrayed in the legend, was a shaven-headed monk wearing a
    robe. </p>
    <p><b>T</b>hese are the four messengers in Buddhist symbolism: old age, sickness, death,
    and the samana. They signify the awakening of the human mind to a religious goal, to that
    aspiration of the human heart towards realising the ultimate reality, which is freedo m
    from all delusion and suffering. </p>
    <h4>Buddhist Practice</h4>
    <b><p>S</b>ometimes modern attitudes towards Buddhist meditation tend to portray it as
    leaving the world and developing a very concentrated state of mind dependent upon
    carefully controlled conditions. So in the United States and in other countries where
    Buddhist meditation is becoming increasingly popular, people tend to develop strong views
    about it being a concentrated state of mind in which technique and control are very
    important. </p>
    <p><b>T</b>his type of technique is all well and good, but if you begin to develop the
    reflective capacities of your mind then it is not always necessary, not even advisable to
    spend your time trying to refine your mind to where anything coarse or unpleasant is su
    ppressed. It's better to open the mind to its full capacity, to full sensitivity, in order
    to know that in this present moment the conditions that you are aware of, what you are
    feeling, seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, thinking, are impermanent. </p>
    <p><b>I</b>mpermanence is a characteristic common to all phenomena, whether it is a belief
    in God or a memory of the past; whether it's an angry thought, or a loving thought;
    whether it's high, low, coarse, refined, good, bad, pleasurable or painful. Whatever its
    quality might be, you are looking at it as an object. All that arises, ceases. It is
    impermanent. </p>
    <p><b>N</b>ow what this opening of the mind does, as a way of practice and reflection on
    life, is allow you to have some perspective on your emotions and ideas, on the nature of
    your own body, as well as the objects of the senses. </p>
    <p><b>G</b>etting back to consciousness itself: modern science, empirical science,
    considers the real world to be the material world that we see and hear and feel, as an
    object to our senses. So the objective world is called reality. We can see the material
    world, agree to what it is, hear it, smell it, taste it, touch it or even agree on a
    perception or a name for it. But that perception is still an object, isn't it? Because
    consciousness creates the impression of a subject and an object, we believe that we are o
    bserving something that is separate from us. </p>
    <p><b>T</b>he Buddha, by his teaching, took the subject-object relationship to the
    ultimate point. He taught that all perceptions, all conditions that go through our minds,
    all emotions, all feelings, all material-world objects that we see and hear, are
    impermanen t. About all of it, he said, &quot;What arises, ceases.&quot; And this the
    Buddha kept pointing out over and over again in his teachings: this is a very important
    insight that frees us from all kinds of delusions. What arises, ceases. </p>
    <p><b>C</b>onsciousness can also be defined as our ability to know, the experience of
    knowing. The subject knowing the object. When we look at objects and name them, we think
    we know them. We think we know this person or that person because we have a name or a mem
    ory of them. We think we know all kinds of things because we remember them. Our ability to
    know, sometimes, is of the conditioned sort, knowing about, rather than knowing directly. </p>
    <p><b>T</b>he Buddhist practice is to abide in a pure mindfulness in which there is what
    we call <i>insight knowing</i>, or direct knowledge. It is a knowledge that isn't based on
    perception, an idea, a position, or a doctrine: and this knowledge can only be possible
    through mindfulness. What we mean by mindfulness is the ability to not attach to any
    object, either in the material realm or mental realm. When there is no attachment, then
    the mind is in its pure state of awareness, intelligence, and clarity. That is min
    dfulness. The mind is pure and receptive, sensitive to the existing conditions. It is no
    longer a conditioned mind that just reacts to pleasure and pain, praise and blame,
    happiness and suffering. </p>
    <p><b>F</b>or example, if you get angry, right now, you can follow the anger. You can
    believe it, and go on and on creating that particular emotion, or you can suppress the
    anger and try to stop it out of fear or aversion. However, instead of doing any of these,
    y ou can reflect on the anger, because it is something that we can observe. Now if anger
    were our true self, we wouldn't be able to observe it, this is what I mean by <i>reflection</i>.
    What is it that can observe and reflect on the feeling of anger? What is it that can watch
    and investigate the feeling, the heat in the body, or the mental state. That which
    observes and investigates is what we call a reflective mind. The human mind is a
    reflective mind. </p>
    <h4>The Revelation of Truth Common to All Religions</h4>
    <b><p>W</b>e can ask questions: Who am I? Why was I born? What is life about? What happens
    when I die? Is there meaning to life or purpose? But because we tend to think other people
    know and we don't, we often seek the answers from others rather than opening the m ind and
    watching through patient alertness for truth to be revealed. Through mindfulness and
    through awareness, revelation is possible. This revelation of truth, or ultimate reality
    is what the religious experience really amounts to. When we bind ourselv es to the divine,
    and engage our whole being in that bond, we allow this revelation of truth, which we call
    insight, profound and true insight, into the nature of things. And revelation is ineffable
    too. Words are not quite capable of expressing it. That is why revelations can be very
    different. How they are stated, how they are produced through speech, can be infinitely
    variable. </p>
    <p><b>S</b>o Buddhists' revelations sound very Buddhist and Christians' revelations sound
    very Christian, and that's fair enough. There's nothing wrong with that. But we need to
    recognise the limitation of the convention of language. We need to understand that lan
    guage is not ultimately true or ultimately real; it is the attempt to communicate the
    ineffable reality to someone else. It's interesting to see the number of people who now
    seek a religious goal. A country like England is predominantly Christian but now has many
    religions. There are many inter-faith meetings and attempts within this country to try and
    understand each others' religions. We can stay at a simple level and just know that the
    Muslims believe in Allah and the Christians believe in Christ and the Buddhists believe in
    Buddha. But what I'm interested in is getting beyond the conventions to a true
    understanding, to that profound understanding of Truth. This is a Buddhist way of
    speaking. </p>
    <p><b>W</b>e have now, in a country like England, an opportunity to work toward a common
    truth among all religions, because we can all begin to help each other. It's no longer a
    time when converting people or trying to compete with each other seems to be of any us e
    or value. Rather than the attempt to convert others, religion is the opportunity to awaken
    to our true nature, to true freedom, to love and compassion. It's a way of living in full
    sensitivity, with full receptivity, so we can take delight and open ours elves to the
    mystery and wonder of the universe. </p>
