      celebrate Vesak which is traditionally associated with the Birth, 
      Enlightenment and the Parinirvana of the Buddha, We, the Theravada 
      Buddhists, consider the full moon day of the month of May as the 
      auspicious day on which these three epoch-making events took place. Hence 
      we celebrate those three events on that day in a very religiously 
      righteous way and inspire ourselves to follow the path trodden by the 
      Buddha. </FONT>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The appearance of a Buddha indeed, is a 
      very rare event. A Bodhisattva, that is a Buddha-aspirant, before taking 
      birth in the human world in his last birth, first surveys whether the time 
      is conducive to his appearance. What does this signify? This means 
      Buddha-in-the-making wants to assure himself that the people of that time 
      would be receptive to his message, which is about the predicament of human 
      life (dukkha) and its cessation (nirodha). Surely there are times when 
      people would not lend their ears to such profound teachings. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is especially so at times when they 
      are wallowing in gross sensual enjoyment, due to their ignorance of 
      reality of things. At such times, when their eyes are covered with the 
      dust of ignorance and their ears are plugged mainly with materialistic 
      teachings, the admonitions of the Buddha would go unheard. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The 6th century B.C.E. (Before the Common 
      Era), India, specially the North-East, presented a suitable environment 
      for the appearance of the Buddha. Then it was a beehive of religious 
      activities with many a religious teacher attempting to analyse the problem 
      faced by man and present remedial measures. There were the traditional 
      Vedic Seers who presented their teachings claiming it to be the divine 
      revelation. They posited the belief in a supreme Creator-Godhead and the 
      efficacy of sacrifice to solve all their life's problems. This was called 
      the way of action or sacrifice (karma marga). </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Then there were the Upanishadic teachers 
      who adopted a different approach. They were metaphysicians who believed 
      not in a Supreme-Godhead but in a universal principle - a highly 
      metaphysical concept. This they called the Brahman, the universal soul, 
      the matrix of everything. As a corollary to Brahman, they metaphysically 
      conceived of an individual soul, an Atman, which is a replica of the 
      Brahman, believed to be residing in all beings. These Upanishadic sages 
      believed that the key to solving the human problem lies in the realisation 
      of the undifferentiated Brahman-Atman identity, which has to be attained 
      through the path of knowledge (gnana marga). </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There were yet others. There were 
      materialists like Ajita Kesakambalia, skeptics like Sanjaya Bellathiputta, 
      Fatalists or Determinists like Makkhali Gosala, extreme karma-determinists 
      like Mahavira and so on. All these religious teachers had a considerable 
      following. In spite of the diversity in their teachings there was also a 
      sort of unity, for these teachings accepted some kind of an entity, a 
      substance, a soul which they referred to as Atman, Jiva and so on and 
      which some considered as metaphysical and therefore different from the 
      body, permanent and non-destructible and when the others considered as 
      identical with the body and hence, material and perishing with the 
      destruction of the body. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Basing on these fundamental philosophical 
      principle of externalism (sassatavada) and annihilationism (ucchedavada), 
      they developed two distinct religious practices. One was the method of 
      self-mortification (atta-kila-mathanuyoga) through which they tried to 
      save the eternal soul (atta) from being imprisoned in Samsaric existence. 
      The other was excessive self-indulgence in sensual pleasures 
      (kama-sukhallikanu-yoga) through which they tried to shower happiness and 
      pleasure on the soul, which they believed would get annihilated with the 
      destruction of the body. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The people of the time were not happy and 
      content with these teachings for they were not well focused and addressed 
      to the real problems they had to face, both with regard to secular and 
      spiritual spheres. So, the people were yearning for a more realistic, 
      effective and practical teaching from a teacher who would dare to 
      transcend the traditional approaches. Hence, the Buddha's advent to this 
      religious scenario was most welcomed. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha was well aware of the human 
      dukkha, both in its psychological dimension and its societal dimension. He 
      well studied the analyses of these problems and the solutions presented to 
      these by the contemporary religious teachers. His conclusion was that 
      neither the analyses nor the solutions were right. He found that the 
      analysis of human problems and finding solutions to them cannot be 
      properly done by adopting theological and theocentric approaches. </FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">These were the traditional approaches 
      adopted by the contemporary teachers and their teachings, therefore, were 
      aimed at encouraging the people just to swim with the current. Thus, 
      prayer, supplication to gods, sacrifice, resignation to fate and so on 
      were the solutions suggested by these teachers. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha discarding theology adopted 
      psychology, instead of being theocentric He was anthropocentric. Through 
      this non-traditional approach He understood the problems of man, how they 
      are caused, how they could be solved and the way leading to their solution 
      in a way never heard of before. His analysis enlightened him with regard 
      to the truth that dukkha is not something thrust upon in by some external 
      force, but our own creation and therefore lying within ourselves. From 
      this He concludes that the solution too has to sought within ourselves.
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Man was declared to be his own master, 
      responsible both for his purity and impurity. The Buddha's thus 
      enlightened knowledge went against the accepted pattern of thinking in the 
      world about spiritual life. The Buddha Himself said that His is a teaching 
      that is going against the current (patisotagami). </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">On the day of His enlightenment He was 
      offered a bowl of milk rice by a lady called Sujata. Having had His meal 
      He put the bowl into the river Neranjara, thinking if He was to gain 
      enlightenment, then may that bowl go against the current - go upstream in 
      the river. We are told that his thought came to be accomplished. 
      Symbolically signifies the fact that the Buddha's teaching went against 
      all the teachings of the day. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Let us now see, in what ways His teachings 
      changed the established ways of thinking. The Buddha immediately after His 
      Enlightenment uttered the following paean of joy (Udana). </FONT></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Through many a birth I wandered in 
        this endless cycle of births and deaths, <BR>
        seeking, but not finding, the builder of the house. <BR>
        Sorrowful is it to be born again and again. <BR>
        O house-builder! you are seen. You shall build no house again <BR>
        All your rafters are broken. Your ridge pole is shattered. <BR>
        My mind has attained the Unconditioned. Achieved is the end of craving&quot;.
        </FONT></I></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Here the Buddha explained how rebirth 
      entails suffering. Through many lives He wandered and suffered, and 
      searched for the architect of this body (the 'house'). In His final birth, 
      He discovered that the creator or architect was not an external being but 
      was man's own internal nature. This elusive architect is Craving or 
      Attachment, a self created force latent in all. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The discovery of the builder led to the 
      eradication of craving by attaining Arahatship which in the above paean is 
      expressed as the end of craving. Here it is firmly established that due to 
      not understanding (avijja) the four Noble truths for so long, He continued 
      in the endless cycle of birth and death. Now with the demolishing of the 
      house, the mind attained the unconditioned state which is Nirvana. </FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The central philosophy of Buddhism is 
      called <B><I>paticca samuppada</I></B>. It rejects the view that 
      everything happens either due to a creator, or fate or chance or karma. 
      Everything happens due to causes and conditions and the Buddha explained 
      these causes and conditions. This doctrine of conditionality has been put 
      in a simple formula as follows; </FONT></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When this is, that is (imasmin sati 
        ideamhoti) <BR>
        This arising that arises (imassa uppada idam uppajjati) <BR>
        When this not that is not (imasmin asati idam nahoti) <BR>
        This ceasing that cease (imassa nirodha idam nirujjhati) </FONT></I></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Expounding the doctrine of Conditioned 
      Genesis, the Buddha also put forward another revolutionary teaching.
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is that man has no Soul or Self, he 
      has no lasting permanent entity. This went against the accepted teaching 
      of the time. There is an entity in Indian philosophy called &quot;Purusha&quot; 
      which is also known as &quot;Prkrti&quot;. Some said that this &quot;Purusha&quot; or &quot;Prkrti&quot; 
      is the source of the world and all in it. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This very same &quot;Purusha&quot; or &quot;Prkrti&quot; was 
      introduced by some thinkers as &quot;Brahman&quot; or &quot;Paramatman&quot;. Everything has 
      originated from the Paramatman with a &quot;Small Atman&quot; in each of them. It is 
      an entity which is eternal, unchanging, omnipresent and indestructible. 
      Through realization of that eternal entity and individual becomes one with 
      it. This is known as &quot;Moksha&quot; (freedom). </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha, however, rejected the concept 
      of both Brahman and Atman and put forward His own teaching of No Atman, or 
      Anatta. What we call a person or an individual is combination of five 
      aggregates; physical body, feelings, perceptions, mental activity and 
      consciousness. But there is no self existing, ego-entity, soul or atman or 
      any other abiding substance within this physical and mental phenomenon of 
      existence or even outside of them. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha's teaching also had widespread 
      effects on the structure of society encouraging people to question some of 
      the assumptions on which that society was based, specially with regard to 
      caste and status of women. He challenged the established system of social 
      status what we call the caste system. According to tradition one could be 
      born into one of four different castes - which were established in a 
      hierarchical system with the Brahmins at the top, and the Sudras at the 
      bottom. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">People in the lowest caste were condemned 
      to lives of misery and drudgery merely because of their birth. The Buddha 
      vehemently opposed this assumption and said it was not one's birth but 
      actions which determine whether one is high or low. The Buddha also did 
      much to improve the status of women. In India at that time, women were 
      attributed a very low position in society. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The birth of a daughter was considered a 
      great woe and a man to whom a daughter was born would in all probability 
      hold his wife responsible for such a calamity. The husband might re-marry 
      to beget sons by another woman. A woman's duty was to serve man. She must 
      be faithful and obedient and could suffer divorce summarily if she were 
      quarrelsome or disobedient. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A woman played no real part in performing 
      religious rituals or sacrifices, as she was regarded as spiritually 
      inferior to man. She might be obliged to &quot;make merit&quot; by committing 
      satipuja, or throwing herself onto a husband's funeral pyre. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha, however, opposed all this and 
      spoke out in favour of giving women an equal place in society. Once the 
      Buddha advised king of Kosala, to be free from prejudices about womenfolk 
      which prevailed at that time and that some girls may be more worthy than 
      boys; worthiness is depended not on sex, but on the development of good 
      qualities. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Contrary to the belief generally held in 
      India that women had no capacity to attain higher spiritual status, the 
      Buddha encouraged them, accepting their ability and advocated the 
      possibility of their spiritual advancement by establishing the Order of 
      Bhikkhunis. Many of the Buddha's women followers, both as laity and those 
      ordained into the Bhikkuni sangha achieved sainthood. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The above account clearly shows why 
      Buddhism could be rightly called a teaching that motivated its followers 
      to swim against the current, not to pray and supplicate external forces, 
      but to engage in introspection, strive and bring a total revolution 
      within. </FONT></P>
