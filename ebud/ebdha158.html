    face="Times New Roman">an we find true happiness in life?&nbsp; There are moments of
    happiness in our life but these do not last. Pleasant things we enjoy are susceptible to
    change, they do not last. We do not really see the impermanence of what is in ourselves
    and around ourselves, we always cling to what is actually impermanent. The pleasant and
    unpleasant events of our lives condition very much our feelings. We are slaves of the
    vicissitudes of life. One day we are praised and then we are glad. The next day we are
    treated unjustly and we are humiliated, and then we are sad. There are in our life. We
    read in the &quot;Gradual Sayings&quot; (Book of Eights, Ch I, par. 6) that the Buddha
    spoke to the monks about the eight worldly conditions which obsess the world. He spoke
    with regard to those who have not attained enlightenment as follows: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>... monks, gain comes to the unlearned
      common average folk, who reflect not thus: &quot;This gain which has come is impermanent,
      painful and subject to change.&quot;&nbsp; They know it not as it really is. Loss come...
      fame... obscurity... blame... praise... contentment... pain... They reflect not that such
      are impermanent, painful and subject to change, nor do they know these conditions as they
      really are. Gain, loss and so forth take possession of their minds and hold sway there.
      they welcome the gain which has arisen; they rebel against obscurity. They welcome the
      praise which has arisen; they rebel against blame. They welcome the contentment which has
      arisen; they rebel against pain. Thus given over to compliance and hostility, they are not
      freed from birth, old age, death, sorrows, lamentations, pains, miseries and tribulations.
      I say such folk are not free from ill.</i> &nbsp; </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">We then read that for the &quot;<i>ariyan
    disciple</i>,&quot; who has attained enlightenment, the opposite is the case. We may
    wonder what the secret is of the ariyan disciple. He sees things as they really are and is
    not enslaved to the <i>worldly conditions</i>. Could we also become an ariyan
    disciple?&nbsp; At this moment we are still &quot;<i>unlearned, common, average folk</i>.&quot;&nbsp;
    From the Buddha's teachings we learn that seeing realities as they are can make us less
    enslaved to the worldly conditions. Seeing things as they are, that is true wisdom. Do we
    see realities as they are or do we live in dreams and fantasies? In our life there are
    realities and there are imaginations or ideas which we form up in our mind. We do not even
    know the difference between reality and imagination. However, in order to see things as
    they really are we must know the difference between what is real and what is not real. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">We may wonder whether the Buddha's teaching
    is not a philosophical system which deals with abstractions. On the contrary, the Buddha's
    teaching helps us to know ourselves, to know our different moments of wholesomeness and
    unwholesomeness. He taught the way to eradicate attachment, aversion and ignorance. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Our thinking about reality is conditioned by
    many ideas we acquired through our education an through the culture in which we are
    rooted. If we want to understand what the Buddha taught we should not hold on to our own
    ideas about reality and we should be open-minded to his teaching. Then we will notice that
    his teaching is completely different from our ideas about reality. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha taught about everything which
    appears no and which can be directly experienced. He did not teach abstract ideas. What
    appears no?&nbsp; Is it attachment, aversion or ignorance?&nbsp; Or is it generosity or
    compassion?&nbsp; In our life there are wholesome moments and unwholesome moments and
    these change very rapidly. We do not have one consciousness or mimd,&nbsp; but many
    different moments of consciousness. Moments of consciousness are realities, not
    imagination, and we can know them now, at this moment, when they appear. Then we will
    notice that there are many different moments of consciousness (cittas). When we, for
    example, perform a good deed there are wholesome moments of consciousness, but also
    unwholesome moments of consciousness may arise. Some slight stinginess may arise, which we
    only know ourselves and which nobody else may notice. There may be attachment to the
    person to whom we give a gift, or there may be conceit. If we do not know when there is an
    unwholesome moment of consciousness (akusala citta) how could we develop wholesomeness? </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Through the development of right
    understanding of the different moments of consciousness we will better know our
    defilements and then we will see that the cause of all sadness and misery is within
    ourselves and not outside ourselves. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">What are realities and what are
    imaginations?&nbsp; We use in our language words in order to make ourselves understood.
    sometimes a word represents something which is real, which can be directly experienced,
    and sometimes a word denotes an abstract idea. We must find out what the Buddha taught
    about reality, otherwise we will continue to be ignorant of what occurs in ourselves and
    around ourselves. then it will be impossible to eradicate our faults and vices and we will
    not be freed from our enslavement to the worldly conditions. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Moments of consciousness are not imagination,
    they are realities which can be directly experienced, now, at this moment. We can come to
    know our good and bad qualities when they appear. We have attachment and aversion with
    regard to what we experience through the eyes, the ears and through the other senses.
    Before attachment or aversion with regard to what we see can arise, there must be a moment
    of just seeing. Is there seeing at this moment?&nbsp; It can be experienced, it is a
    reality. Seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, experiences through the bodysense and through
    the mind are realities, they are not imaginations. They are different moments of
    consciousness which can be directly experienced with they appear. The Buddha spoke about
    realities which can be directly experienced and there are different from abstract ideas
    and imaginations. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Seeing is the experience of what presents
    itself through the eyes, of what is visible. Seeing is different from thinking about what
    we see, different from attachment. Seeing just sees. Hearing is the experience of what
    presents itself through the ears, of sound. Hearing is different from thinking about what
    we hear such as someone's voice or the barking of a dog. Sound is a reality, it can be
    directly experienced; but sound itself does not experience anything, it is different from
    hearing. Tasting experiences flavour. Flavour can be directly experienced when it presents
    itself. Flavour itself does not experience anything, it is different from tasting. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In our life there are two kinds of realities:
    <i>The reality which knows or experiences something, nama, the reality which does not know
    anything, rupa.</i> </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Generosity, kindness, aversion, seeing or
    hearing are mental phenomena or namas, they experience different objects. Sound, flavour,
    hardness, softness, heat or cold are physical phenomena or rupa, they do not know
    anything. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">If we want to know what is real we should ask
    ourselves: &quot;Can it be directly experienced?&quot; What is real has a characteristic
    which there being the need to think about it or to name it. Everything which is real can
    be directly experienced through the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, the bodysense
    and the &quot;mind-door,&quot; through these six doorways. Thus, if we want to know
    whether something is real we should ask ourselves: &quot;Can it be directly experienced
    and through which of the six doorways?&quot; </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Namas and rupas are realities which can be
    directly experienced without there being the need to think about them or to call them by a
    name. Hearing is hearing for everybody, everywhere. We can give hearing another name, but
    its characteristic is the same. Sound is sound for everybody, everywhere. We can give
    sound another name but its characteristic is the same. Attachment is attachment for
    everybody, aversion is aversion for everybody. We can change their name, but the realities
    are the same. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Generosity is a reality, it is nama. We may
    be inclined to think that there is a person who is generous, that a self is generous, but
    generosity does not stay. It is not self, only a kind of nama which arises and falls away.
    Seeing is real, it is a kind of nama. We think, &quot;I see,&quot; but seeing does not
    stay, it is impermanent. Where is then the self?&nbsp; There is no person. What we take
    for a person are in reality only different namas an rupas which arise and then fall away
    again. The nama and rupa in our life are realities which can be directly experienced. They
    are real, but they do not stay. They arise and then fall away immediately. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">We are full of wrong ideas about reality, we
    believe that a self sees and hears, that a self performs good deeds and bad deeds, the
    whole day there is clinging to a self. Wrong view about reality cannot lead to any good.
    So long as we believe in a self there cannot be any eradication of attachment, aversion
    and ignorance and then we will always be enslaved to the eight &quot;worldly
    conditions&quot; of gain and loss, fame and obscurity, praise and blame, contentment and
    pain. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">There is no self who experiences something.
    The seeing sees, the hearing hears, the thinking thinks. What is the use of knowing
    this?&nbsp; It is essential to know that not a self but different moments of consciousness
    experience different objects. The can be only one moment of consciousness at a time an it
    experiences one object. We may be inclined to think that namas can last for a while. We
    may believe that thinking, for example, can last form some time. In reality there are many
    different moments of thinking and they think of only one object at a time. Can we think of
    more than one thing at a time?&nbsp; This is impossible. Seeing is a moment of
    consciousness and it experiences only one object: the visible object. after seeing there
    can be thinking of what we have seen or there can be hearing, but these moments cannot
    arise at the same time. All these moments are different. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">We should know nama and rupa as they appear
    one at a time through the six doors. Ideas such as person, car or tree are not realities,
    they cannot be directly experienced and thus they are not objets of which we should
    develop insight. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha taught that only one nama or rupa
    can e known at a time, when it presents itself through one of the six doors. We may
    understand this in theory, but now we have to prove it through the direct experience of
    realities. This is not easy, because we still cling to our won view of reality. Still, we
    have to know the different objects which present themselves one at a time through the
    different doorways. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Once I was having lunch with &quot;Khun
    Sujin,&quot; my good friend in the Dhamma, in a Chinese restaurant in Bangkok. I was
    served a duck's foot and when I looked at it I had aversion. Khun Sujin said, &quot;Just
    taste it, try it, without paying attention to the shape and form.&quot;&nbsp; I tasted it
    without paying attention to the shape and form. The taste was good. At that time I did not
    understand yet the full meaning of Khun Sujin's lesson, but she wanted to show me that the
    experience through the eyes is one thing, ant eh experience through the tongue the eyes is
    one thing, and the experience through the tongue quite another thing and thus another
    reality. We join all the different experiences together into a &quot;whole&quot; and we
    think&quot; &quot;I am eating a duck's foot.&quot;&nbsp; Duck's foot is not a reality.
    What are the realities? </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">There is the experience of visible object, <br>
      there is visible object, <br>
      there is attention to shape and form, and this is different from seeing, <br>
      there is aversion, <br>
      there is tasting, the experience of flavour, <br>
      there is flavour, <br>
      there is thinking of the flavour. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Thus we see that there are different mental
    phenomena, namas, and physical phenomena, rupas, and these can be known one at a time. We
    can begin to develop right understanding of the realities of our life. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">If we do not come to know namas and rupas
    which appear one at a time, we believe that a duck's foot, a person, a house or a car
    realities which exist. However, these things are ideas, not ultimate realities (paramattha
    dhammas). Namas and rupas which can be experienced one at a time are realities. Our life
    is namas and rupas which arise and fall away. When there is a clearer understanding of the
    realities which can be directly experienced, one nama or rupa at a time, there will be
    less confusion in our life and we will gradually learn that there is no self. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In order to develop right understanding of
    nama and rupa, there should be mindfulness of them when they appear. There is no self who
    is mindful but it is &quot;sati&quot; which is mindful. Sati is a term in Pali (the
    language of the Buddhist scriptures) which can be translated as mindfulness,
    non-forgetfulness or awareness. Sati is a mental factor which accompanies each wholesome
    moment of consciousness. There are different kinds and degrees of sati. When we are
    generous there is sati which is non-forgetful of generosity. When we abstain from killing
    or other unwholesome actions there is sati which prevents us from unwholesomeness. There
    is sati with the development of calm (tranquil meditation) and it is mindful of the
    meditation subject. Sati in the development of insight or right understanding of realities
    has a different object: it is mindful or non-forgetful of a nama or rupa which appears
    now. At that moment there is no notion of a &quot;self&quot; or something which exists and
    can stay. <br>
    We cannot induce sati whenever we want it. Listening to the Dhamma and considering
    realities which appear can condition the arising of sati. We should have right
    understanding of the object of awareness: the reality which appears now,&nbsp; which is
    either nama or rupa, and we should remember that only one reality appears at a time. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">We are inclined to join many realities
    together into a &quot;whole.&quot;&nbsp; I thought that I could see a duck's foot, and I
    failed t understand that seeing is different from thinking and and different from tasting.
    One cannot see a duck's foot, seeing sees only visible object or colour. Thinking can
    think of the idea of a duck's foot. Thinking itself is a nama, it is reality, and sati can
    be mindful of thinking. That idea of which we think is not a reality and thus it cannot be
    object mindfulness. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">We cannot expect there to be many moments of
    sati in the beginning. Sati is non-forgetful of the reality which appears now, through one
    of the six doors, and at that moment understanding of that reality can develop. That kind
    of understanding is direct understanding of the reality which appears and it is different
    from theoretical understanding. The development of direct understanding of realities is
    the development of insight of the Buddha taught. it can only develop very gradually,
    during many lives. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Insight leads to detachment from the self. We
    learn that what we used to take for self are in reality many different elements, namas and
    rupas, which can be know when they appear. My husband and I had been invited to a
    restaurant where it was very cold. I have aversion towards cold and I was inclined to say
    something about it. But that would have been impatience and lack of consideration for our
    host and hostess. I considered that the namas and rupas which arise are beyond our
    control. They arise when there a re conditions for their arising. We always think that a
    self or a person can be master of nama or rupa. Sometimes it seems that we can, but it is
    not so in reality. The experience of bodily ease and pain belongs to the eight worldly
    conditions which we are not master of. The Buddha taught us to develop right understanding
    of realities which are already appearing in daily life, no matter whether they are
    pleasant or unpleasant. Sati can arise wherever we may be, in our daily life. Also when we
    do not feel well or when we are cold there can be mindfulness of realities. For example,
    if there can be a moment of mindfulness of only cold when it appears, there is at that
    moment no notion of &quot;my feet which are cold&quot; or &quot;the cold draught,&quot;
    which are not realities but only ideas. After a moment of sati is never lost. Sati falls
    away, but it can condition a moment of sati again, later on. We may think of the eight
    worldly conditions, but he development of right understanding of realities will help us
    most of all to be more patient amidst the vicissitudes of life. Eventually the right
    understanding of realities will lead to complete detachment and to freedom from all
    sorrow. </font></p>
