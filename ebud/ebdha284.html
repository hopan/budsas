      practice of attending to one in-breath and one outbreath, we can see how 
      quickly the mind rushes in and starts to fill up the space with different 
      kinds of thoughts, perceptions, images, memories and fantasies. The mind 
      is looking for something to do. This is totally ordinary and normal. But 
      where does it come from?
      <P>It's interesting to investigate what the Buddha described as the four 
      parameters of <I>upadana, </I>or attachment and clinging. The root of the 
      word &quot;upadana&quot; is &quot;fuel&quot; or, as Ajahn Thanissaro often translates it, 
      &quot;sustenance.&quot; The image is of a fire that sustains our existence -- 
      whether it is our actual physical existence or the mental existence of who 
      we think we are, who we think we aren't, or who we think we should be. </P>
      <P>How is that all sustained? How is it maintained? What are we feeding 
      our minds and hearts? The Buddha points to the four types of clinging as 
      that which holds on to the modes of existence that create our ways of 
      being. The first is attachment to sensuality, or <I>kamupadana. </I>It's 
      pretty ordinary, straightforward and easy to recognize -- the fundamental 
      desire for gratification, pleasure and stimulation. The sensual hit that 
      seems to make life worth living. It may also keep us locked up pretty 
      tight, but the belief at the time is that seeking gratification is better 
      than doing nothing. Of course, we don't really know what &quot;doing nothing&quot; 
      is because we keep filling up our time.We get bored pretty quickly if 
      there is nothing stimulating, so we look for something to keep us excited 
      and interested. </P>
      <P>The Buddha was once asked, &quot;What is it that prevents us from being 
      enlightened, being liberated in this very life?&quot; He replied that it's 
      attachment to sensual pleasures -- sensual delight through the eye, ears, 
      nose, tongue, body. &quot;One with craving and clinging is unable to experience 
      nibbana in this very life; one without clinging is able to experience 
      nibbana in this very life.&quot; </P>
      <P>During our meditation, when we watch the mind go back again and again 
      to clinging, we recognize how deep a tendency it is. The mind is looking 
      for an object. That's its habit. In the Buddha's teachings, this is not a 
      moral or ethical statement.We Westerners may add the belief: It's a bad 
      thing, I'm a bad person for doing that. But the Buddha is just pointing 
      for us to look at the result. If happiness and freedom is what one is 
      looking for, does clinging to sensuality bring about the desired result?
      </P>
      <P>The second type of clinging is <I>ditthu-padana</I>, or clinging to 
      views. This is the tendency of the mind to seek out a viewpoint or opinion 
      where everything is clear: This is right, I've got the answer, I'm happy 
      now. Of course, life doesn't actually work like that. The Buddha calls 
      this the thicket of views, the wilderness of views, the contortion of 
      views: I've got it all figured out. Now everything is safe and comfortable 
      for me. It doesn't take very long for this house of cards to come tumbling 
      down or to be challenged in one way or another. The Buddha is pointing to 
      our tendency to seek security, peace, well-being and happiness in our 
      views and perspectives. </P>
      <P>Third, the Buddha points to <I>silabbatupadana, </I>or clinging to 
      rules and vows, to precepts and practices that one assumes will lead to 
      purity. Oftentimes it's translated as &quot;attachment to rites and rituals.&quot; 
      One becomes attached to superstitious beliefs like receiving blessings by 
      being sprinkled with holy water or by bathing in the Ganges, which were 
      common practices in the time of the Buddha. The mind carries it through in 
      so many ways.We try to do the right thing, to get everything lined up in 
      our conduct or through our practices. Spreading lovingkindness, doing 
      dedications of blessings, even seeing everything as <I>anicca, dukkha, 
      anatta</I> -- these can be just as much a rite or ritual as anything else. 
      Simply repeating in the mind &quot;this is impermanent, unsatisfactory and not 
      self&quot; will not purify one. This is definitely a practice the Buddha 
      taught, but it's important to be attentive to how it is being held. </P>
      <P>This doesn't mean we shouldn't do certain practices or devotional 
      rituals. But just doing these practices is not what is going to bring 
      about purification. True accomplishment comes when we really give 
      ourselves to the practice, putting in effort in a way that is not 
      self-oriented or self-fixated. Are we able to drop what &quot;I want to get out 
      of it,&quot; or the obsession with getting everything right, even in terms of 
      the precepts? One has to recognize that the training is for the 
      attenuation of clinging and attachment. What really wears us out is when 
      we don't notice our attachments, clinging and seeking. The idea of &quot;I'm 
      doing the practice&quot; gets in the way of being attentive to what's happening 
      in the heart and mind.When we are attentive, we can actually do the 
      practice and enjoy it, delight in it and benefit from the results. </P>
      <P>The last form of attachment is clinging to the belief in self, <I>
      attavadupadana. </I>&quot;Atta&quot; means &quot;self,&quot; and &quot;vada&quot; means &quot;teaching&quot; or 
      &quot;belief.&quot; The self has a function, but we get caught up believing in the 
      story or even the doctrine of it, which then creates havoc. It's important 
      to recognize how the sense of &quot;me&quot; and &quot;mine&quot; insinuates itself all the 
      time -- craving and clinging around the feelings of &quot;'I' need to have 
      this, it has to be this way for 'me'.&quot; These thoughts are the seeds for 
      the different strands of a proliferating mind. As we are sitting and 
      practicing, watching the breath go in and out, the sense of &quot;me&quot; and 
      &quot;mine&quot; comes looking for a place to land, a story to spin. Can we just be 
      with the breath and observe that? We don't have to resolve it, to fight 
      with it, to change it into anything else. That would also be attachment to 
      the belief in self. Just be with the sensation of the breath, coming back 
      to the elemental nature of experience. Feel the solidity, hardness, 
      tangibility, fluidity, movement. This is life; this is what it all boils 
      down to in the end, the sensation of the elements. They are not me or 
      mine, not even consciousness or the feeling of being alive. Investigate 
      the simplicity of experience.What pulls us out of that: what form of 
      clinging is operating, how does it work, where does it take us? </P>
