    Suffering in the World?</font></h2>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Buddha had taught (and I refer to <strong><i>The</i></strong>
    Buddha, for there have been many and you, yourself, may have
    the aspiration to one day be one), that it is man's clinging
    to the idea of separate selfness which is the cause of his
    suffering. Implicit in separate selfhood is egotism and
    craving. This is illusion, the basic illusion. The man who
    &quot;prays to God&quot; expresses craving. He is a clinger.
    He wishes something for<strong> </strong><strong><i>self</i></strong>,
    is egotistic. Even the idea of a God expresses the thought of
    an extension of his egotism into a future life -- in heaven
    or wherever. The prayer craves for a beautiful painfree
    future or continuation of the present. In return he promises
    his God to be of good behavior. </p>
    <p>Buddha teaches that beauty is fleeting, life is
    impermanent and transitory, that pain and sorrow are an
    outcome of the craving egotistic self. <strong><i>That
    craving is our suffering</i></strong><i>.</i> Craving implies
    cravenness. To be craven is to fear. Fearfulness is
    suffering. Life is fearful. </p>
    <p>There is suffering in the world because the fearful,
    fearing self continues in its illusion of lonely
    separateness. The separate self clings to its fears, its
    self-seeking, its pleading, hoping, craving. &quot;Give
    me,&quot; it implores its God, &quot;help me.&quot; What is
    the Buddha's answer to this? Does he not say, &quot;Cleanse
    yourself of the self-idea, of its greed, hatred,
    ignorance&quot;? And what is this ignorance? Is it not our
    ignoring, our refusal to see the basic illusion of selfhood? </p>
    <p>We finally return to meditation again, to why we meditate.
    Meditation is a way, the Buddha's way of self-cleansing,
    self-elimination, of freeing the mind of its attachments to
    the impermananent and illusory. Through meditation we learn
    to detach the self from its assumptions, to realize that ego
    is substance-less, to free our mind from its defilements and
    illusions; to approach, through wisdom and compassion, the
    ultimate cessation of suffering which comes with Nibbana, the
    utter abandonment of our selfhood. In this no eternity is
    sought, no endless continuity. And no annihilation. For,
    since there is <strong>no </strong><strong><i>one</i></strong>,
    what is there to annihilate? Or to eternalize? </p>
    <p>In a way of thinking, is not this a kind of sublime
    mysticism? A creed or belief that yields unseeking
    equanimity, quietude and the end of suffering? Since all
    being, in the end, <i>is</i> mystery; since trembling ,
    transitory being is but an illusory drop of water in a
    depthless ocean, why not accept it as so? </p>
    <p>Those who crave for and pray to gods often achieve thereby
    a kind of mental purification. Even the prayers of sceptics
    often achieve the same result. If prayer brings relief and
    quietude, remission of suffering, it cannot be bad. But what
    if the relief is unlasting? Apart from the notion that prayer
    implies a dependency on external or supernatural authority,
    which I have no reason to bring into question, it definitely
    is based on the idea of a self as opposed to an other, and of
    bringing the two together in a sort of bargaining process.
    But what if we can accept the idea that there is no self to
    begin with and therefore no one to do the bargaining? I am
    reminded, in conclusion, of a little story: </p>
    <p>A Christian missionary found a Chinese priest chanting in
    a temple. When the Chinese had finished, the missionary asked
    him: &quot;To whom were you praying?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;To no one,&quot; replied the Chinese priest. </p>
    <p>&quot;Well, what were you praying <strong><i>for</i></strong>?&quot;
    the missionary insisted. </p>
    <p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; said the Chinese, </p>
    <p>The missionary turned away, baffled. As the was leaving
    the temple the Chinese added, kindly: &quot;And there was no
    one praying, you know!&quot; </p>
    <p>I have learned that through meditation one comes to
    appreciate vistas of truth in no other way attainable; and
    that if one does not come to understand totally and
    unquestionably the fullest depths of meaning possible as to
    the causes of suffering, one does at least arrive by painful
    experience and mindfulness to comprehension of its
    imponderability and immensity. I see it in a personal way, in
    my seventh decade, in severe and frequent anginas, in
    arthritic pains which make sittings so difficult that I must
    frequently change positions during meditation, or do standing
    meditation. I see it in my deafened and daily worsening
    hearing, the dimming of my eyes and in the realization that
    in the course of minding my breath and giving consideration
    to the dissolution of every component of my body, <strong><i>anicca</i></strong>,
    impermanence, is the source out of which this suffering or <strong><i>dukkha</i></strong>
    flows. Out of this impermanence, too, I sense the vastness of
    the illusion that we possess anything life abiding,
    continuous and distinguishable selfhood and that the epitome
    of suffering arises from this basic illusion -- that there is
    a &quot;one,&quot; a &quot;self&quot; which is suffering or
    sufferable. </p>
    <p>The facts of suffering, its truth, and the facts of
    impermanence as well, are widely recognized by most
    religions. All accept the basic tragical quality of life.
    Where Buddhism goes forward from the rest is in the
    maintenance and espousal of the theme of no-self. Life,
    death, impermanence and suffering then become but a process
    in which, in an ultimate and fundamental sense, there is no
    personal participation. From this notion comes release,
    emancipation and enlightenment. As phenomena we may continue
    to go on until the ultimate collapse of our bodies and death
    overtakes us. But since no self is any longer engaged in the
    process, it becomes depersonalized. We are no longer subjects
    or even objects of calamity, despair, disease. Disturbance,
    dejection, worry, dread, anguish, decay, enfeeblement,
    senility, no longer concern us. Serenity and equanimity come
    with a new wisdom reflecting our detachment not alone from
    these negative emotions but also from the positive ones such
    as longing, craving, hoping, desiring, wishing, clinging.
    Because, whether we realize and attain the positive results
    or goals sought through these emotions, or do not, there is
    continued suffering. We suffer if we fail to attain them and
    there is disappointment. If we do attain them, they are
    impermanent, suffer their own kind of decay, and out of this
    loss we suffer as well. </p>
    <p>The goal, in the end, becomes the even-minded
    depersonalized middle course wherein irritation, aversion,
    uncertainty vanish. Hate and animosity become impossible. One
    is neither submissive nor rebellious. We transcend the need
    for personal love or hate. Quietude comes to us. Release.
    These are the goals of insight or vipassana meditation, whose
    aim is release from suffering. How close we come to realizing
    them will depend on the quality of those we seek out to teach
    us and on our own assiduity in the mindfulness with which we
    seek, through our meditation, to arrive at the other shore. </p>
