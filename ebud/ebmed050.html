    <p>We noted that some of the sets in the &quot;Wings to
    Awakening list&quot;, jhana as a condition for discernment,
    while others list discernment as a condition for jhana. Place
    both of these patterns into the context of this/that
    conditionality, and they convey the point that jhana and
    discernment in practice are mutually supporting. Passage <a
    href="#171">§171</a> states this point explicitly, while <a
    href="#165">§165</a> and <a href="#166">§166</a> show that
    the difference between the two causal patterns relates to
    differences in meditators: some develop strong powers of
    concentration before developing strong discernment, whereas
    others gain a sound theoretical understanding of the Dhamma
    before developing strong concentration. In either case, both
    strong concentration and sound discernment are needed to
    bring about Awakening. Passage <a href="#111">§111</a> makes
    the point that when the practice reaches the culmination of
    its development, concentration and discernment act in
    concert. The passages in this section deal with this topic in
    more detail. </p>
    <p>The role of jhana as a condition for transcendent
    discernment is one of the most controversial issues in the
    Theravada tradition. Three basic positions have been advanced
    in modern writings. One, following the commentarial
    tradition, asserts that jhana is not necessary for any of the
    four levels of Awakening and that there is a class of
    individuals -- called &quot;dry insight&quot; meditators --
    who are &quot;released through discernment&quot; based on a
    level of concentration lower than that of jhana. A second
    position, citing a passage in the Canon [A.III.88; MFU, pp.
    103] stating that concentration is mastered only on the level
    of non-returning, holds that jhana is necessary for the
    attainment of non-returning and Arahantship, but not for the
    lower levels of Awakening. The third position states that the
    attainment of at least the first level of jhana is essential
    for all four levels of Awakening. </p>
    <p>Evidence from the Canon supports the third position, but
    not the other two. As <a href="#106">§106</a> points out,
    the attainment of stream-entry has eight factors, one of
    which is right concentration, defined as jhana. In fact,
    according to this particular discourse, jhana is the heart of
    the streamwinner's path. Secondly, there is no passage in the
    Canon describing the development of transcendent discernment
    without at least some skill in jhana. The statement that
    concentration is mastered only on the level of non-returning
    must be interpreted in the light of the distinction between
    mastery and attainment. A streamwinner may have attained
    jhana without mastering it; the discernment developed in the
    process of gaining full mastery over the practice of jhana
    will then lead him/her to the level of non-returning. As for
    the term &quot;released through discernment,&quot; passage <a
    href="#168">§168</a> shows that it denotes people who have
    become Arahants without experiencing the four formless
    jhanas. It does not indicate a person who has not experienced
    jhana. </p>
    <p>Part of the controversy over this question may be
    explained by the fact that the commentarial literature
    defines jhana in terms that bear little resemblance to the
    canonical description. <strong><i>The Path of Purification</i></strong>
    -- the cornerstone of the commentarial system -- takes as its
    paradigm for meditation practice a method called<strong><i>
    kasina</i></strong><i>,</i> in which one stares at an
    external object until the image of the object is imprinted in
    one's mind. The image then gives rise to a countersign that
    is said to indicate the attainment of threshold
    concentration, a necessary prelude to jhana. The text then
    tries to fit all other meditation methods into the mold of
    kasina practice, so that they too give rise to countersigns,
    but even by its own admission, breath meditation does not fit
    well into the mold: with other methods, the stronger one's
    focus, the more vivid the object and the closer it is to
    producing a sign and countersign; but with the breath, the
    stronger one's focus, the harder the object is to detect. As
    a result, the text states that only Buddhas and Buddhas' sons
    find the breath a congenial focal point for attaining jhana. </p>
    <p>None of these assertions have any support in the Canon.
    Although a practice called kasina is mentioned tangentially
    in some of the discourses, the only point where it is
    described in any detail [M.121; MFU, pp. 82-85] makes no
    mention of staring at an object or gaining a countersign. If
    breath meditation were congenial only to Buddhas and their
    sons, there seems little reason for the Buddha to have taught
    it so frequently and to such a wide variety of people. If the
    arising of a countersign were essential to the attainment of
    jhana, one would expect it to be included in the steps of
    breath meditation and in the graphic analogies used to
    describe jhana, but it isn't. Some Theravadins insist that
    questioning the commentaries is a sign of disrespect for the
    tradition, but it seems to be a sign of greater disrespect
    for the Buddha -- or the compilers of the Canon -- to assume
    that he or they would have left out something absolutely
    essential to the practice. </p>
    <p>All of these points seem to indicate that what jhana means
    in the commentaries is something quite different from what it
    means in the Canon. Because of this difference we can say
    that the commentaries are right in viewing their type of
    jhana as unnecessary for Awakening, but Awakening cannot
    occur without the attainment of jhana in the canonical sense.
    </p>
    <p>We have already given a sketch in the preceding section of
    how jhana in its canonical sense can act as the basis for
    transcendent discernment. To recapitulate: On attaining any
    of the first seven levels of jhana, one may step back
    slightly from the object of jhana -- entering the fifth
    factor of noble right concentration [<a href="#150">§150</a>]
    -- to perceive how the mind relates to the object. In doing
    this, one sees the process of causation as it plays a role in
    bringing the mind to jhana, together with the various mental
    acts of fabrication that go into keeping it there [<a
    href="#182">§182</a>]. Passage <a href="#172">§172</a>
    lists these acts in considerable detail. The fact that the
    passage emphasizes the amazing abilities of Sariputta, the
    Buddha's foremost disciple in terms of discernment, implies
    that there is no need for every meditator to perceive all
    these acts in such a detailed fashion. What is essential is
    that one develop a sense of dispassion for the state of
    jhana, seeing that even the relatively steady sense of
    refined pleasure and equanimity it provides is artificial and
    willed, inconstant and stressful [<a href="#182">§182</a>],
    a state fabricated from many different events, and thus not
    worth identifying with. Jhana thus becomes an ideal test case
    for understanding the workings of kamma and dependent
    co-arising in the mind. Its stability gives discernment a
    firm basis for seeing clearly; its refined sense of pleasure
    and equanimity allow the mind to realize that even the most
    refined mundane states involve the inconstancy and stress
    common to all willed phenomena. Passage <a href="#167">§167</a>
    lists a number of verbal mental acts surrounding the exercise
    of supranormal powers that can be regarded in a similar
    light, as topics to be analyzed so as to give rise to a sense
    of dispassion. The dispassion that results in either case
    enables one to experience the fading away and cessation of
    the last remaining activities in the mind, even the activity
    of discernment itself. When this process fully matures, it
    leads on to total relinquishment, resulting in the clear
    knowing and release of Arahantship. </p>
    <p>In contrast to the issue of the role of jhana as a
    condition for discernment, the role of discernment as a
    condition for jhana is uncontroversial. Discernment aids
    jhana on two levels: mundane and transcendent. On the mundane
    level, it enables one to perceive the various factors that go
    into one's state of jhana so that one can master them and
    shed the factors that prevent one from attaining a higher
    level of jhana. This again involves the reflection that
    constitutes the fifth factor of noble right concentration,
    but in this case the results stay on the mundane level. For
    instance, as one masters the first level of jhana and can
    reflect on the elements of stress it contains, one may
    perceive that directed thought and evaluation should be
    abandoned because they have become unnecessary in maintaining
    one's concentration, just as the forms used in pouring a
    cement wall become unnecessary when the cement has hardened.
    In dropping these factors, one then goes on to the second
    level of jhana. Passage <a href="#175">§175</a> gives a list
    of the factors that, in succession, are dropped in this way
    as one attains higher and higher levels of concentration. </p>
    <p>On the transcendent level, the discernment that
    precipitates Awakening results in a supramundane level of
    jhana called the fruit of gnosis, which is described in <a
    href="#176">§§176-77</a> -- a type of jhana independent of
    all perceptions (mental labels) and intentional processes,
    beyond all limitations of cosmos, time, and the present: the
    Arahant's foretaste, in this lifetime, of the absolutely
    total Unbinding experienced by the awakened mind at death. </p>

    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a name="106"><b></b></a><b>§ 106.</b> And what, monks,
    is noble right concentration with its supports and requisite
    conditions? Any singleness of mind equipped with these seven
    factors -- right view, right resolve, right speech, right
    action, right livelihood, right effort, and right mindfulness
    -- is called noble right concentration with its supports and
    requisite conditions. </p>
    <p>[1] Of those, right view is the forerunner. And how is
    right view the forerunner? One discerns wrong view as wrong
    view, and right view as right view. This is one's right view.
    And what is wrong view? 'There is nothing given, nothing
    offered, nothing sacrificed. There is no fruit or result of
    good or bad actions. There is no this world, no next world,
    no mother, no father, no spontaneously reborn beings; no
    priests or contemplatives who, faring rightly and practicing
    rightly, proclaim this world and the next after having
    directly known and realized it for themselves.' This is wrong
    view. </p>
    <p>And what is right view? Right view, I tell you, is of two
    sorts: There is right view with effluents, siding with merit,
    resulting in acquisitions; and there is noble right view,
    without effluents, transcendent, a factor of the path. </p>
    <p>And what is the right view that has effluents, sides with
    merit, and results in acquisitions? 'There is what is given,
    what is offered, what is sacrificed. There are fruits and
    results of good and bad actions. There is this world and the
    next world. There is mother and father. There are
    spontaneously reborn beings; there are priests and
    contemplatives who, faring rightly and practicing rightly,
    proclaim this world and the next after having directly known
    and realized it for themselves.' This is the right view that
    has effluents, sides with merit, and results in acquisitions.
    </p>
    <p>And what is the right view that is without effluents,
    transcendent, a factor of the path? The discernment, the
    faculty of discernment, the strength of discernment, analysis
    of qualities as a factor of Awakening, the path factor of
    right view in one developing the noble path whose mind is
    noble, whose mind is free from effluents, who is fully
    possessed of the noble path. This is the right view that is
    without effluents, transcendent, a factor of the path. </p>
    <p>One tries to abandon wrong view and to enter into right
    view: This is one's right effort. One is mindful to abandon
    wrong view and to enter and remain in right view: This is
    one's right mindfulness. Thus these three qualities -- right
    view, right effort, and right mindfulness -- run and circle
    around right view. </p>
    <p>[2] Of those, right view is the forerunner. And how is
    right view the forerunner? One discerns wrong resolve as
    wrong resolve, and right resolve as right resolve. And what
    is wrong resolve? Being resolved on sensuality, on ill will,
    on harmfulness. This is wrong resolve. </p>
    <p>And what is right resolve? Right resolve, I tell you, is
    of two sorts: There is right resolve with effluents, siding
    with merit, resulting in the acquisitions; and there is noble
    right resolve, without effluents, transcendent, a factor of
    the path. </p>
    <p>And what is the right resolve that has effluents, sides
    with merit, and results in acquisitions? Being resolved on
    renunciation, on freedom from ill will, on harmlessness. This
    is the right resolve that has effluents, sides with merit,
    and results in acquisitions. </p>
    <p>And what is the right resolve that is without effluents,
    transcendent, a factor of the path? The thinking, directed
    thinking, resolve, mental absorption, mental fixity, focused
    awareness, and verbal fabrications in one developing the
    noble path whose mind is noble, whose mind is without
    effluents, who is fully possessed of the noble path. This is
    the right resolve that is without effluents, transcendent, a
    factor of the path. </p>
    <p>One tries to abandon wrong resolve and to enter into right
    resolve: This is one's right effort. One is mindful to
    abandon wrong resolve and to enter and remain in right
    resolve: This is one's right mindfulness. Thus these three
    qualities -- right view, right effort, and right mindfulness
    -- run and circle around right resolve. </p>
    <p>[3] Of those, right view is the forerunner. And how is
    right view the forerunner? One discerns wrong speech as wrong
    speech, and right speech as right speech. And what is wrong
    speech? Lying, divisive tale-bearing, abusive speech, and
    idle chatter. This is wrong speech. </p>
    <p>And what is right speech? Right speech, I tell you, is of
    two sorts: There is right speech with effluents, siding with
    merit, resulting in the acquisitions; and there is noble
    right speech, without effluents, transcendent, a factor of
    the path. </p>
    <p>And what is the right speech that has effluents, sides
    with merit, and results in acquisitions? Abstaining from
    lying, from divisive tale-bearing, from abusive speech, and
    from idle chatter. This is the right speech that has
    effluents, sides with merit, and results in acquisitions. </p>
    <p>And what is the right speech that is without effluents,
    transcendent, a factor of the path? The abstaining,
    desisting, abstinence, avoidance of the four forms of verbal
    misconduct in one developing the noble path whose mind is
    noble, whose mind is without effluents, who is fully
    possessed of the noble path. This is the right speech that is
    without effluents, transcendent, a factor of the path. </p>
    <p>One tries to abandon wrong speech and to enter into right
    speech: This is one's right effort. One is mindful to abandon
    wrong speech and to enter and remain in right speech: This is
    one's right mindfulness. Thus these three qualities -- right
    view, right effort, and right mindfulness -- run and circle
    around right speech. </p>
    <p>[4] Of those, right view is the forerunner. And how is
    right view the forerunner? One discerns wrong action as wrong
    action, and right action as right action. And what is wrong
    action? Killing, taking what is not given, illicit sex. This
    is wrong action. </p>
    <p>And what is right action? Right action, I tell you, is of
    two sorts: There is right action with effluents, siding with
    merit, resulting in the acquisitions; and there is noble
    right action, without effluents, transcendent, a factor of
    the path. </p>
    <p>And what is the right action that has effluents, sides
    with merit, and results in acquisitions? Abstaining from
    killing, from taking what is not given, and from illicit sex.
    This is the right action that has effluents, sides with
    merit, and results in acquisitions. </p>
    <p>And what is the right action that is without effluents,
    transcendent, a factor of the path? The abstaining,
    desisting, abstinence, avoidance of the three forms of bodily
    misconduct in one developing the noble path whose mind is
    noble, whose mind is without effluents, who is fully
    possessed of the noble path. This is the right action that is
    without effluents, transcendent, a factor of the path. </p>
    <p>One tries to abandon wrong action and to enter into right
    action: This is one's right effort. One is mindful to abandon
    wrong action and to enter and remain in right action: This is
    one's right mindfulness. Thus these three qualities -- right
    view, right effort, and right mindfulness -- run and circle
    around right action. </p>
    <p>[5] Of those, right view is the forerunner. And how is
    right view the forerunner? One discerns wrong livelihood as
    wrong livelihood, and right livelihood as right livelihood.
    And what is wrong livelihood? Scheming, persuading, hinting,
    belittling, and pursuing gain with gain. This is wrong
    livelihood. </p>
    <p>And what is right livelihood? Right livelihood, I tell
    you, is of two sorts: There is right livelihood with
    effluents, siding with merit, resulting in the acquisitions;
    and there is noble right livelihood, without effluents,
    transcendent, a factor of the path. </p>
    <p>And what is the right livelihood that has effluents, sides
    with merit, and results in acquisitions? There is the case
    where a noble disciple abandons wrong livelihood and
    maintains his life with right livelihood. This is the right
    livelihood that has effluents, sides with merit, and results
    in acquisitions. </p>
    <p>And what is the right livelihood that is without
    effluents, transcendent, a factor of the path? The
    abstaining, desisting, abstinence, avoidance of wrong
    livelihood in one developing the noble path whose mind is
    noble, whose mind is without effluents, who is fully
    possessed of the noble path. This is the right livelihood
    that is without effluents, transcendent, a factor of the
    path. </p>
    <p>One tries to abandon wrong livelihood and to enter into
    right livelihood: This is one's right effort. One is mindful
    to abandon wrong livelihood and to enter and remain in right
    livelihood: This is one's right mindfulness. Thus these three
    qualities -- right view, right effort, and right mindfulness
    -- run and circle around right livelihood. </p>
    <p>Of those, right view is the forerunner. And how is right
    view the forerunner? In one of right view, right resolve
    comes into being. In one of right resolve, right speech comes
    into being. In one of right speech, right action...In one of
    right action, right livelihood...In one of right livelihood,
    right effort...In one of right effort, right mindfulness...In
    one of right mindfulness, right concentration...In one of
    right concentration, right knowledge...In one of right
    knowledge, right release comes into being. Thus the learner
    is endowed with eight factors, and the Arahant with ten. </p>
    <p>Of those, right view is the forerunner. And how is right
    view the forerunner? In one of right view, wrong view is
    abolished. The many evil, unskillful qualities that come into
    play with wrong view as their condition are also abolished,
    while the many skillful qualities that have right view as
    their condition go to the culmination of their development.
    (Similarly with the remaining factors up through:) In one of
    right release, wrong release is abolished. The many evil,
    unskillful qualities that come into play with wrong release
    as their condition are also abolished, while the many
    skillful qualities that have right release as their condition
    go to the culmination of their development. </p>

    pervades, suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture
    and pleasure born from withdrawal. There is nothing of his
    entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born from
    withdrawal. </p>
    <p>Just as if a skilled bathman or bathman's apprentice would
    pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together,
    sprinkling it again and again with water, so that his ball of
    bath powder -- saturated, moisture-laden, permeated within
    and without -- would nevertheless not drip; even so, the monk
    permeates...this very body with the rapture and pleasure born
    of withdrawal. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded
    by rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal. This is the
    first development of the five-factored noble right
    concentration. </p>
    <p>Furthermore, with the stilling of directed thought and
    evaluation, he enters and remains in the second jhana:
    rapture and pleasure born of composure, unification of
    awareness free from directed thought and evaluation --
    internal assurance. He permeates and pervades, suffuses and
    fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of
    composure. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by
    rapture and pleasure born of composure. </p>
    <p>Just like a lake with spring-water welling up from within,
    having no inflow from east, west, north, or south, and with
    the skies periodically supplying abundant showers, so that
    the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would
    permeate and pervade, suffuse and fill it with cool waters,
    there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool
    waters; even so, the monk permeates...this very body with the
    rapture and pleasure born of composure. There is nothing of
    his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born of
    composure. This is the second development of the
    five-factored noble right concentration. </p>
    <p>And furthermore, with the fading of rapture, he remains in
    equanimity, mindful and alert, and physically sensitive to
    pleasure. He enters and remains in the third jhana, of which
    the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous and mindful, he has a
    pleasurable abiding.' He permeates and pervades, suffuses and
    fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture,
    so that there is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with
    pleasure divested of rapture. </p>
    <p>Just as in a blue-, white-, or red-lotus pond, there may
    be some of the blue, white, or red lotuses which, born and
    growing in the water, stay immersed in the water and flourish
    without standing up out of the water, so that they are
    permeated and pervaded, suffused and filled with cool water
    from their roots to their tips, and nothing of those blue,
    white, or red lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water;
    even so, the monk permeates...this very body with the
    pleasure divested of rapture. There is nothing of his entire
    body unpervaded with pleasure divested of rapture. This is
    the third development of the five-factored noble right
    concentration. </p>
    <p>And furthermore, with the abandoning of pleasure and
    stress -- as with the earlier disappearance of elation and
    distress -- he enters and remains in the fourth jhana: purity
    of equanimity and mindfulness, neither-pleasure-nor-pain. He
    sits, permeating the body with a pure, bright awareness, so
    that there is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure,
    bright awareness. </p>
    <p>Just as if a man were sitting wrapped from head to foot
    with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body
    to which the white cloth did not extend; even so, the monk
    sits, permeating his body with a pure, bright awareness.
    There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure,
    bright awareness. This is the fourth development of the
    five-factored noble right concentration. </p>
    <p>And furthermore, the monk has his theme of reflection well
    in hand, well attended to, well pondered, well tuned
    (well-penetrated) by means of discernment. </p>
    <p>Just as if one person were to reflect on another, or a
    standing person were to reflect on a sitting person, or a
    sitting person were to reflect on a person lying down; even
    so, monks, the monk has his theme of reflection well in hand,
    well attended to, well pondered, well tuned by means of
    discernment. This is the fifth development of the
    five-factored noble right concentration. </p>
    <p>When a monk has developed and pursued the five-factored
    noble right concentration in this way, then whichever of the
    six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know and realize,
    he can witness them for himself whenever there is an opening.</p>
    <p>Suppose that there were a water jar, set on a stand,
    brimful of water so that a crow could drink from it. If a
    strong man were to tip it in any way at all, would water
    spill out? </p>
    <p>Yes, lord. </p>
    <p>In the same way, when a monk has developed and pursued the
    five-factored noble right concentration in this way, then
    whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to
    know and realize, he can witness them for himself whenever
    there is an opening. </p>
    <p>Suppose there were a rectangular water tank -- set on
    level ground, bounded by dikes -- brimful of water so that a
    crow could drink from it. If a strong man were to loosen the
    dikes anywhere at all, would water spill out? </p>
    <p>Yes, lord... </p>
    <p>Suppose there were a chariot on level ground at four
    crossroads, harnessed to thoroughbreds, waiting with whips
    lying ready, so that a skilled driver, a trainer of tamable
    horses, might mount and -- taking the reins with his left
    hand and the whip with his right -- drive out and back, to
    whatever place and by whichever road he liked; in the same
    way, when a monk has developed and pursued the five-factored
    noble right concentration in this way, then whichever of the
    six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know and realize,

    courteously. After an exchange of friendly greetings and

    he said to Ven. Sariputta: By means of the divine eye,
    purified and surpassing the human, I see the thousand-fold
    cosmos. My persistence is aroused and unsluggish. My
    mindfulness is established and unshaken. My body is calm and
    unaroused. My mind is concentrated into singleness. And yet

    <p>Sariputta: My friend, when the thought occurs to you, 'By
    means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human, I
    see the thousand-fold cosmos,' that is related to your
    conceit. When the thought occurs to you, 'My persistence is
    aroused and unsluggish. My mindfulness is established and

    <p>So after that, Ven. Anuruddha -- abandoning those three

    his mind to the Deathless property. Dwelling alone, secluded,

    <p><b>§ 173.</b> I tell you, the ending of the effluents

    sphere of nothingness...the sphere of neither perception nor
    non-perception. </p>
    <p>'I tell you, the ending of the effluents depends on the
    first jhana.' Thus it has been said. In reference to what was
    it said?... Suppose that an archer or archer's apprentice
    were to practice on a straw man or mound of clay, so that
    after a while he would become able to shoot long distances,
    to fire accurate shots in rapid succession, and to pierce
    great masses. In the same way, there is the case where a
    monk...enters and remains in the first jhana: rapture and
    pleasure born of withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought
    and evaluation. He regards whatever phenomena there that are
    connected with form, feeling, perceptions, fabrications, and
    consciousness, as inconstant, stressful, a disease, a cancer,
    an arrow, painful, an affliction, alien, a disintegration, a
    void, not-self. He turns his mind away from those phenomena,
    and having done so, inclines his mind to the property of
    deathlessness: 'This is peace, this is exquisite -- the
    resolution of all fabrications; the relinquishment of all
    acquisitions; the ending of craving; dispassion; cessation;
    Unbinding.' </p>
    <p>Staying right there, he reaches the ending of the mental
    effluents. Or, if not, then -- through passion and delight
    for this very property [the discernment inclining to
    deathlessness] and from the total wasting away of the first
    of the five Fetters [self-identity views, grasping at
    precepts and practices, uncertainty, sensual passion, and
    irritation] -- he is due to be reborn [in the Pure Abodes],
    there to be totally unbound, never again to return from that
    world. </p>
    <p>'I tell you, the ending of the effluents depends on the
    first jhana.' Thus it was said, and in reference to this was
    it said. </p>
    <p>(Similarly with the other levels of jhana up through the
    sphere of nothingness.) </p>
    <p>Thus, as far as the perception-attainments go, that is as
    far as gnosis-penetration goes. As for these two spheres --
    the attainment of the sphere of neither perception nor
    non-perception and the attainment of the cessation of feeling
    and perception -- I tell you that they are to be rightly
    explained by those monks who are meditators, skilled in
    attaining, skilled in attaining and emerging, who have
    attained and emerged in dependence on them. </p>

    passion and delight for this very phenomenon [of discernment]
    and from the total ending of the first five Fetters -- he is
    due to be reborn [in the Pure Abodes], there to be totally
    unbound, never again to return from that world. (Similarly
    with the other levels of jhana up through the sphere of
    nothingness and the four releases of awareness based on good
    will, compassion, appreciation, and equanimity.) </p>

    <p><b>§ 175.</b> Sariputta: This Unbinding is pleasant,
    friends. This Unbinding is pleasant. </p>
    <p>Udayin: But what is the pleasure here, my friend, where
    there is nothing felt? </p>
    <p>Sariputta: Just that is the pleasure here, my friend:
    where there is nothing felt. There are these five strands of
    sensuality. Which five? Forms cognizable via the eye --
    agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, fostering desire,
    enticing; sounds...smells...tastes...tactile sensations
    cognizable via the body -- agreeable, pleasing, charming,
    endearing, fostering desire, enticing. Whatever pleasure or
    joy arises in dependence on these five strands of sensuality,
    that is sensual pleasure. </p>
    <p>Now there is the case where a monk -- quite withdrawn from
    sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful qualities -- enters and
    remains in the first jhana...If, as he remains there, he is
    beset with attention to perceptions dealing with <i>sensuality,</i>
    that is an affliction for him. Just as pain arises as an
    affliction for a healthy person, even so the attention to
    perceptions dealing with sensuality that beset the monk is an
    affliction for him. Now the Blessed One has said that
    whatever is an affliction is stress. So by this line of
    reasoning it may be known how Unbinding is pleasant. </p>
    <p>Furthermore, there is the case where a monk...enters and
    remains in the second jhana...If, as he remains there, he is
    beset with attention to perceptions dealing with <i>directed
    thought,</i> that is an affliction for him... </p>
    <p>Furthermore, there is the case where a monk...enters and
    remains in the third jhana...If, as he remains there, he is
    beset with attention to perceptions dealing with <i>rapture,</i>
    that is an affliction for him... </p>
    <p>Furthermore, there is the case where a monk...enters and
    remains in the fourth jhana...If, as he remains there, he is
    beset with attention to perceptions dealing with <i>equanimity,</i>
    that is an affliction for him... </p>
    <p>Furthermore, there is the case where a monk...enters and
    remains in the sphere of the infinitude of space. If, as he
    remains there, he is beset with attention to perceptions
    dealing with <i>form,</i> that is an affliction for him... </p>
    <p>Furthermore, there is the case where a monk...enters and
    remains in the sphere of the infinitude of consciousness. If,
    as he remains there, he is beset with attention to
    perceptions dealing with <i>the sphere of the infinitude of
    space, </i>that is an affliction for him... </p>
    <p>Furthermore, there is the case where a monk...enters and
    remains in the sphere of nothingness. If, as he remains
    there, he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with
    <i>the sphere of the infinitude of consciousness, </i>that is
    an affliction for him... </p>
    <p>Furthermore, there is the case where a monk...enters and
    remains in the sphere of neither perception nor
    non-perception. If, as he remains there, he is beset with
    attention to perceptions dealing with <i>the sphere of the
    infinitude of consciousness, </i>that is an affliction for
    him...whatever is an affliction is stress. So by this line of
    reasoning it may be known how Unbinding is pleasant. </p>
    <p>Furthermore, there is the case where a monk...enters and
    remains in the cessation of perception and feeling. And,
    having seen [that] with discernment, his effluents are
    completely ended. So by this line of reasoning it may be
    known how Unbinding is pleasant. </p>

    <p><b>§ 176.</b> Ananda: It is amazing, my friend, it is
    marvelous, how the Blessed One has attained and recognized
    the opportunity for the purification of beings...and the
    direct realization of Unbinding, where the eye will be, and
    forms, and yet one will not be sensitive to that sphere;
    where the ear will be, and sounds...where the nose will be,
    and smells...where the tongue will be, and tastes...where the
    body will be, and tactile sensations, and yet one will not be
    sensitive to that sphere. </p>
    <p>Udayin: Is one insensitive to that sphere with or without
    a perception in mind? </p>
    <p>Ananda: ...with a perception in mind... </p>
    <p>Udayin: ...what perception? </p>
    <p>Ananda: There is the case where with the complete
    transcending of perceptions dealing with form, with the
    disappearance of perceptions of resistance, and not heeding
    perceptions of diversity, thinking, 'infinite space,' one
    remains in the sphere of the infinitude of space: Having this
    perception in mind, one is not sensitive to that sphere. </p>
    <p>Further, with the complete transcending of the sphere of
    the infinitude of space, thinking, 'infinite consciousness,'
    one remains in the sphere of the infinitude of consciousness:
    Having this perception in mind, one is not sensitive to that
    sphere. </p>
    <p>Further, with the complete transcending of the sphere of
    the infinitude of consciousness, thinking, 'There is
    nothing,' one remains in the sphere of nothingness: Having
    this perception in mind, one is not sensitive to that sphere.

    <p>Once, friend, when I was staying in Saketa at the Game
    Refuge in the Black Forest, the nun Jatila Bhagika went to
    where I was staying, and on arrival -- having bowed to me --
    stood to one side. As soon as she had stood to one side, she
    said to me: 'The concentration whereby -- neither pressed
    down nor forced back, nor with mental fabrications kept
    blocked or suppressed -- still as a result of release,
    contented as a result of stillness, and as a result of
    contentment one is not agitated: This concentration is said
    by the Blessed One to be the fruit of what?' </p>
    <p>I said to her, '...This concentration is said by the
    Blessed One to be the fruit of gnosis [the knowledge of
    Awakening].' Having this sort of perception, friend, one is
    not sensitive to that sphere. </p>

    <p><b>§ 177.</b> The Buddha: Sandha, practice the absorption
    (jhana) of a thoroughbred horse, not the absorption of an
    unbroken colt. And how is an unbroken colt absorbed? </p>
    <p>An unbroken colt, tied to the feeding trough, is absorbed
    with the thought, 'Barley grain! Barley grain!' Why is that?
    Because as he is tied to the feeding trough, the thought does
    not occur to him, 'I wonder what task the trainer will have
    me do today? What should I do in response?' Tied to the
    feeding trough, he is simply absorbed with the thought,
    'Barley grain! Barley grain!' </p>
    <p>In the same way, there are cases where an unbroken colt of
    a man, having gone to the wilderness, to the foot of a tree,
    or to an empty dwelling, dwells with his awareness overcome
    by sensual passion, obsessed with sensual passion. He does
    not discern the escape, as it actually is present, from
    sensual passion once it has arisen. Making that sensual
    passion the focal point, he absorbs himself with it, besorbs,
    resorbs, and supersorbs himself with it. </p>
    <p>He dwells with his awareness overcome by ill will...sloth
    and drowsiness... restlessness and anxiety...uncertainty,
    obsessed with uncertainty. He does not discern the escape, as
    it actually is present, from uncertainty once it has arisen.
    Making that uncertainty the focal point, he absorbs himself
    with it, besorbs, resorbs, and supersorbs himself with it. </p>
    <p>He is absorbed dependent on
    earth...liquid...fire...wind...the sphere of the infinitude
    of space...the sphere of the infinitude of
    consciousness...the sphere of nothingness...the sphere of
    neither perception nor non-perception...this world...the next
    world...whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained,
    sought after, pondered by the intellect. That is how an
    unbroken colt of a man is absorbed. </p>
    <p>And how is a thoroughbred absorbed? An excellent
    thoroughbred horse tied to the feeding trough, is not
    absorbed with the thought, 'Barley grain! Barley grain!' Why
    is that? Because as he is tied to the feeding trough, the
    thought occurs to him, 'I wonder what task the trainer will
    have me do today? What should I do in response?' Tied to the
    feeding trough, he is not absorbed with the thought, 'Barley
    grain! Barley grain!' The excellent thoroughbred horse
    regards the feel of the spur as a debt, an imprisonment, a
    loss, a piece of bad luck. </p>
    <p>In the same way, an excellent thoroughbred of a man,
    having gone to the wilderness, to the foot of a tree, or to
    an empty dwelling, dwells with his awareness not overcome by
    sensual passion, not obsessed with sensual passion. He

    <p>He dwells with his awareness not overcome by ill
    will...sloth and drowsiness... restlessness and

    it has arisen. </p>
    <p>He is absorbed dependent neither on earth, liquid, heat,
    wind, the sphere of the infinitude of space, the sphere of
    the infinitude of consciousness, the sphere of nothingness,
    the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception, this
    world, the next world, nor on whatever is seen, heard,
    sensed, cognized, attained, sought after, or pondered by the
    intellect -- and yet he is absorbed. And to this excellent
    thoroughbred of a man, absorbed in this way, the gods,
    together with Indra, the Brahmas, and Pajapati, pay homage

        you are absorbed.'</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Sandha: But in what way is the excellent thoroughbred of a
    man absorbed when he is absorbed...? </p>
    <p>The Buddha: There is the case, Sandha, where for an
    excellent thoroughbred of a man the perception (mental note
    or label) of earth with regard to earth has ceased to exist;
    the perception of liquid with regard to liquid...the
    perception of fire with regard to fire...the perception of
    wind with regard to wind...the perception of the sphere of
    the infinitude of space with regard to the sphere of the
    infinitude of space...the perception of the sphere of the

    <p><b>§ 182.</b> [On attaining the fourth level of jhana]
    there remains only equanimity: pure and bright, pliant,
    malleable and luminous. Just as if a skilled goldsmith or
    goldsmith's apprentice were to prepare a furnace, heat up a
    crucible, and, taking gold with a pair of tongs, place it in
    the crucible. He would blow on it periodically, sprinkle
    water on it periodically, examine it periodically, so that
    the gold would become refined, well-refined, thoroughly
    refined, flawless, free from dross, pliant, malleable and
    luminous. Then whatever sort of ornament he had in mind --
    whether a belt, an earring, a necklace, or a gold chain -- it
    would serve his purpose. In the same way, there remains only
    equanimity: pure and bright, pliant, malleable, and luminous.
    He [the meditator] discerns that 'If I were to direct
    equanimity as pure and bright as this toward the sphere of
    the infinitude of space, I would develop the mind along those
    lines, and thus this equanimity of mine -- thus supported,
    thus sustained -- would last for a long time. (Similarly with
    the spheres of the infinitude of consciousness, nothingness,
    and neither perception nor non-perception.)' </p>
    <p>He discerns that 'If I were to direct equanimity as pure
    and bright as this toward the sphere of the infinitude of
    space and to develop the mind along those lines, that would
    be fabricated. (Similarly with the spheres of the infinitude
    of consciousness, nothingness, and neither perception nor
    non-perception.)' He neither fabricates nor wills for the
    sake of becoming or un-becoming. This being the case, he is
    not sustained by anything in the world (does not cling to
    anything in the world). Unsustained, he is not agitated.
    Unagitated, he is totally unbound right within. He discerns
    that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done.
    There is nothing further for this world.' </p>
