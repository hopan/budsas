      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Never does man come to the end of his search into 
      the nature expecting to gain more things to fill his ever-wanting 
      storehouse. From the outset, he is doomed to face a world that tends to 
      reduce his ability as he recognizes his hands are too short and his feet 
      are too slow to catch up the swift flow of existence. Nature endows him 
      with a body as an effective instrument to enjoy the taste of life, but at 
      the same time it burdens him with a heavy load. To enjoy life he has to 
      feed the body. Hunger and thirst ceaselessly urge him to move. However, 
      never satisfactorily is hunger relieved and thirst quenched down. Now he 
      finds himself facing a reality that drives him to make prompt decision. 
      Drink up your fill before the rivulet runs dry. He had to choose this one 
      and forgo the others, either engaged in work or taking leisure. Working or 
      leisure, the world appears before him with its limitation in space and 
      time. Somehow, it draws a curve the two ends of which would set the 
      fragment of existence, the very instant of life. Every instant is marked 
      with the rising and falling of things, their appearance and disappearance. 
      The continuity of instant after instant constitutes the duration of life. 
      That where on the curve man should pin down his decision to optimize his 
      gain over loss depends on his store of knowledge about the world around 
      him. Nature appears to offer him, to the point of his observation, 
      infinite resources that would ever satisfy his wants. Nevertheless, being 
      sandwiched between time and space, he could not move at will to get what 
      he wanted at anytime. Resources appear to be infinite to his vision but 
      scarce within his reach. What he should do is to learn how to reasonably 
      allocate the resources.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Before learning how to do this, he is suggested 
      to learn what to know. He is convinced to know by whom this world was 
      created, and how it was created. Otherwise, human existence is supposedly 
      meaningless; life and death are by incident, irrationally and aimlessly. 
      If the Bible did not contain the book of Genesis, people would not know 
      what the face of the world might have been as they think of today, better 
      or rather worse. Nevertheless, such a question has been set aside by 
      Buddhists.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Once upon a time, a young monk named Māluṅkya[1] 
      thought he should challenged the Blessed-One to see if He knew or knew not 
      whether the world is or is not eternal; it is or is not infinite; whether 
      soul and body are identical; and so on. Let the Blessed-One declare He 
      knows if in fact He knows. And let the Blessed-One declare He knows not if 
      in fact He knows not. Otherwise, the young monk would deny the Buddha and 
      return to his worldly life. It is better to conduct a worldly life 
      enjoying sensual pleasures like every other ordinary person than to 
      observe ascetic disciplines without having answer to the questions 
      concerning the origin and nature of the world.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Much against his expectation was the Buddha’s 
      negative answer. On this very account, some might have accused Buddha of 
      trying to unsophisticatedly evade the problem; many others attributed to 
      Him a detestable agnosticism. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Instead of explaining how the world was created 
      and what it is for, the Buddha admonished the young ascetic not to waste 
      his time about the questions beyond the reach of human knowledge but 
      rather to concentrate his effort to know his actual conditions. He gave a 
      smile. A man was hit with a poisonous arrow. Time was not generous to him 
      with asking about where the arrow came from, what kind of wood it was made 
      of, and who had shot it. The most pressing importance for him to do first 
      of all was to plug out the poisonous arrow, treat the wound. Survival 
      first, the rest would be accomplished later.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">As your eyes have yet to be amplified with a 
      sophisticated tool such as a telescope, don’t be anxious to locate the 
      orbit of Pluto’s satellite. In addition, a telescope cannot be fabricated 
      with mere human labor, ignoring other materials, which require some amount 
      of capital to produce.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Although there is a saying that people do not 
      live merely with bread, there is a truth that on the edge of starvation he 
      might have died before he could learn to know how a bicycle was made. 
      Think of the majority of people in the poorest country of the world. 
      Trying to teach them how the universe has expanded, from the Big Bang or 
      anything else, rather than trying to teach them how to get food 
      successfully, not only makes fun of the problem but also exposes the 
      outrageous aspect of human life.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">In a Sutta,[2] while explaining to a brahmanic 
      priest the true meaning of, and how to celebrate, a great sacrifice, an 
      important ceremony of the Brahmanic religion then, the Buddha relates in 
      disguise a story of the past. Once, a king intended to hold a great 
      sacrifice for the benefit of his kingdom. He consulted the highest priest. 
      The latter gave him a homily on what to do first. The kingdom was then 
      suffering poverty and unrest, rife with robbers and rebels. If His Majesty 
      was thinking about raising tax and crushing those robbers and rebels by 
      force and death punishment, a number of them would be still at large and 
      go on devastating the kingdom. Yet there was an effective measure to 
      improve the situation. To those engaged in agriculture and husbandry, 
      supply them with seed. To those apt to do commerce, supply them with 
      capital to invest. To those tending to public servants, supply them with 
      wages. Should people be employed, robbery and rebellion would be reduced. 
      As long as the national treasure is abundant, people live in prosperity, 
      and a great sacrifice can be expected.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">As we have seen, economic growth is the basis for 
      social order and peace, hence its development including the expansion of 
      religious practice. This aspect in the Buddha’s teaching was very often 
      neglected, and the emphasis, if not excluded, was laid upon the ethical 
      behavior. Ethical perfection is, of course, the lofty goal of Buddhist 
      practice, but meditation can never be practiced by those who are starved 
      out.[3] This is implied in a Buddha’s saying: “All sentient beings are 
      subsisting on food.”[4] In modern view, this can be considered as an 
      economic background of Buddhism.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times"><B>II. WHAT TO PRODUCE: THE DOCTRINE OF NUTRIMENT</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Thus, there must be a Buddhist economics.[5] It 
      is not only of the kind that teaches how man should dhammically, that is, 
      legally and honestly, earn his living, but it also teaches how he could 
      make use of his gains for the benefit of his own and others. Accordingly, 
      it does not neglect the problem of production and consumption. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">It is commonplace to say the modern economics is 
      trying to tackle the problems of what, how and for whom to produce. Much 
      is focused on the production of goods, or to name it distinctively, goods 
      and services. These are but a general denomination of a variety of 
      articles produced for sale or for use.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Whether it is essential of economic studies or 
      not, it is out of controversy that what man in the first place and 
      ultimately tends to produce is the need for life, and what gives him 
      satisfaction. Economics may study how to optimally allocate scare 
      resources and how markets work for the allocation, and whatever 
      definitions there may be, if and only if human living exists. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Man, this complicated and sophisticated 
      composition of matter and spirit as commonly assumed, is the first motive 
      and final cause of every human activity. Practically, man needs material 
      food for the sustenance of his physical body and spiritual food, so to 
      say, for his spiritual development. Generally speaking, the modern 
      economics has as its object the contemporary man, the living organism that 
      has reached its relatively high, but, of course, not final evolution as it 
      is at the present day. However advanced may be his level throughout his 
      history of evolution, man likely started his life in embryo, which at the 
      very first moment of conception is but a lump of matter. The question if 
      human life begins with embryo is the controversial issue among religions 
      and ethics, economics unconcerned. Normally economists include this first 
      stage of human life in the first period in the two period model of 
      economy. For our particular purpose, we will deal with embryo and foetus 
      as independent consumer.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Basically man needs material food for his 
      material life. This begins at the first moment of conception until ending 
      up in death. Food needed in this condition of nutrition is of matter, 
      which is composed of primary elements universally found in all other 
      varieties of matter. Because at the first period of his life man was not 
      capable of production, so he lived on endowment economy. Economically he 
      was then borrower. What he had borrowed yesterday he had to pay today and 
      what is done to day will be retributed tomorrow: that is the law of action 
      and its retribution based upon the doctrine of karma. Man is a debtor of 
      his own and of others in the past and present. What should be taken in 
      consideration in this rergard is not merely quantitative but qualitative 
      as well.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">We suppose the doctrine of karma is well known to 
      those who have acquired a basic knowledge of Buddhism, so it is not 
      necessary to be dealt with in details here. Anyhow, it suggests that the 
      problem of consumption and savings can be treated on the foundation of&nbsp; 
      the doctrine of karma.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times"><B>III. FOR WHOM TO PRODUCE: LEVELS OF EXISTENCE</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Now, the question is set up: what does human 
      being need for its subsistence and development? In the first place, as a 
      sentient being it merely needs physical food. In its evolution, as an 
      animal it needs one more kind of food: contact food. To the higher level 
      of existence, as a human being it needs all four kinds of food: physical 
      food, contact food, mental food and consciousness food. It is said in 
      Sutta: “There are these four kinds of food for the subsistence of beings 
      who have taken birth or for the support of those in search of a place to 
      be born.&nbsp; Which four? Physical food, gross or refined; contact as the 
      second, mind and will the third, and consciousness the fourth.”[6]</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">If we examine the life of a sentient being from 
      its first moment of conception to the last point as death, its development 
      can be traced back from the time immemorial when the first living being 
      came about to the world until now. Within a limited span of life, a living 
      being is marked with its first existence as a mere germ of physical 
      material. It is differentiated from the other class of nonliving being by 
      the kind of material of which it is composed. Ultimately primary elements 
      are intangible, invisible. The differentiation of matter is due to the way 
      in which elements are distributed, arranged in the construction of 
      organism.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">In the first stage, supplied with physical 
      nutriment, the germ of physical material expands in proportion to the 
      amount of food consumed at a rate of growth. This process goes on while 
      sensory organs gradually develop. Up to a definite stage mind appears and 
      engages in actions like a speculator.[7] It accumulates data with the 
      cooperation of sensory organs, processes them, and converts them into 
      information. Based on this information, perception is brought to 
      operation. The latter gathers all information thus given to construct a 
      world that is conceived as reflecting the true reality. Nevertheless, the 
      image of the world is not taken once forever as a photograph. It ever 
      changes in quantity as well as in quality as sensory organs develop in 
      stable condition and operate more effectively in response to the demand of 
      mind and will. The image of the world is stored up as a positive ground on 
      which mind ascertains its existence and deploys its activities.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">In every stage of development, consciousness is 
      given rise immediately as soon as there is the interaction of external 
      object and internal sensory organ. But on the lower level, the appearance 
      of consciousness is too dim to collect a knowledge of the world. On this 
      level, consciousness is merely a blind will of subsistence. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">As sensory organs reach their maturity, the image 
      of the world is reflected clearer and more disctinctively, and the 
      knowledge about it is more rational, more synthetic. On the higher degree 
      of this progression, consciousness develops to self-consciousness, 
      recognizing the existence of the outer world as well as the existence of 
      its self. Consciousness as the fourth kind of food is needed for this 
      stage of evolution.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Thus, the evolution of beings depends on what 
      kind of food they consume. On the lowest level of existence, a living 
      being is hardly different from the vegetative state of life, and only the 
      physical food is needed. On a much higher level, in which a living being 
      is endowed in addition with the least sensory organs sufficient to detect 
      the danger from the external world, contact food is added. This evolution 
      can be tracked in the development of an animal, including a human being, 
      from the very first moment of conception to the instant when it is brought 
      to daylight. From then onward, for some species of animal the process of 
      evolution comes to a stop. Even to certain human beings whose sensory 
      organs are fully endowed, but for some unknown reason their mind cannot 
      reach beyond the sphere of animal.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Mental development depends on the accumulation of 
      experiences. If the processing of accumulation fails, the functioning of 
      sensory organs yields no good effect on mind. This means that facts as 
      mental food have not been supplied sufficiently, or the structure has 
      refused this kind of food. The third kind of food could be called food for 
      thought. It is converted into kind of energy which makes the mental 
      organization work, and consequently the social structure is motivated and 
      the civilization of makind is engendered. Food for civilization to be kept 
      going and developing is consciousness.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">&nbsp;What to produce is the first concern of 
      economics. Goods and services are produced to satisfy human wants. Among 
      other things having been created by God, the “dominion over the fish of 
      the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that 
      moveth upon the earth” was given to the first man. This means since the 
      time of Genesis, the material production, that is, to produce physical 
      food including clothing, and shelter, and the like, was marked as the main 
      occupation of human livelihood.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Accoding to Buddhist tradition, as related in the 
      Aggañña-sutta,[8] in the beginning human beings collected natural 
      resources for his food and clothing, “lived on a kind of naturally ripened 
      uncooked rice.” We can imagine that natural resources mentioned here 
      collected by the primitive men was nonstorable,[9] “What they collect in 
      the evening for evening meal will&nbsp; growth again and ripen in the 
      morning; what they collect in the morning for morning meal will growth 
      again and ripen in the evening.”[10] This was due partly to his lack of 
      technology and most essentially due to his lack of the idea of 
      accumulation. It is only up to a later definite stage of evolution that 
      human being began to engender in his mind this idea: “Why should I collect 
      rice in the evening for evening meal and in the morning for morning meal? 
      I would rather collect it once for two days.” And he did it. Soon this 
      goaded others into outdoing him. Thus the idea of accumulation entailed 
      speculation.[11] Eventually struggle among rivals within community was 
      aroused and the primitive society of mankind started a new turn engaged 
      into social conflict.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">It is easy to recognize the primitive man 
      mentioned in the above quotation from Sutta is far from the real one. But 
      in terms of economical treaty it might serve as a simple economic agent 
      with which a number of models, agent-based models for example, can be 
      built for the convenience of economic analysis. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">It is a matter of common sense to take the 
      primitive accumulation as being activated by human laziness. According to 
      the Buddhist theory of nutriment it was due to the growth of the demand 
      for food compatible with the development of human organs. In the first 
      stage of human living, fragmentedly physical food was needed, 
      collaboratively consumed by organs of olfaction, gustation and tactition. 
      In grown-ups, sight and hearing need enhancing for their abiltity to 
      perceive the external world, so more kinds of food must be supplied in 
      addition. As mind developed sufficiently to make decisions of what and how 
      resources should be collected for its agent’s benefit, man now was faced 
      with the limitation of time. He had to allocate his time optimally between 
      labor and leisure. He had to learn how to make choices.[12] In this regard 
      we involve both consumption and idleness in the leisure time. Consumption 
      is meant to signify enjoyment of goods and services produced by man’s 
      labor to satisfy his wants, while idleness implies enjoyment of those 
      given by nature. To higher levels of evolution, leisure time is thoroughly 
      dedicated to enjoyment of four kinds of food. Bread, and anything of the 
      kind, is consumed for sustaining biological body and the stable state of 
      inner organism. Seeing and hearing, sightseeing and listening to music for 
      instance, serve as contact food for the accumulation of experiences hence 
      enhancing the ability of judgment and making choices between the better 
      and the worse. The thinking and willing are fed with mental food, the 
      third kind, by virtue of which human action is taken off aiming at the 
      ultimate end of his destination. Moreover, his future depends on what he 
      is doing in the present. Economically speaking he must learn how to 
      allocate resources across time: how much time for work and consumption he 
      should optimally decide on today so that he would live a life of 
      contentment tomorrow. This lifetime budget constraint is drawn on the 
      substratum of life, that is, the continuum of consciousness, without which 
      no future time is conceived. The latter is irrigated with food termed as 
      consciousness which is marked with the notion of self.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">When the sensory organs reach their maturity for 
      sensation and perception, the balance of&nbsp; food consumption, so far 
      having been tilted to the physical one, now begins to lean toward the 
      others, the first being contact. The enjoyment of seeing and hearing in 
      leisure time passively impressed by nature is no longer sufficient to 
      satisfy the wants of accumulation of experiences as energy resources for 
      motivating mental structure to work. Materials serving as contact food 
      must be produced as items of goods. All the same, physical food needed for 
      sustaining biological body cannot be reduced. He has, therefore, either to 
      double working time or improve his skill in production. The primitive man 
      mentioned in the above-cited Sutta doubled his product, but there is no 
      hint of how he had managed to do so. It makes sense to suppose that along 
      with the full-fledged development of sensory organs he had made a 
      considerable progress in acquiring technological knowledge which enabled 
      him to increase the quantity of his product.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times"><B>IV. HOW TO PRODUCE</B> </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Though mystified with the form of legend related 
      in sort of vernacular by the Sutta, some economic models can in fact be 
      constructed based on the primitive agent. He had as his counterpart in 
      another system of economy Robinson Crusoe[13] who started his living on a 
      deserted island where in his early days of making a living he was endowed 
      merely with his own labor using his hands and what given by nature 
      circumscribed by his environment. Goods produced by the mix of labor and 
      nature-given elements are naturally nonstorable. Without having aid of any 
      other tools than his own hands, he had to spend most of his time for 
      productivity. At the same&nbsp; time, he also needed a shelter to protect 
      him from danger and damage likely engendered by environment. Within 
      limited total hours of day, even if rationally and proportionally divided 
      between working and leisure – of course he needed a rest or recreation 
      after having toiled –, he was forced to reduce the hours spent on food 
      collection as to spend on building a hut. Unconsciously he constructed in 
      mind the production possibilities frontier which allocates his scarce 
      resourses optimally.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">The metaphor of Robinson Crusoe enables us to 
      reason out the increase in productivity by the primitive man – doubling 
      the quantity of rice collected sufficient for two days consumption instead 
      of just one day. Given the production function, other things are held 
      constant – land, and labor in the present context remains unchanged–, a 
      change in technology will alter the output.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">In this connection, based on Buddhist theory of 
      four kinds of food, the demand for consumption goods as physical food – 
      supposed in the long-run economy – &nbsp;when reaching the last unit of its 
      marginal utility will be held constant over a period of time and then fall 
      down along with the decay of human life which is subject to the law of the 
      material world. The other three, in the first place fundamentally 
      considered as mere complements to physical food, will be diminished as the 
      body, which they have as support, decays. But in the ultimate sense, 
      contact is meant to signify the threefold combination of consciousness as 
      subject, its corresponding object and sensory organs as its support. 
      Accordingly, whenever consciousness exists contact is currently working. 
      In the material world, sensory organs are full-fledged only at a definite 
      stage after sentient being was given birth. On account of this, their 
      development is subject to the physical law, and their activity will fade 
      as their support is falling into decay. If the support is unsteady, the 
      structure of mind will be unstable and the activity of consciousness is 
      weakening. Nevertheless, the state of sense contact could be sublimated by 
      the appropriate practice of which meditation is the most effective. Just 
      as sanitary food is beneficial for the health of body, aesthetic works as 
      contact food – food for sight such as paintings and food for hearing such 
      as music and the like –&nbsp; are helpful to the soundness of mind. 
      Relying on the soundness of mind, mental structure operates in an 
      equilibrium state to absorb more sublimate food supplied through sensory 
      organs and converts it into information. Greed, hatred, delusion are 
      noxious food for mind and information converted from data detained with 
      these defilements will form false judgments and give a distorted image of 
      the world.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Modern economics by definition yet controversial 
      is dealing with the production of goods and services to satisfy human 
      wants in terms of material resources. Human wants, however, are unlimited, 
      and natural rescources are exhaustible; he is, therefore, permanently 
      facing the problems of scarcity.[14] </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">According to Buddhist psychological view, living 
      being is a substrum (upādāna) on which mind and body are supported, with 
      which and by means of which fuel for life and action is supplied. 
      Terminologically, this fuel is named as taṇhā – craving or thirst or 
      hunger for existence. Directed by the conception of a self and subject to 
      a world that is perpetually inclined to decay, a living being is depressed 
      by the thirst for fuel to light up its existence and the expectation of 
      the moment of life to come.[15] Being conscious of living is having a mind 
      in becoming, expecting to get a more satisfactory state of affairs against 
      the current situation which is ever marked with uneasiness.[16] 
      Nevertheless, under the spell of the law of impermanence, spurred by the 
      thirst for life, man incessantly runs like a thirty horse in moor after a 
      mirage he thinks a stream of water. The more it is seen just a distance, 
      the farther it appears to move away. Never would the thirst be satisfied. 
      This urges man to act more, to move forward to look for further 
      satisfaction. But limited by environment and the biological nature of his 
      body in addition to the scarcity of resources, man never reaches the end 
      of his satisfaction.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">In the story of the primitive man as mentioned 
      above, it is said that as people vied with each other for gathering rice 
      to store up for the future consumption, the so-called naturally ripened 
      uncooked rice disappeared and a new kind of rice that required man’s labor 
      to produce replaced it. In the present context, it is understandable that 
      his double collection of rice was not simply due to his want of having 
      more time for tomorrow’s leisure, rather in fact it is meant to signify a 
      primitive act of saving&nbsp; against an uncertain future, for nobody knew 
      for sure what would happen to him or to his environment. Because he could 
      not reduce the quantity of goods currently consumed such as food and 
      housing and the like, he had to increase product. In comparison with the 
      situation of Robinson Crusoe as much preferred by economists, in which all 
      that he could get in hands were elements given by nature, but no tools 
      were available other than his own labor to produce things he needed to 
      satistfy his even few wants, he was forced to make a choice of either 
      consuming to his fill all he had gotten today or reducing a portion as 
      saving for tomorrow; in the case of the primitive man, saving was not made 
      by reducing today consumption for tomorrow use, but increasing the 
      quantity of output by improving his productivity. In the present context, 
      it is acceptable that in Buddhist view as stated in the above-cited Sutta 
      that originally, before any model of economy could be imagined, when 
      facing the limitation of environment, and the scarcity of external means 
      to satisfy his wants, man saw the increase in product as his best choice. 
      The creation of mankind is not once forever; but is an evolution instead, 
      ranging from microbiology to as human being. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Another detail in the Sutta is worth notice. The 
      concurrence of speculation caused the disappearance of the primordial 
      food, originating the scarcity which required men much more labor to 
      tackle. &nbsp;This is the crucial point which is easily overlooked in the 
      Buddhist view on the approach to the problem of scarcity. As we have seen, 
      although there is no explicit explanation on the part of the Sutta as 
      cited above, its implication is clear enough for us to recognize the fact 
      that as mankind has made progress to a higher level in his evolution here 
      possibly embodied in a lifetime wants have increased while material 
      resources have remained as they have been, and man has had to develop his 
      technological knowledge to increase production to meet quantity demanded.
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">The corollary proposition that follows is that 
      material consumption has its marginal utility, but human wants compatible 
      with far higher evolution have no limit, therefore human must manage to 
      reduce working time for increasing material goods so that more time for 
      feeding mental structure and consciousness stratum may be spared. As a 
      logical consequence, it is not the mere richness of material quantity 
      which may be valued to some extent as economic growth, but the quality of 
      spiritual consumption supplied with food for mental structure and 
      consciousness stratum that demonstrates the social progress and the rise 
      in standard of living. This does not mean, however, material production 
      should be neglected; in contrast, it must give support to spiritual 
      consumption. Accordingly, material growth must be in proportion with 
      spiritual development. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">As a matter of fact, in dealing with the problem 
      of scarcity, it is not correct to state as some economists do that 
      Buddhist approach is “to alter the nature and level of wants… St. Francis 
      of Assisi and Buddhist monks shared a desire for a more meaningful life by 
      reducing wants or desires for material possessions. In the secular, 
      industrialized world, this approach is not often mentioned.”[17] </FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Nevertheless, the criticism is not ungrounded. 
      Eveidence for its justification can be found in the historical fact that 
      for many centuries most of countries in Asia under influence of Buddhism 
      failed to eradicate poverty and fell behind in comparision with the West. 
      Buddhism, judged on the background of its assumedly pessimistic view of 
      life, was likely to blame for the Asian backwardness.[18] That “they can 
      model their economic development plans in accordance with modern 
      economics”[19] is not apt to justify their failure, rather than to 
      emphasize that “the destiny of modern civilization as developed by the 
      white peoples in the last two hundred years is inseparably linked with the 
      fate of economic science.”[20] Needless to say, that “economic science” is 
      modelled on the frame of western mentality. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Notwithstanding the material achievement as 
      currently seen in the West since the time of colonialism up to today 
      antiterrorist war, the western civilization somehow proved its superiority 
      over the eastern economic behavior. Its technological progress has 
      improved the standard of living. However, this does not mean people are 
      happier. Instead, the amazing achievement of science and technology is 
      pushing human kind to the brink of mass destruction.[21]</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times"><B>V. PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION</B> </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">To live means exist and become. Existence, 
      firstly biological one on which mental structure operates, is sustained 
      with external materials given by nature. It is due to the will for 
      existence that urges living beings to act as to make a living. It is a 
      chain of ever changing events, prone to change and become something other 
      than its current state, for better or for worse. Being perpetually 
      threatened by the danger inherent in surroundings, conscious of its power 
      to act circumscribed by its own body, facing a scarcity of external 
      factors on which its satisfaction depends, a living organism evolves into 
      a structure suitable for accumulation of past events as food for will and 
      thought to form the expectation of a better future, and to judge and make 
      choice of what is good and helpful. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Dealing with an unknown and uncertain future, man 
      proceeds to speculation, accumulating as much as possible whatsoever 
      within his reach. Things to be stored for future use require a minimum 
      quantity and preferable quality. Man is not content merely with gifts 
      gratuitously dispensed by nature; he is apt to re-make them so that they 
      could be suitable for his today consumption and accumulation for tomorrow. 
      Thus, to live, in a sense, is to act. Action implies production. </FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Among other definitions of economics, I would 
      like to refer to one that would seem fit for contemporary capitalism as it 
      states “economics as a science that studies the production of wealth under 
      a system of division of labor…”[22] In this definition the importance is 
      attached to the production of wealth, for wealth in the present context is 
      the accumulation of all material goods produced by man’s labor capable of 
      satisfying to some extent human needs. Moreover, it is wealth that 
      enhances one’s position and authority in social relations.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">In a Sutta, [23] it is stated that in ancient 
      time, or in the era when people reach the legendary highest development, 
      there were only three varieties of need: desire, hunger and old age. As 
      time elapsed, when human society was getting into fierce conflict, more 
      varieties of need appeared. This statement gives a general view on the 
      evolution of mankind, from the simple form of life to the complicated one. 
      The notion of wealth is conceived as human beings are conscious of their 
      existence as a self that acts as a master over its surroundings. According 
      to the Esukārī-sutta,[24] in the time of Buddha there existed a 
      classification of wealth under four categories with which social hierachy 
      was determined. Accordingly, a man’s wealth was all he had in his 
      possession; it is means by which he earned a living. This conception of 
      wealth suggests the notions of production and consumption as are likely 
      understood to some extent by modern economics. Nonetheless, Buddha 
      promoted the supreme Law as the ultimate wealth that human being was 
      recommended to seek. The Supreme Law thus mentioned consists of seven 
      factors or constituents of wealth; they are faith, virtue, shame of sin, 
      fear of sin, learning, generosity and wisdom,[25] of which the sixth, 
      generosity or liberty, attained by generously giving up in practicing 
      charity, implies the possession of material goods, for one would give up 
      to others only what one, a wealthy man or instance, had in possession. 
      Accordingly, these constituents of wealth should be regarded as factors of 
      production of goods of highest quality. Nonetheless, most economic writers 
      would be reluctant to approve such likely idealistic a definition of 
      wealth, for in their assumption by wealth are meant “both real assets (a 
      house, automobiles, television sets, and other durables) and financial 
      assets (cash, savings accounts, stocks, bonds, insurance policies, 
      pensions) that households own.”[26] </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">In general, things, of which the causal 
      connection with human needs is recognized and which men have power to 
      direct to their satisfaction, are conceived as goods.[27] Goods thus 
      characterized implies the meaning of wealth.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Suffice it to say in this implication of wealth 
      that in the ordinary sense all human action is aimed at satisfying his 
      wants and needs. In hope of reaching this end he has to gather all that 
      are thought beneficial to him. They constitutes his wealth. In other 
      words, men make an effort and do labor to produce a variety of goods for 
      current consumption and in expectation of a better future. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">As we have seen, it is commonplace to distinguish 
      between material goods that achieve one’s worldly satisfactions and higher 
      goods that serve as means of attainment of ideal satisfactions. Because 
      economics deals with only things in this world, it follows as a logical 
      consequence that only material consumption is concerned.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Buddha, in fact, never denied the need of 
      material goods consumed as requisites for sustaining human biological 
      existence that serves as a basis for higher development. In the Sutta of 
      Debtlessnes, [28] He recognizes four kinds of well-being: the enjoyment of 
      having, the enjoyment of making use of wealth, the enjoyment of being 
      debtless, and the enjoyment of being blameless. Here a man enjoys having 
      righteous wealth righteously gained through his effort and labor; he 
      enjoys rationally consuming and making merit righteous wealth righteously 
      accumulated; he experiences joy to own no debt; and he experiences joy as 
      thinking of the blamelessness of his actions performed with body, speech 
      and thought.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">In this passage, the conditons of well-being are 
      by no means improved and increased merely by gaining and accumulating a 
      quantity of wealth even though “righteously gained through one’s effort 
      and labor.” Wealth is beneficial only if it brings men enjoyment and 
      happiness with both material consumption and spiritual development.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">In another Sutta,[29] once a man came to Buddha 
      and asked for the teaching in compliance with which could live happily, in 
      peace and prosperity in the very present life and in the future as well, 
      those who&nbsp; were “householders, enjoying worldly pleasures, being in 
      bondage to wives and children…” The Blessed One then offered him in the 
      first place four conditions that lead to the present bliss. They were 
      industry, protection, good friends and right livelihood. Industry means he 
      makes a living in pursuing a career, and he is good at his occupation, 
      practicing it assiduously, tirelessly. Wealth gained with such industry 
      should be safely guarded in such way that it would not be taken away by 
      thieves, destroyed by fire, swept away by flood, or going bankrupt with 
      spoiled children. Had these two conditions been fulfilled, wealth would 
      have been accumulated and increased only in a favorable environment, with 
      good social relationship. In addition, at last, the household has to hold 
      a balance between income and expenditure.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Thus, in brief, economical behavior is 
      instructed. In production, industry or assiduity is emphasized. Exertion, 
      energetic, industrious, assiduous (viriya, uṭṭhāna, padhāna, etc.), 
      sometimes can be understood as describing the same state of mind or 
      consciousness, though their psychological activities are of a minor 
      difference. However, in general, they often express the most important 
      element in practice, namely vigilance (appamāda). Buddha said: “Vigilance 
      is the way to Deathless. Indolence is the way to Death.”[30] </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Negligence, carelessness, indolence, laziness: 
      these are the inertia of mind or consciousness. It awakens in men a 
      disclination to work. Economists might just as well call it leisure versus 
      labor. As it should be in this context to quote Mises[31]: “Leisure, other 
      things being equal, preferred to travail.” That is, by nature men have an 
      inclination to enjoy more time used for leisure. Working to him is a must 
      only when he chooses to increase material goods to satisfy his wants and 
      needs. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Nonetheless, strictly speaking, leisure is not 
      negligence or laziness as it appears to be. As it is defined by 
      economists, leisure is a category of consumer’s goods that can be measured 
      in terms of units of time.[32] As combined with comsumption goods it forms 
      a bundle for consumers to make choices; for leisure by this definition 
      means any time spent not working in the labor market. Accordingly, as a 
      worker tries to increase his income, in the case that other things are 
      equal, i.e. other variables in the production function are held constant, 
      he has to increase the expenditure of labor, that means he should reduce 
      the time spent on leisure. Thus, labor is the opportunity cost of leisure.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">With the aid of technological progress, today 
      worker can rise the productivity of labor that yields higher wage rate 
      without curtailing time for leisure. His standard of living is increased, 
      and his income is maximized; he has both wealth and leisure to enjoy the 
      pleasures of life. This is a feature of the mordern civilization which is 
      dubbed as that of material consumption worked out on the western model of 
      economy. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">It is, however, unjustified to blame the West for 
      the unrest of the today world only on account of its material 
      achievements; for the inclination to enjoying sensuous pleasures is 
      inherent in every sentient being. The satisfaction of it should first be 
      sought in the material factors that constitutes physical food as stated in 
      the doctrine of nutriment. Hankering after sensuous pleasures keeps living 
      beings on the track of carnal appeal, incessantly seeking for material 
      objects to gratify the demanding body. In a Sutta,[33] Buddha likened 
      material consumption to the child-eating of a couple. Once a couple 
      bringing with their only son crossed a desert. Halfway through, their 
      travel rations ran out, and they were driven to consent to kill and 
      sparingly eat the only son. As they were eating their only son, they 
      lamented over him. The simile reveals the marginal utility in material 
      consumption. Things, like physical food, here composed of material 
      elements, are supposedly needed for the removal of a human being’s hunger 
      or thirst, his felt uneasiness. In proceeding with consumption of one kind 
      of subjectively homogenous food, as one more unit is added, the marginal 
      utility of good consumed is dininished; up to a point, as for the last 
      unit, the marginal utility is negative and no more good consumed is 
      needed. However, this does not mean the saturation of material enjoyment 
      is reached. Man’s longing for sensuous pleasures is never satiated. As a 
      rule, the total utility of a good consumed is treated with its 
      quantitativeness; but to a consumer its qualitativeness – hence its 
      subjectivity, should not be neglected. Time of consumption is as well a 
      factor that affects the change in the total utility. One more unit of time 
      augmented lessens the favor with enjoyment. A substitution of daily disk 
      is desirable. The fact is that as the supply of one thing is full while 
      desire for enjoying it remains insatiable, another is appealed for 
      substitution. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Economists are normally concerned with the 
      problem of overproduction – whether it is relative and causes depression, 
      but they have paid no attention to the problem of overconsumption. The 
      effect we call over-consumption could be compared to people, albeit being 
      full, continuing to eat excessively to their obesity. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Buddha recognises four requisites: food, 
      clothing, housing, medicine. They are of material elements and classified 
      under physical nutriment. The need for them is not unlimited, but the want 
      or desire for their enjoyment is somewhat unconstrained. Almost all human 
      production is concentrated on the productivity of material goods. Economic 
      growth is exclusively based on the quantity of goods and services that 
      have been produced for the sake of the satisfaction of meterial 
      consumption. Any incentive that encourages consumption, thus makes 
      increase in quantity of demand, </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">This concentration on material production and 
      consumption, lacking other kinds of nutriment – that we call mental or 
      spiritual ones – needed &nbsp;for an ultimate evelution of mankind, has caused 
      the disparity between bodily and mental growth. Today with the wonderful 
      progress of science, and somewhat miraculous accomplishment of technology, 
      people know a lot of how matter works, yet their knowledge of how mental 
      structure is composed and which kind of food is to be taken, is lamentably 
      narrow. Dietetics would advise to people as to what to be eaten is 
      beneficial to health and against what is noxious, but for mental health, 
      little is warned against detriment. Adultery, rape, drug traffic, 
      violence, a myriad of social disorders; all these symptoms of social 
      obesity are in fact the outcome of the disparity of economic development.
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Economic growth of the world today has risen the 
      standard of living of mankind in general to a considerable level. 
      Nonetheless, the overproduction and overconsumption entail the inevitable 
      inequality in the distribution of wealth on the world scale. The cause and 
      effect of this mal-distribution has been much studied and analysed among 
      economists, and I suppose that I have no special contribution to the 
      estimation. Nonetheless, it is advisable in this concern to makes some 
      references to the Buddha’s instructions on the current issue.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Once,[34] Buddha gave householder Anāthapiṇḍika 
      instruction on five conditions to accumulate wealth:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">1. The householder, using the wealth righteously 
      earned through his effort and labor, enyoys himself with pleasure, 
      benefits his parantes and family, living rightly with pleasures.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">2. He benefits his friends and associates from 
      wealth that has been righteously accumulated.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">3. He keeps safe the wealth that has been 
      honestly gathered, warding off&nbsp; from fire, flood, thieves, from being 
      dissipated by depraved heirs, and confisticated by the king.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">4. Using his righteous wealth, he performs five 
      oblations: oblation to relatives, to guests, to the dead, to the king 
      (taxation), and to gods.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">&nbsp;5<SPAN LANG="en-us">.</SPAN> Using his righteous 
      wealth, he accumulates merits for the future life by giving to priests, to 
      charity.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">In another Sutta,[35] Buddha instructed a young 
      householder to rationally optimize his income by dividing it into four 
      portions: One portion used for his wants; two portions spent on 
      business,[36] and the fourth kept away for times of need.[37] In more 
      details as stated in the corresponding Sutta translated in Chinese 
      Āgamas,[38] two additional portions are added: one for buiding shrines and 
      the sixth for construction of monasteries.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">It is interesting to take notice in the Chinese 
      translation of Āgama in which the role of god worshipping shrines and 
      monasteries in Ancient India is to be matched with today’s economical and 
      social institutions. They do not imply the meaning of religion as we 
      understand nowadays. Monasteries at the time of Buddha were converted 
      almost pleasure-grounds or parks orginally owned by kings or queens, or 
      nobles, or the wealthy; later they were dedicated to religious or 
      sectarian groupes for their preaching and practising. Religious or 
      doctrinal debates sometimes took place among current sects involving 
      Buddhism. At those places, not only were religious dogmas taught but many 
      other branches of knowledges also. Oftentimes, subjects chatted about 
      among defferent communions were denounced in Buddhist canon as futile, 
      useless, or a mere waste of time.[39] Generally speaking, their roles were 
      kind of cutural and educational establishments where new thoughts and even 
      technological knowledge were from there spread and transmitted. The 
      dedication to religious purposes of a portion of the disposal income of a 
      household as instructed by Buddha is to be taken as a contribution to the 
      cultural and educational activities, kind of an investment in human 
      capital. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times"><B>VI. CONCLUSION</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">So far we have dealt with some aspects that can 
      be considered as the Buddhist foundation of economics. There are many left 
      to be discussed. Generally speaking, writings concerning the problem were 
      mostly focused on the moral issues and blamed for the situation of the 
      world today. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Many writers on Buddhist economics criticise Adam 
      Smith for his theorem of the “invisible hand” according to which if 
      individual behaves on the basis his own interest then social benefits will 
      be promoted. To some extent, this is not a normative theory, but a 
      positive one. &nbsp;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">The fact that can not be denied is that this 
      sefl-interest, or more exactly selfishness, has been the motive for the 
      economic growth that has been longed for by almost countries outside 
      Europe and her scions. As Smith may have affirmed, had individual’s 
      self-interest not been motivated, no economic development would be made. 
      It is accepted in the theory of general equilibrium that competitive 
      markets are adjusted among themselves under the effect of the interaction 
      between buyers and sellers, households and firms. The interaction is 
      brought about&nbsp; as partners in competitve markets are trying to do the 
      best, to gain the most profit they can. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">In order to have a closer look at the picture, 
      let’s put the situation into Keynes’s words: “It does not count the cost 
      of the struggle, but looks only to the benefits of the final result which 
      are assumed to be permanent. The object of life being to crop the leaves 
      off the branches up to the greatest possible height, the likeliest way of 
      achieving this end is to leave the giraffes with the longest necks to 
      starve out those whose necks are shorter.”[40] As a logical consequence, 
      it is needless to say about the outcome of this pattern of competitive 
      economy that it on one hand motivates craving for profit as incentive for 
      material achievement by means of which people’s standard of living has 
      been considerably improved – despite the unjust distribution of wealth, 
      and on the other hand it entices humans to manufacture unimaginably lethal 
      weapons and innumerable apparatuses of exploitation and oppression. </FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Thus, the root causes of economic growth, for 
      better or worse as seen today, are entangled with greed, hate and 
      delusion. The elimination of these three poisions is the ultimate goal of 
      Buddhist life. Nonetheless, selfishness associated with evil root-causes 
      as revealed in the profit maximization, if Buddhist psychological attitude 
      is to be taken, is the driving force of every human action. Based on the 
      doctrine of nutriment, as the biological body keeps subsisting even after 
      the saint has attained the state of destroying the evil root-causes, four 
      kinds of food remain required until the saint enters Nirvana as the body 
      composed of five aggregates comes to a total disintegration. In this 
      perspective, a certain economic system still exists as to supply him the 
      requisites. But Buddha never taught anything that goes far beyond the 
      reach of human capacity. To those who choose to follow the path that leads 
      to the ultimate liberation, to the attainment of Nirvana, He instructs the 
      pratice of the absolute renunciation of worldly pleasures. To those who 
      are bound up with sense pleasures, He gives the teaching of mundane life 
      so that they might live in peace and happiness in the very present life, 
      as well as in the future. The teaching for the latter is simple: 
      generosity and virtue. Generosity here consists of offering to monks and 
      giving to the poor. To be able to practice generosity, he must possess a 
      certain amount of wealth.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Thus, economic behavior of a lay Buddhist is a 
      purposeful action aimed at gathering tangible wealth for material 
      comsumption and accumulating merits for the future life. Merit by 
      canonical definition is profitable deeds that are good for the actor 
      himself and for others in the present as well as in the future. In 
      relation to this purposeful action, the ground for increase in wealth of a 
      lay Buddhit is said to be comprised of ten items: land, capital, children, 
      servants, cattle, faith, virtue, learning, giving and wisdom.[41] 
      Accordingly, conditions for economic growth must be a balance of material 
      consumption and spiritual development. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="VU Times">Nonenetheless, Buddhist economics, if any, is 
      feasable only on the condition that an individual’s goal in this life must 
      be established and his deeds are directed with virtue; no matter if the 
      theory of selfishness or profit motive is in question. In this respect, 
      the Buddha’s teaching related to the right livelihood[42] is expected to 
      contribute a good deal of leading principles for economic studies.&nbsp; </FONT>
