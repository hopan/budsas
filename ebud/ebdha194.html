        </b><font face="Times New Roman">
        <p>Asoka Weeraratna was a man of vision who had the drive and stamina to
        translate his vision into fact. He once told me that his favourite
        saying of the Buddha was, &quot;Do not become discouraged and give up,
        and do not rest satisfied with partial achievements.&quot; He himself
        took this piece of advice to heart. Whenever he set himself a goal, he
        did not merely dream about it and sing praises to its glory. Rather, he
        worked with incredible foresight and energy to make the goal a reality.</p>
        <p>Because he followed these guidelines, Asoka Weeraratna's life was
        crowned by three great achievements: the establishment of the German
        Dharmaduta Society in Sri Lanka; the founding of the Berlin Buddhist
        Vihara in Germany; and the creation of the Nissarana Vanaya Hermitage at
        Mitirigala.</p>
        <p>Already in the 1950s, he foresaw the potential for establishing
        Buddhism in the West, and to make his own contribution to the westward
        movement of the Dhamma, in 1952 he founded the German Dharmaduta
        Society. He started the Society in the back room of the family shop,
        though later it moved to premises purchased with funds he acquired
        through a zealous fund-raising drive.</p>
        <p>Asoka realized that if Buddhism was to send down roots in Germany, it
        was not enough to set up a base for German Buddhist missions here in Sri
        Lanka. He saw the need to have a Buddhist centre right in the heart of
        Germany itself. Thus he personally searched for suitable premises
        throughout Germany, and he found the ideal site in the lovely Frohnau
        district of Berlin. The place he discovered was Das Buddhistische Haus,
        an old Buddhist compound built by Paul Dahlke in 1924. Under his
        initiative the German Dharmaduta Society purchased the compound,
        renovated it, and in 1957 brought it back to life as the Berlin Buddhist
        Vihara. In the same year, Asoka Weeraratna organized the first Buddhist
        mission to Germany, led by three Sri Lankan Bhikkhus accompanied by
        himself. From that time to the present, monks from Sri Lanka and
        elsewhere have lived at the Berlin Vihara, helping to maintain a
        Theravada presence in Germany.</p>
        <p>Asoka Weeraratna later turned his attention to the construction of
        the Nissarana Vanaya Hermitage at Mitirigala, which became one of Sri
        Lanka's most respected meditation monasteries. He equipped the monastery
        with all the facilities conducive to the meditative life, found an
        accomplished meditation master, Ven. Matara Sri Gnanarama Mahathera, to
        direct the meditation training, and then, his mission accomplished, he
        himself entered the Buddhist order under the name Ven. Dhammanisanthi
        Thera. Even by establishing Nissarana Vanaya, Asoka continued to make
        Buddhism available to Westerners, for the hermitage has accommodated
        Western monks resident in Sri Lanka since 1977.</p>

        Theras</font></p>
        </b><font face="Times New Roman">
        <p>I myself first met Asoka in the early 1980s, when he was known as
        Ven. Dhammanisanthi. I immediately felt a close bond with him through
        his commitment to disseminating Buddhism in Germany. Though I am not
        German myself, my spiritual mentor was the great German scholar-monk
        Ven. Nyanaponika Mahathera, with whom I lived at the Forest Hermitage
        for twelve years. Ven. Nyanaponika and his teacher, Ven. Nyanatiloka
        Mahathera, also German, always had a keen interest in the spread of
        Buddhism in their native country. In this respect they shared a common
        vision with Asoka, which they expressed by their support for the German
        Dharmaduta Society. Ven. Nyanatiloka served as the first patron of the
        Society during the early 1950s, and through the years Ven. Nyanaponika
        was always ready to give advice. Before he left for Germany in 1982 to
        take up residence at the Berlin Vihara, Ven. Dhammanisanthi came to the
        Forest Hermitage in Udawattakele, Kandy to meet Ven. Nyanaponika. The
        two monks spent several hours, spread over two days, discussing
        prospects for the spread of Buddhism in Germany. I still recall that the
        discussion presented an interesting contrast between Ven.
        Dhammanisanthi's enthusiastic optimism and Ven. Nyanaponika's pragmatic
        realism and restraint.</p>

        </b><font face="Times New Roman">
        <p>The topic of this seminar, &quot;The Necessity for Promoting Buddhism
        in Europe,&quot; is quite appropriate for commemorating Ven.
        Dhammanisanthi, and reminds us of his life's mission of trying to bring
        the Sasana to the West. The topic is also very timely, for the
        opportunity for disseminating Buddhism in the West is much more ample
        today than it was fifty years ago when the German Dharmaduta Society was
        born. At the same time, however, we should not assume that Buddhism is
        barely known in Europe and has to be introduced almost from scratch. To
        the contrary, in the past two decades public awareness of Buddhism in
        the West has increased sharply. In many Western countries today Buddhism
        is the fastest growing religion. In North America, Western Europe, and
        Australia-New Zealand, hundreds of Buddhist centres have sprung up
        almost overnight, offering teachings and meditation retreats even in
        remote regions. Thus the challenge we face is not that of discussing how
        to introduce Buddhism to Europe as though it were an utterly unfamiliar
        creature, but of discovering how to promote the healthy growth of a
        Buddhism already sending down roots into European soil.</p>
        <p>I will deal with my topic in three major parts. <i>First</i>, I will
        present a short survey of the historical development of Buddhism in
        Europe. This will necessarily be oversimplified and thus inadequate, but
        my aim is not so much to lay out all the facts as to show how Buddhism
        has arrived at its present stage of development in the West. <i>Second</i>,
        I will raise the question why Buddhism, at just this particular time, is
        exerting such a strong appeal on Westerners. Then, in the <i>third</i>
        place, I will briefly discuss a few special problems we face in trying
        to make our own Theravada form of Buddhism accessible to the West as a
        living and relevant tradition.</p>

        Historical Overview</font></p>
        </b><font face="Times New Roman">
        <p>I divide the history of the Western engagement with Buddhism into
        three major phases. These phases are not totally discrete, for they
        intersect and overlap, but the threefold division provides a useful way
        of determining general trends.</p>
        </font><b>
        <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Phase I: The Discovery
        of Buddhism</font></p>
        </b><font face="Times New Roman">
        <p>Phase I consisted in the academic study of Buddhist texts, aimed at
        discerning the broad contours of Buddhist history and doctrine. This
        project took place during the peak of the colonial period, when European
        countries were busy subjugating Asian peoples and incorporating their
        nations into their hungry empires. In many cases European interest in
        Buddhism was bound up with the Christian missionary enterprise of
        converting the native populations to Christianity.</p>
        <p>Although reports about Asian Buddhist beliefs and practices had been
        drifting back to Europe since the thirteenth century, a clear picture of
        Buddhism as a unitary whole did not take shape in Europe until the
        middle of the nineteenth century, just a little more than 150 years ago.
        Before then, the sundry reports that had reached scholars in Europe were
        generally haphazard, inaccurate, and conjectural, if not utterly
        fantastic. The first person to comprehend Buddhism as a unitary
        tradition and establish its historical origins was the brilliant French
        philologist Eugene Burnouf. Burnouf had studied Pali, Sanskrit, and
        Tibetan manuscripts that had been sent to him in Paris from the East.
        Based on these texts, with barely no other clues, he wrote his 600-page
        tome, <i>Introduction to the History of Indian Buddhism</i> (1844), in
        which he traced in detail Indian Buddhist history and surveyed its
        doctrines and texts. Though later generations of scholars have greatly
        expanded upon Burnouf's work and filled in many missing pieces, they
        regard as essentially accurate the outline of Indian Buddhism he
        proposed in his groundbreaking study.</p>
        <p>In the decades following Burnouf, there appeared throughout Europe a
        galaxy of brilliant scholars who opened up the treasures locked away in
        all the different branches of Buddhism. These scholars fall into three
        main schools. The scholars of the &quot;Anglo-Germanic School&quot;
        focused on the Pali tradition. Their work emanated from the Pali Text
        Society, founded by T.W. Rhys Davids, and their ranks included Caroline
        Rhys Davids, Oldenberg, Woodward, Hare, and Horner; the Danish scholars
        Trenckner, Fausboll, and Anderson; and the Swede Helmer Smith. The
        &quot;Franco-Belgian School&quot; investigated Indian Buddhism both
        Hinayana and Mahayana in Sanskrit, Tibetan, and Chinese texts; its
        luminaries were de la Valle Poussin, Sylvain Levy, and Lamotte. The
        &quot;Russian School&quot; -- represented by Stcherbatsky, Rosenberg,
        and Obermiller -- concentrated on scholastic Indian Buddhism as
        preserved especially in Tibetan texts. Although these scholars usually
        remained reticent about their own religious beliefs, by collecting Asian
        manuscripts, publishing modern editions of these texts, and providing
        translations and scholarly studies of Buddhist thought, they laid the
        indispensable foundation stone for the spread of the Dhamma in the West,
        namely, access to the original Buddhist sources.</p>
        <p>The academic study of Buddhism initiated by these pioneers has
        continued through to the present time, despite the setback of two world
        wars and frequent shortages in funding. In Western universities and
        institutes, scholars map in ever finer details and with broader sweep
        the entire Buddhist heritage -- from Sri Lanka to Mongolia, from
        Gandhara to Japan. Thus what I call &quot;Phase I&quot; in the history
        of Western Buddhism is not so much a temporary stage superceded by its
        successors as a preparation for the further evolution of Buddhism in its
        Western setting.</p>
        </font><b>
        <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Phase II: Elite
        Appropriation</font></p>
        </b><font face="Times New Roman">
        <p>Phase II in the European encounter with Buddhism I shall call
        &quot;elite appropriation.&quot; By this, I mean the adoption of
        Buddhism as a living creed by an increasing number of intellectuals,
        writers, artists, and professionals. In the German-speaking world the
        catalyst for the transition from the mere academic investigation of
        Buddhism to its active appropriation was the philosopher Arthur
        Schopenhauer. Schopenhauer published the first edition of his
        philosophical masterpiece, <i>The World as Will and Representation</i>,
        in 1819, before he had come across reliable accounts of Buddhist
        thought. However, his philosophical intuitions showed such striking
        parallels to the Dhamma that several decades later, when Schopenhauer
        did gain access to accurate material on Buddhism, he at once recognized
        the affinity of his own thought to the Buddha's doctrine. Thus, in the
        second edition of his book, he hailed Buddhism as &quot;the most
        perfect&quot; of all the world's religions. Such was his admiration for
        the Buddha that he kept a small statue of the Master on his mantle
        alongside a bust of his philosophical hero, Immanuel Kant.</p>
        <p>Schopenhauer did not become a Buddhist himself, which would have been
        almost unthinkable in the Europe of his day, but his writings had a
        profound impact on later European thinkers and guided many to the
        Dhamma. At least three major figures owed their discovery of Buddhism to
        Schopenhauer's influence: the Austrian Indologist K.E. Neumann, who
        translated the Digha and Majjhima Nikayas and other Pali texts into
        German; the Bavarian judge George Grimm; and the Berlin homeopath Paul
        Dahlke. The last named pair, through their writings and promotional
        work, became the two leading proponents of Buddhism in Germany during
        the early part of the twentieth century. Their writings did not simply
        analyse Buddhism in terms of objective, impersonal categories, but tried
        to explain it from the inside, as experienced by one who had made the
        personal leap of faith.</p>
        <b><i>
        <p>Arnold and the Theosophists</p>
        </i></b>
        <p>In the English-speaking world, the primary impetus for the adoption
        of Buddhism by educated Westerners came from Sir Edwin Arnold's
        inspirational poem on the Buddha's life, <i>The Light of Asia</i>.
        Arnold depicted the Buddha as a figure of heroic stature whose
        personality combined deep compassion for all humanity with a masterly
        capacity for rational thought. These two characteristics dovetailed
        perfectly with the intellectual milieu of the period and aroused in
        Arnold's readers a new respect for the Buddha and interest in his
        teachings. Though conservative Christians were indignant at the poem's
        success, the British intelligentsia of the period were liberal enough
        not to feel constrained by Christianity's claims to sole possession of
        the truth. The Theosophical movement, founded by Madame Blavatsky and
        Henry Steele Olcott, also gave Buddhism a profile in the Anglo-American
        world. While their interpretation of Buddhism as a popular expression of
        esoteric wisdom bordered on the chimerical, the Theosophists helped to
        make Buddhism fashionable among those attracted to alternative ways of
        thought.</p>
        <b><i>
        <p>The First Flowering</p>
        </i></b>
        <p>Inspired by the Dhamma, a few adventurous spirits, not content with
        mere book knowledge, left their homelands to travel to the East to learn
        Buddhism at its sources. Others like Childers and Rhys Davids, working
        in colonial administrations in Asia, already had access to native
        authorities on the Dhamma. By the turn of the century several Westerners
        took the decisive step of coming to the East to enter the Sangha. The
        pioneers in this development were the Englishman Allen Bennett, who
        became Ven. Ananda Metteyya in Burma (1901), and Anton Gueth, who became
        Ven. Nyanatiloka (1903). Though Ven. Ananda Metteyya later disrobed
        after a tentative mission to Britain, Ven. Nyanatiloka settled
        permanently in Sri Lanka, where in 1911 he founded Island Hermitage as a
        monastery especially for Western monks.</p>
        <p>Within Europe, starting early in the twentieth century, Buddhist
        societies began to sprout, Buddhist journals commenced publication, and
        numerous books on Buddhism, of varying degrees of authenticity,
        attempted to bridge the gap between classical Buddhism and the Western
        intellectual heritage. During this phase of &quot;elite
        appropriation&quot; most proponents of Buddhism favoured the Pali
        tradition, as being far closer to the Buddha's original teachings than
        the baffling and ornate Mahayana sutras. What these thinkers emphasized
        in Buddhism was its rationality and realism, its ethical purity, its
        tolerance, its non-dogmatic approach to truth, and its compatibility
        with modern science. In this phase, with a few exceptions, the
        meditative, communal, and devotional aspects of Buddhism were left
        quietly on the sidelines. In other words, theory prevailed over
        practice.</p>
        </font><b>
        <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Phase III: The
        Popularization of Buddhism</font></p>
        </b><font face="Times New Roman">
        <p>Phase III in the spread of Buddhism in the West began roughly in the
        1960s and continues through to the present. This third phase might be
        described as the popularization of Buddhism. During this phase, Buddhism
        comes to exert its appeal on an increasing number of people of different
        lifestyles and its following proliferates rapidly. At the beginning of
        this phase Buddhism was largely a counter-cultural phenomenon, adopted
        by those in rebellion against the crass materialism and technocratic
        obsessions of modern society: hippies, acid heads, disaffected
        university students, artists, writers, and anarchists. But as these
        youthful rebels gradually became integrated into the mainstream, they
        brought their Buddhism with them.</p>
        <p>Today Buddhism is espoused not only by those in the alternative
        culture, but by businessmen, physicists, computer programmers,
        housewives, real-estate agents, even by sports stars, movie actors, and
        rock musicians. Perhaps several hundred thousand Europeans have adopted
        Buddhism in one or another of its different forms, while many more
        quietly incorporate Buddhist practices into their daily lives. The
        presence of large Asian Buddhist communities in the West also enhances
        the visibility of the Dhamma. Thousands of books on Buddhism are now
        available, dealing with the teachings at both scholarly and popular
        levels, while Buddhist magazines and journals expand their circulation
        each year. Buddhist influences subtly permeate various disciplines:
        philosophy and ecology, psychology and health care, the arts and
        literature, even Christian theology. Indeed, already three years ago <i>Time</i>
        magazine devoted a full-length cover story to the spread of Buddhism in
        America, and at least five books on the subject are in print.</p>
        <b><i>
        <p>Facilitating Factors</p>
        </i></b>
        <p>The transition in Western Buddhism from Phase II to Phase III was
        facilitated by two main factors. One was the increasing number of Asian
        Buddhist teachers who travelled to the West -- Theravada bhikkhus,
        Japanese Zen masters, Tibetan lamas -- either to give lectures and
        conduct retreats, or to settle there permanently and establish Buddhist
        centres. The second factor was the return to the West of the young
        Westerners who had trained in Asia in the late 1960s and early 1970s,
        and now came back to their home countries to spread the Dhamma.</p>
        <p>From the mid-1980s on we see even a new sub-phase of Phase III, or
        perhaps an incipient Phase IV: the emergence of a generation of Western
        Buddhist teachers who have never been to Asia but have received their
        full training in the West.</p>
        <p>What is characteristic of Western Buddhism in Phase III, in
        distinction from the earlier phases, is the focus on Buddhist practice,
        especially the practice of meditation. In this phase it is not the
        academic study of Buddhist texts and doctrines that dominates (as in
        Phase I), or the attempt to interpret the Dhamma through the prism of
        Western thought (as in Phase II), but the appropriation of Buddhism as a
        practice that can bring deep transformations in one's innermost being as
        well as in the conduct of everyday life. This does not necessarily mean
        that Buddhist practice is being taken up in accordance with canonical or
        traditional Asian models, nor that it is pursued to attain Nibbana in
        the sense upheld by classical Buddhist doctrine. Often Western Buddhists
        give their own twist to Buddhist concepts, sometimes in ways that depart
        drastically from canonical standards and from an Asian standpoint might
        border on &quot;heresy.&quot; But in Phase III, Buddhism is viewed as in
        some sense a path to awakening, a way that brings deep understanding of
        the mind and makes accessible new dimensions of being. Hence at this
        stage Buddhism becomes a means of spiritual transformation through
        direct experience, through insights not arrived at by mere conceptual
        reflection.</p>
        <b><i>
        <p>A Variety of Schools</p>
        </i></b>
        <p>In Phase III, we also find the arrival of various schools of Asian
        Buddhism, which peacefully coexist, pursuing their own growth and
        cooperating with each other to secure common aims. With the passage from
        Phase II to Phase III a noticeable shift takes place in the type of
        Buddhism generally adopted by Western Buddhists. In Phase II, Pali
        Buddhism was dominant, though I must stress that this adherence to the
        Pali heritage did <i>not</i> entail a commitment to any form of
        Theravada Buddhism as practised in Asian lands. In fact, the elite
        Buddhists often looked upon Asian Theravada as a degeneration from the
        pristine canonical doctrine, which they believed was a unique possession
        of their own. But with the rise of Phase III the focus of attraction
        shifts away from the Pali tradition: first to Zen Buddhism in the 1960s
        and 1970s; and then to Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhism in the 1980s and
        1990s. Further, new types of Buddhism come onto the scene, schools
        peculiar to the West, such as Thich Nhat Hanh's Order of Interbeing
        (based in France, but with a strong American chapter), the Arya Maitreya
        Mandala (centred in Germany), and the Friends of the Western Buddhist
        Order (based in Britain, but with several Continental chapters). These
        are partly syncretistic, partly innovative attempts to create new styles
        of Buddhist practice conformable to the Western temperament. Also the
        age range of Buddhist followers varies between the schools. Today in
        Germany most followers of the Pali tradition are in their 50s and 60s,
        while the followers of Zen and Tibetan Buddhism are in their 30s and
        40s. This development is critically important for us, as followers of
        the Theravada, to understand, and I will therefore return to it later.</p>

        Western Receptivity to Buddhism</font></p>
        </b><font face="Times New Roman">
        <p>At this point, I want to raise the question: How are we to understand
        the surge of interest in Buddhism among Westerners in recent years? How
        do we account for the eagerness with which so many today are ready to
        explore the Dhamma and often to deeply embrace it? It is necessary to
        address this question in order to begin to see the needs that we must
        fulfil as we try to make our own contribution to the spread of the
        Dhamma in Europe.</p>
        </font><b>
        <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Nature Abhors a Vacuum</font></p>
        </b><font face="Times New Roman">
        <p>I think the answer to this question unfolds in roughly two distinct
        stages, corresponding to the last two phases in the Western adoption of
        Buddhism that I spoke of just before. During Phase II, &quot;the phase
        of elite appropriation,&quot; intellectuals were drawn to Buddhism
        because it filled a vacuum that had been growing ever wider in Europe
        since the seventeenth century. This vacuum was the absence of any
        comprehensive body of wisdom teachings that could offer a key to the
        deeper meaning of human existence. The responsibility for shedding light
        on the meaning of existence had traditionally been assigned to
        philosophy, but from the seventeenth century onwards philosophy came to
        renounce this task in favour of other concerns. Besides, such guidance
        that philosophy did offer, as in Spinoza's <i>Ethics</i>, was usually
        embedded in systems of thought so subtle and complex that few people
        could understand them.</p>
        <p>Of course, Christianity too staked out for itself a claim to hold the
        key to the riddle of existence, but the main thrust of orthodox
        Christianity has not been to show the way to wisdom. Its purpose is to
        offer the prospect of an eternal afterlife in heaven through faith in
        God and Christ the Saviour, and it was just such faith that was coming
        into question. Further, Christianity's own record as a defender of human
        values was far from impressive. Its legacy of crusades, inquisitions,
        forced conversions, and intolerance repelled rather than attracted
        ethically sensitive minds, while its alliance with the colonial regimes
        confirmed suspicions about its imperialistic designs. Moreover, as
        science strode boldly into one arena of knowledge after another, often
        in the face of staunch resistance from the Church, it discredited
        Christian claims to the infallibility of revelation. Thus for a growing
        number of independent thinkers the Christian religion had become
        irrelevant.</p>
        <p>When translations of Buddhist texts and expositions of Buddhist
        thought began to appear in the late nineteenth century, they seemed to
        offer the West exactly what it was lacking: a system of spiritual wisdom
        that could give illumination and moral guidance yet did not demand
        unquestioning faith in theological dogmas. Instead, it rested its claims
        upon human reason and personal insight into fundamental truths and
        universal laws. The way Buddhism impinged on the Western mind during
        this period reveals both the strength and weakness in the Western
        perception of Buddhism. The strength lay in a deep and clear grasp of
        the doctrinal principles of the Dhamma, expressed in works that were
        utterly compelling in their insights, logic, and literary eloquence. The
        weakness was the understanding of Buddhism as primarily a rational,
        ideational system, to replace the tottering belief system of the
        Christian churches. Another limitation was that Buddhism in this phase
        still appealed mainly to the educated elite and thus could attract only
        those astute enough to break away from the cultural and religious
        mainstream, which was still predominantly Christian.</p>
        </font><b>
        <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">The Conditions for
        Popularization</font></p>
        </b><font face="Times New Roman">
        <p>For the transition to Phase III to take place, that is, for Buddhism
        to spread more widely through the general population, certain additional
        conditions were necessary, and these only became sufficiently widespread
        in the second half of the twentieth century. One was the triumph of
        liberal democracy over autocratic political systems. Under the heading
        of democracy we must include not only political democracy, but also the
        democracy of the mind, an openness to new ways of thought and tolerance
        for viewpoints that differ radically from those of one's own
        intellectual heritage. This openness was encouraged by a partial change
        in the attitude of the Christian churches towards other faiths, which in
        the West after the Second Vatican Council (1963–65) swung towards
        greater respect and tolerance for non-Christian religions.</p>
        <p>A second preparatory factor was a fair degree of economic affluence,
        which freed Europeans from excessive concern with material security and
        gave them the leisure to explore new avenues of thought. The rise of the
        consumerist society also helped them see the limitations to material
        development as a final solution to our quest for happiness.</p>
        <p>A third factor was the relatively high standard of liberal education
        established in the 1960s, enabling a large proportion of young people to
        attend the university. Higher education exposed them to multiple
        viewpoints in all the domains of human knowledge, and also trained them
        to think critically and deeply about new ideas.</p>
        <p>A fourth preparatory factor was improved means of transportation and
        communication, which facilitated contacts between East and West. Now
        curious Westerners could easily travel to the East to experience
        Buddhism first hand in its own native setting, while Buddhist teachers
        from Asia could move West to propagate the Dhamma.</p>
        <p>The fifth factor, following naturally from the fourth, was the actual
        arrival in the West of Buddhist teachers, both Asians and Westerners
        trained in Asia. These teachers brought Buddhism as a dynamic faith that
        they embodied in their lives through years of serious training.</p>
        </font><b>
        <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">The Great Transition</font></p>
        </b><font face="Times New Roman">
        <p>While the above five factors constituted the necessary conditions for
        Buddhism to become accessible to a sizable number of Europeans, they are
        not a sufficient explanation for the rapid escalation of Western
        interest in Buddhism. To pinpoint the decisive cause for this
        phenomenon, I must refer back to the vacuum or void that had opened up
        right beneath the feet of European civilization, that is, the absence of
        a solid, authoritative spiritual tradition that could give guidance in
        the mastery of life. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth
        centuries this void was acutely felt only by the more discerning Western
        minds, disenchanted with both doctrinaire Christianity and economic
        materialism. Ordinary people were somehow able to balance their
        ancestral Christian faith with a bright optimism about the coming Golden
        Age, to be achieved through science and technology.</p>
        <p>By the late 1950s, however, the picture had drastically changed.
        After two world wars and a prolonged cold war that threatened the whole
        world with thermonuclear destruction, countless people found their trust
        in the intrinsic goodness of human nature crumble into dust. Such
        horrors as the Nazi Holocaust and the Hiroshima atom bomb not only
        undermined faith in a benevolent God guiding the whole creation, but
        also brought to light the dangers in mere rationality not illuminated by
        a higher wisdom and staunch commitment to ethics. The most brilliant
        minds of the West, relying on the rational intellect, had twice plunged
        the whole world into barbaric irrationality, with death tolls numbering
        in the tens of millions. Now, with even more lethal weapons of
        destruction at hand, they threatened to do so again. Thus the void that
        sensitive nineteenth century thinkers had seen on the horizon had
        expanded until it had swallowed up almost everyone. And not only had it
        expanded, but for many it had acquired a sharp and compelling urgency
        that could not be quenched by any system of ideas, however noble. What
        they needed was a programme of action, which in many cases meant a deep
        personal engagement in the spiritual quest.</p>
        <p>At the same time that the fear of nuclear war cast long shadows over
        the entire globe, unprecedented material affluence in the West brought
        into easy reach the comforts, conveniences, and sensory delights that
        earlier generations had only dreamt about. Yet while this consumerist
        paradise mesmerized many (and still continues to do so), at least a few
        people &quot;with little dust in their eyes&quot; realized that such
        mundane pleasures could bring no lasting peace to the heart. At this
        point, for such spiritually sensitive Westerners, the message embedded
        in the Four Noble Truths was no longer a splendid system of ideas, to be
        admired in the comfort of an armchair. The message had become, rather, a
        medicine for curing a terrible disease, the disease of suffering, and
        the one sensible thing to be done with it, as with any medicine, was to
        take it. Hence for the Buddhists in Phase III of Western Buddhism, the
        Dhamma presented itself as a path of practice pivoting on the training
        and mastery of the mind. As teachers and centres became available,
        growing numbers of Westerners took up the practice eagerly, ready to
        follow it wherever it might lead.</p>

        <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">The Need for a Social
        Ethic</font></p>
        </b><font face="Times New Roman">
        <p>But Buddhism offered not only a method of mind training that could
        bring inner peace and deeper self-knowledge, it also fulfilled another
        profound need of the Western soul. As part of its deep intellectual
        heritage, Western civilization was committed to the idea that human
        happiness largely depends on the reformation of the social order in ways
        that eliminate political tyranny, economic oppression, and social
        injustice. The commitment to this premise was responsible for the rise
        of democracy in the West, as well as for less successful experiments
        with various forms of socialism. However, the experience of the
        nineteenth and twentieth centuries had shown that without some code of
        ethical guidance, mere aspirations for freedom and democracy could
        easily give birth to their opposites. Thus the French Revolution,
        launched under the motto of &quot;liberty, equality, and
        fraternity,&quot; ended up with the guillotine. The Bolshevik
        Revolution, with its promise of a &quot;dictatorship of the
        proletariat,&quot; culminated in the Soviet police state. Western
        idealists saw in Buddhism the foundations for a lofty social ethic
        devoted to world peace, social justice, and ecological sanity, yet
        internally protected by its moral code against the deformities to which
        secular political utopianism was prone.</p>
        </font><b>
        <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">The Search for Community</font></p>
        </b><font face="Times New Roman">
        <p>To understand the appeal of Buddhism to many present-day Westerners,
        another factor we must consider is the general breakdown of community in
        modern Western culture. With increasing industrialization and
        urbanization, the older human-scale social structures that allowed each
        person to find a meaningful place in the whole gave way to huge,
        monstrous institutions that reduced individuals to mere cogs in an
        impersonal social order. People have come to feel isolated, alienated,
        cut off from the bonds of social solidarity, trapped in a system that
        fuels ruthless individualism. These destructive values have provoked a
        widespread psychological crisis marked by chronic stress, anxiety, and
        depression. The escape routes people seek are promiscuous sex, violent
        entertainment, alcoholism, and drugs; but these, of course, do not offer
        a real solution.</p>
        <p>When Buddhism arrived on the scene it seemed to offer a counterweight
        to the loneliness and isolation so many people felt even in their
        overcrowded cities. For one thing, it stressed such values as universal
        love, compassion, cooperation, and altruism, half-forgotten ideals of
        the Christian legacy. But just as importantly, it ushered in a new sense
        of community. As Buddhist groups sought their own organizational forms,
        they gradually evolved towards the model of the Buddhist centre, where
        fellow practitioners meet regularly in a spirit of friendship to
        practise and study the Dhamma together, usually under the guidance of a
        teacher. Many Buddhist societies now have residential facilities where
        the more dedicated members live either temporarily or permanently. Some
        have urban centres accessible to people during the working week, and
        country centres some distance away to which members can resort for
        longer meditation retreats.</p>
        </font><b>
        <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">The Shift among
        Traditions</font></p>
        </b><font face="Times New Roman">
        <p>As I mentioned earlier, when Buddhism in the West enters Phase III, a
        shift occurs away from the Pali tradition towards Zen and Tibetan
        Vajrayana. One explanation for this might be the more attractive, more
        exotic surfaces of these schools of Buddhism; another factor might be
        the charismatic personalities of their teachers, the Zen masters and
        Tibetan lamas. But such an explanation is not complete. The main reason
        these traditions have gained in popularity over the Theravada is, I
        believe, because within their fold the lineage of meditation practice
        has been kept more alive than in mainstream Theravada. Certainly in the
        Pali Canon the Buddha repeatedly emphasizes the urgency of meditation
        above all else, and this message does live on in small pockets of
        earnest Theravadin practitioners throughout southern Asia. However, the
        European Buddhists of the older generations had set the pace by viewing
        Pali Buddhism largely in rationalistic terms, as a lofty ethic and
        impressive system of thought. Almost as if to confirm this, the few
        representatives of Asian Theravada to settle in the West have tended to
        present Buddhism largely in doctrinal and ethical terms. Rarely do they
        exhibit the same degree of spiritual vitality as the Mahayana and
        Vajrayana masters. Since present-day Western seekers are looking for a
        practice they can incorporate into their lives, not just a system of
        ideas they can admire and discuss, they naturally feel the appeal of the
        alternative forms of Buddhism -- Zen, Vajrayana, and new Western
        Buddhist schools -- over the Theravada.</p>
        <p>This, however, is not to say that a meditation tradition rooted in
        the Theravada is lacking in the West. A number of Westerners who had
        come to Asian countries years ago to practise under qualified teachers
        later returned to the West to teach and establish Buddhist centres. But
        what we find, as an interesting development, is that often such Western
        teachers of Theravada-based meditation do not consider themselves
        adherents of Theravada Buddhism in its doctrinal sense. Instead,
        explicitly or implicitly, they distance themselves from Asian Theravada
        and call their style of Buddhism &quot;the Vipassana tradition&quot; or
        &quot;the practice of mindful awareness.&quot; While they have evolved a
        rigorous system of training, they often lift Vipassana meditation out
        from its setting in Buddhist faith and doctrine, presenting it almost as
        an autonomous discipline of psychological insight and self-awareness.
        This is certainly a weak spot in the Western approach to the Dhamma, for
        the religious and philosophical dimensions of classical Buddhism are
        necessary for insight meditation to lead to its real goal, &quot;the
        taintless liberation of the mind.&quot; Neglect of the textual and
        doctrinal side of Buddhism can result in a diluted, shoddy understanding
        of the Dhamma. But the stripped-down style of practice -- non-religious,
        non-doctrinal, non-monastic insight meditation -- is the dominant mode
        in which Westerners are taking up Theravada Buddhism. This development
        might induce us to examine our own tradition more closely to ask
        ourselves why the Dhamma is being approached in such a partial fashion,
        through such a pick-and-choose policy, instead of being embraced as an
        organic whole.</p>

        Challenge of Bringing Theravada to the West</font></p>
        </b><font face="Times New Roman">
        <p>This brings me to the third major division of my talk, the special
        challenges we face in transmitting Theravada Buddhism to the West. When
        I ponder this issue, the question that immediately lodges itself in my
        mind is this: &quot;What exactly is the type of Theravada Buddhism that
        we wish to spread?&quot; For one thing, as I mentioned above, it is not
        merely texts and ideas that Westerners are looking for, not merely the
        Buddhism of the books. Books are certainly needed to introduce people to
        the Dhamma, to give them material for study and reflection. The point I
        wish to make is not that literature on Buddhism is dispensable, but that
        it is insufficient. For the Dhamma to take deep root in people's hearts,
        it must come to them, not between the covers of a book, but in living,
        breathing persons who display the truth of the teaching in their lives.</p>
        </font><b>
        <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">The Ideal Form</font></p>
        </b><font face="Times New Roman">
        <p>Thus when I raise the question, &quot;What type of Buddhism do we
        wish to spread?&quot; I am not thinking of the pure canonical Dhamma,
        which exists as such only in the books. In actuality, Buddhism has
        always been expressed in concrete practices, embedded in social
        structures, and embodied by real human beings. Thus we have to consider
        this aspect of Theravada Buddhism and not merely the doctrinal formulas
        of the Pali Canon. So when we ponder how to bring Buddhism to the West,
        we have to decide which of the many faces of Theravada we want to bring.
        To some extent, this is premature, since if Buddhism does eventually
        take root in the West, it will assume forms particular to Western social
        and cultural conditions. But to begin we need something to serve as a
        seed or nucleus.</p>
        <p>The ideal form of Theravada to present would be one that fuses all
        healthy aspects of the tradition into an organic whole. The transmission
        would have to focus on the practice of meditation, yet it should include
        a strong emphasis on Buddhist ethics (including Buddhist perspectives on
        contemporary ethical issues), textual and doctrinal study, devotional
        practices, and a fair share of ritual, too; but ritual would have to be
        integrated into the spiritual path, not pursued in compliance with mere
        cultural norms. The meditation practice should be the heart of the
        transmission. Once students experience the beneficial effects of
        meditation on their lives, in time they will develop keener interest in
        the study of texts, in devotional practices, in the precepts, and in
        ritual. Ritual will then serve to cement these varied aspects of Dhamma
        into a coherent whole, animated from within by the meditative
        experience.</p>
        </font><b>
        <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">A Monastic Transmission</font></p>
        </b><font face="Times New Roman">
        <p>But now we come to the heart of the issue. Theravada Buddhism, in its
        orthodox mould, has always looked upon the monastic order, the Sangha,
        as the bearer of the Buddhist heritage. Thus, if Theravada is to take
        hold in the West, it seems it should be through a monastic transmission
        guarded and upheld by lay support. Without this, we would probably wind
        up with a watered-down or secularized version of the Theravada, as we
        find today in the Vipassana sanghas. A monastic transmission is needed
        to keep alive the stress on renunciation and restraint so characteristic
        of the true Dhamma.</p>
        <p>The need for a monastic transmission, however, immediately runs up
        against a practical problem. In Sri Lanka today it is extraordinarily
        difficult to find monks who possess the personal qualities needed by a
        Buddhist &quot;messenger of Dhamma&quot; (<i>dhammaduta</i>), including
        the ability to communicate the Dhamma effectively to people from a very
        different cultural background. This has adverse repercussions for the
        whole project of propagating Theravada Buddhism abroad, making the
        Theravada something of a still backwater on the otherwise lively Western
        Buddhist frontier.</p>
        <p>Of all the Asian Theravada communities, I feel the Sri Lankans have
        the strongest potential for transmitting the Dhamma to the West. From
        what I have observed, the Thai, Cambodian, and Burmese monks cater
        almost exclusively to their own communities and seldom even imagine that
        the Dhamma can have any pull on Westerners. It is the Sri Lankans who
        have been most inspired by the ideal of passing the Dhamma to the West,
        and again it is the Sri Lankan Sangha that includes monks ready to learn
        Western languages and translate the teachings into a message meaningful
        to Westerners.</p>
        <p>Yet, despite this, when we survey the Western Buddhist scene, the
        results are disappointing. We see a tremendous surge of interest in Zen
        and Tibetan Buddhism, in new Buddhist movements like the Order of
        Interbeing and the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order, and in
        Vipassana as a secular practice. But apart from Ajahn Sumedho's
        Amaravati network, which consists of Western monks and nuns, the
        orthodox Theravada Sangha has had relatively little impact in the West.
        Of course, one might just interpret this as evidence that Westerners are
        too decadent to appreciate the true Dhamma. However, that interpretation
        would not only be uncharitable, but it would also be wrong. A sizeable
        number of Western Buddhists feel themselves powerfully drawn towards the
        Theravada tradition and are on the lookout for monks to offer teachings.
        Thus the desire is there; it is just the resources to satisfy it that
        are in short supply.</p>

        <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">The State of Monastic
        Education</font></p>
        </b><font face="Times New Roman">
        <p>Although I do not have an easy solution to this problem, it would be
        useful to make a preliminary diagnosis of its origins. I believe part of
        the explanation lies in the system of monastic education that prevails
        here in Sri Lanka. This system is extremely inadequate and needs drastic
        revision from the ground up: revision with respect to the aim, depth,
        and breadth of monastic training. When monks trained in this system go
        overseas to expound the Dhamma, they find themselves facing severe
        handicaps. Not only must they learn to adapt to a society where social
        relationships are not governed by clearly defined roles and
        expectations, but they must really strike at the existential concerns of
        Western students. Routine preaching and ceremonies simply won't do.</p>
        <p>The only way for the Sri Lankan Sangha to help meet the challenge of
        promoting Theravada Buddhism in the West is by making exponential
        improvements in monastic education right here in Sri Lanka. If a monk is
        to go abroad to spread the Dhamma, he must have not only a thorough
        knowledge of his own Theravada tradition, but acquaintance with other
        subjects too. He will need some knowledge of the history and schools of
        Buddhism, comparative religion, and English. He should also know, or be
        ready to learn, the language of the country in which he will work.</p>
        <p>Beyond these specific areas of competence, he will require the
        intellectual openness and acuity to comprehend the dispositions,
        attitudes, and worldviews of people from a different culture and relate
        to them in meaningful ways. He must also have some grounding in the real
        practice of the Dhamma, for knowledge of books and doctrines, however
        wide, will be fruitless if not coupled with dedication to the practice.
        Unfortunately, it is almost impossible to find a monastic institute that
        can impart the necessary training, and the Buddhist prelates, due to
        their conservatism, resist proposed reforms. In this respect Buddhist
        educational institutions compare poorly with Christian seminaries, which
        equip their own missionaries with a thorough and wide-ranging education
        that often excels the Buddhist institutes even in the field of Buddhist
        studies.</p>

        <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">The Revival of
        Meditation</font></p>
        </b><font face="Times New Roman">
        <p>The problem of deficient education is compounded by the decline of
        the practical training in meditation throughout the Sri Lankan monastic
        system. Thus the training of the monks focuses not so much on guiding
        them along the Buddha's path to awakening as on teaching them how to
        serve as custodians of a distinct social and cultural heritage. I do not
        want to dismiss the value of this service, for within this country it is
        quite necessary to preserve the cultural and social pillars of Sri
        Lankan Buddhism, especially against the incursions of evangelical
        Christianity and materialistic consumerism. But this function should be
        subordinated to the more important one of teaching the young monks the
        path to wisdom and peace; it should not become so domineering that the
        original path gets covered with mist and weeds.</p>
        <p>The decline of a living meditation tradition in the bhikkhu training
        centres seems to stem from the sharp distinction that the Theravada
        tradition makes between village monks and forest monks. In this
        division, the village-and-town monks devote their time to preaching and
        community service, while the forest monks engage in full-time
        meditation. This division creates a situation where a monk not intent on
        winning the path to Nibbana in this present life postpones the practice
        of meditation to some future existence, justifying his life in robes as
        a service to society. Such social service, however, takes on a largely
        secularized hue and easily veers off into political activism. Seldom is
        it integrated into a true path of spiritual development.</p>
        <p>On the other side of the divide, those monks who are keen on winning
        the goal in this life withdraw into the forest for full-time meditation
        and rarely show any inclination to share their insights with the wider
        community. Also, given their method of training, they will generally
        lack the linguistic and social skills needed to propagate the Dhamma in
        foreign countries. Thus we have this sharp dichotomy: educated town
        monks without deep personal insight into the Dhamma or experience in
        meditation, and meditation monks without much inclination to propagate
        the teaching.</p>
        <p>Since it would be inappropriate to force monks devoted to full-time
        meditation to take up a more active vocation, the remedy needed to
        redress this imbalance seems to require a revitalization of meditation
        practice within the bhikkhu training institutes. This cannot be done,
        however, merely by imposing meditation on the monks from the outside as
        a mandatory discipline. Meditation practice does not occur in a vacuum.
        It must spring up from an inner need, under the impetus given by a clear
        understanding of the foundations and objectives of Buddhist
        spirituality. So what is really needed is a rejuvenation of the
        spiritual challenge at the heart of the Buddhist monastic life.</p>

        <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">The Training of
        Dhammadutas</font></p>
        </b><font face="Times New Roman">
        <p>Personally, I do not think it is prudent to try to create
        institutions expressly for the purpose of training monks as
        &quot;Buddhist missionaries&quot; or <i>dhammadutas</i>. Such
        institutions could easily attract monks who want to go abroad for the
        wrong reasons: to gain prestige, to become popular, perhaps to find
        employment and disrobe. I feel it is wiser to strengthen programmes in
        the existing bhikkhu training centres. At the same time, we should keep
        an eye open for capable bhikkhus enrolled in these programmes who
        display the qualities needed to propagate the Dhamma in the West. We
        must also remember that the purpose in training monks is not to make
        them <i>dhammadutas</i>, but to lead them along the way to
        enlightenment. Thus the training should focus on the inner development
        of the monk, both in those qualities conducive to personal growth and in
        those that allow for a compassionate outflow of his spiritual
        development to others. Monks who have the special skills, and the
        inclination to work for the spread of the Dhamma, can then be chosen for
        overseas assignments, providing they also display the inner maturity
        required by such a task.</p>
        </font><b>
        <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">An Inconclusive
        Conclusion</font></p>
        </b><font face="Times New Roman">
        <p>I come to an inconclusive conclusion. At the present stage in its
        evolution, Buddhism in the West is taking on a form that focuses on the
        Dhamma as a path of inner transformation through meditation and
        contemplation, with other aspects of Buddhist practice subordinated to
        this concern. We should not immediately conclude that Western Buddhism
        is therefore an ideal model for Asians to emulate. Western Buddhists
        often lack a solid knowledge of the texts, and thus are prone to bend
        the teachings to fit their own agendas and expectations. It is here, I
        think, that Asian monks with a sound scholarly knowledge of the Dhamma
        can make a valuable contribution. But while corrective measures are
        needed in Western Buddhism to ensure right understanding, it is clear
        that the central focus of Western Buddhists will be on personal
        meditative experience as the way to inner peace and wisdom.</p>
        <p>If Sri Lankan Buddhists are to make a significant contribution to the
        healthy growth of Buddhism in the West, we will need representatives of
        the Dhamma who are also living embodiments of the Dhamma. That is, we
        need monks -- and nuns as well -- who express in their lives and
        characters the potentials of the Dhamma as a way of life that brings
        real wisdom, purity, and peace within, and overflows in expressions of
        kindness and compassion for others. This is a difficult challenge, but
        it is an indispensable requirement if Sri Lanka is to contribute to the
        development of Buddhism in the West. Since the main responsibility for
        transmitting the Dhamma rests with the monastic order, the Sangha in
        this country must set its own house in order if it is to be qualified to
        perform this task. This will require some intense internal criticism and
        attempts at genuine reform, especially in the system of monastic
        training. If such changes do not take place, it is unlikely that Sri
        Lanka will be able to contribute much more to the growth of Buddhism in
        Europe than to maintain viharas that serve Sri Lankan expatriates.</p>
        <p align="CENTER">* * *</p>
        <p>I will end on a bright note. Despite the shortage of qualified <i>dhammaduta</i>
        monks, scattered across the West there are a few Theravada viharas and
        Buddhist centres maintained by monks who, in their own quiet and
        non-assertive way, are working to spread the Dhamma. Prominent among
        them we find Sri Lankan monks, who often must take up this task with
        much hardship and self-sacrifice. The hardship they face is not only
        external, but internal as well. They must maintain a delicate discipline
        amidst the temptations of the Western consumerist culture, and must also
        struggle against the weight of Buddhist tradition to find the clear
        message of the Buddha hidden behind stultifying conventions. Such monks
        generally do not have large organizations behind them, or financial
        backing from home, but through their dedication to the Dhamma and
        compassionate concern for others, they actively seek to help Westerners
        find their way to the Buddha's path. Their selfless work deserves
        appreciation and support from all sincere Buddhists in this country./.</p>
