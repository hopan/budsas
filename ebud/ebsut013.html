<blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the important rules of
    Vinaya, for Buddhist monks as well as nuns, is the
    prohibition of a monk to be alone with women, and a nun to be
    alone with men. This is not just a rule for strict monks and
    nuns, but a rule which the Buddha made obligatory for all
    monks and nuns. Since this is a rule which often comes up, I
    will explain it at length in this Vinaya article. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the introduction to one of the
    rules (&quot;Aniyata&quot; 1) found in the Vinayapitaka,
    there occurs the following story: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&quot;At one time the
        Enlightened One, the Lord, was staying at Savatthi in
        Anathapindika's Park, in the Jeta Grove. Then the
        Venerable Udayin approached this girl (a newly married
        daughter of one of Ven Udayin's supporters) and having
        approached her, he sat down together with that girl, one
        man and one woman, in a secret place on a secluded,
        convenient seat, conversing at the right time, speaking
        Dhamma at the right time ... Visakha (the famous lay
        woman disciple) saw the Venerable Udayin sitting together
        with that girl, one man and one woman, in a secret place
        on a secluded convenient seat. Seeing this, she said to
        the Venerable Udayin: &quot;This is not proper, honoured
        sir, it is not suitable, that the master should sit
        together with womenfolk, one man and one woman, in a
        secret place on a secluded, convenient seat. Although the
        master has no desire for that thing (sexual intercourse),
        unbelieving people are difficult to convince.&quot; The
        Venerable Udayin took no heed of Visakha..... Visakha
        told this matter to the monks ... The monks became vexed,
        annoyed and angry and told the matter to the Lord ... The
        Lord rebuked Ven. Udayin: &quot;How can you, foolish man,
        sit together with womenfolk, one man and one woman, in a
        secret place on a secluded, convenient seat? </i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>...&quot;(The Lord Buddha
        then laid down a rule explaining...) </i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>'A secret place' means
        secret from the eye, secret from the ear. Secret from the
        eye means if (the monk) covering his eye, raising his
        eyebrow, raising his head, he (the onlooker) is unable to
        see (the monk). Secret from the ear means he (the
        onlooker) is unable to hear ordinary speech. 'A secluded
        seat' means it is secluded by a wall, or by a door, or by
        a screen, or by a screen wall or by a tree or by a pillar
        or by a sack or it is concealed by anything whatsoever.
        'Convenient' means it is possible to indulge in sexual
        intercourse.&quot; </i></font></p>
        <p align="right"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>(from the Pali
        Text Society's Book of the Discipline, Vol l, p 330ff) </i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The following rule,
    &quot;Aniyata&quot; 2, is similar to the first, which I have
    just described, with the only change being that this time
    Venerable Udayin sat down with that same girl, just the two
    of them, in a secret place (secret from the eye, secret from
    the ear), that was not a secluded place (by a wall etc) nor a
    convenient place (for sexual intercourse). Again when Visakha
    spotted Venerable Udayin and the girl alone together, she
    rebuked the monk:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&quot;This, honoured sir, is
        not right, it is not suitable for the master to sit
        together with womenfolk, one man and one woman, in a
        secret place. Although, honoured sir, the master has no
        desire for that thing (here referring to flirting),
        unbelieving people are hard to convince.&quot; </i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Again Ven. Udayin took no heed of
    Visakha's complaint, so she told the monks who told the Lord
    Buddha. The Buddha then rebuked Ven. Udayin and condemned
    such behaviour by establishing another rule for monks. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The above quotations, directly from
    the Vinayapitaka, show the danger of a monk being alone with
    women, especially inside a room, car or building. These rules
    were repeated in the nuns' Vinaya, prohibiting a nun being
    alone with men for similar reasons. In today's society where
    allegations of sexual abuse are rife, and are often just one
    person's word against another's, keeping these important
    rules is more than just a protection from the opportunity for
    abuse, but also a guard against the suspicions spread by the
    malicious. Suspicions, even when untrue, are so difficult to
    disprove. As the wise laywoman Visakha said <b>&quot;Even if
    the Venerable monk or nun has no desire for that thing,
    unbelieving people are hard to convince&quot;</b>. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Knowing this rule now, may we help
    all Buddhist monks and nuns keep their precepts well and thus
    help prevent allegations that are damaging to all. Please
    avoid being alone with a monk if you are a woman and if you
    are a man, avoid being alone with a nun. Thank you. </font></p>
