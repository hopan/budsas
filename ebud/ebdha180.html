    the introduction of Buddhism in China in A.D 65-67, the most stupendous task was lying
    before a highly religious community with a team of translators from Parthia, Indo-Seythia,
    India and Central Asia to render the Sanskrit Buddhist texts into Chinese. This difficult
    task spread over several centuries after the inception of Buddhism. With Buddhism we reach
    a world of ideas very different from Chinese traditional thoughts and ideas. Besides this,
    the Indian language through which the great treasure of her religion would reveal, was
    completely different from Chinese. Sanskrit with its highly developed and intricate system
    of grammar was different from Chinese that had no systematic grammar. In the earliest
    period, the translators faced a serious problem to give phonetic transcription of Indian
    proper names specially to render the abstract notion and concrete ideas of the Buddhist
    expression by Chinese character which is pictographic in form and ideographic in nature.
    The Chinese characters are monosyllabic in sound and unificational in form. On the
    contrary, Sanskrit is alphabetic, polysyllabic and highly infective. Arthur F. Wright
    says, &quot;the Chinese had shown little disposition to analyse the personality in its
    components, while India had a highly developed science of psychological analysis. In
    concept of time and space, there were also striking differences. The Chinese tended to
    think of both as finite and to reckon time in life span, generation to political eras. The
    Indians, on the other hand, conceived of time and space as infinite and tended to think of
    cosmic aeons rather than of limits of terrestrial life&quot;[1]. The social and political
    values of the two ancient civilisations also differed. The society according to Confucius
    was an ordinance of heaven and based upon five relations between ruler and subjects,
    father and son, husband and wife, elder and younger brothers and friends. Confucian idea
    of filial piety was equated with worship of heaven and he regarded that for the people, it
    would suffice as a religion. Buddhism, on the other hand, professes the ideal of wandering
    ascetic who goes forth to homeless state to eliminate the sorrows of birth and diseases,
    old age and death. With such alien background, the task of finding out suitable
    comprehensive equivalents for highly technical Buddhist terminology was a formidable one.
    The phonetic transcription was undoubtedly a very difficult task to be performed with the
    help of ideographic Chinese character which was less suited for that purpose. This would
    not have been that difficult in any alphabetical writing system. Moreover, with the
    exception of a very few Chinese monks of the team belonging to highly organised Church of
    Lo-yang and Ch'ang-an, others had very little knowledge of Sanskrit and in the archaic
    period the Central Asian and Indian monks had also scanty knowledge of literary Chinese.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">In the earliest period, translation of
    Buddhist terminology and text was very vague and confusing. Amid ever-growing confusion
    caused by various forms of Buddhism introduced in China from outside, by importation of
    missionaries from various countries belonging to multifarious schools and by translations
    of some of the Mahaayanist and Hiinayaanist texts, the Chinese Buddhists were groping in
    darkness. Later on, they successfully evolved a Chinese doctrinal system.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Throughout the history of translation of
    Buddhist texts into, Chinese, the transcribes had followed certain rules and regulations.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">They had used those characters which were
    not commonly used in written Chinese, e.g. a, yi, ke, ge, lo, sa, fu, mi, etc. The words
    Maitreya and Bodhisattvas had been rendered with such sounds as Mi-lo, Fu-sa. But we find
    a number of common signs as shan, she, shil, men were frequently used for Buddhist
    transcription. The Sanskrit word 'Srama.na had been rendered with such phonetical sound as
    she-men.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">One Chinese syllable may be written in
    various ways as Chinese characters are homophonous, e.g. shan (to write out), shan (good,
    benevolent), shan (mountain). These syllables may stand for various foreign sounds.
    Generally, we see the characters like p'o, (ke or ge) chia, (ke or ge) chia are used for
    transliteration. The character (chia) stands for Sanskrit sound ke or ge. Thus Bhagavat
    had been rendered p'o-ge-p'o. The first syllable p'o had been employed for Sanskrit sounds
    like va, pa, pha, bha, vat. A Japanese book called Siddhakos a has mentioned about a
    Record of I-ching which contains Chinese equivalent characters for Sanskrit alphabets.[2]</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">In early period, transcription of
    individual words and proper names were not standarised. It went through many changes. The
    word Buddha had been rendered into Chinese as Fo-t'u, Fo-t'ou. The original word Buddha
    was greatly distorted. Later on, the character Fo was used for Buddha. It may be an
    abbreviation of Fo-t'ou. Sir Charles Eliot says that these two syllables Fo-t'ou once
    pronounced like vut-tha.[3]</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">During the transitional period from
    ancient phonetic renderings to the time of highly developed transcription system, the same
    norm of using restricted characters and conventional set of signs had always been adopted
    for the purpose of transcription. We must note that the system of transcription is not a
    new innovation. During the glorious reign of the Former and Later Hans when they had
    close, political and trade relation with the West, they had to transcribe the geographical
    names of those often-frequented countries. The Records of the Former and Later Hans
    mentioned about two hundred [4] (mostly geographical) foreign words in transcription. The
    Buddhist transcribers must have made full use of this rudimentary system for rendering
    foreign sounds.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddhist literary activity had an
    interesting method of transliterating Indian words. Indian proper names, specially with
    obvious meaning were translated, e.g. Divaakara, Asvaghosa, Devadatta, Asoka and
    Tathaagata as Jih-ku-ang (the rays of the Sun), Ma-ming (neighing of a horse), T'ien-shou
    (gift of Devas), Wu-yu (not mournful), Ju-1ai (one whose incoming into the world is like
    the coming of his predecessors), respectively. This translation of Indian proper names
    gives correct comprehension of their meaning. The transliterated word A-mi-ta-p'o
    Amitaabha was also rendered as Wu-liang-kuang, boundless light. There are many such proper
    names which could be easily rendered into Chinese phonetic sound but it is difficult
    sometime to say where and when they had been transliterated or translated. But many proper
    names did not tend themselves to such renderings and it was a pretty difficult task to
    translate the Buddhistic theological terms like Nirvaana and Samaadhi, etc.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The Siddhakosa (880 A.D) a Japanese book
    says in Nan-hai-kuei-chuan. (The Record sent home by I-Ching) in Chapter XXXIV under the
    title Si t'an-Chang[5], he had mentioned about 49 Sanskrit letters of the alphabet which
    are in perfect accord with corresponding Chinese Characters with a very few exceptions.[6]</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">A system known as Fan-ch'ieh[7] or Fan-yin
    was devised by Indian Buddhist monks to render approximately in Chinese the Paali or
    Sanskrit syllables. Fan-ch'ieh is a system of spelling in Chinese Dictionaries[8]. It was
    a favourite style with the Emperor K'ang-hsi (A.D 1662-1723) of the Manchu Dynasty.
    According to this system which is similar to Indian Sandhi Prakara.na, a syllable
    -phonetically of two characters will be combined by dropping the final of the first and
    the initial of the second to produce a new sound and<b> </b>tone e.g. Fu-wan (to begin
    late evening) Fan (to respect, to turn over), Chu Yung Chung.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Hsuan-chuang and I-Ching, the noted and
    profound Sanskrit scholars introduced certain reforms in rendering Sanskrit equivalents
    for Buddhist terms in Chinese and probably after them, the rendering of Sanskrit terms was
    more accurate and more precise. Hsuan-chuang preferred to transliterate the Buddhist
    terminology rather than translating them.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">In the early period of translation, most
    of the Buddhist terminologies were translated through Taoist terms but it was soon found
    that these terms did not convey the subtle meanings. The translators preferred to keep the
    foreign words and then transcribe them into Chinese. Consequently, we find Praj~naa
    Paaramitaa, Nirvaa.na, etc. have been transcribed as Pan-jo-pa-lo-mi-to, Nieh p'an, etc.
    Towards the end of the 4th century, Toa-an[9], one of the greatest Chinese monks
    bibliographer and collector of sacred texts, gave some practical suggestions to the
    members of the bureau of translators. He as a 'general manager' of the team, was always
    aware of the problems the transcribes often confronted with. The questions before them
    were whether the translation should be done to cater to the popular need of the people, so
    as to make it short in form, free and polished which would be welcome by the Chinese
    people in general or whether the translation should be faithful, literal or repetitious
    which would be disliked by them. In his preface to Praj~naa Paaramitaa Suutra Tao-an had
    given some practical suggestions to the transcribers requesting them on what points they
    should deviate from the original, and also mentioned three points where they should make
    faithful translation of Sanskrit texts[10]. Hsuan-chuang similarly formulated certain
    rules for the translators. He had insight in selecting words and as a translator he
    created marvel in using the choicest Chinese words to translate the Buddhist terms.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Through the combined efforts of both
    foreign missionaries and Chinese monks, enormous body of the Buddhist Suutras was
    translated which constitutes the bulk of the Canon and with it thousands of new terms were
    assimilated into Chinese Buddhism. Among the foreign missionaries who made a greatest
    contribution in translation were An Shih-kao from Parthia, Dharmarakã a from Tukhara,
    Kumaarajiiva from Kucha.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism grew and developed with two
    indigenous religions Confucianism and Taoism. Taoism is a mystic philosophy which was
    directly opposed to Confucianism. Taoism is ascetic and pantheistic. Buddhist philosophy
    is also regarded as a philosophy of asceticism which emphasises the withdrawal from the
    world. Here, we, in fact, find some similar ideas with Taoism and in the Taoist circle
    Buddhism made its headway. Buddhism entered into China as a foreign religion but soon
    found expression in Taoist mystic words &quot;The Chinese who became interested in the
    foreign religion were attracted by its novel formulae for attainment of supernatural
    power, immortality or Salvation and not by its idea. This early Buddhism (in China) was
    generally regarded as a sect of Taoism&quot;[11]. The defenders and propagators had to
    find some arguments to reconcile the Buddhist ideas with traditional Chinese thoughts.
    Thus Tao (The Way, The Truth, A Principle) was the expression used for Dharma or Bodhi,
    Ying-jen for Arhat, Wu-wei for Nirvaa.na, Hsiao-hsurt (filial submission and obedience)
    for 'Siila.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">It is of utmost importance to have correct
    evaluation of Chinese comprehension of Buddhist terms. Both the Indian and Chinese
    Maadhyamika texts have a sizeable technical vocabularies. The question whether a Chinese
    term conveys the meaning of Indian equivalent depends on whether the translation keeps the
    formal system of the original and whether it is understood by the Chinese. if this is
    fulfilled, then the technical meaning of the term is understood.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">In the middle of the Later Han Dynasty
    (1st Century B. C. to 1st Century A.D.) there was a revival of Taoism. In order to
    differentiate the original from the revived Taoism, the name Hsuan-hsueh, Dark Learning
    was known to the contemporary Chinese and Neo-Taoism to the West. Hsuan means dark,
    profound, metaphysics. This term originated in the first chapter of Lao-tze's The Book of
    Tao, &quot;They may both be called the Cosmic Mystery Reaching from the Mystery into the
    deeper Mystery Is the Gate to the secret of all Life&quot;.[12]</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The Neo-Taoists took delight in
    contemplating mystery behind all mysteries-the ultimate behind the phenomena; world. They
    speculated that there must be some absolute Principle at the origin of all phenomena, and
    some ultimate reality that brings forth universal harmony. The idea of Wu or Non-being is
    the basis of all things. &quot;Though Heaven and Earth in their greatness are richly
    endowed with the myriad things, though their thunder moves and their winds circulate,
    through their revolving operations the myriad transformations came to be - yet it is the
    Silent and Supreme non-being that is their origin.&quot;[13] </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The Chinese literary society during the
    4th century A.D was greatly dominated by Neo-Taoism, at the same time the Praj~naa School
    was gaining supremacy among the Buddhist<b> </b>Circle. Both the Schools were influenced
    by similar philosophy. According to the Buddhist all things by nature are empty&nbsp; and
    the Neo-Taoist held that everything had their origin in non-being (Wu wei). Liu-chin (A.D.
    438-495) made this statement, &quot;from the K'un-lun Mountain eastward the term 'Great
    Oneness' is used and from Kashmir westward the word Sambodhi Cheng chueh (Buddhist
    expression) is used. In the Record of the Later Han Dynasty Fan-yeh (A.D 398-445) says
    about Buddhism, &quot;If we examine closely, its teaching about purifying the mind and
    gaining release from the ties of life and its casting aside both 'emptiness' and 'being'
    we see that it belongs to the same current as do the Taoist writings&quot;&quot; So we
    feel that the Buddhist and Taoist scholars belonged to the same intellectual trend. An
    Interesting incident 1 am quoting from the biography of Hui-yuan [15] (A. D. 334-416). One
    day while the monk Hui-yuan was discussing in the assembly, the audience who gathered
    there became restless, confused and bewildered about the exposition of the Buddhist theory
    of reality. The monk immediately quoted the idea of reality of Lao-tze and Chuang-tze and
    then only the audience became satisfied and pacified. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Many scholars used Lao-tze's and
    Chuang-tze's ideas and thoughts to expound Buddhist ideas. Such use of Taoist terminology
    to explain Buddhist concept was known as Ke-yi[16] method of analogy. This method was a
    specialised system of teaching Buddhism to the literary and gentry class who were well
    versed in Confucious and Taoist classics. In the beginning of the 4th Century A.D Tao-an
    (A.D 312-385) who came from an eminent Confucian family evolved this system. This method
    of Ke-yi was employed for those who were well-equipped with the doctrinal terminologies of
    Taoism and Confucianism but were ignorant of Buddhist terminology. But Tao-an himself had
    to give up Ke-yi when he found this method of instruction useless. Later on, Flui-yu, the
    disciple of Kumaarajiiva condemned this system. Tao-an in the early stage always taught
    Buddhism with the help of &quot;Three Mysteries&quot; Lao-tze, Chuang-tze and I-Ching (The
    Book of Change).</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">So we find that the Buddhist ideas and
    concepts were equated with Chinese ideas and thoughts. Thus the five important cardinal
    virtues of Confucianism Wu-ch'ang were equated with the five Buddhist Siilas and the four
    Buddhist Mahaabhuutas with the Chinese five Elements Wu-hsing.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">During the period of disunity lasting from
    the disintegration of the Han in 220 A.D till the Sui (A.D 590-617) and the T'ang (A.D
    618-907), Taoism became increasingly important. The Buddhist antithesis of Bhuuta-tathataa
    or Absolute Chen-ju and the temporal, permanent and change, Nirvaana and cycle of life and
    death found their equivalents in the Taoist ideas of non-being and being. Wu and yu, the
    Mahaayanist concept of Praj~naa (Chih-hui), the void Suunyataa (K'ung) Stillness ('Saanti,
    Chi), expediency (Upaaya, Feng-shih), amalgamated with their counterparts in Hsuan-hsueh
    of Saintiliness (Sang), Emptiness (hsu)[17], Non-being (Wu-wei), etc.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">In course of discussion between Tathaagata
    and Subhuuti in the Vajracchedika Praj~naa Paaramitaa Suutra[18], Subhuuti concluded
    saying, Yi-ch'ieh hsien-Shang Chieh-yi wu-wei fu-erh yu-Cha'pie. The sages and wise men
    all adopted diffusive doctrine that admits of no particular distinction (Wu-wei) has been
    interpreted in many ways. It means non-activity, passive, spontaneous, transcendal,
    non-phenomenal nominal interpreted as Nirvaa.na, etc.[19] &quot;The famous Taoist doctrine
    of Wu-wei is no less than the practical application of this philosophy of the infinite to
    our daily life.&quot;[20]</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Among hundred of Suutras translated into
    Chinese a sizeable number comprises Dhaara.ni. These texts show that these are the works
    of transcription rather than that of translation. The transcription of Dhaara.ni does not
    confront with major obstacles. It does neither require thorough knowledge of intricacies
    of Sanskrit grammar, nor it requires knowledge of literary Sanskrit. For transcribing
    Dhaara.nii, a knowledge of Indian script was sufficient.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The Indian script in a variety of Braahmii
    called Siddham [21] became very popular and played an important part in Chinese Buddhism
    ever since it was introduced in China and Japan in the 8th century with spread of
    Mantrayaana, the esoteric school of true word, Siddham script was specially employed to
    transcribe Dhaara.niis, Mantras and Viijaakã aras or germ letters. An attempt was made in
    early period to transcribe the Indian formulae phonetically syllable by syllable with
    corresponding Chinese sound but before long it proved to be inefficacious. With the advent
    of the 8th century the transcrivers mostly used Siddham letters. The prolific translator
    Hsuan - chuang made certain reforms in the method of translation. The terms regarding
    esoterism like Dhaara.niis or Ma.n¯ alas were left untranslated by him.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Long before the spread of Buddhism the
    Chinese were familiar with Taoist spells, magic charms and sorcery. Therefore, they became
    very much interested in Buddhist Mantras and Dhaara.niis. The first foreign monk who
    arrived at Ch'ang-an in 625 A. D. with the text of thousand of Dhaara.nis and Saadhana,
    was a native of Central India. These texts were translated under the name of T'o-lo
    ni-chi-ching Dhaara.nii Sa&quot;ngraha. The original is lost, the translations exist.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The following centuries saw a galaxy of
    Tantric adepts who brought many more Mantrayaanic texts. Among the foreign monks special
    mention may be made of Subhakara Si&quot;mha, Vajrabodhi and Amoghavajra, all from India.
    Subhakara Si&quot;mha translated Mahaavairocana, the basic text of Tantrayaana.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Under the imperial patronage, by the pious
    devotion of selfless painstaking and persevering monks, by their loyal supporters and by
    private contribution the translation work continued unceasingly, unabated throughout the
    long period of Buddhism in China. The latest Japanese editions of the Catalogue of Chinese
    Tripi.taka contains 85 volumes and 3053 items. It is a rare wonder in the history of human
    civilisation, so far its amount and perfection are concerned. It is matchless and cannot
    be compared with the translation work carried on by the team of modern world. Indian
    philosophical ideas and thoughts, political and social systems were opened to the Chinese
    which had lasting cultural impact on Chinese mind.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Living in the highly advanced scientific
    world we really wonder how could it be possible to produce such bulk of Buddhist Canon in,
    Chinese by simple human endeavour.</font></p>
