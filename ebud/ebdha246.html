      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="6">T</FONT>he 
      main question for a lot of people is how to practice meditation in daily 
      life. How to practice the Dhamma in daily life. The practice of formal 
      meditation in a retreat is primarily intensive training in a very 
      structured environment. This is helpful and important, but the real 
      practice of meditation, if meditation is to be of any real value, is in 
      our daily lives.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In daily life, the full path 
      and the other aspects of cultivating the mind have to be undertaken and 
      practiced as well. It's really in our daily lives, in our day-to-day 
      situations that we <I>need</I> skill and understanding to meet all the 
      challenges that come up: all the conflicting situations, the chaos, the 
      the daily ups and downs.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We have to have a game plan 
      for meeting and facing the defilements that come up within our own minds 
      as well as the negativities and defilements that come at us from others. 
      We have to develop qualities of the mind in addition to meditation.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Many people want to meditate 
      and find peace of mind. But some of those people don't want to really 
      change the rest of their life style. They want to have their cake and eat 
      it too-be able to meditate and get the &quot;bennies,&quot; such as peace of mind, 
      but still be able to do whatever comes into their mind according to their 
      whims and their fancies.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But the process doesn't 
      really work that way. For most of us, the mind we encounter as we sit in 
      meditation- all the states that come up, the difficult emotions, other 
      negative mental states, and even the condition of our body, pains and the 
      like- is basically the sum total of what we have been accumulating all of 
      our life. These accumulations are the consequences of our life-long habit 
      patterns, life style, and even of our viewpoints.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There are practices, in 
      addition to meditation, that we can cultivate to help us bring the Dhamma 
      into our habit patterns, our life styles, and our viewpoints. Let's 
      explore some of these other aspects of the Dhamma practice which we have 
      to put into effect in our daily lives as the appropriate situations come 
      up.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We know that the second Noble 
      Truth is that the source of suffering is craving and clinging, unbridled 
      desire. Because of this, one of the main practices in the Dhamma is called 
      Dana. Dana means the practice of giving or sharing with others. It is an 
      antidote to attachment, to holding on tightly, to really holding on to our 
      things. We find this greed and attachment everywhere. We hold on tightly 
      to our possessions, don't want to let go of them. The problem is, the more 
      that we have, the more of a burden it becomes. But the practice of giving 
      helps. It's an antidote to stinginess, and by sharing things that we have 
      with others, or letting go of our own selfish self-centeredness, it also 
      helps to open up our minds in loving kindness and compassion. It is an 
      antidote to clinging and craving.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Giving has different forms. 
      You might say there are three degrees of giving. One is called <I>
      one-handed giving.</I> With this degree of giving, you give things away 
      because people ask you, or because u are pressured into it, or because 
      people are looking. But you are also holding on with one hand. You may not 
      really want to give, but, reluctantly, you do. Let's say that a beggar 
      keeps on badgering you. To get rid of him, you give him something. If 
      you've ever traveled in India, you've probably encountered situations 
      where beggars follow you around like a shadow and won't let you go until 
      you finally give them something. That is a form of giving, of sharing with 
      others. But it has a limited value, because, of course, the whole spirit 
      of giving is really letting go. This is letting go to some degree, but not 
      fully.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The second degree of giving 
      is <I>friendly giving.</I> That means you give because you like to give. 
      It feels good. You don't have to pressured into it. Whenever you see 
      somebody in a situation of need, if you have enough for yourself, if you 
      have two of something, you give it out of friendliness. If you have two 
      bananas and somebody is hungry, you usually give them one. That's a higher 
      form giving because you're not being pressured into it-it's coming from 
      your own friendliness, and you're not tightly holding on.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The third degree is called <I>
      kingly giving.</I> In kingly giving, you give anything at any time. You 
      give the shirt off your back. You give the last food you have to someone 
      who is hungrier. Because there's no thought-you give the <I>best</I> that 
      you have. There's no holding on nor even thought of an &quot;I&quot; involved in the 
      giving.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Giving material things may be 
      the easiest form of giving, especially if you have more than enough. Most 
      people, especially in the West, have more than enough. We have closets and 
      garages full stuff; we have clothes that we don't use. Perhaps we clear 
      things out once a year and give them to the Salvation Army or Good Will as 
      a form of giving and generosity. Of course a lot of times, we're clearing 
      our closets of things we don't need because we've got to make room for 
      more things that we're going to accumulate. Giving material things, giving 
      food, giving money to charity, that's all a form of material giving or 
      sharing.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Another form of giving is the 
      giving of your time. That goes a little bit deeper, because your own time 
      is closer to your ego. It's fairly easy to give a beggar a dollar or some 
      extra food if u have enough, but to share your time might be a little bit 
      more difficult. Imagine that your neighbor comes over and says, &quot;Oh, you 
      know, I'm really in a jam, I really need your help this Saturday to help 
      me paint my house.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Saturday! Oh, my God. That's 
      the football game, the soccer match. Can't we do it on Sunday?&quot; Or, &quot;I'll 
      hire my nephew. I'll give him ten dollars and send him on down to help 
      you.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We cling to our own precious 
      time and to our desire to do only what we want. Letting go of our own 
      desires and time to help a person in need is a deeper form of giving.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Sharing our knowledge or 
      talents with others is another way of giving. All these forms of giving- 
      from the material to the mental- are ways of letting go.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Meditation is also a form of 
      giving, of giving up. You might actually say that when we meditate, that's 
      the highest form of giving, because we're giving up whatever is coming 
      through our senses, especially in mindfulness meditation. We're giving up 
      the sound coming to our ear, whether it's a pleasant sound or it's a 
      painful sound, we're just letting it arise and vanish without holding on. 
      If we do cling to it, we try to let go. We try to let go of our thoughts, 
      let go of the pains in our bodies. And of course, ultimately, each of us 
      tries to let go of the self. We let go of the feeling of self in order to 
      realize unconditioned Dhamma and true liberation of mind. For this, even 
      the sense of self has to be let go.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Surely if we cannot let go of 
      material things, of mental things, of emotions such as anger, of other 
      negative states or even of positive states, then when it comes time for 
      it, we won't be able to let go of the self in meditation, to make that 
      quantum leap to the unconditioned experience. Therefore the practice of 
      giving is a whole and complete practice in itself.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In your daily lives you can 
      find many opportunities for practicing giving. You can be especially 
      giving of your time when somebody is in need, for example somebody at work 
      say: &quot;Can you show me how to work this stupid computer?&quot; Show him how to 
      do this, or help her do that, or give in other ways.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There are three foundations 
      of the Dhamma that help us as we practice giving. They are Right 
      Understanding, the first aspect of the Noble Eightfold Path; Right 
      Mindfulness, the seventh aspect, Right Effort, the sixth aspect. All those 
      three work together.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Right understanding 
      understands selfishness and miserliness as being negative states. Right 
      Mindfulness ensures that when selfishness comes back or intervenes, we see 
      it; we notice when our minds are holding on tightly to things. Having 
      become mindful of selfishness and attachment as unwholesome states of 
      mind, we use Right Effort to abandon them when they arise. Practicing 
      Right Effort, we make the effort to prevent and abandon unwholesome 
      states, the effort to cultivate and perfect wholesome states.</FONT></P>
