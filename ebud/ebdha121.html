    <p>In line with the present-day stress on the need for
    religious teachings to be personally relevant and directly
    verifiable, in certain Dhamma circles the time-honored
    Buddhist doctrine of rebirth has come up for severe
    re-examination. Although only a few contemporary Buddhist
    thinkers still go so far as to suggest that this doctrine be
    scrapped as &quot;unscientific,&quot; another opinion has
    been gaining ground to the effect that whether or not rebirth
    itself be a fact, the <i>doctrine</i> of rebirth has no
    essential bearings on the practice of Dhamma and thence no
    claim to an assured place in the Buddhist teachings. The
    Dhamma, it is said, is concerned solely with the here and
    now, with helping us to resolve our personal hangups through
    increased self-awareness and inner honesty. All the rest of
    Buddhism we can now let go as the religious trappings of an
    ancient culture utterly inappropriate for the Dhamma of our
    technological age. </p>
    <p>If we suspend our own predilections for the moment and
    instead go directly to our sources, we come upon the
    indisputable fact that the Buddha himself taught rebirth and
    taught it as a basic tenet of his teaching. Viewed in their
    totality, the Buddha's discourses show us that far from being
    a mere concession to the outlook prevalent in his time or an
    Asiatic cultural contrivance, the doctrine of rebirth has
    tremendous implications for the entire course of Dhamma
    practice, affecting both the aim with which the practice is
    taken up and the motivation with which it is followed through
    to completion. </p>
    <p>The aim of the Buddhist path is liberation from suffering,
    and the Buddha makes it abundantly clear that the suffering
    from which liberation is needed is the suffering of bondage
    to samsara, the round of repeated birth and death. To be
    sure, the Dhamma does have an aspect which is directly
    visible and personally verifiable. By direct inspection of
    our own experience we can see that sorrow, tension, fear and
    grief always arise from our greed, aversion and ignorance,
    and thus can be eliminated with the removal of those
    defilements. The importance of this directly visible side of
    Dhamma practice cannot be underestimated, as it serves to
    confirm our confidence in the liberating efficacy of the
    Buddhist path. However, to downplay the doctrine of rebirth
    and explain the entire import of the Dhamma as the
    amelioration of mental suffering through enhanced
    self-awareness is to deprive the Dhamma of those wider
    perspectives from which it derives its full breadth and
    profundity. By doing so one seriously risks reducing it in
    the end to little more than a sophisticated ancient system of
    humanistic psychotherapy. </p>
    <p>The Buddha himself has clearly indicated that the root
    problem of human existence is not simply the fact that we are
    vulnerable to sorrow, grief and fear, but that we tie
    ourselves through our egoistic clinging to a constantly
    self-regenerating pattern of birth, aging, sickness and death
    within which we undergo the more specific forms of mental
    affliction. He has also shown that the primary danger in the
    defilements is their causal role in sustaining the round of
    rebirths. As long as they remain unabandoned in the deep
    strata of the mind, they drag us through the round of
    becoming in which we shed a flood of tears &quot;greater than
    the waters of the ocean.&quot; When these points are
    carefully considered, we then see that the practice of Dhamma
    does not aim at providing us with a comfortable
    reconciliation with our present personalities and our
    situation in the world, but at initiating a far-reaching
    inner transformation which will issue in our deliverance from
    the cycle of worldly existence in its entirety. </p>
    <p>Admittedly, for most of us the primary motivation for
    entering upon the path of Dhamma has been a gnawing sense of
    dissatisfaction with the routine course of our unenlightened
    lives rather than a keen perception of the dangers in the
    round of rebirths. However, if we are going to follow the
    Dhamma through to its end and tap its full potential for
    conferring peace and higher wisdom, it is necessary for the
    motivation of our practice to mature beyond that which
    originally induced us to enter the path. Our underlying
    motivation must grow towards those essential truths disclosed
    to us by the Buddha and, encompassing those truths, must use
    them to nourish its own capacity to lead us towards the
    realization of the goal. </p>
    <p>Our motivation acquires the requisite maturity by the
    cultivation of right view, the first factor of the Noble
    Eightfold Path, which as explained by the Buddha includes an
    understanding of the principles of kamma and rebirth as
    fundamental to the structure of our existence. Though
    contemplating the moment is the key to the development of
    insight meditation, it would be an erroneous extreme to hold
    that the practice of Dhamma consists wholly in maintaining
    mindfulness of the present. The Buddhist path stresses the
    role of wisdom as the instrument of deliverance, and wisdom
    must comprise not only a penetration of the moment in its
    vertical depths, but a comprehension of the past and future
    horizons within which our present existence unfolds. To take
    full cognizance of the principle of rebirth will give us that
    panoramic perspective from which we can survey our lives in
    their broader context and total network of relationships.
    This will spur us on in our own pursuit of the path and will
    reveal the profound significance of the goal towards which
    our practice points, the end of the cycle of rebirths as
    mind's final liberation from suffering. </p>
