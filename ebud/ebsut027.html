    <h3><a name="intro"><font color="#000080">Translator's
    Introduction</font></a></h3>
    <p>This, the first book in the <strong>Khuddaka Nikaya</strong>
    (Collection of Short Discourses), appears to have been
    designed as a primer for novice monks and nuns. In nine short
    passages it covers the basic topics that one would need to
    know in beginning Buddhist monastic life; many of the
    passages also serve as useful introductions to Buddhist
    practice in general. Passages <a href="#1">1</a> and <a
    href="#2">2</a> cover the ceremony for taking ordination as a
    novice. Passage <a href="#3">3</a> gives preliminary guidance
    in the contemplation of the body, a meditation exercise
    designed to overcome lust. Passage <a href="#4">4</a>
    introduces many of the basic categories of analysis through
    which discernment can be developed, beginning with the most
    basic formulation of the causal principle so central to the
    Buddha's teaching. Passage <a href="#5">5</a> gives an
    overview of the practice as a whole -- beginning with the
    need to associate with wise people, and ending with the
    attainment of Unbinding (nibbana/nirvana). This overview is
    presented in the context of the concept of protective
    rituals, and makes the point that -- given the nature of
    human action and its results -- the best protection comes not
    from rituals but from acting in a generous, moral, and wise
    manner. Passage <a href="#6">6</a> expands both on Passage <a
    href="#1">1</a> and Passage <a href="#5">5</a>, detailing
    some of the virtues of the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha, while
    at the same time elaborating on the practice of meditation
    and the attainment of Stream Entry -- the point at which the
    meditator has his/her first glimpse of Unbinding. Passage <a
    href="#7">7</a> elaborates on the theme of generosity,
    showing how gifts to the Sangha can be dedicated to the
    welfare of one's dead relatives. Passage <a href="#8">8</a>
    presents meritorious action in general as an investment more
    reliable and longer-lasting than material investments.
    Passage <a href="#9">9</a> returns to the subject of
    meditation, focusing on the development of good will and
    lovingkindness. </p>
    <p>These nine passages, in different contexts, are frequently
    chanted in Theravada countries even today. Lay and ordained
    Buddhists chant Passage <a href="#1">1</a> daily, as an
    affirmation of their refuge in the Triple Gem. Monks will
    often chant Passages <a href="#5">5</a>-<a href="#9">9</a> as
    blessings when lay people make merit, and frequently use
    verses from Passage <a href="#5">5</a> as sermon themes. </p>
    <p>Thus the passages contained in this book serve as a useful
    introduction both to early Buddhist training and to modern
    Theravada practices. </p>

        The <strong>Maha Nidana Suttanta [D. 15]</strong>
        describes the eight emancipations as follows: </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>&quot;Possessed of form, one sees forms. This is
            the first emancipation. </p>
            <p>&quot;Not percipient of form internally, one sees
            forms externally. This is the second emancipation. </p>
            <p>&quot;One is intent only on the beautiful. This is
            the third emancipation. With the complete
            transcending of perceptions of [physical] form, with
            the disappearance of perceptions of resistance, and
            not heeding perceptions of diversity, thinking,
            'Infinite space,' one enters and remains in the
            sphere of the infinitude of space. This is the fourth
            emancipation. With the complete transcending of the
            sphere of the infinitude of space, thinking,
            'Infinite consciousness,' one enters and remains in
            the sphere of the infinitude of consciousness. This
            is the fifth emancipation. </p>
            <p>&quot;With the complete transcending of the sphere
            of the infinitude of consciousness, thinking, 'There
            is nothing,' one enters and remains in the sphere of
            nothingness. This is the sixth emancipation. </p>
            <p>&quot;With the complete transcending of the sphere
            of nothingness, one enters and remains in the sphere
            of neither perception nor non-perception. This is the
            seventh emancipation. </p>
            <p>&quot;With the complete transcending of the sphere
            of neither perception nor non-perception, one enters
            and remains in the cessation of perception and
            feeling. This is the eighth emancipation. </p>
            <p>&quot;Now, when a monk attains these eight
            emancipations in forward order, in reverse order, in
            forward and reverse order, when he attains them and
            emerges from them wherever he wants, however he
            wants, and for as long as he wants, when through the
            ending of the mental fermentations he enters and
            remains in the fermentation-free release of awareness
            and release of discernment, having directly known it
            and realized it in the here and now, he is said to be
            a monk released in both ways. And as for another
            release in both ways, higher or more sublime than
            this, there is none.&quot; [<a href="#8ref4">Go back</a>]
