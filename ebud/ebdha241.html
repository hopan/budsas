      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="6">T</FONT>his year marks the 
      250th anniversary of the establishment of the Siam Nikaya. On Saturday the 
      20th of July 1753 on the full moon day of Asela, Upali Thera of Siam and 
      his retinue who had arrived in Kandy, conferred on the Sinhala monks the 
      gift of the Upasampada, which had long disappeared from the island. </FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This was achieved with the active support 
      of two kings, Boromakot (1733-1758) or Dhammika as he is called in the 
      Mahavamsa and Kirti Sri Rajasinghe King of Kandy (1747-1782). The 
      outstanding personalities connected with the event were the saintly and 
      erudite Upali Maha Thera on the Thai side and the indefatigable 
      Saranamkara Thera on the Sinhala side. The establishment of the Siam 
      Nikaya was the climax of centuries of endeavour on the part of the Sri 
      Lankan rulers and it is considered an event of singular importance in the 
      religious, cultural and political history of the island and is recorded in 
      elaborate detail not only in the Mahavamsa but also in several 
      contemporary and near contemporary literary works, some of which are not 
      yet published. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Saturday, the 20th of July 1753 was the 
      full moon day of Asela. That night the king brimming with joy went to the 
      preaching hall on foot and placed his head at the feet of the Siamese 
      monks, offered a fan and with all reverence invited them to perform the 
      Upasampada. In the presence of the king the following Sri Lankan monks 
      were admitted to the Higher Ordination with Upali Thera as their Upadhya 
      and Brahamajothi Thera and Mahapunna Thera as their Acariyas. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>Training in ecclesiastical procedure</B>
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Having accomplished their main task which 
      was the result of centuries of effort by a series of rulers, Upali Thera 
      and his associates did not stop here because there was much more to be 
      done. It was mentioned that the study of the Pali language and practices 
      relating to monastic discipline had been grossly neglected in Sri Lanka, 
      so much so that even the most basic ecclesiastical procedures had gone 
      into abeyance. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Upali Thera had to teach the Sinhala monks 
      the basic procedures and even the Kammavaca or the Pali formula recited at 
      the performance of ecclesiastical acts like pabbajja (ordination) and 
      Upasampada (Higher Ordination). </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">These rules are laid down in the Upali 
      Kathikavata or set of rules formulated by Upali Thera which is available 
      in Thailand. When requested a copy of the Kammavaca had been sent by king 
      Dhammika to Sri Lanka and a fragment of this is still available in the 
      library of the Malvatta Vihara in Kandy. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The newly ordained bhikkhus were given 
      instruction in the performance of the Patimokkha ritual, which was vital 
      for the Buddhist monastic community to maintain and establish its purity 
      and exercise control over its miscreants. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Following the Thai royal tradition, Kirti 
      Sri Rajasinha, invited the Thai bhikkhus and Sinhala bhikkhus to observe 
      the Vassavasa or rains retreat, a monastic practice coming down from the 
      time of the Buddha, which ensures that monks are confined to one monastery 
      for three months during the heavy rainy season and ends with the Kathina 
      festival. During the period of the retreat, Upali thera with great wisdom 
      and foresight admitted 97 samaneras belonging to both Malvatta and 
      Asgiriya Viharas to the Higher Ordination. Thus Upali thera's endeavour 
      helped to restore the sangha, revive monastic practices and strengthen it 
      numerically. The dearth of monks in the island would have convinced him 
      that many more were needed to ensure the stability of Buddhism in the face 
      of many dangers for years to come. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Upali thera's commitment and thoroughness 
      in performing the task expected of him is clear when he effected the 
      delimitation of ecclesiastical boundaries within which the sangha was 
      expected to perform its activities according to Vinaya rules. All monastic 
      rites like the pabbajja, Upasampada and patimokkha had to be done within a 
      consecrated venue (sima) or boundary. A great deal of importance is 
      attached to the ritualistic validity of the (sima) and Upali thera 
      demonstrated and explained in detail to the Sinhala monks, the procedure 
      of the delimitation of the sima and the ritual connected with it. </FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>Kathina ceremony</B> </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">On the full moon day of November 1753 
      which fell on the 9th Saturday, the Kathina ceremony which signified the 
      end of the rains retreat was celebrated in great splendour with people 
      from all parts of the island and also foreign merchants assembling in 
      Kandy. This too was the impact of Thailand where the Kathina Ceremony was 
      a magnificent one with the royal family participating, offering new robes 
      and lavish gifts to the priesthood. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It was the practice in Thailand then and 
      now and even in Sri Lanka from ancient times that the robes offered to the 
      Sangha at the Kathina Ceremony should be prepared within one day - that is 
      spinning the yarn, weaving the cloth, cutting up the robes and sewing and 
      dyeing them. The robes, thus prepared in the traditional manner were taken 
      by the king in procession and offered first to the Temple of the Tooth 
      Relic and then to all the bhikkhus who observed the rains retreat. </FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">At the successful conclusion of all these 
      significant events, Kirti Sri Rajasinha brimming with gratitude towards 
      his royal brother King Boromakot of Thailand held on the 14th October 
      1753, an exhibition of the Tooth Relic for the benefit of the Thai monks 
      and envoys. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The transformation of the Asela Perahera 
      into the Dalada Perahera </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Tooth Relic or the Dalada was brought 
      to Sri Lanka in the reign of Kirti Sri Meghavarna who ruled in 
      Anuradhapura (303-331). The Mahavansa says that a great deal of money was 
      spent in celebrating the festival in honour of the Relic and the King 
      decreed that the Relic should be taken round the city of Anuradhapura 
      annually. There is evidence to show that his decree was faithfully carried 
      out by his successors for the well known Chinese traveller Fa Hsien who 
      visited India and Sri Lanka in the 5th century describes in elaborate 
      detail this magnificent festival. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Devale Peraharas that form a part of 
      the Asela Perahara today did not form a part of the procession in Fa 
      Hsien's time. Somewhere down the line the practice of taking the Tooth 
      Relic in procession annually seems to have gone into abeyance very likely 
      due to security reasons, as the Relic became the symbol of royalty. </FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Asela Perahara of the 17th century as 
      reported by Robert Knox consisted only of the Dewale Peraharas honouring 
      the Hindu and Mahayana deities namely, Natha, Vishnu, Kataragama and 
      Pattini. Upali Thera who witnessed this was quite perturbed that in the 
      heart of a Buddhist country, the deities should be honoured in all 
      pageantry and the Buddha ignored. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is said that as a result of the 
      agitation caused by Upali Thera, the King ordered that henceforth &quot;Gods 
      and men should follow the Buddha&quot;, in the procession. This is how the 
      Tooth Relic of the Buddha became the focus of the Asela Maha Perahera. 
      This indeed is a great service that Upali Thera has rendered to Sri Lanka, 
      for this procession which is now held in honour of the Tooth Relic is the 
      greatest event in the entire Buddhist world. The second mission from 
      Thailand in January 1756 </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Once the Order of Bhikkus was firmly 
      established and definite steps were taken for the maintaining of 
      discipline, the need was felt for the training of newly ordained monks in 
      meditation and the study of Buddhist texts. It is to meet this need that 
      King Boromakot of Siam sent 16 theras and 11 novices. The most prominent 
      members of this mission were Suvisuddhacariya Maha Thera and Varananamuni 
      Anu Thera. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The former belonged to the Vidarsanadhura 
      - the school of monks who were committed to higher forms of meditation and 
      the latter belonged to the Granthadhura, the school of monks who were 
      devoted to the study of sacred texts. The two leaders of the delegation 
      were apparently masters in their respective spheres. The monks brought 
      with them 97 books that were not found in Sri Lanka and for the next 4 
      years worked for the welfare of the Sri Lankan Sangha. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>The purge of the Sangha</B> </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Once the Order was established the king 
      found it necessary to hold a convocation to purge the sangha of its 
      undesirable elements, advise those bhikkhus who remained, and promulgate a 
      set of disciplinary rules for their guidance. On several occasions before 
      this rulers had attempted this task and Kirti Sri Rajasingha was following 
      their example. He gathered the support of pious monks like Saranankara and 
      &quot;ordered an investigation, took strong measures against them (impious 
      monks) and had them seriously admonished, that from now onwards those who 
      had renounced the world, should forever avoid unseemly tasks like 
      astrology, medical activity and the like and should foster the words of 
      the Buddha&quot;. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The impact of the Thai contact and the 
      services rendered by Upali Thera cannot be over estimated. If, after a 
      series of mishaps, he did not arrive in 1753, subsequent events in Sri 
      Lanka and Thailand prove beyond doubt that the Siam Nikaya would never 
      have been established in Sri Lanka and certainly not under a Buddhist 
      king. King Boromakot the magnanimous ruler whose tireless efforts 
      facilitated the restoration of the sangha in Sri Lanka died in 1758 and 
      the country was plunged in a fratricidal struggle for the throne. During 
      the reign of his son Ekatat (1758-1767) the Burmese sacked Ayutthia in 
      1767 which ended its existence as the Thai metropolis. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This was the most terrible blow to 
      Thailand as most of her treasures both material and cultural were lost for 
      ever. In this situation the cordial relations with Sri Lanka and the 
      exchange of missions could never have taken place. On the Sri Lankan side 
      the situation was not much better. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">For soon after the arrival of the second 
      mission trouble was brewing between the king of Kandy and the Dutch. The 
      Dutch invaded Kandy in 1765 while the king and the royal family went into 
      hiding. The Temple of the Tooth which was the target of their attack was 
      looted, the king's palace was razed to the ground and the rest of the city 
      lay at the mercy of the Hollander. After the invaders retreated the king 
      regained his throne. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">However, the atmosphere in Kandy, the 
      strained relationship with the Dutch and the confusion in Ayutthia was not 
      conducive for diplomatic relations to take place. In the last and 
      auspicious moment in 1753 the Upasampada was restored and it proved to be 
      an unqualified success. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Summarising the impact of the Thai contact 
      it must be emplahsized that it retrieved Buddhism from the darkest chasm 
      it had fallen into, during its long history of 2300 years in the island. 
      The extinction of the sangha means the virtual disappearance of Buddhism 
      from the island. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This had happened before during the Cola 
      interregnum when the monks either disrobed or fled to South India and 
      Burma to escape the harassments of the invaders. Matters were soon 
      rectified by Vijabahu I (1055-1110) who held pabbajja and upasampada 
      ceremonies and regenerated the Order. This practice was continued by 
      successive rulers who thus quantitively and qualitatively strengthened the 
      sangha. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">By the 16th century the situation had 
      changed for the worst and a new danger threatened the very survival of 
      Buddhism in Sri Lanka - the onslaught of Christian missionary enterprise - 
      Kandy had now become the last bulwark of independent Buddhism. The once 
      flourishing monasteries of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa were in ruins and 
      the maritime provinces were ruled by Christian powers. The time and 
      resources of the king of Kandy was exhausted in his attempts to maintain 
      the sovereignty of his kingdom so that he had little time for matters 
      spiritual. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The island was devoid of the yellow robe, 
      the monasteries came to be occupied by a set of degenerate, corrupt 
      persons called ganas. Many temple libraries had been burnt down by the 
      Portuguese invaders and also on the orders of Rajasinha I of Sitawaka and 
      Pali learning grossly neglected. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This was the tragic situation when 
      Thailand stepped in on the orders of King Boromakot of Ayuthia. The 
      restoration of the Upasampada was only, one of Upali Theras many 
      achievements. In addition he set up simas or consecrated boundaries in 25 
      places in the country for the correct performance of ecclesiastical rites.
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Three or four centuries ago the Sihala 
      sangha gave instruction to the entire Buddhist world on these matters and 
      Sri Lanka was looked upon as the repository of the pure Theravada 
      tradition. In the 18th century the Sinhala monks had to learn the correct 
      intonation of the Kammavaca from the Thai monks. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">With the arrival of the second mission 
      (1756), the Granthadhura and the Vidarsanadhura, which too was taken from 
      Sri Lanka earlier was reintroduced. Thus Upali Thera's work was completed 
      in every possible way. It could be mentioned that the scholar monks who 
      kept the flame of learning alive during the 19th century all belonged to 
      the pupillary succession of Saranankara Thera who was a pupil of Upali 
      Thera. </FONT></P>
