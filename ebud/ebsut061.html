        Introduction</SPAN></B></FONT></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">An 
        often discussed subject in early Buddhist discourses is the post-mortem 
        status of arahant. The four questions whether an arahant exists, does 
        not exist, both or neither, after his death is a frequently asked set of 
        questions in these discourses. In contrast, there is relatively less 
        discussion on the arahant who is living. Still less is discussion on 
        differences in qualitative sense among arahants. A reader of the Pali 
        canon tends to get the idea that arahants are basically a homogeneous 
        group of people. This is not hard to understand in the context of early 
        Buddhism represented in the Pali Nikayas which seem to consider the 
        Buddha himself as one of the arahants </SPAN>
        <A HREF="#_edn1" NAME="_ednref1" TITLE>

        [1]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">. The tradition, nevertheless, 
        did recognize differences between the Buddha and arahants. As has been 
        explained in discourses such as Gopaka Moggallana sutta</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn2" NAME="_ednref2" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[2]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US"> 
        the Buddha was “knower of the way, an understander of the way and 
        skilled in the way” (‘<I>maggannu, maggavidu, maggakovido</I>’) whereas 
        the disciples are “the followers of the way” (‘<I>magganuga</I>’). In 
        discourses such as Nagara sutta</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn3" NAME="_ednref3" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[3]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US"> 
        the Buddha, who discovered the Noble Eightfold Path and reached Nirvana 
        having followed it, has been compared to a pioneer who discovers a lost 
        path following which he reaches an ancient city. Although this 
        distinction has been made, the early discourses do not make much of a 
        distinction between arahanthood attained by the Buddha and an arahant 
        who follows the advice of the former. According to the 
        Samannaphala-sutta</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn4" NAME="_ednref4" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[4]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US"> 
        in which the Buddha is presented as detailing the fruits of monkhood to 
        be realized within this life itself, there are three kinds of knowledge, 
        namely, the knowledge of recollecting one’s own past births (<I>pubbenivasa 
        anussati nana</I>), the knowledge of departure and arrival of <I>beings 
        (sattanam cutupapata nana</I>) and the knowledge of the extinction of 
        defilements (<I>asavakkhaya nana</I>), marking the culmination of the 
        path leading to the nirvanic goal. Now it is these very same three 
        knowledges that the Buddha realized when he attained Buddhahood and the 
        disciples realized when attained arahanthood by following the Master. 
        Perhaps this may have prompted the early Buddhists to talk about 
        similarities rather than differences of arahants. We, nevertheless, know 
        that talking about similarities is not exciting. Talking about 
        differences, particularly in negative sense, may lead, on the other 
        hand, to contradict what discourses seem to be saying in one voice.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">There 
        are discussions on the differences among arahants in so far as their 
        positive spiritual faculties are concerned. The idea behind naming 
        different arahants as having achieved excellence in different aspects of 
        monastic training is that there are differences in abilities and 
        propensities among arahants</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn5" NAME="_ednref5" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[5]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">. 
        What is mentioned in this manner may be considered not very significant 
        in so far as they lead only to minor variations in behaviour. Obviously 
        this seems to be the way that these differences have been understood in 
        the tradition. If the differences, however, go beyond that and if such 
        differences among the key disciples of the Buddha were so important as 
        to influence the course of the Sasana I think it is worth discussing 
        them.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">In 
        undertaking to write this paper I believe that the personality 
        differences between the great elders of the Theravada tradition have 
        influenced its future path in a decisive manner. In fact, according to 
        the tradition the Venerable Ananda was not an arahant until after the 
        parinirvana of the Buddha. Except his involvement in the first sangayana 
        almost everything else we mention of him belongs to his life as a 
        non-arahant. But there is no doubt that, in so far as the history of 
        Theravada is concerned, Ananda was the most notable and influential 
        non-arahant bhikkhu during and after the Buddha. The thesis of the paper 
        is that the formation of Theravada tradition owes much to sharp 
        personality differences and the resultant differences of the ways of 
        living of the two elders Maha Kassapa and Ananda. In order to support 
        this thesis first I will make a study of the lives of the two elders 
        including their function and role in the first sangayana and 
        subsequently I will show how some of the key trends in Theravada have 
        their origin in the life and the philosophy of these two great elders.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B>
        <SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size:14.0pt;color:navy">Maha Kassapa</SPAN></B></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">In the 
        Theravada tradition the great elder Maha Kassapa occupies a very special 
        place. Though he is not the oldest nor is he one of the two highest 
        among the disciples of the Buddha (namely, Sariputta and Moggallana) 
        Maha Kassapa has played a crucial role, quite different from the roles 
        played by other important arahants, in the formation of the Sasana. For 
        instance, the two highest disciples of the Buddha, Sariputta and 
        Moggallana, have played a very important role in spreading the word of 
        the Buddha and maintaining the stability of the Sasana. No doubt these 
        leading disciples and many others with similar ranking were quite 
        prominent during the time of the Buddha. Maha Kassapa’s case, however, 
        is different. Compared to other great disciples Maha Kassapa’s physical 
        presence was less visible among the Sangha for he had chosen to live in 
        the forest during most of his monastic life although he made frequent 
        visits to see the Buddha. In the history of Buddhism, however, his 
        presence has been quite visible. At the parinirvana of the Buddha Maha 
        Kassapa comes out of his seclusion and takes over the Sasana and lays 
        the foundation of what has come to be known as Theravada.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">
        Although Maha Kassapa was a disciple of the Buddha like any other his 
        relationship with the latter seems somewhat different from that of other 
        great or ordinary disciples. The usual nature of the relation between 
        the Buddha and a disciple seems to have been characterized by a deep 
        sense of respect on the part of the disciple and hence creating a 
        distance from the master. With Maha Kassapa, although he too had a great 
        respect to the Buddha, relationship was closer in the sense that the 
        latter had considered the former to be equal to him in some sense.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">There 
        is a very interesting and unusual incident taking place between the 
        Buddha and Maha Kassapa right after the latter’s realization of 
        arahanthood. It is the act of exchanging robes: the Buddha on seeing the 
        fine upper robe offered to him by Kassapa as a seat-spread appreciates 
        how refine it was. Upon this Kassapa offered his robe to the Buddha and 
        he, in turn, gave Kassapa his own upper robe which was quite coarse and 
        unrefined. In the Theravada tradition, of course, this is understood as 
        a very special favour on the part of the Buddha bestowed on Maha 
        Kassapa. Apart from that, however, the tradition does not seem to 
        attribute any further significance to this act. The later Mahayana 
        tradition, however, seems to read this act in a different manner. 
        According to the Chinese tradition Maha Kassapa is believed to be the 
        first patriarch who received the Buddha’s robe. It is significant that 
        they believe that Ananda, who in turn received the transmission of 
        Dhamma from Maha Kassapa, is the second. The Mahayana idea seems to be 
        in consonant with the later development of esoterism in the Buddhist 
        tradition. But Theravada did not develop such an attitude and hence did 
        not develop any particular individual monk to be the in-charge or owner 
        of the Dhamma. Nevertheless, in the Theravada tradition too, it is 
        recorded that Maha Kassapa had the Buddha’s alms bowl in his possession 
        as the de facto head of the Sasana and subsequently he chose Ananda to 
        be his successor to receive the Buddha’s alms bowl</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn6" NAME="_ednref6" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[6]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">. 
        The significance of the story, however, is that both Hinayana and 
        Mahayana traditions accept the authority of Maha Kassapa without debate.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">
        Another story that testifies to the high recognition that Maha Kassapa 
        enjoyed among the Buddhist traditions other than Theravada has been told 
        by Hui Neng, the sixth patriarch of Mahayana tradition. The story 
        (occurring in Taisho #1228) is as follows: Once the Buddha sitting in 
        the middle of monks picked up a flower and raised it up. Of the monks 
        gathered only Maha Kassapa could understand the meaning of this act by 
        the Buddha and smiled by way of response. It is said that through this 
        silent conversation between the Master and the Disciple Zen tradition 
        was born.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The 
        Theravada tradition does not highlight very much Maha Kassapa’s wisdom 
        as Mahayana seems to be doing. On the contrary, it highlights his 
        austere way of life. Anguttaranikaya contains a long list of disciples 
        of the Buddha acclaimed as excelling in different aspects of religious 
        life. While Sariputta, the first great disciple, is acclaimed as 
        excelling in wisdom Maha Kassapa is acclaimed as excelling in observing 
        austere practices (dhutanga)</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn7" NAME="_ednref7" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[7]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">There 
        are instances in the discourses that cause us to think that the Buddha 
        considered Maha Kassapa in some sense as worthy of acting on behalf of 
        him. According to one discourse in the Samyuttanikaya (section on 
        Kassapa) the Buddha makes the following request from Maha Kassapa:
        </SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">- Exhort 
        the Bhikkhus, Kassapa, give them a Dhamma talk. Either I should exhort 
        the Bhikkhus, Kassapa, or you should. Either I should give them a Dhamma 
        talk or you should</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn8" NAME="_ednref8" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[8]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">When 
        the Buddha says “either I or you, Kassapa ...” the indication is that 
        Maha Kassapa is second only to the Buddha or it could even be 
        interpreted as saying that both the Buddha and Maha Kassapa are equal in 
        this regard. In fact the Commentary seems to come close to this second 
        reading. It says: </SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">- He 
        [the Buddha] says this in order to appoint Maha Kassapa to his own 
        position. But weren’t Sariputta and Moggallana around? They were, but he 
        thought: “They will not live much longer, but Kassapa will live until 
        the age of 120. After my parinibbabana he will hold a recital of the 
        Dhamma and the Vinaya in the Sattapanni cave, and he will enable my 
        Dispensation to endure for a full 5000 years. Let me appoint him to my 
        own position</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn9" NAME="_ednref9" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[9]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">.
        </SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">
        Whatever manner should we understand the statement one thing is clear: 
        the Buddha has placed Maha Kassapa on a position second only to that of 
        himself.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">In 
        another discourse the Buddha compares his higher attainments with those 
        of Maha Kassapa. These attainments include the four rupa jhanas, four 
        arupa jhanas, various kinds of psychic power (iddhividha), divine ear, 
        understanding the minds of other beings and persons, recollection of 
        past births, divine eye and the taintless liberation of mind. The Buddha 
        says:</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">- 
        Bhikkhus, by the destruction of the taints, in this very life I enter 
        and dwell in the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, 
        realizing it for myself with direct knowledge. Kassapa too by the 
        destruction of the taints, in this very life enters and dwells in the 
        taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, realizing it for 
        himself with direct knowledge. (Bhikkhu Bodhi I p.674)</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The 
        discourse poses several problems about the nature of an arahant. The 
        higher attainments listed here are usually described as common property 
        of many arahants</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn10" NAME="_ednref10" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[10]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">. 
        If that is the case what is the meaning of the Buddha’s highlighting of 
        Maha Kassapa’s attainments in particular? Since Maha Kassapa is a savaka 
        of the Buddha like any other his realization is ultimately dependent on 
        the guidance given by the Buddha. In this sense he cannot be different 
        from any other arahant. It is commonly accepted that there can be 
        differences among arahants in so far their super-human attainments are 
        concerned. But again the understanding given in most of the discourses 
        is that anyone attaining arahanthood does so by achieving ‘three 
        sciences’ (<I>tisso vijja</I>). As described in the Mahasaccaka-sutta 
        (Majjhimanikaya: 36) it<B> </B>is the same three sciences that the 
        Buddha realized in attaining the Buddhahood. Therefore there cannot be, 
        according to the discourses, a difference among arahants in their 
        destruction of taints, the final knowledge which completes one’s 
        transfer from being an ordinary worldling (<I>puthujjana</I>) to a 
        consummate noble person (<I>ariya puggala</I>). The attainment of 
        arahanthood of any arahant is described in the words (quoted above) used 
        by the Buddha in describing Maha Kassapa’s attainment. Although all the 
        arahants are similar to one another in being taintless they could be 
        different in their ability and mastery over some of the psychic 
        attainments. In this sense one arahant can be considered as lower or 
        higher to another arahant, not in kind but in degree. </SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">In 
        fact, in describing the Maha Kassapa in those words, the discourse does 
        not say anything new or extra-ordinary about him. Either the discourse 
        says that Maha Kassapa is equal to the Buddha in all respects, which is 
        impossible, or it says that he is like any other arahant, which is to 
        make the discourses meaningless. We must not forget, however, that, 
        describing the event of exchange of robes, the Commentator describes 
        Maha Kassapa as ‘buddha patibhaga’ or ‘one comparable to the Buddha’</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn11" NAME="_ednref11" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[11]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">. 
        This indicates that the tradition placed Maha Kassapa much higher than 
        the other arahants, next only to the Buddha. </SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">In the 
        tradition there are several other instances indicative of the very 
        special status of Maha Kassapa. As Maha Kassapa himself describes, he 
        was already a renunciant when he met the Buddha. He asks the Buddha to 
        accept him as a savaka and the Buddha does so and instructs him. He says 
        (S. II. p.221) that he achieved liberating knowledge on the eighth day 
        of his admission to the Sasana. It is on this day that the Buddha 
        exchanges robes with him. This, no doubt, is a very high honour 
        conferred on the new comer. (As we discussed earlier it had lot of 
        implications for the later Buddhist tradition.) In describing this 
        extraordinary act, the commentary says:</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">-&nbsp;The 
        Buddha exchanged the robe with the Elder saying: This robe worn out by 
        wearing by the Tathagata cannot be worn by one who has only a little 
        virtue. This must be worn by one who is strong, capable of completing 
        practice of virtues and a born-wearer of rag-robes</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn12" NAME="_ednref12" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[12]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The 
        Commentary further says that Maha Kassapa also realized the gravity of 
        the event; never became arrogant to think that there is nothing more to 
        be achieved but stayed alone with the Buddha and attained arahanthood. 
        In one of the dialogues with Ananda (which we will discuss in detail 
        later) Maha Kassapa reminds the latter of all the special ways the 
        Buddha had treated him and the exalted position given to him. In 
        addition to this, there is a belief that Maha Kassapa was looking very 
        much like the Buddha physically. According to a story occurring in the 
        Pujavaliya, an ancient Sinhala literary work belonging to the 13<SUP>th</SUP> 
        century (ch.34), due to this physical similarity, an elderly female 
        devotee, offered alms to Maha Kassapa regularly, mistook the Buddha to 
        be Maha Kassapa and offered alms to the former. Not knowing what 
        happened Maha Kassapa came after the Buddha to receive alms from the 
        devotee. Recognizing her ‘mistake’ she took back what she offered to the 
        Buddha and gave it to Maha Kassapa. It is said that Maha Kassapa felt 
        very uncomfortable about the whole episode and as a result made a

        Another characteristic of the relation between the Master and the 
        Disciple emerges from an incident in which Maha Kassapa is portrayed as 
        not quite accepting but politely refusing a request made by the Buddha. 
        At one point the Buddha makes the following suggestion to Maha Kassapa:
        </SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">- You 
        are old now, Kassapa, and those worn-out hempen rag-robes must be 
        burdensome for you. Therefore you should wear robes offered by 
        householders, Kassapa, accept meals given on invitation and dwell close 
        to me</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn13" NAME="_ednref13" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[13]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Maha 
        Kassapa responds to this by reminding the Buddha that he has been 
        observing these practices for a long time in his life and that he has 
        been doing so for his own happiness as well as out of kindness to the 
        later generations. The Buddha withdraws his request and allows Maha 
        Kassapa to continue with his austere practices. The behaviour of Maha 
        Kassapa in this context is not typical of a disciple of the Buddha. 
        Usually what could have happened at this kind of occasion is that the 
        disciple would abide by the request of the Master. We must not forget, 
        however, that the issue does not involve any ethical or moral issue and, 
        furthermore, Maha Kassapa does not directly refuse the Buddha’s request. 
        He simply makes his intentions very clear and the Buddha respects them. 
        According to the Jataka stories, Nyanaponika and Hecker maintain that 
        Maha Kassapa was connected with the Bodhisatva for nineteen times and of 
        them six times as his father, two times as his brother and other times 
        friend or teacher.</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn14" NAME="_ednref14" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[14]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US"> 
        It is noteworthy that Maha Kassapa in the past has had connections with 
        Buddha only as his senior, superior or collegue but not as his junior or 
        inferior. All this evidence points to one conclusion: the relationship 
        between the Buddha and Maha Kassapa was substantially different from the 
        kind of relationship that is typical between the Master and a disciple.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">It is 
        possible that at least some of the disciples of the Buddha were not very 
        convinced of the high position occupied by Maha Kassapa. An important 
        clue is available in the comments made by the disgruntled nun 
        Thullananda. The episode, which we will refer to again in our discussion 
        of Ananda, is connected to Ananda’s wandering on tour in the area called 
        Dakkhinagiri mostly with new recruits to the Sasana without much 
        training. By the time the group returned Rajagaha a large number of 
        these monks had left sasana to return to lay life. Seeing this Maha 
        Kassapa reprimanded Ananda rather severely and called him a youngster 
        who did not know his limits</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn15" NAME="_ednref15" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[15]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">

        Hearing this conversation between the two elders, Thullananda, a nun who 
        did not like Maha Kassapa calling Ananda a youngster, expressed her 
        displeasure by remarking: how can Master Kassapa <B>who was formerly a 
        member of another sect </B>(<I>annatitthiyapubbo samano</I>), think to 
        disparage Master Ananda... (emphasis added)</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn16" NAME="_ednref16" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[16]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">? 
        This piece of gossip provides a glimpse of the kind of perception, at 
        least, some of the disciples had towards Maha Kassapa. Here again, if 
        this statement is meant to say that Maha Kassapa, before becoming a 
        follower of the Buddha, was a follower of a different religious group it 
        does not say anything extra-ordinary for there were many others like him 
        who were former members of other religious groups. For instance, even 
        the two chief disciples of the Buddha belonged to Sanjaya 
        Belatthiputta’s group before they became the followers of the Buddha. 
        But we do not find any similar remarks made on them. If so what is so 
        special in Maha Kassapa’s position to be singled out? A possible 
        explanation of the situation is that Thullananda’s remark arises from 
        the unusual manner Maha Kassapa was admitted to the disciple-hood by the 
        Buddha. In accepting Maha Kassapa as a disciple it seems that the Buddha 
        had to assert his superiority over the former by saying the following:
        </SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">
        -
        Kassapa, if one who does not know and see should say to a disciple so 
        single-minded as yourself: “I know, I see,” his head would split. But 
        knowing Kassapa, I say, “I know, I see.”</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn17" NAME="_ednref17" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[17]</SPAN></SPAN></A></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The 
        statement can be interpreted as the Buddha trying, so to say, to justify 
        his position as the teacher of Maha Kassapa. This is also somewhat 
        unusual to the normal practice. As we saw in the discussion above there 
        is no direct reference in the discourses that the Buddha gave him 
        pabbajja or upsampada when he was accepted as a disciple. Maha Kassapa 
        was accepted as he was. Perhaps as a result of this Maha Kassapa may 
        have been perceived by others as still not totally belonging to the 
        Sasana. He may have been perceived as some kind of outsider. </SPAN></P>

        noted earlier, the life of Maha Kassapa was characterized by 
        austerities. In the Theragatha the following account attributed to Maha

        with unexpected experiences at times:</SPAN></P>

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The 
        attitude to austere practices in the early monastic tradition seems to 
        be one of accepting them as valuable but not making them compulsory or 
        encouraging them for their own sake. In a well known incident Devadatta 
        demanded that some of these practices be made compulsory for all monks 
        for all the time which the Buddha refused</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn19" NAME="_ednref19" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[19]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">. 
        The Buddha’s response was that one may do or do not do according to 
        one’s wish. There are instances (Samyuttanikaya II pp.202-3), however, 
        the Buddha joining Maha Kassapa in praising those disciples of early 
        times who followed such practices and expressing disappointment on the 
        more recent disciples who were not keen in following such practices. It 
        is clear, however, that Maha Kassapa’s unique point was that he made a 
        life-long commitment to follow such austerities. This way of life, as we 
        will see later in this discussion, is bound to have a great influence on 
        the future shape of the Sasana.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">
        Another visible characteristic in Maha Kassapa’s life was his lack of 
        enthusiasm in the affairs of women. According to one discourse in the 
        Samyuttanikaya (II 214-7 which we will discuss again later) Mah Kassapa 
        was not very keen to visit bhikkhunis. Ananda had to ask three times 
        before he finally agreed to do so. The incident, however, ended up in a 
        disaster when a nun called Thulla Tissa made a disparaging comment on 
        Maha Kassapa. According to the context of the event it is not clear 
        whether the Bhikkhuni’s remarks are due to displeasure towards Maha 
        Kassapa or whether due to her high regards for Ananda. If it is the 
        latter the bhikkhuni could have uttered a similar remark to anyone other 
        than Ananda; Maha Kassapa became victim merely by accident. There is 
        another incident in which, hearing Maha Kassapa making some critical 
        comments on Ananda, a nun called Thullananda expressed her disapproval 
        in very strong terms. This incident too may be due to the high regards 
        the nun had toward Ananda. Or the events could be due to some less than 
        favourable attitude the particular nuns had toward Maha Kassapa. When we 
        couple these episodes with Maha Kassapa’s apparent reluctance to teach 
        bhikkhunis we may assume that he was not very enthusiastic about 
        bhikkhunis in particular and womenfolk in general</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn20" NAME="_ednref20" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[20]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Maha 
        Kassapa’s position as the head of the Sangha is highlighted at the 
        instance of the parinirvana of the Buddha. The Mahaparinibbana-sutta of 
        the Dighanikaya says that people could not kindle the pyre of the Buddha 
        till Maha Kassapa arrived in there with his group from his forest abode. 
        Once he arrived in there and saluted the feet of the Buddha, the Sutta 
        says, the pyre got kindled automatically. It is clear, from the 
        cremation of the Buddha onwards Maha Kassapa took over as the leader of 
        the Sangha. The subsequent incidents such as the first council took 
        place under the direct guidance and direction of Maha Kassapa. This, 
        however, does not mean that Maha Kassapa started occupying the place of 
        the Buddha. It only shows that he was accepted by the Sangha as the 
        ‘sangha-thera’ or the eldest in the group. (More on this issue later.)

        elders seem to occupy two different poles in the monastic life. We will 
        come to this comparison later. Initially an account of Ananda as the 
        chief attendant of the Buddha, treasurer of the Dhamma and the champion 
        of the Bhikkhuni Sasana is called for.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Ananda

        attendant of the Buddha and for keeping in memory what the Buddha said 
        or the word of the Buddha (buddha vacana). According to the tradition, 
        Ananda was appointed by the Buddha to the position of his attendant 
        fulfilling an aspiration he has been cherishing for a long time in his 
        samsaric existence. In accepting the position, according to the Vinaya, 
        Ananda came forth with a set of eight conditions. The Buddha accepted 
        these conditions and ever since Ananda was the disciple physically 
        closest to the Buddha attending to his daily needs, arranging meetings 
        with the Buddha for those who came to visit him and serving as the 
        intermediary between the Buddha and the rest. In the list of disciples 
        excelling in various aspects of the Sasana life, Ananda was acclaimed 
        the highest among those who are learned (bahussuta), mindful 
        (satimanta), with good behaviour (gatimanta), resolute (dhitimanta)</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn21" NAME="_ednref21" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[21]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Being 
        closest to the Buddha naturally Ananda had most opportunities to hear 
        what the Buddha said. Since Ananda, as the attendant to the Buddha, went 
        everywhere the Buddha went again he was the most obvious choice for 
        keeping in mind what the Buddha said. In a rare case when Ananda was not 
        present with the Buddha, the latter would say to former what he had 
        taught in his absence. In this manner Ananda became the most ‘heard’ 
        (bahussuta) monk in the sasana and naturally he was described as the 
        ‘treasurer of the Dhamma’ (dhamma bhandagarika).</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">As the 
        closest disciple of the Buddha Ananda played a decisive role in 
        persuading the Buddha to establish the Bhikkhuni Sasana. The story of 
        Bhkkhuni Sasana as told in the early Buddhist sources is beset with 
        problems. The impression given in the Vinaya Cullavagga, which is the 
        basic source of the event, is that the Buddha agreed to establish the 
        order for bhikhunis simply and solely because he could not escape from 
        persuasive Ananda. According to the report in the Vinaya, Maha Pajapati 
        Gotami, the step-mother of the Buddha, had asked for permission from the 
        Buddha when he was staying at Kapilavatthu, his native place, to receive 
        ordination (pabbajja) which the Buddha had refused even for the third 
        time. Gotami did not give up her hopes and went, accompanied by a large 
        number of similar-minded ladies, by walking to Vesali where the Buddha 
        was subsequently residing and waited outside of the place where she was 
        hoping for a change of mind of the Buddha. Seeing Gotami in a depressed 
        and sad mood Ananda offered to speak on behalf of her on the matter He 
        made a strong appeal for Gotami’s case reminding the Buddha that she was 
        the one who really brought him up in the absence of his real mother. The 
        Buddha would not be convinced and he would refuse Ananda’s request even 
        for the third time. Finally Ananda puts the crucial question to the 
        Buddha, namely, whether or not a woman is capable of realizing the four 
        stages of arahanthood in the Sasana. To this the Buddha gives a 
        categorical and an affirmative answer, and if it was the case, the 
        Buddha did not seem to have alternative but to agree to Ananda’s request</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn23" NAME="_ednref23" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[23]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">. 
        It is quite natural that bhikkhunis had developed a sense of great 
        respect and indebtedness towards Ananda. It is also quite natural that, 
        as we will be looking at in detail shortly, that some bhikkhunis were 
        not willing to see or hear anything that they perceived as damaging to 
        their revered ‘patron saint’. The two instances connected with Maha 
        Kassapa and some bhikkhunis need to be understood in this context.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">
        Encounters between Ananda and Maha Kassapa are quite unique in Theravada 
        tradition in the sense that they highlight glimpses into personality 
        differences between two key disciples of the Buddha. We know that in the 
        Vinaya there are references to ‘bad’ monks who found some way or other 
        to behave notoriously. They are duly criticized by both good monks and 
        the Buddha. In the discourses we find some monks such as Sati (see: 
        Majjhimanikaya:38) and Arittha (See: Majjhimanikaya: 22) who held wrong 
        views, and they have been duly reprimanded by the Buddha or by fellow 
        monks. What we have with Maha Kassapa and Ananda, however, is quite 
        different. The differences between Maha Kassapa and Ananda do not 
        involve any violation of Vinaya rules; nor do they involve any wrong 
        views or wrong presentation of the Dhamma. What we witness is 
        personality differences between two eminent disciples of the Buddha, one 
        as an arahant and the other as a stream-winner.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">There 
        are two discourses, which we have already referred to, in the section 
        reserved for the sermons related to Maha Kasssapa (Kassapa samyutta), of 
        the Samyuttanikaya (II. Pp.214-7; 217-22), which betray such 
        differences. The first of the two discourses contains the episode of 
        Maha Kassapa visiting reluctantly a bhikkhuni monastery in order to 
        preach doctrine to bhikkhunis. At the end of the sermon a nun called 
        Thulla Tissa made the following disparaging remark. </SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">- How 
        can Master Maha Kassapa think of speaking on the Dhamma in the presence 
        of Master Ananda, the Vedehan sage- this is just as if a needle-peddler 
        would think he could sell a needle to a needle-maker.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Maha 
        kassapa overhears this and expresses his displeasure at this rudeness 
        whereupon Ananda said to former: “Be patient, Venerable Kassapa, women 
        are foolish”. Maha Kassapa seems to understand this remark as an effort 
        to defend the wrong-doer nun and warns Ananda sternly: <B>“Hold it, 
        friend Ananda! Don’t give the Sangha occasion to investigate you 
        further”</B>, and goes on to remind Ananda that it is he, and not 
        Ananda, that was praised very highly by the Buddha in the presence of 
        the Sangha as being capable of attainments similar to those of the 
        Buddha himself. Here Maha Kassapa refers to an earlier occasion, 
        discussed above, when Maha Kassapa’s higher attainments were <I>compared</I> 
        by the Buddha with those of himself. Finally Maha Kassapa concludes:
        </SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">
        -
        Friend, one might just as well think that a bull elephant seven or seven 
        and half cubits high could be concealed by a palm leaf as think that my 
        six direct knowledges could be concealed. </SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">If the 
        remarks were to come from a non-arahants, one could well suspect signs 
        of a ‘power struggle’ dormant in these remarks. It is not easy for us to 
        make a judgment about the actual intention or the tone of the 
        conversation. Since Maha Kassapa is an arahant we know, according to the 
        tradition of the Canon, that he is incapable of reverting to ‘dosa’ or 
        anger which he has eradicated in attaining arahanthood. Therefore it is 
        possible that the words were uttered in kindness, but there cannot be 
        any doubt about the strong-ness and the critical character of the 
        expression (highlighted above) and the reprimanding ‘tone’ contained in 
        the repeated series of questions put to Ananda by Maha Kassapa reminding 
        him of the great attainments achieved by himself. One could well argue 
        that all these are signs that Maha Kasapa had a such great ego and 
        arrogance, but this is not possible for an Arahant. It is possible that 
        Maha Kassapas’ strong remarks come not only from this incident but also 
        from his prior impression that Ananda had too much involvement with 
        bhikkhunis, and in his capacity as one next only to the Buddha naturally 
        the great Elder was concerned about the overall welfare of the Sasana. 
        Being only a stream-winner, however, it is, at least theoretically, 
        possible that Ananda could be vulnerable to this kind of laxity in 
        behaviour. But, again, as we saw earlier Ananda is one who has been 
        acclaimed by the Buddha as the highest among those who are with good 
        behaviour and resolute character, among other qualities. Besides there 
        is evidence to the very strong moral character of Ananda. According to 
        an instance occurring in the Anguttaranikaya (II. pp.144-6) once a 
        bhikkhuni wanted to seduce Ananda and sent for him saying that she was 
        not well and wished to see him. Once at the bhikkhuni’s residence Ananda 
        realized her real intention and admonished her on the futility of sexual 
        gratification, helped her calm her mind and left himself intact. It 
        looks that his good looks attracted many a opposite sex to Ananda. But 
        the Theravada texts do not contain anything suggestive of any laxity on 
        the part of Ananda. </SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The 
        episode described in the second discourse (referred to earlier) happens 
        when Ananda returns from a tour in Dakkhinagiri with a group of his 
        pupils. In the course of this tour some thirty younger disciples of 
        Ananda who were not well grounded in the Sasana reverted to household 
        life. Having returned to Rajagaha Ananda visits Maha Kassapa and the 
        following conversation takes place:</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">- 
        Friend Ananda, for how many reasons did the Blessed One lay down the 
        rule that bhikkhus should not take meal among families in groups of more 
        than three?</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">“The 
        Blessed One had laid down this rule for three reasons, Venerable 
        Kassapa: for retraining ill-behaved persons and for the comfort of 
        well-behaved bhikkhus, [with the intention] ‘May those of evil wishes, 
        by forming faction, not create a schism in the Sangha!” and out of 
        sympathy towards families. It is for these three reasons, Venerable 
        Kassapa, that the Blessed One laid down this rule.”</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">“Then 
        why, friend Ananda, are you wandering about with these young bhikkhus 
        who are unguarded in their sense faculties, immoderate in eating, and 
        not devoted to wakefulness? One would think you were wandering about 
        trampling on crops; one would think you are wandering about destroying 
        families. Your retinue is breaking apart, friend Ananda, your young 
        followers are slipping away. <B>But still this youngster does not know 
        his measure!</B>”</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">
        Ananda’s response to the comments was the following:</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">“Grey 
        hairs are growing on my head, Venerable Kassapa. Can’t we escape being 
        called a youngster by the Venerable Maha Kassapa?”</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">It is 
        having heard this conversation that bhikkhuni Thulla Nanda alluded to 
        the fact that Maha Kassapa formerly belonged to another religious group 
        (which we discussed earlier). In the explanation that follows Maha 
        Kassapa gives a detailed account of his faith in the Buddha, on the 
        special manner the Buddha treated him by exchanging robes with him (<I>Samyuttanikaya</I> 
        II p.21) and how the Buddha acknowledged his higher attainments.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">
        Looking at this second episode we can see that Maha Kassapa’s accusation 
        to Ananda comes for some justifiable reasons. Ananda’s decision to go on 
        a tour with a group of young and immature monks seems to be an act 
        resulting from lack of responsibility. But, since we are not told of 
        Ananda’s side of the story, we are not in a position to judge one way or 
        the other. Calling Ananda youngster who does not know his limits, 
        however, is a very severe accusation for which there is no textual 
        support. The remarks made by Ananda in turn, nevertheless, show how 
        frustrated he was at being called a youngster. </SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The 
        first council that took place three months after the parinirvana of the 
        Buddha was headed by Maha Kassapa and it is yet another important series 
        of events that shed light on the two personalities. Having decided to 
        hold the council the members of the Sangha asked Maha Kassapa to select 
        members for the purpose. He selected 499 arahants. At this point monks 
        said the following to Maha Kassapa:</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">- 
        Honoured Sir, this Ananda, although he is still a learner, could not be 
        one to follow a wrong course through desire, anger, delusion, fear; and 
        he has mastered much dhamma and discipline under the Lord. Well, now, 
        honoured sir, let the elder select the Venerable Ananda as well</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn24" NAME="_ednref24" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[24]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Maha 
        Kassapa selected Ananda accordingly. Ananda played a major role in being 
        the key resource person for the basket of discourses (sutta pitaka). At 
        the end of the whole process Ananda informed the sangha that the Buddha 
        at his last moment allowed the monks to abolish lesser and minor rules 
        of training. Then there arose a question as to what were these ‘lesser 
        and minor rules of training’. The group could not come to a consensus. 
        At this juncture Maha Kassapa reminded the Sangha that there were Vinaya 
        rules which affect householders and since they are aware of them, if the 
        Sangha were to abolish some of these rules people would criticize the 
        Sangha saying that the disciples of the Buddha have changed the Vinaya 
        rules once their Master is gone and brings forth the following motion:
        </SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">- If it 
        seems right to the Order, the Order should not lay down what has not 
        been laid down, nor should it abolish what has been laid down. It should 
        proceed in conformity with and according to the rules of training that 
        have been laid down</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn25" NAME="_ednref25" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[25]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">.
        </SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The 
        Sangha passed this motion and thus a tradition of Theravada was born 
        which, up to this date, remains unchanged formally by the Theravada 
        Sangha. Right after passing the motion, however, the elders gathered 
        accused Ananda of minor offence (dukkata) of not making clear this issue 
        from the Buddha and demanded that he must confess. Ananda agreed to 
        confess, but said that he does not think that it amounts to a minor 
        offence for he could not do that out of lack of mindfulness. </SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">
        Subsequently the Sangha came out with another list of what they thought 
        to be minor offences on the part of Ananda. They are; (i) that he sewed 
        the Buddha’s robe for the rains sitting on it; (ii) that he had the 
        Buddha’s body first of all honoured by women; because these were weeping 
        the Buddha’s body was defiled by their tears; (iii) that he did not 
        invite the Buddha to live longer even when the Buddha was alluding to 
        the possibility very clearly; and (iv) that he made an effort for the 
        going forth of women in the Dhamma and Discipline proclaimed by the 
        Buddha. To the first accusation Ananda responds by saying that although 
        he did so it was not out of disrespect; for the second he said that he 
        had to give priority to women for it was not proper to let the women be 
        there at an improper time; for the third he said he forgot to invite the 
        Buddha for his mind was possessed by Mara; and for the last on 
        initiating the Bhikkhuni Order he said that he did so out of kindness 
        for Maha Pajapati Gotami, the foster-mother of the Buddha. On these 
        issues Ananda’s position was that none amounted to a minor wrong doing, 
        nonetheless, he would confess out of respect for the Sangha.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The 
        first Sangayana seems not only the first effort at organizing the word 
        of the Buddha to form an accepted version of it but also the formal 
        beginning of the tradition that subsequently came to be known as 
        Theravada. The attitudes expressed and the decisions made at this 
        meeting seem to have had tremendous influence in determining the 
        subsequent history of the organization. The account in the Cullavagga, 
        discussed above, makes it abundantly clear that the two key 
        personalities in the whole exercise were Maha Kassapa and Ananda</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn26" NAME="_ednref26" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[26]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">. 
        In the next section we will discuss the implications of the first 
        Sangayana on the history of Buddhism in more detail.</SPAN></P>

        <SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size:14.0pt;color:navy">Doctrinal and 
        Historical Implications</SPAN></B></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">It 
        must be clear from the above discussion that both Maha Kassapa and 
        Ananda are among the most prominent in the Sasana and they encounter 
        each other in Sasana- activities quite often. It is ultimately on these 
        two individuals the future path of the Sasana rested. Some of the 
        developments which still affect the nature of the Sasana may justifiably 
        be traced to the personality differences of these two elders.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">As we 
        noted earlier, Maha Kassapa was basically a forest-dwelling monk who 
        practiced austere ways of living. Secluded life away from crowds was the 
        outstanding character of his behaviour. Ananda was the complete opposite 
        of this and he represented the urban city living in an environment of 
        established monasticism. The two modes of life, city living and forest 
        living have been there from the beginning of the Sasana. The exact 
        attitude to forest living is hard to determine even though it seems to 
        have been taken as the ideal. For instance when one receives <I>
        upasampada</I> (formal acceptance to the Sangha) one is reminded of the 
        four requisites of monastic life, namely, rag robe, alms food, 
        urine-medicine and living in the forest as the ideal although other 
        kinds of requisites given by house holders are also acceptable</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn27" NAME="_ednref27" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[27]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">. 
        But the Buddha’s somewhat negative response to Devadatta’s request to 
        make compulsory these practices and abstaining from meat eating reveals 
        that these practices are only optional. It is said that some religious 
        people adhere to austerities in order to attract attention and thereby 
        to increase their gains. Sariputta, described by a modern writer as 
        “paradigmatic saint of settled monasticism”</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn28" NAME="_ednref28" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[28]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">, 
        says that what really matters is not whether one lives in a village or 
        in a forest but whether or not one is seen or heard to have defilements 
        in his behaviour</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn29" NAME="_ednref29" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[29]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">.
        </SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">
        Somewhat opposite sentiment has been expressed by the Buddha in 
        responding to some remarks made by Maha Kassapa</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn30" NAME="_ednref30" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[30]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US"> 
        on the deteriorated character of the Sangha at that time. When Maha 
        Kassapa said that now the bhkkhus are difficult to admonish, the Buddha 
        responded by saying that bhikkhus in the past were forest dwellers, 
        alms-food eaters, rag-robe wearers and so on and that they spoke in 
        praise of such practices but it is no more</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn31" NAME="_ednref31" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[31]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">. 
        Here the Buddha is seen talking very highly of these qualities and 
        practices which Sariputta thought some people could misuse. Taking all 
        these occurrences together we have to conclude that the early Buddhist 
        stand on the issue is at best inconclusive.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The 
        two modes of living have been there with the Sangha up till today with 
        all the tensions seen from the time of the Buddha. As the current 
        practice has evolved, in the Theravada tradition, the practice of 
        forest-dwelling (<I>arannavasi</I> (Pali) or <I>aranyavasin </I>
        (Sanskrit) is seen to be the ideal but practiced by only a few. Those 
        others who are city-dwellers (gamavasi (Pali) or gramavasin (Sanskrit) 
        see themselves as falling behind the ideal but show, however, their 
        allegiance to the ideal by organizing or joining with the laity in 
        making pilgrimages to these places or by arranging <I>dana</I> every 
        year or so to those who live in forest hermitages. As we know the Buddha 
        himself was not a forest dweller; but he had a period of six years in 
        the forest before he attained the Buddhahood. Having attained the 
        Buddhahood it was meaningless for him to be in the forest for the very 
        idea of the attainment was to teach people to make an end to their 
        suffering. In this sense, living in the forest exclusively was not 
        meaningful for even an arahant. Once attained arahanthood one has to 
        show, out of kindness, the path to others. Even from Maha Kassapa’s life 
        we know that he was not an absolute forest dweller. The very fact that 
        we talk about him or any one of that sort is that they bring their 
        experience back to people. If one were to be in the forest absolutely 
        without having anything to do with the society then there is nothing for 
        us to talk about him. According to the Vinaya, for a monk to be 
        exclusively in the forest (not withstanding the fact that survival in 
        such manner is very doubtful) without having himself located within a 
        particular Sangha is impossible; he must mingle with the rest of his 
        group at least every fortnight to perform <I>uposatha</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size:10.0pt"><I><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"> </SPAN>

        Although it is theoretically possible for a group of monks to organize 
        itself exclusively as a forest group which has nothing to do with lay 
        society, it does not seem to have happened for practical reasons. The 
        meaning of the practice, thus, seems to be serving a practical purpose, 
        namely, retiring into forest as a means of re-strengthening one’s inner 
        balance. Although Maha Kassapa, who climbed the mountain every day and 
        enjoyed in being in <I>jhana </I></SPAN><A HREF="#_edn33" NAME="_ednref33" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">[33]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">, 
        seems to be the ‘extreme’ example we have from the time of the Buddha, 
        he himself was not without social engagements in his own way</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn34" NAME="_ednref34" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[34]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">. 
        Ananda’s entire religious life seems to have been devoted for social 
        engagements, namely, working for others including primarily the Buddha, 
        with probably no records of forest dwelling at all. Both are eminent 
        disciples of the Buddha in their own ways. The monk’s life today may 
        well be described as one oscillating between these two great disciples 
        of the Buddha.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The 
        idea that one who enters the Sasana has to engage in either in what is 
        called the ‘yoke of text’ (gantha-dhura) or the ‘yoke of insight’ 
        (vipassana-dhura) seems to be a development belonging to the period 
        after the Buddha. The commentaries, however, want us to believe that 
        this division was already existent during the Buddha’s time itself</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn35" NAME="_ednref35" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[35]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">. 
        It is not hard to imagine that there was some kind of organized effort, 
        while the Buddha was still alive, to memorize what the Buddha said. But 
        if we go by the Cullavagga record of the first council we see in it the 
        real beginnings of an institutional effort to organize and preserve the 
        word of the Buddha. The reason was basically religious: once the Buddha 
        attained parinirvana it was the dhamma that occupied the place of the 
        Master. When the Buddha was alive one could go to the Buddha if there 
        was any doubt about any matter relating to the Dhamma or the Vinaya. Now 
        it was the very Dhamma and the Vinaya as taught and enacted by the 
        Buddha to be consulted</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn36" NAME="_ednref36" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[36]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">. 
        Hence the need to make the Dhamma and the Vinaya readily available in 
        order to be consulted. The leading role played in the whole process by 
        Ananda, who was acclaimed by the Buddha as possessing the highest 
        learnedness (bahussuta) and memory (satimanta), is clear. This does not 
        mean that Maha Kassapa was away from textual interests. In fact, it is 
        he who initiated the first council. And according to the 
        Sumangalavilasini (the commentary to the Dighanikaya) account of the 
        first council the Vinaya and the each division of the Canon was assigned 
        to the leading arahants and their pupils, and thus Samyuttanikaya was 
        assigned to Maha Kassapa and his pupils for preservation through memory</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn37" NAME="_ednref37" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[37]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">. 
        Judging by the overall behaviour and attitudes of Maha Kassapa it may be 
        more accurate to assume that the circumstances after the parinirvana of 
        the Buddha forced him to take interest in these matters. Otherwise he 
        was more prone to meditation which was the main preoccupation in forest 
        life. In the gathas (stanzas) attributed to him (in the Theragatha) 
        nothing is mentioned about his being learned or anything related to 
        studies. Instead a lot is mentioned in praise of secluded meditative 
        life. </SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The 
        two yokes mentioned seem to have been incorporated into a broad scheme 
        of concepts encompassing all the aspects of Buddhist life, namely, the 
        idea of threefold sasana, namely, pariyatti or study of the Canon, 
        patipatti or the practice and pativedha or the realization. As 
        commentaries report, there arose during the reign of Vattagamini Abhaya 
        among the Sri Lanka Sangha a debate as to which of the sasana is more 
        critical. The debate arose among the pansukulikas (wearers of rag robes) 
        and dhammakathikas (preachers of the Dhamma), a development in the 
        Theravada comparable to ganthadhura and vipassanadhura or arannavasi and 
        gamavasi referred to earlier, when everybody including the monks had to 
        suffer owing to a long-lasting famine and a series of foreign invasions. 
        Consequently the practice of memorization of the Dhamma became almost 
        extinct in the country. Finally when the situation regained normalcy 
        those who survived got together and arranged to write the word of the 
        Buddha preserved up to that time in memory. Naturally this was an 
        occasion when the memorization of the Dhamma appeared to be very crucial 
        for the existence of the Sasana. It is on this background the debate 
        arose among the monks. In the debate dhammakathikas won the day by 
        establishing that the practice of the Dhamma is impossible in the 
        absence of knowledge what the Dhamma is</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn38" NAME="_ednref38" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[38]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">. 
        Adikaram thinks that this turn of events marks a significant shift in 
        attitudes of the early Sri Lanka Sangha, a shift not very desirable for 
        the spiritual wellbeing of the Organization. He comments on the outcome 
        of the debate: </SPAN></P>

        -
        Practice was relegated to the background and preaching gained supremacy. 
        The Sutta defeated the Vinaya. How different this was from the older 
        attitude!Vinayo nama sasanassa ayu” (Vinya is the very life of the 
        religion of the Buddha cried out in bold terms the theras of old. The 
        change in attitude although no attention has been paid to it in the 
        commentaries, is of the utmost importance in the history of Theravada 
        Buddhism. This school of Buddhism claims its descent from Upali, the 
        greatest Vinayadhara among the disciples of the Buddha. Mahinda, too, 
        the founder of this school in Ceylon insisted of the Vinaya by a 
        Ceylonese bhikkhu as it was only then he maintained, that the sasana 
        would take root in Ceylon. Mahinda’s Buddhism was religion predominantly 
        of practice, and the victory, mentioned above, of Suttanta over Vinaya 
        would not have been one after the heart of the great missionary 
        (Adikaram: 1946. pp.77-78). </SPAN></P>

        another eminent scholar in the history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. Rahula 
        does not see any signs of decadence in these events, as Adikaram does. 
        Rahula dismisses Adikaram’s attitude as one “of a devotee lamenting over 
        the “degeneration” and “corruption” of the Faith”</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn39" NAME="_ednref39" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[39]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">. 
        These two rather polar views held by two of the eminent scholars of 
        modern Theravada are indicative of the persistence of the division up 
        till today. In this manner, the two vocations (dhura) and the two modes 
        of living (in gama or in aranna) have been persistent in the sasana 
        throughout. Although the particular ways of description and 
        establishment of categories came later one can see the seeds of these 
        historical developments in Maha Kassapa and Ananda.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">
        Another important Theravada perception that continues up till today is 
        its attitude toward women in general and the sasana of the Bhikkhunis in 
        particular. It is a historical fact that the Order of Bhikkhunis is long 
        discontinued in the Theravada tradition. The stalwarts of the Theravada 
        have always maintained, following the Vinaya, that reintroduction of 
        higher ordination –upasampada for Bhikkhunis is impossible without an 
        already existent Bhikkhuni sangha. This standpoint comes fundamentally 
        from two positions, both advocated and upheld by Maha Kassapa. One is 
        the attitude of the Sangha headed by Maha Kassapa at the first council 
        on the issue of changing the minor rules. As we saw earlier, at the end 
        of the formal recitation of the Canon</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn40" NAME="_ednref40" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[40]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US"> 
        Ananda informs the Sangha that the Buddha before his parinirvana had 
        given permission to abolish the minor rules if the sangha so desired. At 
        this there arose a question as to what the minor rules were. The elders 
        could not come to an agreement. It is in this state of indecision that 
        Maha Kassapa proposed that the Sangha should not abolish any of the 
        already existing rules; nor should the Sangha approve any new rules that 
        have not been enacted by the Master. The members of the first council 
        accepted this by maintaining silence. It is important to note that the 
        Theravada tradition still upholds this decision for it has not been 
        changed or abolished although in the history they have had several 
        councils ever since</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn41" NAME="_ednref41" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[41]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">. 
        In understanding the position of the present Theravada leaders we need 
        to keep in mind this historical tradition. In fact, the Theravada Sangha 
        is still bound by the decision made at the first council, and by not 
        approving the reestablishment of Bhikkhuni Sasana the Theravadins are 
        merely adhering to an age-old historical tradition (although whether or 
        not doing so is the right thing to do is a different matter). It is 
        clear that the strong Vinaya emphasis adhered to by the Theravada is 
        mainly due to Maha Kassapa. Although the Sangha accepted the proposal of 
        the great elder still they accused Ananda of a minor offence of not 
        making it clear from the Buddha and this move shows that at least some 
        of the elders were not unwilling to change or abolish some of the rules.
        </SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The 
        other is the general attitude to women held by the elders at the first 
        council. In our study of Maha Kassapa we found that he was not 
        enthusiastic about teaching Dhamma to Bhikkhunis. Two instances in which 
        he agreed to do so he had to be coaxed to it by Ananda, and both 
        incidents ended in disaster. These incidents also suggest that the 
        dislike between Maha Kassapa and bhikkhunis was mutual. Now in the first 
        council, as we saw earlier, one of the charges brought forth by the 
        elders against Ananda was that it was wrong for him to make women, who 
        soiled the body of the Buddha with their tears, pay their homage before 
        others. This can be interpreted as resulting from the popular perception 
        that women must not be accorded a honour over men. Ananda’s response 
        reveals his awareness of realities of life and respect for social norms. 
        The other charge which has direct bearing on the issue is that he 
        persuaded the Buddha to establish the Bhikkhuni Order. This charge 
        strongly suggests that the majority of the senior members of the Sangha 
        did not like the existence of the Bhikkhuni Order. Although this charge 
        against Ananda is given as coming from the elders and not directly from 
        Maha Kassapa who was the head of the council it is imaginable that it 
        was fully approved by the latter. This historical event that took place 
        at the first council surely has been instrumental in determining the 
        subsequent behaviour of the Theravada with regard to the Bhikkhuni 
        Order. It is clear that the attitude still exists today. Ananda as the 
        patron of the Bhikkhuni Order did not think what he did by initiating 
        the Bhikkhuni Order was wrong. The subsequent history of Theravada, 
        however, shows that Maha Kassapa’s opinion prevailed over that of 
        Ananda.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">
        Earlier we referred to how Maha Kasapa was accepted by the Sangha the 
        sangha-thera after the parinibbana of the Buddha. The 
        Mahaparinibbana-sutta account reveals how Maha Kassapa took over the 
        leadership of the Sangha right after the parinibbana of the Buddha. It 
        is necessary to understand this development in the context the assertion 
        made by the Buddha before his parinibbana to the effect hat after him 
        the Dhamma he taught and the Vinaya he promulgated will be the teacher. 
        Some times this is understood as the Buddha rejecting a leadership in 
        the form of an appointed person for the Sangha. I think that this is a 
        misunderstanding. The issue in the Mahaparinibbana-sutta is the possible 
        anxiety on the part of the disciples that once the Buddha is gone they 
        would be left teacher-less. The word used here is “sattha’ which is 
        usually used to refer to the Buddha himself. The Buddha makes the 
        following statement: </SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">
        -
        Ananda, it is possible that the following occurs to you: ‘the teaching 
        no longer has a teacher, there is no teacher for us’ (<I>atita-satthukam 
        pavacanam natthi no satthati </I></SPAN><A HREF="#_edn42" NAME="_ednref42" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size:10.0pt;

        Ananda, it should not be understood in that manner; Ananda, the doctrine 
        I have explained and the discipline I have prescribed will be your 
        teacher at my passing.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">In 
        making this statement what the Buddha does is to elevate the Dhamma and 
        the Vinaya to the position of the Sattha. In fact, no one including the 
        Buddha could ‘appoint’ another as the Sattha for, in order for this to 
        happen, that other person has to be a Buddha himself. If the other 
        person was himself a Buddha question would not arise. But this 
        difficulty cannot arise in appointing one to the position of 
        sangha-thera. What really seems to happen after the parinibbana of the 
        Buddha is somewhat similar to the second. A revealing discussion occurs 
        in the Gopaka Moggallana-sutta (Majjhimanikaya: 108 ) initially between 
        Ananda and Brahmin Gopaka Moggallana and subsequently between the former 
        and Vassakara, the Chief Minster of King Ajatasatthu. Gopaka Moggallana 
        asks from Ananda whether there was any single monk “who possesses in 
        each and every way all those qualities that were possessed by master 
        Gotama” To this Ananda replies in the negative. Subsequently Vassakara 
        enters the discussion and asks from Ananda whether there is any one monk 
        appointed by the Buddha or by the Sangha as the refuge of the Sangha 
        once he is gone. To this Ananda replied in the negative and explained 
        that this did not mean that they were without refuge and that they had 
        the Dhamma taught by the Buddha as their refuge. Being satisfied with 
        explanation the Brahmin asks a further question, namely: </SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">- Is 
        there, Master Ananda, any single bhikkhu whom you now honour, respect, 
        revere, and venerate, and on whom you live in dependence honouring and 
        respecting him?</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn43" NAME="_ednref43" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[43]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">
        </SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">
        Ananda’s response to this question was in the affirmative. What this 
        discussion makes very clear is that although there no any other person 
        equal to the Buddha there were many who were revered as virtuous monks 
        whom the rest of the monks respected and depended on. The case with Maha 
        Kassapa is similar to this. He was not the Master but he was the most 
        respected of all. </SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">Some 
        could take this case of Buddha’s not appointing a successor to himself 
        and trace all the maladies of the Buddhist tradition to it. This is not 
        reasonable for what the Buddha did not appoint was a teacher replacing 
        on behalf of himself, which is technically impossible. As Ananda himself 
        admits, there was none equal to the Buddha in all respects for such a 
        person himself has to be a Samma-Sambuddha. What is possible, however, 
        is that there can be a leader for the Sangha. In fact, as Ananda 
        explains later in the discussion , the sangha in each locality comes 
        together under the guidance of a sangha-thera in the group and recite 
        the Vinaya in every fortnight and abide by it. This allows for a 
        decentralized self-rule among various groups of the Sangha. On the same 
        grounds, it is also possible to have a sangha-thera appointed by the 
        entire Sangha to be the leader of the whole group. The idea that the 
        Buddha’s reluctance to appoint any one single bhikkhu as the successor 
        to himself as the Samma-sambuddha should not be taken as indicating that 
        the Buddha did not allow for a leadership in the Sangha. Maha Kassapa 
        exemplified this possibility.</SPAN></P>
        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">It is 
        well known that the Theravada tradition lays more emphasis on Vinaya. 
        The strict adherence to Vinaya has been seen as its hallmark. As we saw 
        above Maha Kassapa’s decision not to abolish any of the rules prescribed 
        by the Buddha and not to formulate any new rules crystallizes this 
        attitude. It does not seem that the modern scholarship has paid 
        sufficient attention to this phenomenon. I, nevertheless, believe that 
        this trend has had far reaching implications on the overall character of 
        the Theravada tradition. In the first Sangayana, according to the 
        Cullavagga account, Maha Kassapa chooses, with the consent of the rest, 
        Vinaya to be recited first. The account of the event given in the 
        commentaries is somewhat different. In it Maha Kassapa is seen asking 
        from his fellow elders as to what they should recite first. The answer 
        he gets from them is as follows: Venerable Sir, Kassapa, the Vinaya is 
        the life of the sasana; the Sasana exists when the Vinaya does.”</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn44" NAME="_ednref44" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[44]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US"> 
        Here the primacy of the Vinaya is asserted by the rest of the Sangha but 
        not by Maha Kassapa. Whatever that may be, this emphasis seems to be 
        closer to Maha Kassapa’s sentiments than to those of Ananda. In the 
        first glance one cannot see anything wrong with this emphasis on Vinaya. 
        In the long run, however, this move can be interpreted as taking the 
        Vinaya on its own disregarding the Dhamma basis of it. In fact, as has 
        been shown by scholars such as Jotiya Dhirasekere</SPAN><A HREF="#_edn45" NAME="_ednref45" TITLE><SPAN CLASS="MsoEndnoteReference"><SPAN LANG="EN-US" STYLE="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[45]</SPAN></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-US">, 
        the Vinaya gets its validity and meaning from the Dhamma. In this sense, 
        the real life of the Sasana is not the Vinaya but the Dhamma, and hence 
        one could well say that both the Sasana and the Vinaya will exist if the 
        Dhamma were to exist. The subsequent developments in the Vinaya show 
        how, at times, the Theravada tradition found ways and means to manage to 
        do whatever they wished to do without changing the letter of the Vinaya 
        rule. The spirit of the Vinaya really lies in the Dhamma; but in some 
        later developments one could clearly see that not too much care has been 
        given to retain the spirit. Maha Kassapa’s move to recite the Vinaya 
        first, according to Cullavagga account, may be because he felt that 
        Ananda cannot be given the key position over Upali who has been an 
        Arahant much before the former. But the matter seems to be going beyond 
        this consideration to the personal history of the two elders. As we 
        observed earlier it is possible that there was an element of difference 
        in perspectives between the two elders. If that was the decisive factor 
        in reciting the Vinaya before the Dhamma the implications seem to go far 
        beyond personal matters of the two elders. One could argue that ‘sasana’ 
        in this context did not mean the dispensation of the Buddha in the broad 
        sense of the term, but simply the monastic organization. Granting this, 
        still it seems that what is meant is only the male Sangha (bhikkhu but 
        not bhikkhuni Sangha). Certainly the ‘bhikkhu-parisa’ alone, not the 
        ‘catu-parisa’ (four groups) together, has played the key role. This may 
        have seen natural and acceptable in the context. On the other hand, 
        there is no doubt that the organization depended on its members’ 
        adherence to its legal code. It makes perfect sense that the life of the 
        sasana as an organization is its code of law. If we understand the 
        statement in this sense, that too says a lot about the nature and the 
        way of thinking of the Elders. It is clear that this move was 
        instrumental in making decisive changes in the events of the future 
        Sasana. As is evident from the subsequent commentarial literature the 
        end result of this emphasis was a monastic organization which lay more 
        emphasis on the letter than on the spirit of the Vinaya, namely, Dhamma.</SPAN></P>

        <P CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="margin-top:12.0pt"><SPAN LANG="EN-US">The 
        personality, attitudes and the behaviour of the two great elders not 
        only shaped the history of the Sasana at its formative years but also it 
        continues to do so even at present. As we saw earlier all the 
        traditional modes of monastic life of the Sangha such as, gamavasi and 
        arannavasi (busy life of social service in the city and solitary and 
        meditative life in the forest), dhammakathika and pamsukulika (life of 
        comfort and ease and life of austerity characterized by wearing 
        rag-robes and feeding on alms-food), and ganthadhura and vipassanadhura 
        (life of erudition and learnedness and. life of contemplative practice) 
        may well be traced back to Ananda and Maha Kassapa respectively. These 
        divisions have been among the Sangha all the way through. In fact, they 
        have been universal characteristics of the entire Sangha no matter 
        whether they are Theravada, Mahayana or Vajrayana. The ideals behind 
        Ananda and Maha Kassapa do not need to be perceived as contradictory. 
        They can be quite complementary. The life of any member of the Sangha<B>
        </B>may well be taken as oscillating between these two ideals although 
        the degree of oscillation may differ from individual to individual. The 
        ideal disciple of the Buddha is one who strikes a balance between these 
        two poles, a feat by no means looking easy. </SPAN></P>

          an aspect of this pattern that city dwelling monks level “vicious and
