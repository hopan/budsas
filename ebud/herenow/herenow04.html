    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">W</font>e can
      notice fairly easily what our mind does. It reflects and reacts and it often has fantasies
      and also moods. Anyone who doesn't meditate will believe in all of that. Even those who do
      meditate might still believe in the reactions of their own mind to the outer stimuli, or
      might believe the moods which come into the mind are to be taken seriously, that whatever
      the mind is doing is due to an outside occurrence and not to an inner reaction. This is
      easily seen if we watch our thinking process not only in meditation but in daily living.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha gave very exact instructions how
      to counteract any unskillful mind states and produce skillful ones. They can briefly be
      expressed as &quot;avoiding,&quot; &quot;overcoming,&quot; &quot;developing,&quot; and
      &quot;maintaining,&quot; and are called the four supreme efforts, which have been briefly
      mentioned before. They are part of the 37 factors of enlightenment, so must be part of our
      practice. When perfected they are part of the enlightenment process.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">You may have heard the expression
      &quot;Nibbana and //Samsara// are both in the same place.&quot; It is not a true saying,
      because there is no such &quot;place.&quot; But Nibbana, liberation, emancipation,
      enlightenment, and //Samsara//, the round of birth and death, how can they be together? In
      a way they can, because they are both in the mind, in everybody's mind. Except that
      everyone is only aware of one of them, namely that which makes us continue in the round of
      birth and death; not only when this body disappears and it is called death or when a body
      reappears and it is called birth. But there is constant birth and death in our every
      moment of existence. There is the birth of skillful and unskillful thoughts and the dying
      away of them. There is the birth of feelings, pleasant, unpleasant or neutral, and the
      dying away of them. There is the birth of the arising of this body and its dying away
      moment after moment, except that we are not mindful enough to become aware of that.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We can see this quite clearly when we look at
      a photo of ourselves taken 10 or 20 years ago. We look entirely different from what we see
      in the mirror now. But it doesn't follow that a body takes a leap of 20 years and then
      changes itself suddenly. It has changed moment by moment until after a longer time-span,
      it is finally noticeable to us. With more mindfulness we could have known it all along,
      because there is constant birth and death in the body, the same as with thoughts and
      feelings. This is //Samsara//, the round of birth and death within us, due to our craving
      to keep or renew what we think is &quot;me.&quot; When there is liberation, that craving
      ceases, whatever dies is left to die.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Although we have the potential for
      liberation, our awareness is not able to reach it, because we are concerned with what we
      already know. We are habit-formed and habit-prone and every meditator becomes aware of the
      mind habits with their old and tried reactions to outside triggers. They have not
      necessarily been useful in the past, but they are still repeated out of habit. The same
      applies to our moods, which are arising and passing away and have no other significance
      than a cloud has in the sky, which only denotes the kind of weather there is, without any
      universal truth to that. Our moods only denote the kind of weather our mind is
      fabricating, if it believes the mood.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The four supreme efforts are, in the first
      place, the avoiding of unwholesome, unskillful thought processes. If we look at them as
      unskillful, we can accept the fact of learning a new skill more easily. Avoiding means we
      do not let certain thoughts arise, neither reactions to moods, nor to outside triggers. If
      we find ourselves habitually reacting in the same way to the same kind of situation, we
      may be forced to avoid such situations, so that we can finally gain the insight which
      needs to be culled from it. While we are reacting to a situation or mood, we can't assess
      it dispassionately, because our reactions overpowers the mind.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Avoiding, in a Dhamma sense, means to avoid
      the unskillful thought; in a practical sense we may have to avoid whatever arouses such
      mind states in us. That, however, must not go to the length of running away as the
      slightest provocation, which is a well known, yet unsuccessful method of getting out of
      unpleasant reactions. Habitually running away from situations, which create unwholesome
      reactions in us, will not bring about a peaceful mind. Only if there is one particular
      trigger, which arouses unskillful responses in us over and over again, we may have to move
      away from it without blaming anyone. We just realize that we have not yet been able to
      master ourselves under certain circumstances. Just as we don't blame the unpleasant
      feeling anywhere in the body, but realize that we haven't mastered our non-reaction to
      //dukkha// yet, and therefore must change our posture.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It amounts to exactly the same thing. One is
      a physical move, the other is a mental one. All it means is that we haven't quite mastered
      a particular situation yet. It brings us to the realization that there is still more to be
      learned about ourselves. Blaming anything in our outside of ourselves is useless, it only
      aggravates the situation and adds more unwholesome thinking to it.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In order to avoid unskillful reactions in the
      mind, we have to be attentive and know the way our mind words before we verbalize. We can
      learn about that in meditation. Awareness is the prime mover in meditation. It isn't
      viable or useful to have calm and peaceful mind states without being completely aware of
      how we attained them, remained in them and came out of them. Having learned this through
      our meditative practice, enables us to realize how our mind works in daily life, before it
      says anything, such as possibly: &quot;I can't stand this situation&quot; or &quot;I hate
      this person.&quot; When that happens, and unwholesome state has already been established.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Before the mind is allowed to fall into this
      trap, a dense and unpleasant feeling can be noticed, which acts as a warning that an
      unwholesome mind state is approaching, which can be dropped before it has even established
      itself. It is much easier to let go before the negativity has taken hold but it is harder
      to recognize. When we notice that a mind state is approaching which does not seem to be
      accompanied by peace and happiness, we can be sure it will be unwholesome. The more we
      train ourselves to be mindful of our mind states, the more we realize the unhappiness we
      cause ourselves and other through unskillful thinking.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When we have not been able to avoid an
      unwholesome mind, we have to practice to overcome it. Because of the difficulty of
      becoming aware in time to avoid negativities, we have to be very clear on how to overcome
      them. Dropping a thought is an action and not a passive reaction, yet it is difficult to
      do, because the mind needs something to grasp. In meditation we need a subject, such as
      the breath or the feelings/sensations to hold onto, before the mind can become calm and
      peaceful. When we want to overcome unskillful mind states, it is easier to substitute with
      wholesome thinking, than just trying to let go of unwholesomeness.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If we entertain the negative mind states for
      any length of time, they become more and more at home. As they make themselves
      comfortable, we are more and more inclined to believe them and finally come out with
      thoughts such as &quot;I always hate people who don't agree with me&quot; or &quot;I
      always get nervous about thunder.&quot; These statements are designed to show one's own
      unchanging character, giving our ego an extra boost. The only reason these states might
      have become ingrained in our character is that having entertained negativities for so
      long, one can no longer imagine to be without them. Yet these are nothing but unskillful
      mind states, which can and need to be changed. The quicker we substitute, the better it is
      for our own peace of mind.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If we have dislike or rejection concerning a
      person, we may remember something good about that person and be able to substitute the
      negative thought with something concretely positive. Everyone is endowed with both
      qualities, good and evil, and if we pick on the negative, then we will constantly be
      confronted with that aspect, rather than the opposite. With some people this will be more
      difficult that with others. They are our tests, so to say. Nobody gets away in this life
      without such tests. Life is an adult education class with frequent examinations, which are
      being thrown at us at any time. We are not told in advance, what is in store for us, so we
      should be prepared all the time.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As we learn to skill of substitution and do
      it successfully once, we gain confidence in our own ability. There is no reason when why
      we cannot repeat this whenever needed. The relief we feel is all the incentive we need for
      practice.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When we are confronted with situations which
      we find difficult to handle, we can remember that we are faced with a learning experience.
      Overcoming unwholesome mind states needs mind power, which we develop through our
      meditation practice. If we are not yet able to keep our attention in meditation where we
      want it to be, we will not be able yet to change our mind when we want to do so. The more
      skill we develop in meditation, the easier it will be for us to either &quot;avoid&quot;
      or &quot;overcome.&quot; By the same token, as we practice substitution in daily living,
      we assist our meditation. When we realize that our mind is not a solid entity which has to
      react in certain ways, but is a movable, changeable phenomenon, which can be clear and
      illuminated, then we will more and more try to protect it from unwholesomeness. It is
      often a revelation to a new meditator to find out that the mind is not a fixed and
      believable reactor, but can be influenced and changed at will.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To develop wholesome states of mind means
      that we try to cultivate these, when they have not arisen yet. If the mind is neutrally
      engaged or has a tendency to weigh, judge and criticize, feel hurt or be ego-centered, we
      deliberately counteract these tendencies to develop skillful mind states. We acknowledge
      that all negative states are not conducive to our own happiness, peace and harmony. When
      we develop loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity, we experience that
      these states are conducive to our own inner well-being. Obviously we will then try again
      and again to cultivate the mind states which result in personal contentment. Developing
      them from that understanding alone, that the wholesome states are good for us, is a
      powerful insight. When our mind is at peace, we realize that while there are innumerable
      unwholesome situations in the world, if we have an unwholesome reaction to them, that only
      doubles the //dukkha//. It will neither relieve the situation, nor be helpful to anyone.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If we develop a capacity for seeing the
      positive and using whatever arises as a learning situation, trying to keep the four
      supreme emotions, mentioned above, in mind, then there remains only the last effort,
      namely to maintain skillful mind states. Anyone who has not reached full liberation from
      all underlying tendencies will not be able to maintain positive states at all times, but
      our mindfulness can be sharp enough to tell us when we are not succeeding. That is the
      awareness we need to effect changes. When we are not able to maintain wholesomeness, we
      can always try again. Should we start blaming ourselves or others, however, we are adding
      a second negative state of mind and are blocking our progress.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A skill can be learned. We have all learned
      many skills in this life. This is the sort of ability well worth cultivating, more
      important than proficiencies. This is not a character trait we either possess or lack.
      Everybody's mind is capable of developing the wholesome and letting go of the unwholesome.
      But that also doesn't mean that we find everything wonderful and beautiful from now on.
      That too is not realistic. That which can be practiced is, that although there is
      unwholesomeness within and without, dislike is not an effective reaction to bring peace
      and happiness. The pinnacle of all emotional states is equanimity, even-mindedness, which
      is developed through our meditation practice and based on insight. It is our tool in daily
      living to develop and maintain wholesome mind states.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is neither useful to suppress nor to
      pretend by thinking &quot;I ought to be&quot; or &quot;I should be.&quot; Only awareness
      of what is happening in our mind and learning the skill of changing our mind is called
      for. Eventually our mind will be a finely tuned instrument, the only one in the whole of
      the universe that can liberate us from all //dukkha//. All of us have that instrument and
      the guidelines of the Buddha teach us the skill to use this instrument to the best
      advantage; not to believe its moods and reactions to outer stimuli, but to watch and
      protect it and realize its potential for compete liberation.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If we want a good tool, we need to look after
      it in the best possible manner. This means not letting any dirt particles accumulate, but
      to clean it up as quickly as possible. The same criterion applies to our mind. This is
      probably the hardest skill to learn, which is the reason so few people do it. but a
      meditator is on the right path towards just that, by realizing that the mind cannot be
      believed implicitly, being must too fanciful and fleeting.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The four supreme efforts are called
      &quot;supreme,&quot; not only because they are supremely difficult, but also supremely
      beneficial. A serious meditator wants to transcend the human realm while still in human
      form and these efforts are our challenge. They are so well explained by the Buddha that we
      can clearly see the difficulties we are faced with and the reasons why we are still
      roaming about in //Samsara//. But we don't have to continue that unendingly. Knowing the
      path and the way to tread upon it. we have the opportunity to become free of all fetters.</font></td>
