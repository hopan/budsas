      are three ways to approach the Dhamma. One is by acquiring knowledge through study of the
      Buddha's discourses, trying to remember them as faithfully as possible. That is very
      useful for the propagation of the teaching through lectures and books.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Another way is through devotion, offering
      flowers and incense, reciting devotional verses, giving gifts and making merit. Generosity
      and meritorious action were highly recommended by the Buddha, but he didn't put any value
      on just being in the presence of monks and nuns.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Once there was a monk who was so enraptured
      with the Buddha that he never wanted to be out of his sight. When this monk became sick
      one day and was unable to see the Buddha, he became despondent. The other monks asked him
      why he was so unhappy. He explained that he was depressed because he could not see the
      Buddha, who then came to visit the sick monk and said to him: &quot;What do you see in
      this vile form? There is nothing to see in that. Whoever sees me, sees the Dhamma, whoever
      sees Dhamma, sees me. &quot;</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The third approach to Dhamma, namely
      practice, has always been the one most highly recommended by the Buddha. He said a person
      with real reverence and devotion is one who lives according to the teaching. There are a
      number of steps to be taken when we approach the Dhamma through practice. The foundation
      would be moral conduct, meritorious actions, making good kamma. Without such a foundation,
      we do not have enough security within to be peaceful and at ease with ourselves, which are
      prerequisites for meditation. </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This has sometimes been misinterpreted to
      mean that we should not meditate unless we have already complete purity of precepts and
      gained perfect mindfulness. But that doesn't follow, because it's meditation that helps us
      to gain mindfulness, and gives us insight into the efficacy of the precepts.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The next practice aspect is to guard our
      senses. This is frequently mentioned by the Buddha, so that it bears repeating and
      remembering. Without guarding our senses, we are always open to being tempted into wanting
      and craving, resulting in turmoil in the mind. Our sense contacts are triggers for lust
      and hate.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Our senses are so permanently engaged that we
      have lost sight of their impact, are taking all that for granted and think that's just the
      way it is. We also believe that what we see, hear, taste, touch, smell and think is really
      exactly as we are interpreting it. That's fundamental error. Everyone experiences their
      sense contacts in an individual manner.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Here is an example: The food Westerners eat
      is considered baby food in Asia: food spiced in the Asian way appears like hellfire to the
      Western palate. Even such a basic necessity as food shows up as a completely opposite
      experience. We can infer from that, that we all live in our own world. People argue
      vehemently because they believe their world must be the right one and even kill each other
      because of unresolved differences.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha was often asked such a question
      as: &quot;Is the world finite or infinite, eternal or not?&quot; His answer was:
      &quot;What is the world? The world are our sense contacts.&quot; When asked questions such
      as these, the Buddha always brought the questioner back to practice. When we know that the
      world we live in consists of our sense contacts, we have something to practice with. When
      we know that the world is eternal or not, what is there to practice with?</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Our senses include thinking, which is an
      almost constantly operating faculty. At this moment, we have touch, sound, sight and
      thought contact. Four of our six senses are engaged. Because our senses have been at work
      all our lives we believe that is the only way life can be experienced, which creates our
      deep craving to continue in this form. There is danger in this craving, something most
      people are not aware of consciously. Subconsciously we all know about it, because that's
      where our fears originate. If we examine ourselves for a moment we will realize that we
      harbor many fears, all carrying different names. Some people are afraid of spiders or
      snakes, some are afraid of the dark, some are afraid of airplanes, others that their loved
      ones may die, or that they might lose all their money. All sorts of different names for
      exactly the same fear; the fear of losing one's identifications, the fear of unpleasant,
      painful sense contacts, ultimately the fear of annihilation. Yet losing this existence is
      a guaranteed outcome of being alive. It's just a matter of time.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These fears are caused by our attachment to
      our pleasant sense contacts, identifying with them and believing that apart from our
      senses there is no other reality. Naturally we want that to continue then. We take our
      unpleasant experiences in stride, expecting them to cease and the pleasant ones to arise
      again. If our unpleasant sense contacts are in the majority, then we say we are having a
      lot of //dukkha//. Or we might say: &quot;I'm having a problem.&quot; As a matter of fact
      we are all having the same problem, namely that of not being enlightened. When we come to
      the realization that our sense contacts are very momentary and their inherent satisfaction
      a matter of opinion, we will find it easier to let go of them during meditation.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Meditation will only happen when the sense
      contacts, particularly the thinking, are suspended. If, for instance, the touch contact in
      the sitting position is recognized and attended to as unpleasant, the mind starts working
      on that. Remembering what someone said yesterday, last week or even ten years ago, can
      start the mind churning. This is all due to our attachment to our senses and our
      identification with them.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">From all sense contacts feelings arise, there
      is no way that can be altered, but we can stop ourselves from reacting to such feelings,
      and believing that they belong to us. To get our meditation to a concentrated state, we
      must refuse to react to feelings arisen from sense contacts. The more we practice this in
      daily life, the easier it will be to become concentrated in meditation. We don't have to
      go along with this natural reaction of human beings. Meditative absorptions are
      supermundane and therefore require supermundane qualities in us. Whenever the Buddha
      described the way to Nibbana he included the meditative absorptions as part of the
      practice, to lead us to the inner realization of the Dhamma.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Guarding our senses is not only important in
      meditation, but equally valid in daily life. In a meditation course, where there isn't as
      much input as in ordinary situation, it is a little easier to protect our minds from
      liking or disliking what we see, hear, taste, touch, smell and think. In order to
      facilitate this, we need to practice hearing only sounds, without explaining to ourselves
      what it is we heard. When the mind starts telling its story about the sound, at least we
      will know what we are doing, namely investing sound with a reality which gives it
      importance.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The same applies to eye contact. If, for
      instance, we are looking at a bush, our mind will say: &quot;Oh, a cinnamon bush; who
      planted it? I wonder if we can use it?&quot; Or any number of other ideas. Instead of all
      this, we can look at that which we call &quot;bush&quot; and be aware that our eyes are
      touching upon a form and thereby stopping the mind from making up stories. If we can
      manage to do this once or twice outside of meditation, we can use the same method of
      handling sense input in meditation. When we guard ourselves against the mind-made details
      of sense contacts, we are in less danger of falling into greed and hate. We will find this
      a great help in becoming concentrated in meditation.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Our lives are governed by our senses, but we
      do not have to continue with that. It is not compulsory. Within the operation of our six
      senses, it is not possible to find continued and unadulterated happiness. If it were
      possible, we would already be blissfully contented, since we have been having sense input
      day after day, life after life. The answer does not lie in improving our sense contacts,
      even though most people do try that, but rather in improving our reactions, so that
      eventually equanimity becomes our mode of living. This is the promise the Buddha made to
      us, namely that we can get out of all //dukkha//, all problems, but not by having only
      wonderful sense contacts and not a single moment of unpleasantness. Such a thing has never
      been possible, not even when the Buddha himself was alive. But we can have moments when we
      are actually able to do just that. That one moment gives us the initial experience what it
      is like to be free, which is the only kind of freedom to be found in human life. There is
      no other. Anyone who understands the Buddha's explicit instructions, especially those who
      meditate, can practice in this manner.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The next step to be taken is mindfulness,
      accompanied by clear comprehension (//sampajanna//). Mindfulness is the mental factor of
      just knowing, clear comprehension the one of understanding. We need both. That too can and
      should be practiced in daily life. Mindfulness of the body was praised by the Buddha as
      leading to the &quot;deathless,&quot; a synonym for Nibbana. When we watch our body's
      actions and realize that it can only follow the mind's instructions, this is our first
      step into insight. Usually we take mind and body for granted. Most people are more
      interested in their body than in their mind and are looking after the body very well. Very
      few people are looking after their mind. </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Being aware of our body's movements gives us
      a chance to be alert without thinking, just knowing. Clear comprehension is our
      four-pronged mode of discrimination described previously.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We might think that such discrimination would
      slow us down unduly, that we won't be able to get our work done. Actually it has the
      opposite effect, because we will not do anything that is unnecessary. When we use
      mindfulness and clear comprehension again and again, they will become a habit, which will
      enhance our abilities to attain calm and insight. When we experience our mind ordering our
      body around, this is different from just knowing about it. We become intimately acquainted
      with our dual aspect of mind and body and can begin to investigate where is &quot;me&quot;
      in that. We may eventually find that &quot;me&quot; is our wish to be eternal, not to be
      annihilated.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Most people would like to experience calm,
      bliss and tranquillity in meditation. But those, whose minds are very active need to gain
      insight first in order to become calm. Those, whose minds are more peaceful in any case,
      find it easier to become calm first and gain insight later. A little calm creates a little
      insight and vice versa. In practice we work on both these aspects to give ourselves the
      best chance to develop both simultaneously. When we watch the breath going in and out of
      the nostrils, we try to achieve a calm and peaceful mind. When the mind strays to
      thinking, we first realize &quot;I'm thinking,&quot; and then see the impermanent nature
      of each thought, and how it so often rolls along without any purpose. This is a valuable
      insight, because we can infer that our thoughts are frequently not to be believed, are
      unimportant, have no solidity and do not provide a secure foothold for us.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Without such an experience, we might continue
      to believe all our thoughts and try using them as solid foundations for our life. but when
      we see in meditation, that we can't remember what we were thinking from one second to the
      next, that belief is shattered, never to arise again. When we start doubting our thoughts,
      that doesn't mean we start doubting ourselves. It refers to doubting our views and
      opinions, which is a most valuable practice.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the discourse on living-kindness (Karaniya
      Metta Sutta) an Arahat is described as being totally free from all views. What the Buddha
      expounded to us were his own experiences. Viewpoints are always based on our wrong
      assumption that there is a &quot;me&quot; and are therefore discolored by this underlying
      error. When we realize what our minds are up to, we will eventually stop having so many
      viewpoints and thereby let go of some of the mind's clutter. Most minds are full of ideas,
      hopes, plans, memories and opinions. Right and wrong are often based on culture or
      tradition and have no ultimate validity. They clutter up the mind and leave no space for a
      totally new outlook upon ourselves and the world.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">An important step in this sequence is
      self-conquest, which the Buddha described as the way to Nibbana. As long as we react to
      our feelings created through sense contacts, we must admit that we are
      &quot;reactors&quot; rather than &quot;actors,&quot; victims rather than masters. We like
      to think of ourselves as more exalted than that, yet when we observe reality, that is all
      we can find. As soon as we have overcome this habitual reacting, we have taken a step
      towards conquering ourselves.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We do not force ourselves into unpleasant
      situations, which we haven't learned to cope with yet, because the mind will again react
      negatively, which doesn't help us on the path. We need not sit in excruciating pain in
      meditation, but we need to observe our mind and its activity. This will assist us also in
      daily living when unpleasant feelings and dislike arise because of words we hear or sights
      we see. When we learn to accept things the way they are, self-conquest has taken place
      which releases us from views and opinions.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">//Dukkha// arises from the fact that we don't
      like the law of nature, to which we are subject. We don't like our loved ones dying, we
      don't like physical pain or lack of appreciation, we don't like losing what we prize. If
      we could just accept the way it is it would go a long way towards looking at the world
      more realistically, with less passion, which is the way to freedom. Our passionate desires
      keep us in bounds.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When we have the opportunity to sit quietly
      and watch ourselves, new insights about ourselves may arise. We are the prototype of
      impermanence. But when our mind veers toward the past and starts rehashing old movies,
      it's time to turn it off. The past cannot be changed. The person who experienced the past,
      no longer exists, is only a fantasy now. When the mind strolls to the future, imagining
      how we would like it to be, we can let go by remembering the future has no reality either.
      When it happens, it can only be the present, and the person planning the future is not the
      same one, who will experience it. If we stay in this moment, here and now, during
      meditation, we can use that same skill in daily life.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When we handle each moment with mindfulness
      and clear comprehension, everything functions well, nothing goes amiss, our mind is
      content and inner peace can arise. Keeping our attention focused on each step on the way
      will eventually bring us to the summit.</font></td>
