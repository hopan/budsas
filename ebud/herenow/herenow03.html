      <td width="100%"><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">I</font>t is
      important to experience and not to believe. In order to do that, we have to pay attention.
      In the famous and often quoted Kalama Sutta, the Buddha gives ten points which are not
      suitable as criteria to follow a teacher or a spiritual path. All of them have to do with
      a belief system because of traditional lineage or because of sacred books. Not to believe
      but to find out for ourselves is the often repeated injunction of the Buddha. Unless we do
      that, we cannot have an inner vision, which is the first step that takes us on to the
      noble path.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">An inner vision is an understood experience.
      Without that, insight cannot arise. That holds true for small matters in daily life, just
      as it holds true for the deepest and most profound understanding of the Buddha's teaching.
      If for instance somebody is not pleased with us and we don't understand why, we shall have
      that same disharmony happen to us over and over again. We need to realize that we may have
      said or done something to cause that displeasure. This is a small matter showing the need
      for understanding an experience.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If we think these happenings are something
      outside of ourselves, we can't change our attitudes. Practicing Dhamma means constantly
      changing ourselves to reach out towards the sublime. If change were not possible, the
      Buddha would have given a lifetime of teaching in vain.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Unless we pay total attention to every detail
      we'll never change towards the sublime. Attention to detail is the core of mindfulness.
      Most people lack the practice and also the instructions to be truly mindful. It's one
      thing to read about it, but an entirely different matter to do it. Mindfulness is the
      essence of understanding, because without it there is no seeing into the heart of any
      phenomena.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Watching the breath means &quot;knowing
      exactly&quot;. Mindfulness is not judgmental, nor discriminating, nor telling stories.
      Mindfulness knows when there is concentration and when there isn't when the mind wanders
      off and when the mind becomes peaceful. Perfect mindfulness knows every moment that is
      occurring.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When we pay attention to our feelings and do
      not react to them but only observe, then we're using the second foundation of mindfulness,
      //vedananupassana// (mindfulness of feeling). When we know we're thinking, it's
      //cittanupassana// (mindfulness of thought) and when we know what the content of the
      thought is, it's //dhammanupassana// (mindfulness of mind objects). If we're not paying
      attention, we're not really awake. We need to practice clear attention to any one of these
      at all times.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is possible that in meditation the mind
      becomes concentrated. If there is a feeling of peacefulness, one has to know that quite
      clearly. Without realizing what is happening, one cannot go further, because one doesn't
      know where one is at. This is an important detail of meditation, knowing exactly what's
      happening and being able to verbalize it after the occurrence. The verbalization is the
      understood experience, and occurs naturally after the experience. This holds true for any
      mind-state and for any feeling. The Dhamma is the Buddha's verbalized experience. Unless
      we can do that with our own experiences, we are left with a belief system, which can dull
      the mind. But meditation is to sharpen the mind. The mindful mind is a sharpened axe, with
      a sharp and finely honed blade which can cut through all our illusions. When we sit in
      meditation, we can get to know the disturbances of our own mind: such as the dull mind
      that doesn't know what's going on, or the sleepy mind, the distracted or the resisting
      mind, that doesn't want to obey. That is mindfulness of mind objects.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Like most human beings, we have a distracted
      mind, geared so much towards trying to resist the unpleasant and crave the pleasant, that
      this pattern is very difficult to change. If we find ourselves resisting the unpleasant,
      seeking the pleasant, we just know that this is a normal habit pattern. This is how this
      little spaceship earth operates, and how our economy works. Do you know anybody who's
      blissfully happy because of it? It is an impossible venture, it is a guaranteed failure,
      yet everybody is still trying. We have all been trying long enough, we can give it up, at
      least for the time we're meditation. However it is possible to get rid of //dukkha//, but
      not by eliminating the unpleasant sensations, only by getting rid of our reaction to them.
      This is the most important primary entrance into the spiritual path. Unless this is
      perfectly understood, the rest will not fall into place. We won't get rid of the
      unpleasantness of sitting, or of mosquitoes, or of anything unpleasant we may encounter.
      All is mind-made and therefore mind-reacted. //Dukkha// disappears when our reactions
      disappear.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Unless we know that we are the creators of
      our own //dukkha//, Dhamma remains a mystery. We start practicing when we no longer blame
      our surroundings, other people, the political situation, the economy or the weather. We
      see only our own reactions. Naturally our reactions aren't immediately going to be all
      favorable and wholesome. That will take a while. But at least we can start doing something
      about ourselves.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Mindfulness needs to be used not only in our
      meditation practice, but also every time we move, feel or think in our daily life. While
      awake, mindfulness has to be our primary objective. One has to come to terms with oneself.
      Only then will the world make sense one day. The universe is this mind and body. We find
      out what this mind and body are all about, and we kill know the universe and its
      underlying truth. All is distinctively the same, but we have to know what it is.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When we come out of meditation, we should be
      aware of opening our eyes, moving our body, of everything we are doing. Why? First of all,
      it will keep us from thinking unwholesome, negative thoughts. It facilitates meditation.
      The mind needs to be kept in check and not allowed to run wild. The ordinary, unpracticed
      mind is like a wild bull running around in a garden. It can make a mess of the garden in
      no time. That's what our minds are doing. They're making an awful mess of this world we
      live in. We don't even have to read the newspapers to know about it. It's to be seen
      everywhere, and comes from our own minds. All of us are included, except the enlightened
      ones. A wild mind can't meditate. It has to be caught, kept in check, and a halter put on.
      Every time it runs away, we bring it back with mindfulness, like training a wild horse
      which in its wild state cannot benefit anyone. If the horse is tamed and trained it can be
      extremely useful. How much more this is true of the mind!</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Mindfulness of the body means that we know
      the movements of all parts. As we watch ourselves, we will see that there is mind and
      body. The mind giving the orders, the body following suit. We can recognize too that
      sometimes the body can't obey because it is weak. This is our first entrance into insight,
      realizing there are mind and body and the mind being the more important one. The
      difference between a trained and an untrained person it the understood experience.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Mindfulness which extends to the body
      movements extends to the other aspects of mindfulness as well. If, for instance, we are
      thinking about the future we are no longer paying attention to the body; instead we can
      pay attention to the thought process. We know that we are thinking, and are making kamma.
      The thoughts are the mental formations, as well as the kamma formations. We are the owners
      of our kamma. Whatever we think, that we will be. It's an impersonal process which has
      nothing to do with any particular entity.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Then we can become aware of the content of
      our thoughts, which means knowing whether it is wholesome or not. We can learn to drop any
      negative thinking and replace it. This is where our meditation training comes in, which is
      not divorced from outer activities. When we pay attention to the breath in meditation and
      a thought intervenes, we learn to let go of the thought and come back to the breath. The
      same procedure is used in daily life to let go of unwholesome thoughts. We substitute at
      that time with a wholesome thought, just as we substitute with the breath in meditation.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Mindfulness of the thinking process is what
      the Buddha Named the &quot;four supreme efforts.&quot; [*] They constitute the heart of
      the purification process. The spiritual path is the path of purification and hinges on
      mindfulness. &quot;There's only one way for the purification of beings, for the overcoming
      of //dukkha//, for the final elimination of pain, grief and lamentation, for entering the
      noble path, for realizing Nibbana, that's mindfulness.&quot; (Words of the Buddha). To
      practice the purification process is necessary not only for one's own peace of mind, for
      adding to the peace in the world, but also in order to be able to meditate.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">* [The four supreme efforts (//padhana//)
      are: 1. To avoid unwholesome states of mind 2. To overcome unwholesome states of mind 3.
      To develop wholesome states of mind 4. To maintain wholesome states of mind.]</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The hope that one might sit down on a pillow,
      watch the breath and become concentrated, is a myth. One has to have the mind in proper
      shape for it. Therefore, we must practice these four supreme efforts not only while we are
      meditating, but in every-day life. We will gain inner peace which everybody is looking for
      and very few people ever find.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The first effort is not to let an unwholesome
      thought arise which has not yet arisen. The requires sharp mindfulness. A thought which
      has not yet arisen creates waves ahead of it. To realize that these waves are boding no
      good, needs much attention and practice. The second effort, not to continue an unwholesome
      thought which has already arisen, can be done by anyone of good will, if it is understood
      that there is nobody else to blame. Unwholesome thinking is not due to outer triggers, but
      results strictly from our own defilements.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The third step is to make a wholesome thought
      arise which has not yet arisen. This means that we continually watch over our mind and
      encourage positive, wholesome thoughts where none are present even under the most trying
      circumstances.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Finally, to make a wholesome thought, which
      has already arisen, continue. In the meditation practice, this concerns our meditation
      subject. But in daily life it means our mind's reaction. If we have some sensitivity
      towards ourselves, we can feel that there is a disturbance within when unwholesome
      thinking arises, a feeling of resistance. Unwholesome thoughts have been thought of so
      often for so many years, that they have become part and parcel of our thinking process. It
      takes mindfulness and determination to let go.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In meditation we become aware that our
      unwholesome thoughts are not caused by someone or something external. Then we gain the
      power of mind to drop what we don't want, to keep and substitute with what is useful for
      us. These four supreme efforts are the fourth foundation of mindfulness concerned with the
      contents of our thoughts. If everybody in the world were practicing this, it would be a
      better world to live in.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Our inner being manifests in feeling, which
      arises through our sense contacts. Thinking is also a sense contact. Unwholesome thinking
      produces unpleasant feelings, such as being ill at ease, or unhappy. Seeing, hearing,
      tasting, touching, smelling are the five outer senses. Thinking is the inner one. All of
      them make contact and produce a feeling. There is the eye and the eye object. When both
      are in good condition, the eye consciousness arises and seeing results. The sense base,
      the sense object and the sense consciousness meet. When we know how this being, which we
      call &quot;me&quot;, operates, we can stop the pre-programmed print-out, that's always
      answering the same way. It is quite possible to predict how a person will react to any
      given stimulus, because we have a program which has never been interrupted yet. To
      discontinue it, we first have to know that there is a program and what it consists of.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">For instance, we have the hearing base, which
      is the ear drum; then there is sound. When the hearing consciousness arises, because both
      base and object are present, hearing results and from that a feeling arises. The ear can
      only hear sound, the eye can only see form and color. The mind does all the explaining.
      Everybody has a slightly different explanation, so that nobody sees or hears anything
      alike. When one man sees a woman, and sees her form and color, the mind says &quot;isn't
      she beautiful, I must marry her.&quot; When I see that same woman, I don't think anything
      like that. Yet everyone tries to convince the people around them that what they themselves
      are seeing and hearing is correct. Because they often can't convince others, they start
      shooting or persecuting them.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Thinking is also a sense contact. There is
      the brain base and there are ideas. The mind consciousness arises, contacting the idea and
      thinking starts. From that a feeling results. If we think we love every being, whether we
      actually can do it or not, we certainly get a warm pleasant feeling from the thought. By
      the same token, if we think we hate a person, we get a cold and distant feeling. Now comes
      the reaction to the feeling, which is either wanting/craving or not wanting/ rejecting. By
      being attentive to ourselves, we can experience that quite clearly. The reaction to the
      feeling is our renewed entry into duality and //dukkha//. At the same time it provides us
      with the doorway out of all difficulties. If for once we don't react, but know a feeling
      just as a feeling, if we can do that, mindfulness has been established. We also gain the
      confidence that we can do it again, and are actually practicing spiritual purification.
      That is an important inner conviction. The Buddha said we need both, study and practice.
      It helps us to know something of what the Buddha taught. But if we don't practice, then we
      are only parrots or hypocrites, proclaiming something we have no personal experience with.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Through our practice of mindfulness we become
      aware of the feelings which arise when we make sense contacts. Feelings happen all the
      time and need to be recognized so that we can change our instinctive way of living to a
      deliberate way of being alive. Instinctively we are a constant reactor. Deliberately we
      become an actor.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Probably the most important lesson we can
      learn is to keep our mindfulness going in our every-day activities. We can practice
      wherever we are, at home, marketing, in the office, writing letters, telephoning, any time
      at all. The meditation itself gives us the impetus, showing how awareness removes the
      obstacles inherent in our viewpoints. We cannot see the whole, only parts. We see what is
      around us, but we never see beyond that. With mindfulness comes an opening, where
      everything seems to fall into place and has an interconnection. We lose our exaggerated
      sense of self-importance, and can unite more with all manifestations. All these are still
      side issues. Mindfulness means knowing. As we know and really experience, we can prove,
      eventually, the four noble truths to ourselves. then our work is completed.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Mindfulness has, as one of its factors, the
      ability to be one pointed. We do not become foggy or distracted, but can keep the mind in
      its place. We have to realize that mind obstructions are a human calamity and not a
      personal one. This understanding helps us to patiently endure and gradually change.</font></td>
