      are often surprised to find it is difficult to meditate. Outwardly it seems to be such a
      simple matter, to just sit down on a little pillow and watch one's breath. What could be
      hard about that? The difficulty lies in the fact that one's whole being is totally
      unprepared. Our mind, senses, and feelings are used to trade in the market place, namely
      the world we live in. But meditation cannot be done in a market place. That's impossible.
      There's nothing to buy or trade or arrange in meditation, but most people's attitude
      remains the same as usual and that just doesn't work.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We need patience with ourselves. It takes
      time to change to the point where meditation is actually a state of mind, available at any
      time because the market place is no longer important. The market place doesn't just mean
      going shopping. It means everything that is done in the world: all the connections, ideas,
      hopes and memories, all the rejections and resistances, all our reactions.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In meditation there are may be momentary
      glimpses of seeing that concentration is feasible, but it can't be sustained. It
      constantly slips again and the mind goes right back to where it came from. In order to
      counteract that, one has to have determination to make one's life a meditative one; it
      doesn't mean one has to meditate from morning to night. I don't know anyone who does. And
      it doesn't mean we cannot fulfill our duties and obligations, because they are necessary
      and primary as long as we have them. But it means that we watch ourselves carefully in all
      our actions and reactions to make sure that everything happens in the light of the Dhamma
      -- the truth. This applies to the smallest detail such as our food, what we listen to or
      talk about. Only then can the mind be ready with a meditative quality when we sit down on
      the pillow. It means that no matter where we find ourselves, we remain introspective. That
      doesn't mean we can't talk to others, but we watch the content of the discussion.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">That is not easy to do and the mind often
      slips off. But we can become aware of the slip. If we aren't even aware that we have
      digressed from mindfulness and inner watchfulness, we aren't on the meditative path yet.
      If our mind has the Dhamma quality established within, then meditation has a good chance.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The more we know of the Dhamma, the more we
      can watch whether we comply with its guidelines. There is no blame attached to our
      inability to do so. But the least we can do is to know the guidelines and know where we're
      making mistakes. Then we practice to get nearer and nearer to absolute reality, until one
      day we will actually //be// the Dhamma.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There is this difference between one who know
      and one who practices. The one who knows may understand the words and concepts but the one
      who practices knows only one thing, namely, to become that truth. Words are an utilitarian
      means not only for communication, but also to solidify ideas. That's why words can never
      reveal the truth, only personal experience can. We attain our experiences through
      realizing what's happening within and why it is as it is. This means that we combine
      watchfulness with inquiry as to why we're thinking, saying and reacting the way we do.
      Unless we use our mind in this way, meditation will be an on-again, off-again affair and
      will remain difficult. When meditation doesn't bring joy, most people are quite happy to
      forget about it.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Without the meditative mind and experience,
      the Dhamma cannot arise in the heart, because the Dhamma is not in words. The Buddha was
      able to verbalize his inner experience for our benefit, to give us a guideline. That means
      we can find a direction, but we have to do the traveling ourselves.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To have a meditative mind, we need to develop
      some important inner qualities. We already have their seed within, otherwise we couldn't
      cultivate them. If we want flowers in our garden and there are no seeds, we can water and
      fertilize, yet nothing will grow. The watering and fertilizing of the mind is done in
      meditation. Weeding has to be done in daily living. Weeds always seem to grow better in
      any garden than the flowers do. It takes a lot of strength to uproot those weeds, but it
      is not so difficult to cut them down. As they get cut down again and again, they
      eventually become feeble and their uprooting is made easy. Cutting down and uprooting the
      weeds needs sufficient introspection into ourselves to know what is a weed and what is a
      flower. We have to be very sure, because we don't want to pull out all the flowers and
      leave all the weeds. A garden with many weeds isn't much of an ornament.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">People's hearts and minds usually contain
      equal amounts of flowers and weeds. We're born with the three roots of evil: greed, hate
      and delusion, and the three roots of good: generosity, loving-kindness and wisdom. Doesn't
      it make sense to try and get rid of those three roots which are the generators of all
      problems, all our unpleasant experiences and reactions?</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If we want to eliminate those three roots, we
      have to look at their outcrops. They're the roots underneath the surface, but obviously a
      root sprouts and shows itself above the surface. We can see that within ourselves. Caused
      by delusion, we manifest greed and hate. There are different facets of greed and hate, and
      the simplest and most common one is &quot;I like,&quot; &quot;I want,&quot; &quot;I don't
      like,&quot; and &quot;I don't want&quot;. Most people think such reactions are perfectly
      justified, and yet that is greed and hate. Our roots have sprouted in so many different
      ways that we have all sorts of weeds growing. If we look at a garden we will find possibly
      thirty or forty different types of weeds. We might have that many or more unwholesome
      thoughts and emotions. They have different appearances and power but they're all coming
      from the same roots. As we can't get at the roots yet, we have to deal with what is above
      the surface. When we cultivate the good roots, they become so mighty and strong that the
      weeds do not find enough nourishment any more. As long as we allow room for the weeds in
      our garden, we take the nutriment away from the beautiful plants, instead of cultivating
      those more and more. This takes place as a development in daily living, which then makes
      it possible to meditate as a natural outcome of our state of mind.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">At this point in time we are trying to change
      our mind from an ordinary one to a meditative one, which is difficult if one hasn't
      practiced very much yet. We only have one mind and carry that around with us to every
      activity and also to the meditation. If we have an inkling that meditation can bring us
      peace and happiness, then we need to make sure we have a meditative mind already when we
      sit down. To change it from busy-ness to quiet at that moment is too difficult.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The state of mind which we need to develop
      for meditation is well described by the Buddha. Two aspects of importance are mindfulness
      and the calming of the senses. Internal mindfulness may sometimes be exchanged for
      external mindfulness because under some circumstances that is an essential part of
      practice. The world impinges upon us, which we cannot deny.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">External mindfulness also means to see a
      tree, for instance, in a completely new way. Not with the usual thoughts of &quot;that's
      pretty,&quot; or &quot;I like this one in may garden,&quot; but rather noticing that there
      are live and dead leaves, that there are growing plants, mature ones and dying ones. We
      can witness the growth, birth and decay all around us. We can understand craving very
      clearly by watching ants, mosquitoes, dogs. We need not look at them as a nuisance, but as
      teachers. Ants, mosquitoes and barking dogs are the kind of teachers who don't leave us
      alone until the lessons are fully learned. When we see all in the light of birth, decay,
      death, greed, hate and delusion, we are looking in a mirror of all life around us, then we
      have Dhamma on show. All of us are proclaiming the truth of Dhamma constantly, only we
      don't pay enough attention.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We can use mindfulness to observe that
      everything in existence consists of the four elements, earth, fire, water, air; and then
      check out what is the difference between ourselves and all else. When we take practice
      seriously and look at all life in such a way, then we find the truth all around as well as
      within us. Nothing else exists.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This gives us the ability to leave the
      marketplace behind where the mind flits from one thing to the next, never has a moment's
      peace, is either dull and indifferent or hateful and greedy. But when we look at that
      which really is, we're drawing nearer to what the Buddha taught, out of his compassion for
      all the beings that are roaming around in //samsara// from one //dukkha// to the next. He
      taught, so that people like us may awaken to the truth.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We should neither believe nor disbelieve what
      we hear or read, but try it out ourselves. If we give our wholehearted attention to this
      practice, we will find that it changes our approach to living and dying. To be
      whole-hearted is a necessity in anything we do. If we get married and are half-hearted
      about it, that cannot be very successful. Half-hearted practice of Dhamma results in
      chaotic misunderstanding. Whole-heartedness may have at its core devotion, and a mind
      which goes beyond everyday thoughts and activities.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Another facet which goes together with
      mindfulness, is clear comprehension. Mindfulness is knowing only, without any
      discriminating faculty. Mindfulness does not evaluate of judge but pays full attention.
      Clear comprehension has four aspects to it. First: &quot;What is my purpose in thinking,
      talking or doing?&quot; Thought, speech and action are our three doors. Second &quot;Am I
      using the most skillful means for my purpose?&quot; That needs wisdom and discrimination.
      Third: &quot;Are these means within the Dhamma?&quot; Knowing the distinction between
      wholesome and unwholesome. The thought process needs our primary attention, because speech
      and action will follow from it. Sometimes people think that the end justifies the means.
      It doesn't. Both means and end have to be within the Dhamma. The fourth step is to check
      whether our purpose has been accomplished, and if not, why not.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If we live with these steps in mind, we will
      slow down, which is helpful for our reactions. No inactivity, that is not the answer, but
      the meditative quality of the mind, which watches over what we are doing. When we use
      mindfulness and clear comprehension, we have to give time to investigate. Checking
      prevents mistakes.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Our wrong thinking creates the danger of
      making bad kamma and takes us away from the truth into nebulous mind-states. The Dhamma is
      straight forward, simple and pure. It needs a pure mind to stay with it. Otherwise we find
      ourselves outside of it again and again.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">External mindfulness can also extend to other
      people, but here we need to be very careful. Seeing and knowing others engenders negative
      judgment. If we practice external mindfulness towards other people, we have to realize
      that judging others is making bad kamma. We can pay attention with compassion.
      People-watching is one of the most popular pastimes but usually done with the intention of
      finding fault. Everyone who's not enlightened has faults; even the highly developed
      non-returner has yet five fetters to lose. What to say about ordinary worldlings? To use
      other people as our mirror is very helpful because they reflect our own being. We can only
      see in others what we already know about ourselves. The rest is lost to us.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If we add clear comprehension to our
      mindfulness and check our purpose and skillful means we will eliminate much grief and
      worry. We will develop an awareness which will make every day, every moment an adventure.
      Most people feel bogged down and burdened. Either they have too much or too little to do;
      not enough money to do what they like or they frantically move about trying to occupy
      themselves. Everybody wants to escape mechanism that each one chooses does not provide
      real inner joy. However with mindfulness and clear comprehension, just watching a tree is
      fascinating. It brings a new dimension to our life, a buoyancy of mind, enabling us to
      grasp wholeness, instead of the limitations of our family, job, hopes and dreams. That way
      we can expand, because we're fascinated with what we see around and within us, and want to
      explore further. No &quot;my&quot; mind, &quot;my&quot; body, &quot;my&quot; tree, but
      just phenomena all around us, to provide us with the most fascinating, challenging
      schoolroom that anybody could ever find. Our interest in the schoolroom increases as
      mindfulness increases.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To develop a meditative mind, we also need to
      calm our senses. We don't have to deny our senses, that would be foolishness, but see them
      for what they are. Mara the tempter is not a fellow with a long tail and a flaming red
      tongue, but rather our senses. We hardly ever pay attention to what they do to us when
      they pull us from an interesting sight to a beautiful sound, and back to the sight, the
      tough, the idea. No Peace! Our constant endeavor is to catch a moment's pleasure.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A sense contact has to be very fleeting,
      because otherwise it becomes a great //dukkha//. Let's say we are offered a very nice meal
      which tastes extremely good. So we say to our host: &quot;That's a very nice meal, I like
      it very much.&quot; The host replies: &quot;I have lots of food here, please stay around
      and eat for another two or three hours.&quot; If we did, we would not only get sick in
      body but also disgusted in our mind. A meal can last twenty or at the most thirty minutes.
      Each taste contact can only last a second, then we have to chew and swallow. If we were to
      keep it in the mouth any longer, it would become very unpleasant.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Maybe we feel very hot and go to take a cold
      shower. We say to our friend waiting outside: &quot;Now I feel good, that cold water is
      very pleasant.&quot; Our friend says: &quot;We have plenty of cold water, you can have a
      shower for the next five to six hours.&quot; Nothing but absolute misery would result. We
      can enjoy a cold shower for ten or twenty minutes at the most.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Anything that is prolonged will create
      //dukkha//. All contacts pass quickly, because that is their nature. The same goes for
      sight, our eyes are continually blinking. We can't even keep sight constant for the length
      of time we're looking at anything. We may be looking at a beautiful painting for a little
      while and really like it. Someone says: &quot;You can stay here and look at the painting
      for the next five hours, we're not closing the museum yet.&quot; Nobody could do that. We
      can't look at the same thing a long time, without feeling bored, losing all awareness, or
      even falling asleep. Sense contacts are not only limited because of their inability to
      give satisfaction. They are actually waves that come and go. If we are listening to some
      lovely music, after a few hours the same music becomes unbearable. Our sense contacts are
      mirroring a reflection of satisfaction, which has no real basis in fact. That's Mara
      constantly leading us astray. </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There's a pertinent story of a monk in the
      Buddha's time which relates the ultimate in sense discipline. A married couple had a big
      row and the woman decided to run away. She put on several of her best saris, one over the
      other, wore all her gold jewelry and left. After a while the husband was sorry that he had
      let her go and followed her. He ran here and there, but couldn't find her. Finally he came
      across a monk who was walking along the street. he asked the monk if he'd seen a woman in
      a red sari with long black hair and lots of jewelry around her neck and arms. The monk
      said: &quot;I saw a set of teeth going by.&quot;</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The monk was not paying attention to the
      concepts of a woman with long black hair, a red sari, and lots of jewelry, but only to the
      fact that there was a human being with a set of teeth. He had calmed his senses to the
      point where the sight object was no longer tempting him into a reaction. An ordinary
      person at the sight of a beautiful woman with black hair, a red sari and lots of jewelry,
      running excitedly along the street, might have been tempted to follow her. A set of teeth
      going by, is highly unlikely to create desire. That is calming the senses.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If we come upon a snake, it's not an object
      of dislike, or destruction, but just a sentient being that happens to be around. That's
      all. There's nothing to be done, nothing to react to. If we think of it as a snake that
      could kill us, then of course, the mind can go berserk, just as the monk's mind could have
      done, if he had thought &quot;Oh, what a beautiful woman.&quot;</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If we watch our senses again and again, this
      becomes a habit, and is no longer difficult. Life will be much more peaceful. The world as
      we know it consists of so much proliferation. Everywhere are different colors, shapes,
      beings and nature's growth. Each species of tree has hundreds of sub-species. Nature
      proliferates. All of us look different. If we don't guard our senses, this proliferation
      in the world will keep us attracted life after life. There's too much to see, do, know and
      react to. Since there is no end to all of that we might as well stop and delve inside of
      ourselves.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A meditative mind is achieved through
      mindfulness, clear comprehension and calming the senses. These three aspects of practice
      need to be done in everyday life. Peace and harmony will result, and our meditation will
      flourish.</font></td>
