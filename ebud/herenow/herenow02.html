      two aspects of our being are mind and body. We have to pay attention to both of them, even
      though meditation is a mind exercise, not a body exercise.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some of the most common questions are:
      &quot;How am I going to learn to sit?&quot; &quot;How am I not going to have any
      pain?&quot; That is only possible through continued application, doing it again and again.
      In the beginning, the body just doesn't like sitting cross-legged on the floor.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We can use this situation as skillful means.
      When discomfort arises in the body, we learn to pay attention to the mind's reaction, and
      do not move automatically. Everybody in the world is trying to get out of any kind of
      discomfort with an instinctive, immediate reaction. It's not that we're not going to get
      out of discomfort, but in order to make meditation pay off, we have to learn to get out of
      instinctive, immediate reactions. It's those that land us in //dukkha// over and over
      again.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When there is an uncomfortable feeling, it is
      essential to realize what is happening within. We notice that there is a sense contact, in
      this case &quot;touch!&quot; The body is making contact; the knees with the pillow, the
      legs with each other, several contacts are happening. From all sense contacts, feelings
      arise. There is no way out of that, this is how human beings are made. The Buddha taught
      cause and effect, that dependent upon any sense contact, feeling results. There are three
      kinds of feelings, pleasant, unpleasant and neutral. We can forget about the neutral ones,
      because we are hardly ever aware of them. Neutral is actually considered pleasant, because
      at least it doesn't hurt. From this particular touch contact that is being made through
      the sitting posture, there arises, after a while, an unpleasant feeling. The immediate
      reaction is to move. Don't! Investigate! By getting to know our own mind, we get to know
      the world and the universe. All minds contain the seed of enlightenment. Unless we know
      our own mind, we cannot develop and cultivate that seed. here the mind has been contacted
      with an unpleasant feeling, our perception says: &quot;this is painful.&quot; Our next
      step are the mental formations, which are also kamma formations, because we make kamma
      through our thought processes.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">First came the sense contact, secondly
      feeling arose. Then perception, naming it, followed by dislike. At the moment of dislike,
      there is the running away through changing our position. That is the kamma making aspect.
      This is minor negative kamma, yet it's negative, because the mind is in a state of
      ill-will by saying &quot;I don't like it.&quot;</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The mind may start all kinds of
      rationalizations: &quot;I wish I'd brought my own little chair&quot;; &quot;I can't
      sit&quot;; &quot;At my age I shouldn't do things like this&quot;; &quot;Meditation is too
      difficult.&quot; None of these explanations have any intrinsic validity, they are only a
      mind reacting to an unpleasant feeling. Unless we become acquainted with our mind's
      reactions, we're not using meditation in the most beneficial manner.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Knowing the unpleasant feeling, we can now
      try to acquaint ourselves with its true nature. Our whole life is lived according to our
      feelings. Unless we become aware of our reactions to feelings, we remain half asleep.
      There is a beautiful little book called //The Miracle of Being Awake//. This miracle is
      nothing but mindfulness, knowing what's going on within. When we have realized we want to
      get rid of the unpleasant feeling, then we can try to disown it for a moment. Only the
      Arahant is fully capable of complete detachment, but we can do so for a short time. The
      unpleasant feeling has arisen without our asking for it and we don't have to believe it to
      be ours. We can let it be just a feeling.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If we do that for a moment, we can get back
      to the meditation subject, and have won a victory over our own negative reactions.
      Otherwise we are letting our unpleasant feelings rule us in whatever way they want. The
      whole of humanity runs after pleasant feelings, and away from unpleasant ones. Unless we
      at least know that, we have no reference point for inner change. It may not be possible to
      reverse that reaction yet, but at least we know it is happening.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">After we have become aware of our mind's
      intention, we're free to move and change our sitting position. There is nothing wrong with
      changing one's posture but there's something wrong with instinctive, impetuous habits.
      Meditation means total awareness. Being awake is not the opposite of being asleep; it is
      the opposite of being dull and foggy. Such mind states are mostly due to an unwillingness
      to look at our own //dukkha//. We'd rather hide in a fog. In meditation that won't do. The
      Buddha said that this body is a cancer; the body as a whole is a disease, and we can
      experience that when just sitting still, it becomes uncomfortable.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Meditation means //samatha// and
      //vipassana//, calm and insight. Unless we know the limitations of each and also their
      possibilities, we won't be able to make good use of the practice. We are generally
      applying both of them in every session, but we must be able to distinguish between them.
      If there is no understanding of what's happening in the mind, the fog settles down in it.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Everybody would like bliss, peace and
      happiness. That is a natural wish. They are available in meditation, with a lot of
      practice, and some good kamma. However they are not the goal of meditation. The goal of
      meditation is insight. Yet skillful means for gaining insight are needed and are found in
      tranquillity meditation.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Making use of a meditation subject, the mind,
      after some training, will be able to stay on it for a while. Presuming that the mind is
      able to focus on the breath for even a short time, we realize afterwards that some peace
      arose, because the mind was not thinking. The thinking process in everybody's mind is
      hardly ever profound. It's just thinking. Just as the body breathes, so the mind keeps
      churning. And it keeps churning out mostly irrelevant, unsubstantial and unimportant
      details, without which we would be much happier.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The mind in its original form is pure. It's
      clear and lucid, luminous, pliable and expandable. Our thinking is the impurity and the
      blockage. There's hardly a person who doesn't think all day long, probably without even
      being aware of it. But when we start meditating, we do become aware of our inner
      restlessness. We realize we can't keep the mind on the meditation subject, because we are
      thinking instead of meditating. The moment we experience our thinking habit (even that
      takes time to realize) we accomplish two things. We become aware of our mind's activity
      and also the content of our thoughts. We will realize immediately that our thinking is
      irrelevant and makes little or no sense. Because of that, we can let go of it fairly
      easily and return to the meditation subject. We have to be able to stand back and watch
      the thinking process and not get involved in it. Otherwise we'll just keep on thinking
      instead of meditating.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The mind is the greatest and most delicate
      tool existing in the universe. All of us have it, but few look after it properly.
      Practically everybody is interested in looking after their bodies. Eating, sleeping,
      washing, exercising, seeing the doctor when the body is sick, cutting hair, nails, filling
      teeth, doing everything that's necessary to keep the body functioning well. In reality,
      the body is the servant and the mind is the master. So we are looking after the servant
      and forgetting the master. If we do that in our homes, we create chaos. That's one of the
      reasons why the world looks as chaotic as it does. People kill each other, steal from each
      other, are unfaithful, lie, gossip and slander. Most have absolutely no ideas that the
      mind is our most precious asset. It gives us wealth beyond compare and yet we don't know
      how to look after it.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We have to do exactly the same thing for the
      mind as we do for the body. We need to give it a rest. Imagine if we didn't go to sleep
      for three or four days, how would we feel? Without energy, without strength, pretty
      terrible. The body needs a rest, but the mind does too. During the day it thinks, at night
      it dreams. It's always busy. The only real rest it can ever get, which energizes and gives
      the needed boost to become clear and lucid, is to stay on the meditation subject.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The mind needs a clean-up, which means
      purification. This happens when all thinking is stopped for a while, because of
      one-pointed concentration. One moment of concentration is one moment of purification. At
      that time the mind cannot contain ill-will or sensual desire, or any other negativity.
      When the concentration ceases, the mind reverts to its usual behavior again. In meditation
      we can experience that a purified mind gives us happiness, and quite naturally we will try
      to keep that purification process going also in daily living.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The mind needs the kind of exercise that is
      not geared towards winning or achieving anything, but just to obey. When we ask the mind
      to stay on the meditation subject, yet it runs away from it, we know immediately that we
      are not the master of our mind, but that the mind does what it pleases. When we have
      realized that, we will be less likely to believe our own views and opinions, particularly
      when they are unwholesome, because we understand that the mind is simply thinking
      habitually. Only through the meditation process can we become aware of that. The mind also
      requires the right kind of food. Because in meditation we can reach states of higher
      consciousness, we are thereby able to nourish the mind in a way which cannot happen in the
      ordinary thinking process. Tranquillity meditation leads the mind into realms which are
      totally unavailable to us otherwise. Happiness and peacefulness arise without dependence
      on outer conditions, which give us a new freedom.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The mind of every human being contains the
      seed of Nibbana. We need training in order to realize what is obscuring our vision. Then
      the seed can be cultivated and nurtured to full growth. Because our minds contain such a
      potential, they also contain the peace and happiness which everybody wants. Most people
      try to find fulfillment through acquiring material objects, seeing or touching, eating or
      knowing them. Particularly having more and keeping it all safe.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This dependency is a guarantee for
      //dukkha//. As long as we depend on outer conditions, whether people, experiences,
      countries, religions, wealth or fame, we are in constant fear of losing our footing,
      because everything changes and vanishes. The only way we can have real peace and
      happiness, is by being independent of all around us. That means gaining access to the
      purity of our mind without thinking, which involves staying on our meditation subject long
      enough for our consciousness to change. The thinking consciousness is the consciousness we
      all know. It contains constant ups and downs, either liking or disliking, wanting
      something in the future or regretting something about the past, hoping for better days or
      remembering worse ones. It is always anxious and cannot be expected to be totally
      peaceful.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We are familiar with a different
      consciousness also, for instance when we love someone very much. That emotion changes our
      consciousness to where we are only giving from the heart. We know a different
      consciousness when we are involved with religious activities, with faith and confidence
      aroused. We are giving ourselves to an ideal. None of that lasts through, and all depends
      upon outer conditions.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Through meditation we can change our
      consciousness to an awareness of purity within, which all of us have, only obscured
      through thinking. At that time we realize that such an independent peace and happiness are
      only possible when the &quot;me&quot; and &quot;mine&quot; are forgotten for a moment,
      when &quot;I want to be happy&quot; is eliminated. It is impossible to have peace when
      thinking about &quot;self.&quot; This will be our first inkling of what the Buddha meant,
      when he said non-self (//anatta//) is the way out of //dukkha//.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Because it is difficult for the mind to stay
      on the meditation subject, we have to use everything that arises for insight. Eventually
      the mind becomes clear and sharp and is no longer bothered by the outer manifestations
      that touch upon it, such as sound and thought, which are the most common ones. Finally a
      depth of concentration is reached.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When unpleasant feelings arise let us use
      them for insight. We didn't ask for the feelings, why are they ours? They are certainly
      changeable, they get worse or better, they move their position, and they give us a very
      good indication that the body is //dukkha//.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The body isn't doing anything except sitting,
      and yet we have //dukkha//, for the simple reason of not liking the feeling as it is. When
      we use the unpleasant feeling to actually realize the first and second noble truths, we've
      come nearer to the Dhamma in our hearts. The first noble truth being the noble truth of
      //dukkha//, the second being the reason for //dukkha//, namely craving. In this case,
      we're craving to get rid of the unpleasant feelings. If we were totally accepting of the
      feeling, not making any value judgments, there would be no //dukkha//.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We can try letting go of this craving for a
      moment; anyone with some strength of mind can do that. Just accepting the feeling as it
      is, not disliking it. Then there's no //dukkha//, for just that moment. That will be a
      profound insight experience, because it will show without the shadow of a doubt, that if
      we drop our desires, //dukkha// disappears. Naturally when the body feels uncomfortable,
      it's difficult to drop the craving to get rid of that discomfort. But anybody can do it
      for just one moment, and it's an essential and in-depth experience of the Dhamma.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When we are able to step back to observe our
      thought processes we realize that the mind is continually thinking. It may take from 5-10
      minutes to become aware of that, for someone who hasn't practiced meditation previously.
      For an experienced meditator it may only take a second or two. Next we can see what kind
      of thinking we are indulging in and the more often we see it, the less enraptured we'll be
      with it. We become aware of the fact that this is the way the human mind acts, not just
      ours, but everybody's and we'll know the truth about the mind. There is nothing else to be
      seen except that. When we observe that the thinking goes on and that it is insignificant,
      it will be so much easier to let go. We also see how very fleeting thoughts are, how they
      come and go all the time. We'll know from experience then, that no real happiness is to be
      found in something so short-lived, yet the whole world is trying to achieve happiness that
      way. We can't even remember what we thought a moment ago, how can that bring happiness?
      Such insights make it possible to drop the distractions and get back to the meditation
      subject.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We are using the two approaches of calm and
      insight in conjunction with each other. When calm is firmly established, insight arises
      spontaneously. It's important to realize that calm meditation is essential. If isn't as if
      some people like it and others don't.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If the ocean has high waves and we want to
      look beneath the surface to see what can be found there, we can't recognize anything at
      all while the waves are rising. There is too much movement, all is stirred up and nothing
      is to be seen. When the waves subside and the ocean surface becomes calm and transparent,
      then we can look underneath the surface of the water and see sand, coral and multi-colored
      fish. It's the same in the mind. When the mind has all the waves and motions of thinking,
      that churning in the mind makes it impossible to see absolute reality. On the contrary,
      the mind refuses to look beyond ordinary knowing. But when the mind becomes totally calm,
      then there is no value judgment, and we can see easily what lies underneath the surface.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In order to understand the Buddha's teaching,
      we have to get below the surface, otherwise our insights will be superficial. The calm
      mind is the means for delving below relative reality. While we are trying to become calm,
      at the same time we're objectively examining all that arises, so that there is more and
      more support for letting go of the thinking. The less we believe in our thoughts, the less
      we expect of them and the happier we will be to let them go. Then we get an inkling of
      what inner peace and happiness mean.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These inner feelings are most pronounced in
      meditation, but can be carried into daily living in a milder form, primarily because the
      mind knows it can always return to peace and happiness in meditation, without having to
      depend on any situation or any person. Worldly affairs no longer have the former sting in
      them; they are just happening, that's all, the same as thinking and feeling are arising
      and ceasing, without an owner or a maker. </font></td>
