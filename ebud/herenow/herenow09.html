      four pathways to power are, according to the Buddha, essential aspects of realizing
      liberation. He said: &quot;If a monk or nun has missed the four pathways to power, they
      have missed the way to liberation. If they have practiced the four pathways to power, they
      are practicing the right way.&quot;</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These four pathways are initially mundane,
      which means they are an endeavor, which all of us are capable of pursuing. Only when they
      have become powers, are they supermundane and constitute four of the 37 factors of
      enlightenment.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Because they are so essential to practice and
      cannot be disregarded, we need to know about them in detail. We have to understand them in
      an analytical way, so that we can check up on our own results. This is the criterion that
      eventually turns knowledge into wisdom. We can learn any of the Buddha's teachings by
      heart, that's not so difficult, but consequently we need to look at these teachings in the
      light of personal endeavor. We can check whether our practice has borne fruit or not. If
      so, we will continue in the same way as before; if not we need to alter our approach. By
      investigating within whether we are actually doing what the Buddha taught and whether it
      has become part of our own inner being, we gain insight into our mind's capacity. When we
      see that, through practice, we have been able to enlarge the abilities of our mind, we
      will not become complacent, but resolve to increase them further.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The four pathways to power start out with
      //chandha-samadhi//. //Chandha// is intention, and can be wholesome, unwholesome or
      neutral. It also means desire or direction. In order to make it a pathway to power we have
      to use it as the intention towards complete insight. //Samadhi//, as part of the term,
      means that the intention has to be fully concentrated and not dissipated. This would be
      the difference between living a worldly life or living a life wholly dedicated to
      spiritual endeavor.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In a worldly life, we are forced to dissipate
      our intentions into different directions. It is the nature of life in the world. The
      necessity for obtaining and looking after many different objects, even though we can
      minimize that, will take up some time. There are always people and material aspects who
      have a claim on us. We have to honor those claims. Our own ambitions and desires are being
      fostered in the world as being useful and commendable. In order to cultivate
      &quot;concentration of intention&quot; leading to total liberation, we need to be in
      circumstances where no obstacles arise.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">All four of the pathways have willpower as an
      adjunct. Concentration of intention also includes one-pointedness. It only becomes a true
      pathway when our intention is directed towards the greatest power of all, namely the power
      arising from letting go of all craving.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The second pathway is &quot;concentration of
      energy,&quot; (//viriya-samadhi//). Everyone has a certain amount of physical energy which
      sometimes becomes detrimental to our mental endeavor when there is too much restlessness.
      If we have too little physical energy, that is also counterproductive. But mental energy
      can be increased, namely by being one-pointed, using our energy in one direction only, not
      having many irons in the fire. We need to be clear about what is of the utmost importance
      for us in this life. This needs checking up in the quiet introspection of our own
      contemplation. &quot;What is it that I want most?&quot; &quot;Where do I want to expend my
      energy?&quot; &quot;What is my main intention?&quot;</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The answer may not be to come to the end of
      //dukkha//. That is all right too. But we can benefit by concentrating our energy and
      intention no matter where we are heading, as it will protect us from wasting our time with
      useless actions.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The willpower we can arouse depends very much
      on our insight. If we have seen the urgency of our own spiritual growth, we will find it
      easier to have the will for practice. All of us are subject to instinctual actions and
      reactions based on desire and craving. Willpower helps us to let go of these and direct
      our energy into different channels. Urgency (//samvega//) is an essential part of
      successful practice. When our insights give rise to seeing the whole world on fire from
      craving and ourselves burning with it, then urgency will become a natural part of our
      make-up and willpower a concomitant to it. Willpower arises in direct proportion to
      urgency, which is connected to our insight into the world around us; the world which does
      not stop at our front door, because it lives in our own heart and mind.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The next pathway to power is
      &quot;concentration of consciousness,&quot; (//citta-samadhi//) or one-pointedness of
      concentration. When intention and energy come together in a powerful way coupled with
      willpower, meditative concentration can result. The first two pathways are causes for the
      third one to arise, leading to meditative absorptions. Deep tranquillity in one's
      meditation is the underlying factor needed for profound insights, which can change an
      ordinary worldling to a noble one, which is the goal of our practice.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Most people today are not really aware of
      that, but are interested in meditation to gain release from stress. That too is all right.
      Why not? The Buddha's purpose and teaching were relief and release from //dukkha// once
      and for all, so that it can never arise again. If we translate //dukkha// as stress, which
      we can well do, then we might say, &quot;yes it is relief from stress. But the kind of
      release the Buddha had in mind is based on the depth of insight, where we realize and
      experience that is isn't really //dukkha// that disappears, but the &quot;me&quot; who is
      experiencing it vanishes.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One-pointed intention and one-pointed effort
      lead to one-pointed consciousness. The mind finds itself in a state of awareness where
      there are no obstructions or obstacles resulting from thinking. Insight does not arise
      from thoughts, but is an inner, intuitive knowing quite different from discursive and
      logical thinking, rather an outcome of a clear and calm mind. This leads the awareness
      into the depths of truth, which has always been there, but which did not rise to the
      surface before, so that the mind could not grasp it previously.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">What the Buddha experienced under the Bodhi
      Tree, when he was able to formulate the four noble truths and the noble eightfold path,
      was not a result of discursive thinking nor of logical or learned understanding. It was a
      deep inner experience which arose from a totally calm mind without obstructions.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is our saving grace that a mind can do
      only one thing at a time. When we are calm and concentrated all our hindrances are
      momentarily laid to rest. This is the boon of meditation. When there are no obstacles in
      the mind, it has the ability to recognize an entirely different depth than it does under
      ordinary circumstances, when we are always in danger of having greed, hate or deluded mind
      states arise. When we arouse the pathways to power we create a different dimension in the
      mind. This is essential, as otherwise we may believe in the Buddha and his teaching, but
      may not be able to prove it ourselves. It is up to all of us to live the Dhamma in heart
      and mind.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The fourth pathway is the &quot;concentration
      of investigation.&quot; Subsequent to the experience of calm and tranquillity with their
      inherent expansion of consciousness, comes investigation for insight. The meditative calm
      becomes a condition for insight through concentrated investigation, when we realize the
      impermanence of even the best meditative states. None of the pathways, however, only apply
      to meditation. While they benefit us greatly in the context of meditation, they are useful
      and practicable in all other moments of our lives.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We certainly need concentrated intention in
      daily living. We cannot one day intend to be kind, the next day selfish, then kind again
      and expect to be peaceful and happy. We also need to know what we are aiming for in
      mundane living. If we want a university education, we have to concentrate on that
      intention. We cannot go to university one day, stay home the next day and expect to pass
      examinations.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Concentration of energy is also a basic
      requirement of daily living. If we conserve our energy to use it where it bears the best
      fruit, our mundane endeavors will flourish and be easily accomplished. If we develop and
      cultivate right intention, energy, willpower and concentration, we can increase our
      potential manifold.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Notwithstanding any results we may see in
      ourselves, we should never expect to be either totally perfect or totally imperfect. We
      need to look upon ourselves as practitioners, those who are learning. In the Buddha's time
      they were called //savaka//, which means &quot;hearer.&quot; If we consider ourselves in
      that way, we need not search for perfection or imperfection, but rather try to draw nearer
      to giving up all ideas of &quot;me&quot; and &quot;mine.&quot;</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Concentrated investigation of phenomena is an
      aspect of our moment to moment mindfulness, which enables us to see //anicca//
      (impermanence), //dukkha// (unsatisfactoriness) or //anatta// (corelessness) wherever we
      look. Everything that exits proclaims these three characteristics, so that we need never
      be without Dhamma consciousness. Usually one of the three aspects becomes more pregnant
      with meaning for us and our mind veers in that direction to investigate the underlying
      truth behind the reality in which we live.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We are never without an object for
      investigation. Our thoughts and feelings are full of these three characteristics. When
      there is a pleasant feeling, can we keep it? Do we feel unhappy when it is gone? Are we
      beginning to see this whole person we are so concerned with, as nothing but flux and flow,
      with no solid core to be found anywhere? When we look at ourselves again and again, we
      will eventually realize that we cannot find an unchanging substance within.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Depth of insight arises through the
      meditative process. However, we need to assist our practice by investigative thoughts and
      directions in daily living. If our mind is concerned with worldly affairs or sensual
      pleasures during the day, it is asking too much of it to become calm and insightful in the
      evening. It is an unrealistic expectation, which no mind can fulfill. We need to prepare
      our mind, so that it is used to thinking in terms of Dhamma consciousness, with
      mindfulness already established as a daily habit. Then we can proceed with meditation
      without first having to shed all mental burdens. We are already facing in the right
      direction and can easily achieve calm and peacefulness, which are our resource for mental
      energy.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When we are young, we may be inclined to
      think that our body is our source of energy. But the body can fall sick at any time, can
      be maimed or even die. Our real energy source lies in the fact that the mind can renew
      itself and become powerful through the arising of deep tranquillity. Then it doesn't
      matter whether the body is old and decrepit or young and healthy, because mind is the
      master and body the servant.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We need the meditative calm as our fuel
      supply. It is more important even than food. Although one does eventually have to have
      food again, one can go without it for quite a long time, much longer than usually thought
      possible, and still have much energy to meditate. We have this natural resource within,
      yet very few people take advantage of it. In order to make use of it, the mind needs
      protection during daily living, so that it is already in the right frame of consciousness
      when meditation begins. Insight into the futility of ambitions and desires helps to lessen
      discursive and distracting thinking.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The four pathways to power are mundane when
      we are practicing and become supermundane when we have perfected them. They bring total
      liberation from //dukkha// if culmination of intention, energy willpower, calm and insight
      is achieved, which they demand of us.</font></td>
