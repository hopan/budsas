      <TD WIDTH="100%"><FONT SIZE="6">W</FONT>hen I first went to study with my 
      teacher, Ajaan Fuang, he handed me a small booklet of meditation 
      instructions and sent me up the hill behind the monastery to meditate. The 
      booklet -- written by his teacher, Ajaan Lee -- began with a breath 
      meditation technique and concluded with a section showing how the 
      technique was used to induce the first four levels of jhana.<P>In the 
      following years, I saw Ajaan Fuang hand the same booklet to each of his 
      new students, lay and ordained. Yet despite the booklet&#39;s detailed 
      descriptions of jhana, he himself rarely mentioned the word jhana in his 
      conversations, and never indicated to any of his students that they had 
      reached a particular level of jhana in their practice. When a student told 
      him of a recurring meditative experience, he liked to discuss not what it 
      was, but what to do with it: what to focus on, what to drop, what to 
      change, what to maintain the same. Then he&#39;d teach the student how to 
      experiment with it -- to make it even more stable and restful -- and how 
      to judge the results of their experiments. If his students wanted to 
      measure their progress against the descriptions of jhana in the booklet, 
      that was their business and none of his. He never said this in so many 
      words, but given the way he taught, the implicit message was clear.</P>
      <P>As were the implicit reasons for his attitude. He had told me once 
      about his own experiences as a young meditator: &quot;Back in those days you 
      didn&#39;t have books explaining everything the way we do now. When I first 
      studied with Ajaan Lee, he told me to bring my mind down. So I focused on 
      getting it down, down, down, but the more I brought it down, the heavily 
      and duller it got. I thought, &#39;This can&#39;t be right.&#39; So I turned around 
      and focused on bringing it up, up, up, until I found a balance and could 
      figure out what he was talking about.&quot; This incident was one of many that 
      taught him some important lessons: that you have to test things for 
      yourself, to see where the instructions had to be taken literally and 
      where they had to be taken figuratively; that you had to judge for 
      yourself how well you were doing; and that you had to be ingenious, 
      experimenting and taking risks to find to ways to deal with problems as 
      they arose.</P>
      <P>So as a teacher, he tried to instill in his students these qualities of 
      self-reliance, ingenuity, and a willingness to take risks and test things 
      for themselves. He did that not only by talking about these qualities, but 
      also by forcing you into situations where you&#39;d have to develop them. Had 
      he always been there to confirm for you that, &quot;Yes, you&#39;ve reached the 
      third jhana,&quot; or, &quot;No, that&#39;s only the second jhana,&quot; he would have 
      short-circuited the qualities he was trying to instill. He, rather than 
      your own powers of observation, would have been the authority on what was 
      going on in your mind; and you would have been absolved of any 
      responsibility for correctly evaluating what you had experienced. At the 
      same time, he would have been feeding your childish desire to please or 
      impress him, and undermining your ability to deal with the task at hand, 
      which was how to develop your own powers of sensitivity to put an end to 
      suffering and stress. As he once told me, &quot;If I have to explain 
      everything, you&#39;ll get used to having things handed to you on a platter. 
      And then what will you do when problems come up in your meditation and you 
      don&#39;t have any experience in figuring things out on your own?&quot; </P>
      <P>So, studying with him, I had to learn to take risks in the midst of 
      uncertainties. If something interesting came up in the practice, I&#39;d have 
      to stick with it, observing it over time, before reaching any conclusions 
      about it. Even then, I learned, the labels I applied to my experiences 
      couldn&#39;t be chiseled in rock. They had to be more like post-it notes: 
      convenient markers for my own reference that I might have to peel off and 
      stick elsewhere as I became more familiar with the territory of my mind. 
      This proved to be a valuable lesson that applied to all areas of my 
      practice.</P>
      <P>Still, Ajaan Fuang didn&#39;t leave me to reinvent the dharma wheel totally 
      on my own. Experience had shown him that some approaches to concentration 
      worked better than others for putting the mind in a position where it 
      could exercise its ingenuity and accurately judge the results of its 
      experiments, and he was very explicit in recommending those approaches. 
      Among the points he emphasized were these:</P>
      <I>
      <P>Strong concentration is absolutely necessary for liberating insight.
      </I>&quot;Without a firm basis in concentration,&quot; he often said, &quot;insight is 
      just concepts.&quot; To see clearly the connections between stress and its 
      causes, the mind has to be very steady and still. And to stay still, it 
      requires the strong sense of well being that only strong concentration can 
      provide. </P>
      <I>
      <P>To gain insight into a state of concentration, you have to stick with 
      it for a long time.</I> If you push impatiently from one level of 
      concentration to the next, or if you try to analyze a new state of 
      concentration too quickly after you&#39;ve attained it, you never give it the 
      chance to show its full potential and you don&#39;t give yourself the chance 
      to familiarize yourself with it. So you have to keep working at it as a 
      skill, something you can tap into in all situations. This enables you to 
      see it from a variety of perspectives and to test it over time, to see if 
      it really is as totally blissful, empty, and effortless as it may have 
      seemed on first sight. </P>
      <I>
      <P>The best state of concentration for the sake of developing all-around 
      insight is one that encompasses a whole-body awareness.</I> There were two 
      exceptions to Ajaan Fuang&#39;s usual practice of not identifying the state 
      you had attained in your practice, and both involved states of wrong 
      concentration. The first was the state that comes when the breath gets so 
      comfortable that your focus drifts from the breath to the sense of comfort 
      itself, your mindfulness begins to blur, and your sense of the body and 
      your surroundings gets lost in a pleasant haze. When you emerge, you find 
      it hard to identify where exactly you were focused. Ajaan Fuang called 
      this <I>moha-samadhi,</I> or delusion-concentration. </P>
      <P>The second state was one I happened to hit one night when my 
      concentration was extremely one-pointed, and so refined that it refused 
      settle on or label even the most fleeting mental objects. I dropped into a 
      state in which I lost all sense of the body, of any internal/external 
      sounds, or of any thoughts or perceptions at all -- although there was 
      just enough tiny awareness to let me know, when I emerged, that I hadn&#39;t 
      been asleep. I found that I could stay there for many hours, and yet time 
      would pass very quickly. Two hours would seem like two minutes. I could 
      also &quot;program&quot; myself to come out at a particular time. </P>
      <P>After hitting this state several nights in a row, I told Ajaan Fuang 
      about it, and his first question was, &quot;Do you like it?&quot; My answer was 
      &quot;No,&quot; because I felt a little groggy the first time I came out. &quot;Good,&quot; he 
      said. &quot;As long as you don&#39;t like it, you&#39;re safe. Some people really like 
      it and think it&#39;s nibbana or cessation. Actually, it&#39;s the state of 
      non-perception <I>(asaññi-bhava).</I> It&#39;s not even right concentration, 
      because there&#39;s no way you can investigate anything in there to gain any 
      sort of discernment. But it does have other uses.&quot; He then told me of the 
      time he had undergone kidney surgery and, not trusting the 
      anesthesiologist, had put himself in that state for the duration of the 
      operation. </P>
      <P>In both these states of wrong concentration, the limited range of 
      awareness was what made them wrong. If whole areas of your awareness are 
      blocked off, how can you gain all-around insight? And as I&#39;ve noticed in 
      years since, people adept at blotting out large areas of awareness through 
      powerful one-pointedness also tend to be psychologically adept at 
      dissociation and denial. This is why Ajaan Fuang, following Ajaan Lee, 
      taught a form of breath meditation that aimed at an all-around awareness 
      of the breath energy throughout the body, playing with it to gain a sense 
      of ease, and then calming it so that it wouldn&#39;t interfere with a clear 
      vision of the subtle movements of the mind. This all-around awareness 
      helped to eliminate the blind spots where ignorance likes to lurk.</P>
      <I>
      <P>An ideal state of concentration for giving rise to insight is one that 
      you can analyze in terms of stress and the absence of stress even while 
      you&#39;re in it.</I> Once your mind was firmly established in a state of 
      concentration, Ajaan Fuang would recommend &quot;lifting&quot; it from its object, 
      but not so far that the concentration was destroyed. From that 
      perspective, you could evaluate what levels of stress were still present 
      in the concentration and let them go. In the initial stages, this usually 
      involved evaluating how you were relating to the breath, and detecting 
      more subtle levels of breath energy in the body that would provide a basis 
      for deeper levels of stillness. Once the breath was perfectly still, and 
      the sense of the body started dissolving into a formless mist, this 
      process would involve detecting the perceptions of &quot;space,&quot; &quot;knowing,&quot; 
      &quot;oneness,&quot; etc., that would appear in place of the body and could be 
      peeled away like the layers of an onion in the mind. In either case, the 
      basic pattern was the same: detecting the level of perception or mental 
      fabrication that was causing the unnecessary stress, and dropping it for a 
      more subtle level of perception or fabrication until there was nothing 
      left to drop. </P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">*</P>
      <FONT SIZE="6">
      <P>T</FONT>his was why, as long as your awareness was still and alert 
      all-around, it didn&#39;t matter whether you were in the first or the 
      fourteenth jhana, for the way you treated your state of concentration was 
      always the same. By directing your attention to issues of stress and its 
      absence, he was pointing you to terms by which to evaluate your state of 
      mind for yourself, without having to ask any outside authority. And, as it 
      turns out, the terms you can evaluate for yourself -- stress, its cause, 
      its cessation, and the path to its cessation -- are the issues that define 
      the four noble truths: the right view that the Buddha says can lead to 
      total liberation. </P>
