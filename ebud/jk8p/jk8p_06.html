<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next three steps of the Eightfold Path have to do more
  with inner work of meditation than outer work of Right Livelihood and Right Speech, and so
  forth. The next step is called Right Effort. It's very important in understanding
  spiritual practice.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ramana Maharshi, the great Indian master, one of the
  greatest ever, and certainly in the last century or so, said:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Enlightenment is not your birthright.<br>
    Those who succeed do so only through proper effort.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It was an amazing thing for him to say because he became
  fully enlightened at seventeen years old when he went to his uncle's house and said,
  &quot;I wonder what it would be like to die. I think I'll try it.&quot; And he laid down
  on the floor and died, and then came back somehow. It's hard to know whether he physically
  died, but it seemed like he died, and he came back with a very different perspective on
  life. Nevertheless, he taught for many, many years, and even he said this.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day Nasrudin went to the market with a recipe for some
  kind of liver and kidney pie, or something like that, and he bought the meat. He had the
  recipe in one hand and he took the stuff for his pie in the other hand. And a huge raven
  or crow saw him walking home and swooped down from a tree nearby and grabbed the meat out
  of his hand and flew off with it. And Nasrudin shook his head and said, &quot;It won't do
  you any good. You don't have the recipe.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It gets kind of reversed for us. Most of us, especially
  living in California, as we do, are overburdened with spiritual recipes. How many Dharma
  talks, how many spiritual books, how many retreats, how many good therapy things, how many
  <i>sesshins</i>, and how many whatever have you had? You have the recipe. Like all the
  people sitting under the bodhi tree with the Dalai Lama, and the pilgrims who had come
  from miles and miles on foot from the high Himalayas to be with the Dalai Lama in
  Bodhgaya, he said, &quot;Okay, you're here, and you think you're very fortunate because
  you have the blessings of being under this bodhi tree where the Buddha was enlightened,
  with all these famous lamas, and the Dalai Lama himself, and you have the teachings, the
  sacred meditations, and mantras, and all these things. It won't do you any good. The only
  thing that makes it work is if you take the trouble to practice it. All the rest of it is
  very nice, and you might as well watch Dallas or something like that. It's not so
  different. Maybe you would learn more from Dallas, I don't know. At least it wouldn't be
  pretentiously spiritual.&quot; So the answer is &quot;effort.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Effort is central in our spiritual practice.
  Traditionally, there are four kinds of effort that are talked about. The effort to deal
  with unskillful things has two parts. First, the effort to abandon that which is
  unskillful, and that means abandoning our grasping, our fear, our hatred, or our anger. It
  doesn't mean judging oneself or resisting it. It means learning skillful means not to be
  so caught up in things, not to be so attached. Then, the effort to maintain their absence,
  once you're figured out how to let go of them some. It's like Mark Twain and smoking. You
  all heard that. When someone asked if he had ever stopped smoking, he said, &quot;Sure, it
  was easy. I've done it thousands of times.&quot; The second effort is the effort to
  maintain that abandonment in some fashion.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The other two traditional definitions of Right Effort have
  to do with that which is skillful; the effort to develop or cultivate or nourish that
  which is skillful within ourselves, and then the effort to maintain or sustain it, so that
  in some fashion it stays with us.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is from the <i>Dhammapada</i>:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One person on the battlefield conquers an army<br>
    of a thousand persons,<br>
    Another conquers himself,<br>
    and that is greater.<br>
    Conquer yourself and not others,<br>
    discipline yourself,<br>
    and thereupon learn freedom.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So it's the effort of learning how to cultivate or
  generate that which is skillful -- which means awareness, loving-kindness, or caring for
  the world around you, or living more in the present, the effort to abandon the habits, the
  fears of things that we get caught in that create suffering and that keeps us in the muck,
  and the effort to sustain them. This is wonderful because it's a teaching that can apply
  very much to our daily life; it's not just a retreat teaching. It's small habits and all
  the little pieces. Our life is made up of little activities, little pieces, little habits,
  and little ways. And we can begin to work with the way we drive our car, the way that we
  relate to people at work, or the way we eat, what we choose to eat, and how we set about
  eating -- to make those things more conscious. To make our approach to these bear the
  fruit of greater awareness, greater attention, of more caring, of more kindness.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Think now for just a moment: what are a few things in your
  own life that could well be served by bringing a little more of this effort, this effort
  to pay attention, or the effort to let go and abandon? What little things do you do that
  you could use in some way to wake up more, to awaken?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Fundamentally, the meaning for Right Effort can be
  expressed in a simple way: it's the effort to be aware, the effort to see clearly, to pay
  attention. That's Right Effort. One Zen master was asked, &quot;Would you give me the
  essence of the teachings?&quot; He wrote down, &quot;attention&quot;. Then the person
  said, &quot;Fine. Now would you give me the whole teachings, the commentary, and how I
  should undertake it?&quot; He wrote down, &quot;Attention, attention.&quot; The person
  said, &quot;Isn't there anything else?&quot; And he said, 'Attention, attention,
  attention. That is it, to be present, to see clearly.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Right Effort isn't so much the effort to make the world a
  different place, as it is the effort to understand the nature of this world, of our body,
  our mind, this life.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Why is it hard to make the Right Effort, why is it hard to
  pay attention? It's hard for different reasons. It's hard because we sometimes don't want
  to see. You know, this idea of &quot;Be Here Now,&quot; and so forth, it sounds good,.It's
  not so good. It isn't, because what happens when you're here now? Has anybody looked? What
  do you have to be here now with? Pain, boredom, fear, loneliness, pleasure, joy, beautiful
  sunsets, wonderful tastes, horrible experiences, people being born, people dying, light,
  dark, up, down, parking your car on the wrong side of the street, getting your car towed;
  all those things. For if you live here, it means that you have to be open to what Zorba
  called &quot;The whole catastrophe.&quot; Sometimes we don't want that.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Right effort is the effort to see clearly. This world is
  crazed. There's war, there's prejudice, there's political prisoners, there's all this kind
  of suffering that we need to remember living in Marin, because it's really kind of a
  ghetto that we live in, and we forget how incredibly fortunate we are.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I had a letter today from someone I know . She's kind of
  middle-aged and very poor, and just gets by doing some sewing, and her husband works in a
  gas station. They live in Florida. They are related to some people I know. They've had a
  very hard life. She has some kind of progressive degenerative disease. They do not live in
  such a nice neighborhood, and their house was broken into, and the few things of any value
  that they had were just stolen. I thought, &quot;God, here I live in such a nice place,
  and have nice things, and I leave the front door open most of the time, and don't worry
  about it,&quot; and we forget what blessings we have. We forget about the sorrow and the
  struggle in the world. Part of the effort is to really wake up and to look at ourselves
  and at the world around us, and to be conscious of it, not to be just asleep.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">My teacher Achaan Chah said there are two basic ways of
  practice. One way of practice is to be comfortable. And it's valuable. You can sit a
  little and get yourself quiet. You keep the precepts, so you don't harm people, and they
  start to like you. You say &quot;Om&quot; at dinner. You chant a little before you eat.
  And everything becomes nicer in your life. It becomes more comfortable and more pleasant
  because you live a good life and you're peaceful. The other way to approach spiritual
  practice is not to be involved in trying to be comfortable, but rather to be free or
  liberated. And that way of practice has nothing whatsoever to do with comfort. Comfort may
  come and it may not. Sometimes it may be terribly uncomfortable, but its goal or its
  direction is not comfort; its goal is freedom. It's a wonderful thing, and it's a real
  legacy of the Buddha.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Right Effort means we really need to start to pay
  attention, and to see how fortunate we are, and to begin to see the laws that govern the
  world within which we live.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another friend of mine just called me this week and said
  her husband who is in his mid-forties has advanced lung cancer; he just found out about it
  a few days earlier. Then she called about four days after that. She asked me what was the
  lesson in that. She said, &quot;You're a teacher. Tell me what the lesson is.&quot; I
  don't know what the lesson is. I said, &quot;I don't know. Call me later, maybe I can
  think of one.&quot; And she called back. If you trust people they generally find out what
  the lesson is anyway. She said, &quot;I know what the lesson is.&quot; I said,
  &quot;What?&quot; And she said, &quot;The lesson is to love people while you have them,
  when they're here.&quot; It was so sweet and so touching because it came from a place
  where she really, really knew it. It's to take care with what we have that's beautiful,
  and nourish it; and that which isn't, to abandon it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I'll read you a passage from Nisargadatta Maharaj, the old
  bidi wallah who I studied with in Bombay; wonderful old teacher. He sold little Indian
  cigarettes on the street corner, and he was fully enlightened somehow at the same time. He
  had these classes. He died a couple of years ago. He was a wonderful old man.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Someone asks:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What can truth or reality gain by all our practice?</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">He uses truth and love interchangeably. He says:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nothing whatsoever, of course. But it is in the nature of
    truth or love, cosmic consciousness, whatever you want to call it, to express itself, to
    affirm itself, to overcome difficulties. Once you've understood that the world is love in
    action, consciousness or love in action, you will look at it quite differently. But first
    your attitude to suffering must change. Suffering is primarily a call for attention, which
    itself is a movement of love. More than happiness, love wants growth, the widening and
    deepening of awareness and consciousness and being. Whatever prevents that becomes a cause
    of pain, and love does not shirk from pain.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That's an amazing thing to say, that love doesn't shirk
  from pain, that what loves wants is not pleasure. You live in Marin, you know about
  pleasure. It's wonderful, but it gets boring after awhile. It does! There is something
  deeper or higher, that's richer, that is our capacity, or our birthright, or our deepest
  need. I don't know what it is, but it is different than just pleasure.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What does it mean to make Right Effort? We've touched
  this, or we want that, or we want to discover or open. There are two different approaches
  or styles to effort. I've practiced with them both, and I'll put them out, and you can
  listen and see which works better for you.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One is the Rinzai approach, using Zen terminology, where
  there is enlightenment, and it's a goal, and you work very hard - you literally bust your
  ass on your cushion or whatever you do to get to <i>satori</i> or <i>kensho </i>or
  enlightenment, and you really make an effort directed to this goal.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the ways of practice in the Theravada tradition
  that I'd done in the Sun Lun Monastery was to sit without moving a minimum of four
  sittings a day of two hours. The first hour was heavy breathing, where you sat and did as
  full and deep breathing as you were capable of for an hour. And the <i>sayadaw</i> was
  sort of like a football coach, and he would come around and say, &quot;Harder, more.&quot;
  And you concentrate on it. You get very concentrated in an hour. If you were sleepy it
  woke you up; if you had thoughts it kind of blasted them out of your head; and by the end
  of an hour you were very present. Then the next hour you continued to sit without moving,
  and used that concentration just to be with what your experience was. It was very
  powerful.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Or the kind of effort in the Mahasi Monastery where I
  practiced where you sit and walk l5 or l6 hours a day, or l8 if you can. You sleep for
  four hours and you eat a little bit. You sit motionless, you don't move, and the sittings
  are shorter, 45 minutes or an hour, and you don't make a a movement without paying
  attention to it. Lift your hand, blink your eyes, &quot;blinking, turning, moving.&quot;
  You pay attention to every single little thing. Why do that? It sounds so hard. It is, it
  is very, very hard. And if you start to do it, all the defilements, all the desires, all
  the fears, all the reasons that you keep yourself spaced out and in fantasy, and don't
  want to pay attention, they all come at once. Like this wall. And you just sit, and you
  just walk, and you do it. The purpose is to dissolve the sense of solidity of the world.
  If you pay attention that carefully, and that fully, or that deeply with concentration --
  that's next week's talk on Right Concentration -- you begin to see that what's solid is
  not solid, and that what seems as &quot;I&quot; or &quot;body and mind together&quot;
  starts to dissolve into all these little parts. There are the four physical elements, the
  different mood states, and consciousness, hearing, seeing, smelling, and tasting. And
  that's all there is! And it takes the whole show apart, but it takes a powerful
  concentration and a sustained attention to do it. It really is going through fire. There's
  even a physical transformation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There's a book I read recently by Ireena Tweedy called
  &quot;Chasm of Fire&quot;. She's this old Sufi lady who worked with this master in India.
  She talked about her experiences, more in the Kensho metaphor, but it's not so different.
  It's really sitting through the fire and letting your body, your desires, and your fears,
  just burn through you, and you just sit. After awhile your attachments to things change
  and you become much more detached from this that we take to be ourselves, this physical
  body. And you become more detached from the fears and feelings, and all of those things.
  You start with that detachment; then you see it as it operates, clearly, because you're
  not so incredibly identified with &quot;I, me, mine, my body, my mind.&quot; It's very
  powerful!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Suzaki-roshi teaches Zen <i>sesshin</i> in a very strict
  fashion. Or Chan Hsun Hua who runs Gold Mountain Temple. He used to have 49-day chant <i>sesshins</i>
  in San Francisco. You sit for 49 days, and you sleep sitting up, you sleep in your place.
  I never wanted to do it. I've thought about it. For some people it's terrible because
  they're already tight and they do it and it just drives them crazy, it makes them tighter;
  and it doesn't bring any enlightenment at all; it just brings pain. But for some people
  it's a way of practice, the effort to concentrate, the effort to pay attention, to bring
  yourself back -- again, and again, and again. It's not the effort of tensing your body,
  but it's the willingness to sit with anything, and keep bringing your mind back, or to
  walk with anything, to really do that.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Gurdjieff says:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If a person gives way to all their desires, or panders to
    them, there will be no inner struggle in them, no friction, no fire. But if for the sake
    of attaining liberation, they struggle with their habits that hinder them, they'll create
    a fire which will gradually transform their inner world into a single whole.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That's one way of undertaking practice. And when you look
  at how powerful our habits are, and how much we go to sleep, and how much the world really
  needs somebody to have the courage to say &quot;no&quot; or &quot;stop&quot; or &quot;wake
  up&quot; or &quot;live differently,&quot; it becomes very compelling. I know that you're
  not on retreat, that we live in busy household lives -- but the same spirit, this kind
  which is just half of the effort I'll talk about, can be brought to your daily life. It
  can be the effort to do whatever it happens to be in your life that you know is really
  going to make a difference. So one can bring that effort, and it's a wonderful thing to
  do. And if you learn to do it -- it takes practice - it's really empowering; it brings a
  certain inner strength with it as well.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The other approach to Right Effort is actually a bridge
  between these two that would be nice to read about. Someone recently gave me this book
  called &quot;&quot;Peace Pilgrim.&quot; It's about this woman who walked around the
  country for 20 years wearing her blue jogging suit that said &quot;Peace Pilgrim&quot; on
  it, carrying a toothbrush. She spoke about peace, that you had to make yourself peaceful
  and the world peaceful. She never took food unless it was offered to her. She fasted
  otherwise. And she never took rides until much later in her life. She just walked and
  talked about peace. And this is her story, and it's a fantastic book.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">She said:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">During my earlier spiritual growth period -- The ten years
    that she was getting prepared to do her peace walk -- I desired to know and do God's will
    for me. Spiritual growth is not easily attained, you know, but it is well worth the
    effort. It takes time, just as any growth takes time. One should rejoice at small gains,
    and not be impatient, as impatience hampers growth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The path of gradual relinquishment of things hindering
    spiritual progress is a difficult path, but only when relinquishment is complete do the
    rewards really come fully. The path of quick relinquishment is an easy path, for it brings
    immediate blessings, and when God fills your life or the truth fills your life, the gifts
    overflow and bless all that you touch.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What she said is very beautiful. It takes time, just as
  any growth takes time, and it's not easily attained but well worth the effort. If you do a
  lot of it, you get a lot of reward; if you do it slowly, which most of us do, then it's a
  little more frustrating because a lot of the reward comes when you're much, much freer.
  It's the way it goes. What can you do? It's still worth it. It talks about both these
  kinds of effort, that if you're willing to make the effort to really do a lot, or let go
  of a lot, or transform your life, then tremendous fruits can come. You can change how you
  live this week, how you relate, or you can take it slower.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The other kind of effort is not goal-oriented, to get to <i>kensho</i>,
  or <i>satori</i>, or enlightenment, or dissolve the world, transcend yourself; it's the
  Soto Zen approach. It's the approach that says that you're already enlightened. And that
  is enlightenment; it's not something else. It's just what's here. And the only thing that
  blocks our enlightenment is all these thoughts that say, &quot;This isn't enough; I want
  it different.&quot; If you could just live with things as they are; that's all; this is
  it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Krishnamurti speaks about it very beautifully when he
  said:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's the truth which liberates and not your effort to be
    free.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;All year I'm going to get this, and be that, and now
  I'll be --&quot; I remember when the first interesting meditation practice experiences
  started to come, I got very excited, and my mind started to fill with thoughts again.
  There were these lights and things, and I thought, &quot;Gee, this is really
  exciting,&quot; because I started to think about what I'd do when I was enlightened, who I
  would go visit and what I would say. It's like that ego, that part of us that wants to
  take it as a kind of a merit badge or something that you can wear; or a degree. And it's
  not that at all. It's to live with things as they are, to see them clearly, directly, and
  truly in each moment.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ramana Maharshi said:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are two paths to awakening. One is that of
    self-inquiry, where you look to see.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The main koan is, &quot;Who am I?&quot; or &quot; What am
  I?&quot; And you do it through awareness; or through whatever training that you can, to
  discover and investigate the body and mind. And the other is the path of surrender, where
  you say, &quot;Not my will but thine.&quot; It's actually the same if you really look at
  it. &quot;Okay, in this moment I'll be aware of what's here without trying to change it
  and just see what it is.&quot; In that awareness you start to see the truth of it -- that
  it's impermanent -- that it's not &quot;I, me, mine&quot;; that it's not self; that we're
  not separate; then it begins to reveal its nature.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This way of effort then is the effort more of surrender,
  of letting go, rather than trying to attain something. It's surrender to be in each moment
  in a balanced way.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Don Juan says:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If one is to succeed in anything, the success must come
    gently. With a great deal of effort. But with no stress or obsession.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So it's rather the effort to be here again and again and
  again, and to truly see that things arise and that they pass away; that they're born; that
  they die; that we don't own anything; that none of it is ours. Our thoughts, do you
  control your thoughts? Does anybody here have control of their thoughts? We think that
  they're ours. Or our bodies. We do a little better at that, but not very well, if you look
  at it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There's something I want to read. I've been reading all
  these books on early child development and labor and whatever. It's from a book that I've
  come to appreciate very much called &quot;Whole Child, Whole Parent.&quot; If anyone is
  looking for a spiritual guide to parenting, it's the best that I've found. It's called
  &quot;Zen and the Art of Throwing a Ball.&quot; It gives a much more Taoist sense, instead
  of making the effort to come back again and again and dissolve the world. This is the way
  of effort which finds the Tao within our movement, the way that we live.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The self -- the self-centered sense of us -- knows that
  freedom has something to do with law and order but thinks that order must be brought about
  by will power. The child shows us that, on the contrary, freedom comes through
  subservience to existing order, to the Dharma, through conscious alignment with it. The
  self knows that freedom has something to do with pleasure, but it thinks it means feeling
  good and being above the law is what pleasure is.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The child shows us that this pleasure is really
  spontaneity and that it too is a by-product of absolute compliance or obedience to the law
  or the dharma.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here's a story:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once I heard a father marvel, &quot;How did he learn to
    throw that ball so far? I didn't teach him. When did he learn to do this? I didn't even
    see him do it? Why did he do it? No one in our family is particularly interested in
    baseball, and yet he did.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Everything that father thought might have been a
    hindrance. had it actually been present. The family's interest in baseball or someone
    watching him, or anything.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Somewhere along the way, in the throwing of a ball, the
    child had conceived of a possibility of freedom. Perhaps it first came through watching
    someone else, perhaps once in flinging a ball, he had let it fly and surprised himself. At
    any rate, some freedom had been encountered and was now a possibility in his
    consciousness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After that, as long as he remained unself-conscious --
    which means undivided -- he was able to give his undivided attention to the possibility of
    which he had conceived. Through his pure desire for freedom in the sense of possibility,
    certain laws were given the opportunity to gain power over the child. Aiming himself
    toward a conscious possibility he became subservient to it. And then through the child's
    receptive and devoted consciousness the underlying force of being, itself, organized and
    energized and utilized and coordinated everything in the child to express himself in the
    form of freedom to throw the ball so beautifully.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He must have practiced for hours on end, expending
    tremendous effort but little strain because his interest in seeing what was possible
    carried him along, confident that what he could conceive of was possible and could be
    realized if he went at it. Sometimes the ball fell short but he did not infer that he
    lacked power. Sometimes the ball went wild, but he did not infer that the thing was
    impossible or that there was no predictability and all was chaotic.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Whatever seemed too hard only showed him that he had not
    yet discovered the knack. Whatever appeared chaotic only suggested that the order and his
    oneness with it had not yet been discerned. Sometimes his shoulder hurt, but the very hurt
    became a guide, directing him into better alignment with the hidden force he did not
    doubt. He looked at everything for what is and what isn't, and everything taught him,
    until he could throw the ball far, fast, accurately and with remarkable ease.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And he wasn't proud. He wasn't too pleased, and he didn't
    feel triumphant. He felt grateful. And he didn't feel powerful, he felt surer. And he felt
    free and was freer.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It was never that he had his way with the ball, rather
    through his undistracted, absolutely focused, unselfconscious attention, the invisible
    laws of physics had their way with him. through the total submission of himself to the
    invisible laws, he found both dominion and spontaneity which he rightfully experienced as
    true freedom and joy.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What a wonderful way to learn. It speaks to this other
  meaning of effort, and it also speaks to a kind of secret about the first kind of effort,
  which I've used a lot in practice, and gained from in some ways. And that is, in the end
  you have to let go. No matter how much effort you make and where it takes you, it doesn't
  take you all the way, because it's not your effort that makes you free but your discovery
  of what's true about yourself, and life, and its changing nature and the laws of it; that
  you come into harmony with it, that you become free. It can be big things. It can be a big
  <i>satori</i> and a big awakening. Sometimes you get hit over the head by someone near you
  getting cancer or a near car accident, or it can be little things, like a child, where you
  just begin to take your life as a discovery, and you start to see what are the laws that
  operate that make people happy, make them unhappy, what are the laws that operate that
  make war and make harmony or peace between people.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I got a letter recently from someone who had been in one
  of these classes asking about the question of enlightenment. We talk so much about
  precepts and following them, and Right Speech and Right Action, what about enlightenment,
  where does it fit, or is this just a system of ethical conduct? Is this Buddhism? The
  Buddha said it quite explicitly a number of times in one very beautiful <i>sutra</i>. He
  said:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The reason for my teaching is not for merit or good deeds
    or good karma, or concentration, or rapture, or bliss, or even insight. None of these is
    the reason that I teach, but the sure heart's release. This and this alone is the reason
    for the teaching of a Buddha.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">All the other things are secondary to it, secondary to
  what that child experienced with the ball or what the old bidi wallah talked about of the
  movement of love. It's not compelled by pleasure, not by precepts, not by success or
  failure, but by learning to grow, learning to open, learning the laws of the world,
  learning to connect. There is enlightenment, there is freedom, it's true, it's absolutely
  true; and you can experience it; you can come to that.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It says in the <i>Dhammapada</i> that:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To live one day and taste very deeply the meaning of
    impermanence is better than living l00 years and not to touch it.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Why could that be so? Because to taste that, even for a
  moment, is that you see what's true about life and you start to live out of that truth
  more fully. You become free, which is what we all want most deeply. . I ask you a few
  questions. Think about Right Effort for a moment. Where are you making too much effort in
  your life? What things do you do where it's too tight and too hard? You need to learn
  balance. Can you think of them? Where do you try too hard or grasp too much? Where do you
  make too little effort in your life? Where are you lazy or habitual? What aspects of your
  life could be ennobled or awakened with more effort? Think about them. Which ones? Where
  is your life too internal? Where do you shy away out of fear from the world of events and
  circumstances around you? Where is your life too external, or you don't sit enough, you
  don't take enough silence? You don't listen inside to your heart, to what you care about,
  make it inform your life.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To listen in this way inside is to discover the laws like
  throwing the ball of Right Effort in your life. Where do you miss the mark? Practice a
  little more. What takes more effort, what takes a little less? What takes more solitude?
  What takes more giving, and loving, and serving?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You actually know the answers to those things. They come
  pretty easily to us. We just forget to ask, or we don't want to ask because it means,
  &quot;Ugh, I have to rearrange my life yet again in some fashion or other.&quot; But it
  doesn't really matter, because that's the game. Everything gets rearranged anyway. Either
  you can rearrange it or you can wait for it to be rearranged. It's also the game; to grow.
  So you can stall it for awhile. If you really drag your feet, you can; but it's not as
  interesting.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I'll close with my question to my teacher Achaan Chaa.</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I still have very many thoughts, my mind wanders a lot,
    even though I'm trying to be mindful.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">He said:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Don't worry about this, try to keep your mind in the
    present. Whatever there is that arises in the mind or the heart, just watch it, let go of
    it. Don't even wish to be rid of thought, then the mind will reach a natural state, no
    discriminating between good and bad, hot and cold, fast and slow, no &quot;me&quot; and no
    &quot;you&quot;, no self at all, just what there is.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you walk, no need to do anything special, simply walk
    and see what there is. No need to go to a cave or cling to isolation. Wherever you are,
    know yourself by being natural and watching. If doubts arise, watch them come and go. It's
    very simple. Hold on to nothing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's as though you're walking down a road, periodically
    you run into obstacles. When you meet difficulties, see them and overcome them by letting
    go. Don't think about the obstacles you've passed already, don't worry about the ones you
    haven't seen yet. Stay in the present. Don't worry about the length of the road or a
    destination either.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Everything is changing. Whatever you pass, do not cling to
    it, and eventually the mind will reach its natural balance where practice becomes
    automatic and effort becomes effortless. All things will come and go of themselves.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sitting hours on end is not necessary. Some people think
    that the longer you sit the wiser you must be. I've seen chickens sit on their nests for
    days on end.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Wisdom comes from being mindful in all postures. Your
    practice should begin as you awaken in the morning and continue until you fall asleep.
    What is important is only that you keep aware, whether you're working or sitting or going
    to the bathroom.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Each person has their own natural pace. Some of you will
    die at age fifty, some at age sixty-five, and some at age ninety. Don't think or worry
    about this. Try to be mindful and let things take their natural course. Then your mind
    will become quieter and quieter in any surroundings, like a still forest pool. All kinds
    of wonderful, rare animals will come and drink at the pool. You will see clearly the
    nature of all things in the world. Many wonderful strange things come and go, but you will
    be still. This is the happiness of the Buddha.</font></p>
