The Eightfold Noble Path<br>
-- Right Attitude</font></h2>
</font>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So one has decided that spiritual practice is worthwhile
  for some reason. That doesn't mean that we have to go off in a monastery, but our
  household life, our driving, our interpersonal relations, they are our practice, and they
  require some working with. The next level or the next step in this is Right Attitude or
  Right Thought. One sees the value in inner life and sees that frankly our happiness is
  based on our heart considerably more than it is on external circumstances. When there are
  difficulties around, if the heart is open or clear or understanding, we can be happy. We
  can be in the midst of beautiful circumstances and be miserable, be lonely or depressed,
  and know that our happiness which we seek is really a function of our heart, our interior
  life.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Dhammapada begins with: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mind is the forerunner of all things.&quot; If you act
    based on kindness and wisdom in the mind, happiness will follow you like the wheel of a
    chariot follows the ox which draws it. And if you act based on unkindness or you act from
    an unwise state of mind, then unhappiness follows just as the wheel of the cart follows
    the ox which draws it.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are three aspects to Right Attitude. The first is
  openness or receptivity. In undertaking our practice, try not to make it a certain way:
  &quot;I want it to always be peaceful, I want it to be calm, I want not to be angry&quot;
  or &quot;I want my body not to hurt&quot; or &quot;my knees&quot; or &quot;I don't want to
  be restless&quot; or &quot;I don't want to be afraid&quot; or &quot;I want to come to a
  lot of light or joy.&quot; Good luck! You get that sometimes. But if you just look for
  that, what will happen in your daily practice? A really simple thing happens if you're
  looking for that. What happens? You're disappointed. And then what do you do? You stop
  sitting. If you hold in mind how your personality should be or how your body should behave
  or how your mind should be, does it listen to you very much? Tell the truth! You sit here
  and say, &quot;Thoughts, don't come.&quot; Does it help much? A little bit with some
  training, but just a little. It's like the radio. The advertisements come, and you can't
  say, &quot;I want radio without advertisements.&quot; It doesn't work.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You might have begun some investigation or awareness of
  what your personality is like. Most people when they start to look at their personality,
  after a little while say &quot;yuk&quot; because personalities have that kind of quality
  to them. You say &quot;God, maybe if I practice hard, my thoughts will quiet down and I
  can kind of change my personality.&quot; I have news for you! Your personality is kind of
  like your body; you come in and you get issued one for this ride. And you can get wiser or
  kinder, but you kind of have it, and you'll be a wise character of the same personality
  that you are as an unwise one, but you'll be pretty much the same. Or you'll be a loving
  person, whatever you are now, however you define yourself.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Openness means not getting caught on, &quot;I want it to
  be quiet or peaceful, the body or the mind to be this way,&quot; but more a quality of
  discovery, of experimenting, of seeing what you are. &quot;I'm going to sit and listen to
  my heart and see what I really care about or where I'm afraid or what I hold back on. I'm
  going to look at my mind and see what the patterns are, what the desires are, and see what
  makes me happy and what makes unhappiness, and how that works in the world.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are enormously rich and deep things to discover in
  our practice. It requires this attitude of, &quot;I'm going to look and learn,&quot;
  rather than, &quot;I'm going to make it a certain way.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There's a beautiful poem I'll read from the German poet
  Rilke. He says:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes a man stands up during supper<br>
    and walks outdoors and keeps on walking<br>
    because of a church that stands somewhere<br>
    in the East. And his children say blessings<br>
    on him as if he were dead.<br>
    And another man who remains inside his<br>
    own house, stays there inside the dishes<br>
    and in the glasses, so that his children<br>
    have to go far out into the world<br>
    toward that same church which he forgot.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Such a wonderful poem. There's something in us, in our
  nature, which compels us to discover. I remember a very powerful moment with the old guru
  who I studied with, Nisargadatta Maharaj, who taught the way of Nisarga Yoga.
  &quot;Nisarga&quot; means natural. The basic translation of his name was &quot;Mr.
  Natural&quot;. He was this 80-year old cigarette-smoking man. He had a little cigarette
  stand. He was kind of a combination like Krishnamurti and Fritz Perls. He would put you on
  the hot seat when you came in and ask you about your spiritual life.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day we were in a room about this big. People were
  coming in and asking questions. Somebody came in and asked a question and was a little bit
  dissatisfied and left. And another person raised their hand and said, &quot;Maharaj, what
  will happen to that person who came and asked that question and left? Is it all over for
  them in this life? They didn't stay here. You are a great guru, and they weren't
  interested, and they went home.&quot; And he twinkled at that moment, he really lit up,
  and he said, &quot;It's too late. Even the fact that they put their foot in this room,
  even if they hadn't asked the question, means that somewhere in there there's a seed of
  really knowing who we are and what this life is about. Not what you were taught in
  elementary school or what's on TV or the newspapers, but a deep seed of knowing our true
  nature, that wants to discover; it's like coming home. The fact that he just walked in the
  room means that that seed has started to sprout. And no matter if he tries to forget it
  and goes back and gets lost, sooner or later that will manifest in awakening.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We can't not do it once we start. Trungpa Rinpoche in
  speaking with his students at a big public talk one night said, &quot;Frankly, I recommend
  that you don't start the spiritual path because it's painful and it's difficult; it's
  really hard. So my recommendation to all of you is not to do it. You can leave now.&quot;
  Then he said, &quot;But I have a second recommendation, and that is: If you start, you
  better finish. If you begin, then really do it.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's something in us. I think it's the part that loves
  truth, or maybe it's the part that loves connection with another being. Even if we're
  terrified of intimacy - some of you may know that one - or we're terrified of getting
  close and then losing things, or we're afraid of dying, or it's hard to look at parts of
  ourself, there's something in our heart that really wants union, that wants to connect
  with people, with life, with the world around us in a deep way.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And openness then, the first part of Right Attitude, is
  this process of discovery, of seeing what's here and opening to it, not trying to change
  it but seeing clearly with mindfulness, without judging our fear, loneliness, aggression,
  joy, happiness, love, sorrow; our body, how we use it, how we exercise with it; what we
  eat, when we're full, when we overeat. The beginning is just this quality of discovery,
  because it's fantastic then. That makes spiritual practice alive; it's not some rote
  imitation. Then we can begin to learn, and we learn about the forces of desire, of fear,
  of wanting, of love, that makes the whole world go round, and really runs our lives.
  Whether we're conscious or we're on automatic pilot, they still operate. We start to
  discover who we are and how it works.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This leads to the second part of Right Attitude, which is
  renunciation. There is a saying in India, &quot;When a pickpocket meets a saint, he only
  sees the saint's pockets.&quot; What we want determines what we see.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you walk down the street and you're hungry, what do you
  see? Restaurants. &quot;There's a Greek restaurant. I could have feta cheese or a nice
  salad. Oh, there's a nice natural food restaurant. No, I think I'll have a burger. That's
  a good place for burgers.&quot; You don't see shoe stores. Or if you come to the sitting
  and you look around, there's break time, time for tea, you see what you're interested in.
  If you like to talk to women, you'll see the women. If you're interested in sex, you see
  people who are attractive to you or your competition for those people. If you're
  interested in astrology you kind of check out and see whether there are lots of water
  signs or fire signs that come sit. If you're interested in young people or old people,
  that's what you scope out. If you're a barber, you come in here and see who needs a
  haircut.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What you're interested in determines and limits what you
  see. What renunciation means is putting what we want aside for a little bit. At Achaan
  Chah's, where I studied in the forest monastery for awhile, we did a lot of work with a
  practice of the monks' rules as discipline, and there are hundreds of them. At first they
  seemed like a real pain in the ass. As I learned to work with them, work with the
  discipline of not eating after noon, or sitting in a certain kind of posture when you were
  with senior monks -- there's a whole lot of ritual around it -- it required a lot of
  surrender. And as I did it I said, &quot;I want to do it my way. This is 2,000 years old
  and it's dumb, and it's modern times,&quot; and all kinds of resistance came up. Of
  course, I didn't have much choice. I was a monk and I was supposed to do it. I mean, if I
  had stopped, I suppose I could have left or something. &quot;Alright, I'll do this
  trip.&quot; But I had all the resistance, and all the things of not wanting to follow
  rules or not wanting to go against my habit. We're spoiled in this country. You can drink
  whatever kind of beer you want, eat whatever kind of food, travel where you like, and we
  have a capacity to change our lives in ways that most people in the world don't come close
  to.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So here it was, renunciation. What came from it was a
  discovery that there's a strength of heart that comes when we don't just follow our habit;
  and it brings a sense of well-being or purity or something, because we begin to train
  ourselves. We don't have to follow all of our habits and all of our desires.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Achaan Chah was great because he would psych you out when
  you came there to begin practice, and if you were someone who loved to meditate and loved
  it peaceful and quiet, he would assign you to the monastery in the middle of Bangkok, in
  the traffic. And if you loved to socialize and talk and be with people, he would send you
  off to where everyone was in separate caves, and you had to deal with your loneliness or
  your aloneness. The style of practice which really is relevant to our lives, is to look
  into that which we're afraid of, which we run away from, or which keeps us moving all the
  time.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It requires a little fire. Practice has fire. If it
  doesn't have fire, it's not interesting. Yeah, you sit and you hold hands at dinner and
  you do a little &quot;Om&quot; and it's kind of peaceful, and you eat. It's not very
  interesting. If there's fire, it transforms your body, it transforms your heart, it makes
  you feel your loneliness and your desire, and you look at places where you hold tension in
  your body, and what it means to be unhappy or to be happy, to look at your suffering, to
  look at your expectations -- that's juicy, that's interesting, and that's where liberation
  comes.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second step is renunciation. It means beginning to
  work with areas of our life where we've been unconscious and which we can identify.. I
  mean, I could go around the room and just ask you, and you could all name off the things
  that could use a little work, not that they're bad or anything, but because you can
  empower yourself through it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let's take a moment now and think of an area to work on
  this next week, maybe a very small one. It might be a simple a thing such as biting your
  nails. Think of one thing for yourself that you really want to look at and discover more
  about, that you're caught in -- it's a habit, it's a compulsion, or a fear, or whatever.
  Do you have one? I'm sure you must be able to think of one. Okay, fine. Here I want to
  give an assignment which you're welcome to do. If you're the kind that resists
  assignments, please don't do it. The assignment of working with openness is to just look
  at it for one week. Make the resolve in your mind, whether it's nail biting, or being
  afraid of this, or compulsive about that, whatever it happens to be that you choose, that
  for one week you're going to be a botanist, and you're going to study it, when it comes
  out, is it a night creature or a day creature, what it's mating habits are, and what it
  eats, and how long it's there. So you're really going to study it. First you'll see the
  superficial nature of how often it comes. Count it for a day, whatever it is. It might be
  a mental state or an activity. See how often it comes. Then start to look deeper. See
  what's there when it comes. When you bite your nails, when you pay attention to your heart
  and your mind, you see, &quot;Oh, I start biting them when I'm afraid. Alright now, what
  happens? I'm afraid. What's there with the fear? Oh, I get lonely. Maybe that's what it
  is.&quot; So you see it's loneliness, and then fear, and then chomping away, or whatever
  it is that you're examining.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So let yourself take a week and go from the activity
  itself, really seeing how often it comes, and what it's like, and also look at the heart
  and the mind under it, and see if you can discover the mental states that come, and see
  how they come and go. Let it be a practice of a deeper insight than that. You see the
  content, you see the sources of it in your feelings, and then you also see how the action
  and the mind states come like clouds for a little bit and then they pass away.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That's your assignment, to study it for one week. Then the
  second week's assignment, which I'll give you tonight in case you don't come next week, is
  to stop it for just one week, whatever that particular thing is, either the outer activity
  or the inner one if it's there. Try to stop it and watch what happens when you stop it,
  not that it's bad or you're going to get rid of it completely, but then make your
  observation and your experiment to see what mental states and what experiences come when
  you don't do that. Does this give you some sense of what I mean by &quot;fire&quot; or
  being willing to work with yourself? It's discovery; it's not that bad. You may do it for
  the rest of your life, but you can begin to sense this capacity of inner strength, of
  directing your attention, concentrating your mind, and seeing with more clarity. We start
  with little things and we see how we're bound. It's really the question of bondage and
  liberation, from biting your nails to the deepest inner things. We can start to see what
  it is that creates bondage, and that to discover this resource we have to be freer inside.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We become, as Ram Dass put it, connoisseurs of our
  neurosis. It's not that the neurosis goes away necessarily, but you have, &quot;Wow, look
  at that example. Isn't that fantastic! I really did it that time.&quot; And there's a
  sense of humor that you can bring to it. When you observe, after awhile either there comes
  despair or humor, depending on which you want to pick. After awhile you get tired of
  despair, and you see, &quot;My God, there it goes again.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first thing in Right Attitude is openness; that it's
  not a thing of &quot;I'm going to perfect myself and make a perfect personality and a
  perfect body and a perfect mind.&quot; I don't know anybody like that. But it's a quality
  of really discovering and opening. And the second is a willingness to work, not to just
  follow our habits, but to put ourselves into it a little bit, to put some effort out,
  renunciation. And the third is the quality of non-harming, or loving thoughts, and how to
  evoke that, how can we bring this quality of loving thoughts, how can we evoke that
  quality in our spiritual life, which means becoming more conscious of what we do in what
  we do.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One way is to see the events that come to us as gifts,
  especially the difficult ones; not necessarily as good gifts, but gifts. Don Juan calls
  them &quot;challenges.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One way to really discover this quality of love is to see
  that we've got a big playpen. I'm getting into baby metaphors these days. You have to
  understand it's my new conditioning. We have a big playpen and a lot of toys, some of
  which are hot and they burn, some of which are cold, some are pleasant, and some aren't.
  Our life is limited; we're born, we're going to die. Nothing will stop that. No matter how
  fast we run, or how much we jog, we're going to die anyway. Because it's limited, it makes
  it interesting to experiment with. Let's learn in this time that we're here; let's really
  look at it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's hard, because it's easy to love kittens and puppies,
  babies when they're not crying, and pleasant experiences. That actually doesn't have much
  to do with love. That's kind of an ease of mind or sentimentality or something. I think,
  really, love manifests when things get difficult. That's when you really know it. That's
  when the fire melts whatever barriers we have in our heart. Our hearts want to be melted.
  The pain isn't so bad. It's much better to have that all happen than have it all still,
  solid and barricaded.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What love requires in practice, this quality, is
  &quot;constancy&quot; -- Suzuki-roshi's word.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">St. Francis de Sales says:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A cup of knowledge, a barrel of love and an ocean of
    patience.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In a way this quality of love and patience are so related.
  Our practice will go through cycles. Sometimes you sit at home and it will really nourish
  you, and you'll feel rested afterwards; other times you'll sit down after a busy day and
  the body will be tight and the mind will be spinning, and you'll be hating this person,
  and worried about that, and you don't want to feel it, and you don't want to look at it.
  Feel it, look at it; work to nourish that quality of constancy, of what's called, &quot;a
  long-enduring mind.&quot; It's not a short game. You know, we're used to instant food,
  drive-through, tell the lady through the speaker, &quot;Yes, I'd like a Big Mac, fries and
  a coke,&quot; or whatever it is. You drive around and you get it and you can eat it while
  you're driving; you don't even have to stop. Instant gratification. This is not an instant
  gratification thing. It is the longest thing you'll ever do because it's your whole life.
  It's really to discover how to transform your life from being on automatic pilot to being
  conscious, to discovery, to play. And it's wonderful. So it means that you don't complete
  it, you actually learn how to play the game and make your life into that.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It has many cycles. There will be many times when it's
  hard to sit, maybe more than when it's easy. And even in the good moments they'll come.
  You know what happens when something is really sweet and good, a wonderful taste, a great
  sexual experience, a good concert, a piece of music, or some wonderful sitting? What
  happens? There's this little voice that comes in the middle. What does it say? &quot;It
  won't last. Can I get it to stay? How much longer?&quot; There's that worry even in the
  middle. We can't kind of enjoy it because there's that thing inside that tries to grasp
  it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Wisdom is also this development of patience or love or
  constancy, that you go through so many cycles.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I'll read you a poem from Gary Snyder called &quot;The
  Avocado&quot;.</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Dharma is like an avocado.<br>
    Some parts of it so ripe<br>
    you can't believe it it's so good,<br>
    and other parts hard and green<br>
    without much flavor,<br>
    pleasing those who like their eggs<br>
    well cooked.<br>
    And the skin is thin,<br>
    the great big skin around the middle<br>
    is your own original true nature,<br>
    pure and smooth.<br>
    Almost nobody splits it open<br>
    or ever tries to see if it will grow.<br>
    Hard and slippery it looks like you should plant it,<br>
    But then it shoots through the fingers and gets away.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We grasp it sometimes, or we touch it, we touch something
  really deep, and it's beautiful and it's tremendously important. Then what happens? Bleep.
  Slippery seed. That's fine. You pick up the avocado seed again, or you plant it, or maybe
  make a garden of avocado seeds, avocado trees.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As I speak I'm trying to translate the talks and concepts
  that I've used so often in intensive retreats to try and find ways to really make them
  applicable in our situation of jobs and families and driving, and all the rest of it. I
  did a radio show today on KCBS which will be on in a couple of weeks. And at the end of it
  I taught a driving meditation, knowing that people listen to the radio when driving.
  &quot;Don't close you eyes. Hold the steering wheel. Now relax. That's right.&quot; It was
  great fun. But that's the quality of beginning to make what we do our practice, through
  this openness or discovery rather than some ideal that's spiritual; through some
  willingness to renounce or a little fire, and finally through a tremendous amount of
  patience or constancy.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here's another exercise I want to give you. Pick one day
  next week, and maybe next time we'll have a little pairing at the end and see who did it
  and just share with one another in a pair what you discovered. Pick one day next week and
  see how many moments of impatience you can count. Even if you get to 500, don't judge
  them, don't try and make them go away, but in one day of your life see how many times you
  can count impatience, 50, 200, 500. We'll have a contest. The person who comes with the
  most moments of impatience they saw in a day will get a prize.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Patience can even be used to understand impatience,
  because if you look at it, you start to see what's there when you feel impatience. We
  discover love by looking in places where it's not. Actually, we discover deeper or truer
  love. Don't look at what's romantic. Forget that part. Look at where it's hard, and you
  can really learn about love.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Do the exercise. I'll give you a little bit of a hint. You
  get impatient when the kind of experience is happening that's unpleasant, when it's
  painful, when there's some experience of body or mind that hurts a little bit. For the
  heart to open you have to be willing to feel pain, joy, pleasure, hot, cold, the whole
  thing. When you open the door, what do you get coming in? You get what's there. And if you
  open the heart, you get the experience of what our humanity is, what's rich. You can't
  open the heart for pleasure and not feel the pain. The world is dual; it's up/down,
  light/dark, hot/cold, and when we open, we discover a kind of capacity for joy and for
  understanding which allows for the fact that life has pleasure and pain. It's got them
  both. If you don't want pain, go to another planet, because this one has light and dark,
  sweet and sour, hot and cold, and pleasure and pain. That's the game.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you want your heart to open, study your impatience.
  It's a fantastic place to look. Count it through a day, and just see what the things are
  that evoke it as you look. Don't try and change it. There are wonderful things you can
  learn from it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is from the Sufis again:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Overcome any bitterness that may have come<br>
    because you were not up to the magnitude<br>
    of the pain that was entrusted to you.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Like the mother of the world<br>
    who carries the pain of the world<br>
    in her heart, each one of us is<br>
    part of her heart and therefore<br>
    each is endowed with a certain measure<br>
    of cosmic pain.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">You are sharing in the totality<br>
    of that pain and are called upon<br>
    to meet it in joy instead of<br>
    self-pity.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's not a judgment but rather realizing we have this
  capacity, we have a beautiful capacity to suffer, and we have a beautiful capacity to
  love, and we have a beautiful capacity to open to the richness of our experience which has
  all that in it -- what's joyful, what's unpleasant -- so that the attitude of practice is
  like a flower blossoming. You started, so it's happening anyway, but you can help it. You
  can give it a little plant food or you can water it. By sitting every day you water it,
  and the plant food and the nourishment comes from the sangha, from coming together, from
  listening to the Dharma and discussing it, and getting those extra kinds of nutriments
  that help you when you work in your daily life.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we do that, then we can find the dharma that's true. We
  can work with it in traffic on Highway l0l, in our kitchen, with our children, in our
  office, and in the times of our inner solitude, and then things really do become rich and
  wonderful.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I hope I wasn't too preachy tonight. I speak in a way to
  remind myself of these things that just make it a lot better to live. It's not that you
  should do it, but these are just laws of what makes life richer or happier in some way.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I want to close by telling one more story. The story,
  which to me is a wonderful illustration of openness, is of a physician, Larry Brilliant,
  who was involved in a campaign to put an end to smallpox in the world. He was working in
  the villages in Nepal and India. Almost everyone had been inoculated. There were a few
  small areas where it still existed. They had to go in because if they didn't, then it
  would spread, and the whole thing would start all over again around the world. There's
  blindness that comes from smallpox and in some cases terrible disfiguration and brain
  damage. So it was really a very important thing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">They went to this village and the villagers refused to be
  inoculated. They said that smallpox came from God, and God brought both disease and life,
  and that that had to be honored as it came. Here's this guy, Larry Brilliant, who's a very
  devoted spiritual person, and here are these people saying it's from God, and he has to
  make some choice. He and the people with him say, &quot;God or not, we don't want another
  l00,000 children in the world next year to be blinded by smallpox.&quot; So they went into
  the village at night with their jeeps. They first went to the house of the chief, and the
  doors were barricaded. They broke the doors down, and they went in with nurses and
  doctors, and they wrestled the chief and his wife to the floor -- she was apparently
  tougher than the chief -- and they gave them their shots. They were screaming and saying,
  &quot;No, no,&quot; and whatever, and for him it was terribly traumatic because his values
  had been that you respect the religion of all people, and so forth. Working in spiritual
  practice, it's not so black and white, it's not so easy. I'm sure you have seen that,
  haven't you? Making choices.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then what happened after that? Already that was difficult.
  So they're sitting there, and after inoculating the chief and his wife and the family,
  then the village was easy to inoculate. The chief goes out to his garden -- very small
  garden, it's a really poor village -- and picks a couple of squash, some of the few
  vegetables that are in the garden, and brings them in and hands them to the doctors, and
  says, &quot;I would like to give these as a gift,&quot; and then starts to prepare a meal
  with the very little they have, and they're astonished. They say through the translator,
  &quot;Why is he doing this?&quot; And the chief explains. He said, &quot;You came to my
  house. It is my religious belief that smallpox is a gift from God, among the many things
  in this world, and following my religious belief in my heart, I had to resist you. It is
  your belief that it is the best thing in the world that everyone be inoculated. Following
  your belief, and given the fact that there were more of you than there were of us, you
  inoculated us. Defeat is no shame! Now you are a guest in my house and I would like to
  treat you as such.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As he tells the story it was one of the most wonderful
  awakenings in his life. It was the kind of awakening to see that you are in a difficult
  situation. To live is difficult, and we're always in these binds Can you stay open, can
  you discover what's new? Can you allow the people around you to do surprising things? Can
  you yourself do surprising things? </font></p>
