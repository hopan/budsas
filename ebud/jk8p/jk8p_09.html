<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I've asked old students, people who have sat in meditation
  for quite awhile, what kinds of things they were working with after five or ten or fifteen
  years of practice. They say, &quot;I'm working with fear&quot; or &quot;I'm working with
  habit and desires that arise over and over&quot; or &quot;I'm working with laziness&quot;
  or &quot;I'm working with irritation&quot; or anger; common kinds of energies. What I hear
  even from people who have sat in meditation for a long time is the same list of the five
  basic hindrances that are discussed in the second day of every retreat. It seems that they
  stay around for awhile. So I'd like to look at them in the context of people who have been
  practicing for awhile and living their lives, and see how we can continue to work with
  them since they seem to be part of our family life, so to speak, or inner family life
  anyway.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">How can we understand the hindrances or the traditional
  difficulties in meditation in our daily life? First of all, it is important to understand,
  as you go on in the path of spiritual practice, that often the weaknesses or difficulties
  that we encounter are the places that most wake us up. The places where we seem most
  successful and the best of things are often also the places that are the strongest part of
  our self image or our &quot;ego&quot; in some kind of Eastern sense of that word. And it's
  the places that are our very difficulties and our vulnerabilities that often allow us to
  grow in a more genuine way when we look at them, when we work with them.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There was a wonderful paper that was written a few years
  ago by Seymour and Sylvia Boorstein for the Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, and it
  was called &quot;The Five Hindrances of Marriage.&quot; It talked about the difficulties
  that the Buddha described in meditation -- desire, anger, restlessness, laziness or
  sleepiness, doubt -- and it describes the process of marriage as encountering these exact
  same forces. Desire for something else or better. Irritation and anger, especially when
  you discover that that person really isn't behaving in the way that you expected and hoped
  and planned for them, and all the irritation and frustration that comes from that. The
  third hindrance of sleepiness or laziness, discovering after awhile that one can get
  complacent in relationships. Or the opposite -- restlessness, the traditional Seven Year
  Itch; after a certain cycle in a relationship, one gets restless for something new or
  something different. And doubt. &quot;Is this the right person?&quot; or &quot;Is this the
  right way to be living?&quot; and the same forces which arise when one sits in meditation
  and tries to open one's eyes inwardly, and one's heart and mind seem to arise in relation
  to the people we're closest to, and all the other people at distances from us.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Can you recognize that? Can you see that there are
  parallels between the sitting and other things around? There are all kinds of stories that
  we make up about these states. &quot;He did,&quot; and &quot;she did,&quot; and &quot;I
  will,&quot; and &quot;she should,&quot; and so forth. It's useful to see that those
  stories are based on kind of myths that we build about ourselves and the world, identities
  that are created mostly by thought, and, in fact, things are a lot simpler than that.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is from Achaan Chaa:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Traditionally the Eightfold Path is taught with eight
    steps such as Right Understanding, Right Speech, Right Concentration, and so forth. But
    the true Eightfold Path is within us: two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, a tongue and a
    body. These eight doors are our entire Path and the mind is the one that walks on the
    Path. If you know just these things, and the states that arise with them, all of the
    dharma is in front of you.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We all have these stories about experiences, but actually
  our experiences, if we want to live more in the moment, are much simpler than that, much
  simpler than our stories.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let's talk about the five hindrances a little bit and
  maybe reflect in some ways how they arise, not just while sitting, but all the rest of the
  time, which is what practice is for. You sit and practice in order then to live it. That's
  why it's called &quot;Practice.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Desire is the juiciest one of them. As Oscar Wilde said,
  &quot;I can resist anything but temptation.&quot; It's the one that we get caught up in in
  different ways. It's amazing, wanting is a very powerful habit. We can want anything, and
  it changes from one thing to another. We desire one thing and then we desire another. In
  the retreats, as you know, there's the phenomena of things like The Vipassana Romance
  where people are silent and not looking at anyone and just paying attention, and they
  notice some interesting shape or something out there, and then they just sit, and all of a
  sudden the whole idea comes, what it would be like to maybe meet that person, and talk
  with them, perhaps after the retreat to go out and meditate together, or some other
  activity like that. And that goes on, you know -- marriage, children. In California it
  usually includes divorce as well, if you really play it all the way out. And without
  making eye contact with that person, the mind spins out this fantasy of things that will
  fulfill it better than whatever experience is here, with the breath, or the body, or
  whatever is actually here.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That same movement can be observed, if you look, all the
  time in our life. It's called the &quot;If-Only Mind.&quot; It's the mind that arises in
  the moment of experience and says, &quot;If only I had something else,&quot; &quot;If only
  I had a different partner,&quot; or &quot;If only they behaved in a different way,&quot;
  or &quot;If only I had a different job,&quot; or &quot;If only I had more free time,&quot;
  or more money, or a house more in the country, or a house more in the city, or &quot;If
  only I were younger,&quot; or &quot;If only I were older,&quot; or whatever. It's always
  the same state. I watched it when I was a monk and all I had were a few books and a robe
  and bowl. Possessions were really minimal. Even so, I found myself thinking, &quot;If only
  I had a little nicer robe.&quot; It has nothing to do with what's around us. It's this
  movement inside of feeling like what's here is not enough. Do you know what I'm talking
  about?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nasrudin says:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Never give people anything they ask for<br>
    until at least a day has passed.<br>
    Someone said, &quot;Why not?&quot;<br>
    &quot;Experience shows they only appreciate something<br>
    when they have the opportunity of doubting<br>
    whether they will get it or not.&quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the interesting things when you start to look at
  and work with the hindrance of desire is to see that what relieves it, what makes one
  finally happy about it, is not so much the thing that you get, or the person, or the
  experience that you get at the end - this is important, so listen to this - it's actually
  the fact that the state of desiring has ended. I'll give you a simple example. Suppose you
  have a craving for some food that you really want to have. It can be pizza or ice cream or
  cannelloni, you name it, whatever it happens to be. You go and you get it. You do all the
  things. You get in your car, you go, you finally get it, you have it in your hand, and you
  take the first bite of whatever it is. And usually the moment that you taste it, there's
  this great sense of delight and release, and so forth, and part of it may be because it
  tastes good and it's pleasurable, if it's part of your fantasy -- but the main piece is,
  in that moment, finally the wanting stops. Do you understand that? And that a good deal of
  the joy of fulfilling desires is not so much of the getting of the thing, because you have
  it for a little while and then you want the next thing -- it's endless -- but rather that
  there's a moment where the wanting itself stops. If you look closely in yourself, if you
  let yourself look, you find that the very process of wanting is painful; that the very
  state of not being complete or content or present with what's here is what the pain is
  about.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That's a familiar hindrance. Let's talk about some of the
  others, and then talk about ways one could work with them in one's life. Of course, the
  first piece is just beginning to understand how these operate in ourselves.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next four are quite interesting. Anger, sleep,
  restlessness and doubt -- even desire to a certain extent is included -- I tend to see
  them all as states of avoidance. They're really states which arise so that we can avoid
  something, some aspect of what's true in our experience. Maybe I can explain that as we go
  along.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Anger, which includes irritation and judgment and boredom,
  not liking what's present, fear -- all of those are the movement of anger. It's a very
  painful state, for the most part, if you look at it. The body has a lot of tension,
  there's heat, there's burning if you're angry. Even irritation has a lot of tension in it.
  Yet in some way we do it again partly out of habit. Another reason that we do it is
  because it makes us feel right in some way. You know what I mean about being right. That's
  the favorite feeling of many people because it's the feeling that most authenticates the
  sense of yourself.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Two weeks ago when we talked about Forgiveness somebody
  stood up or raised their hand and said something that was really powerful. They said,
  &quot;Here we are, stewing and raging and angry about something that someone has done, and
  very often they're off going about their own business enjoying themselves. And who's
  suffering? It's us because it wasn't that way, and we're so angry, and it should have
  been, and so forth. And who is doing the holding on at that point? I'm not saying that you
  shouldn't be angry -- you can be angry or hold grudges; you're welcome to do anything. --
  We're just looking at the laws of how it operates.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I remember I was sitting at this one monastery for a long
  time meditating, and I had a bout of anger about something, which I have regularly, and I
  went to the teacher and told him how angry I was about something. It was in the hot season
  and he was wearing those little flip-flop sandals. He got up and went over to the table
  where we were sitting and he kicked the table leg. It looked like it hurt him. Then he
  held his foot and he hopped around for awhile. Then he sat back down and kind of massaged
  his foot. Then he looked at me and he shook his head. That was his response to my being
  angry. He just kind of acted out what we do. Just like desire, where we can desire
  anything, and it doesn't matter what it is, the force is there, and we get our food, or
  our relationship, or our car, or our vacation, or our time off, whatever it is, and then
  we look for the next thing because it's so powerful. The same with anger. We can get angry
  at anything, including things that are already past and nothing can be done about them.
  And even more, we can imagine something which somebody is going to do, and sit there and
  get really angry at what they might do. Have you ever seen yourself do that?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We project our righteousness on other people in some way.
  We project our pain, is really what it's about; that we're in some kind of pain, and we
  make it somebody else's fault. Also there's as much suffering in the world as we
  experience at certain times, and we don't want to take it in because it's so hard for our
  hearts, and our culture is one that doesn't train the human heart very well to deal with
  the measure of pain that's part of life.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I got quite angry today. In fact, I was really yelling at
  somebody. I won't talk about the specifics so much. I felt so indignant and I felt so
  right that it was very hard not to do it. It's interesting to observe. It's not like anger
  is some terrible thing, or that it won't arise, or that all these other states won't
  arise, or that there might not even be an occasion where it was appropriate. There are
  some occasions for that, especially if you're able to let it move through you instead of
  storing it as resentment and all kinds of other things, or if you use it in a way that
  isn't really intended to hurt other people. That's a whole other talk about anger.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But here we are, living in a pretty busy and complicated
  world, and we see this state of being angry, or being irritated, or judgmental, arise very
  often, and yet we are the victims of it. It's we who suffer from it. The question, when it
  comes, is: How can we relate to it? It's really the pain in us that we're talking about.
  If we can look at that, then we can touch the world and heal it a little bit. It's very
  difficult to do without healing our own pain.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let's talk about laziness, and so forth. I said all of
  these are avoidances. Very often anger is really a way of not feeling the pain of someone
  else or what our own experience is. Judgment and fear are the same things. Sleepiness is
  the same. Sleepiness, the habit of going unconscious. When is it that sleepiness arises?
  There are three basic causes for it. It comes when we're tired. That's the first one. And
  that's a good signal. You sit in meditation or you find yourself at other times having
  sleepiness. arise for you; then take a look and see what are the causes. Now, if it's just
  that you've been working kind of hard and you're tired, that's one thing. Then you just
  respect your body and maybe take a rest.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But because we're in 80's in California, in a Western
  culture, how many people when they get sleepy or tired are living in such a way that it's
  really a signal? How are you living your life, how busy is it, how full is it; where are
  we going that we fill it up so much? Does that make sense to any of you? So that's a
  signal. It's a signal even if it is just tiredness. Let's look at what pace we live at, or
  let's look of how we fill up our lives, and what we might be avoiding in some way in doing
  that.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One part of sleepiness is just that we're tired. The
  second is that we are unaccustomed to stillness, that our culture moves so fast and we get
  into that rhythm. Then when it's time to stop, and you sit to meditate or you walk
  outside, or you go home you kick your shoes off, you start to think, &quot;Maybe I could
  meditate. No, I'm too tired to do it.&quot; The way I put it in retreats is: When we start
  to get quiet, there's some little voice in there that says, &quot;Oh, it's quiet; it must
  be bedtime,&quot; because it's one of the few times we stop. It's a response in us, when
  we start to get still or concentrated or quiet. And sometimes the fear comes, &quot;Oh,
  this is too quiet, what will I do with this? It's too empty, there isn't enough activity
  for me to know who I am,&quot; because we define ourselves by our activities.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third reason that sleepiness arises is that it is a
  kind of resistance. You will notice yourself becoming lazy or sleepy at certain times in
  your spiritual life not because you're overtired or not because it's too quiet. And that's
  an unfamiliar state that you need to work with, to learn to open again like a child; but
  because there's some pain or sorrow or grief or difficulty or conflict that's kind of hard
  to feel, it's easier just to be sleepy about it. Has anybody noticed that happening in
  their lives, or how often it can happen?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Our culture is amazing. Not just our culture, it's
  worldwide. There are ten million drug addicts, and 20 million alcoholics, and 50 million
  people who are close to those drug addicts and alcoholics -- and their families or
  family-systems, who are really painfully touched by that; deeply so. And more than half of
  all the car accidents where people are killed and 80 or 90 percent of child abuse and the
  great majority of fires at home, and all of those things, are involved with alcohol and
  drugs. And the level of pain, if you start to work with people around the family systems
  of alcohol and drugs, and so forth -- it's extraordinary. Yet, the purpose of all of that,
  for the most part, is to cover pain. A friend of mine who worked in a drug program for
  many years said that generally speaking the amount of drugs and alcohol used is equal to
  the amount of pain in the person, not to be too simplistic about it. So that's what I mean
  by avoidance; that there are states that arise for us that keep us from feeling.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Restlessness is a different one. The vibration, the
  movement, the habit of our culture is to be speedy. TV, shopping, eating, traveling, the
  telephone, all of these things, where we keep ourselves busy because we don't know what to
  do. We're not taught as we grow up how to nurture ourselves in stillness, how to listen
  more to the breeze, or the clouds, or the trees, or the children, or the people around us,
  or how to just sit on our porch and rock in our chairs a little bit and watch stuff go by,
  as people used to do, instead of constantly being busy with it. I have to confess I'm one
  of us in that one. Somebody from Europe who heard my dharma talks wanted to sit a long
  retreat and came to a three-month retreat. They said they were so disappointed in me
  because I tend to move pretty quickly, and they said I seemed more like an Italian shoe
  salesman than a calm meditation teacher. And it's true.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Someone who has done a lot of vipassana practice and has
  worked with eating disorders, has titled one of her books feeding the hungry heart. A lot
  of our busyness is because we're looking for something to fulfill us. So we eat or go
  shopping or travel, or pick up the phone, or turn on the TV really compulsively at times,
  because there's something we want -- and it doesn't quite do it. That's the kind of
  restlessness. The ability to just stop and be, like when you're in a traffic jam where you
  say, &quot;Here, I am on the Golden Gate Bridge; I might as well feel the bridge vibrate
  and kind of look at what the shipping is doing, instead of thinking of where I could be or
  being frustrated.&quot; It's to be with what is.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There have been a number of movies from Australia. I
  remember one called the last wave, with pictures of the aborigines. One of the things that
  most struck me about them was that when the aborigines sat down, they sat. It was like
  they sat and they could have been on a rock, Ayers Rock or something, and they just sat
  there, and they could have sat all day and all night and all week. But you don't see that
  in our culture; you see this sense of movement almost to the extent where people can't sit
  still, can't pause, can't stop because of what would they feel.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Someone asked Nijinsky about his dancing, how he could
  dance in such a marvelous way, and he said that there had to be some stillness in it. He
  said:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's really quite simple. I merely leap and pause.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What a description, &quot;I merely leap and pause.&quot;
  Can we learn to stop a little bit? Maybe that's all that meditation is about, just to
  stop. Then the last hindrance is doubt, confusion, tension, kind of wondering, &quot;What
  should my work be, how should my spiritual life go, am I in the right relationship, am I
  in the right workplace, am I in the right part of the country.&quot; We Americans have the
  curse of choice. That's not a trivial thing. It enlivens and it enriches the culture and
  our lives, but it's a very difficult thing and it's not so for most cultures. And usually
  when doubt arises strongly it does so because our heads, our thinking apparatus is not
  connected with our heart. If you look in the moment where there's a lot of confusion or
  doubt, it's there because there's much thought and not much connection to the heart, to
  what we might do based on our deeper values.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another way to put it is: when there's a lot of doubt,
  often connected with it is a lack of love for ourselves or a lack of love for the other,
  for the world around us. If we're in touch with that love, our path becomes pretty clear.
  Do you remember the question I asked the night of the talk on Forgiveness that came from
  Gandhi's tomb along the Ganges in Delhi where the question was inscribed in stone:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Think of the poorest person you have ever met, and then
    before acting ask if or how this act will be of benefit to that person.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Confusion generally comes when we're not in touch with
  what we really value in life. And again, it requires a stopping, an opening, a listening
  inside.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">These are the hindrances. Are they familiar? Certainly
  they are. They are our companions in the journey. We see them over and over in sitting, we
  see them over and over in the world outside, in the cause for war. When I was angry there
  was a very strong impulse in me to call and register a complaint and try to solve
  something. And then being met by aggression, it was very easy to see if someone chooses to
  be your adversary how easy it is to take up the banner and say, &quot;Alright, I'll do it.
  I'm a man. Why not?&quot; or whatever it is. That's one of the problems, yes. But it's
  worldwide -- prejudice, greed, fear and desire; these same forces that create war or that
  create grain elevators full of food in one place and hungry people in another.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The question is: Are they workable? Can one work with
  these forces? Lama Yeshe in that excerpt that I've read about his time being in the
  hospital and going through all the great difficulty with his heart attack, said:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Can you learn the basic precept of transforming your
    unwanted sufferings into the path of practice?</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you can learn that precept, it will serve you in any
  circumstances. Can you learn to do that? Can any of us do that? What does it take? A key
  thing that it requires is faith. It is so important -- faith in the human heart, faith in
  the power of awareness. The Dalai Lama was asked what was the most important thing one can
  do as a teacher of dharma, what's the most important thing you can communicate, and he
  said &quot;Faith.&quot; Not faith in the Buddha or faith in something from India or some
  ancient system, but really faith in our own true nature. Rock bottom understanding of
  that, not just with words but because you know that it's true that human beings have this
  capacity to deal with the sorrows of the world and with adversity, and that the heart is
  greater than all of that, and that the power of awareness is such that we can grow from
  any of it. That's what we have to discover -- in ourselves, in our sitting, in our
  families, in our lives. Faith, not so much in doing but in stopping, in listening, in not
  doing so much, and letting ourselves stop avoiding things that are difficult, not getting
  so caught by the stories of what we want or what we don't want. That's all the mind. Minds
  do that, it's sort of their job -- you pay them a little bit and they just think all the
  time.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Rilke talks about it quite beautifully in a poem which he
  calls, &quot;I Have Faith in Nights.&quot;</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">You darkness that I come from,<br>
    out of which all things come,<br>
    I love you more than all the fires<br>
    that fence in the world,<br>
    for the fire makes a circle of light for everyone,<br>
    and then no one outside learns of you.<br>
    But the darkness pulls in everything,<br>
    shapes and fires, animals and myself.<br>
    How easily it gathers them,<br>
    powers and people.<br>
    It is possible a great energy is moving near us.<br>
    I have faith in night.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Amazing poem, darkness out of which everything comes.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Can we stop -- in our practice, in our lives with our
  families -- and start to listen, and let ourselves be a little emptier, a little more
  silent, more in touch with the spaces between words or between desires or between
  frustrations? There is something really mysterious that reveals itself as soon as we stop.
  It doesn't take very long, and maybe there's a certain pain that one has to go through in
  putting on the brakes, if you know what I mean -- each time, again and again, too -- but
  when you do it, then things become mysterious again like it is for any child.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Walt Whitman said:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As to me I know of nothing else but miracles<br>
    when you're still enough.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The source of our happiness is not through our doing, it's
  really much more through stopping. How can we work with our hindrances very specifically?
  First of all, if you identify the most popular ones in your own personal repertoire, it
  helps a lot. If you're going to go to the theater, you might as well know what play is on.
  I've talked on some nights about Buddhist personality typology, which is based on our
  responses that come out of the sense of separateness itself; and the three roots in
  Buddhist psychology are the greed type, the aversion type, and the deluded type.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Just to remind you in a simple way, we all have all of it
  in us. I'm a great example of the greedy type. The general response of the greedy type is
  to go into a new situation and see what we like about it, and see how we might get more of
  it, what's lovely about it or what we appreciate. Forget the rest. Now, the aversion type
  -- my wife is more in that category -- is somebody who goes into a situation and sees
  what's wrong with it, which is a very different response, painted wrong, the colors are
  wrong, and people are behaving wrong, and so forth. And then the deluded type whose
  tendency is to go into a new situation and not know what to make of it, not know what
  their place is.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Does this make sense to you? Do you understand these types
  of either wanting or being critical or not knowing your place in it? There's a lot more.
  -- There's the Buddhist families, Ratna, Padma, Vajra, all these styles which I might talk
  about a little bit more. What's interesting is that each of these also has a positive
  side, which we'll get to later, things that can be transformed in us. The point about this
  is that it begins to become useful if we want to work with the hindrances in our daily
  life to start to see what our own patterns are. Is it our tendency to get irritated all
  the time, or is it our tendency to go to sleep all the time, or is it our tendency to eat
  to avoid, to use desire in that way, or is there some other tendency?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">My teacher Achaan Chah used to be very forthright about
  it. It was part of his teaching style. He would kind of give nicknames to a number of his
  monks and people around. It was a little bit like The Seven Dwarfs _ Sleepy and Dopey and
  stuff like that. &quot;This is a monk that's always into eating. Oh, here's my monk, why
  don't you meet him? This is Sleepy. Whenever I visit, go to his cottage, he's always
  sleeping,&quot; and so forth. He did it with a lot of humor.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You've got to start to look at what is your particular way
  of not being present. The thing is that they're not bad. You don't have to say,
  &quot;Well, I'm a bad person,&quot; because this is just the nature of being born with a
  self-structure or having it develop in early childhood. What's important is to see that
  it's actually very alive, and that if you can begin to work with it, it's interesting.
  Aren't you interested in yourself? Fess up! Come on! Why not look at the patterns that we
  use in relating to things? It's really juicy and it can be transformed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first thing is to see what are the popular patterns in
  oneself. So I ask you that for yourself -- which are the ones that you use? Then the
  second, after you recognize that, which helps you to kind of keep on the lookout for them,
  is to begin to identify mindfully the state or the experience as it arises in the moment,
  or as close to the moment as you can -- the wanting or the fear or the desire or the
  doubt. And a little while later you say, &quot;Oh, here I am in it,&quot; and to identify
  it by acknowledging it. It's very useful to use a label, &quot;fear, fear&quot; or
  &quot;desire&quot; or &quot;wanting&quot; - just give it its name in a neutral way. You
  really see the force as an opportunity to learn. &quot;Alright, I've had 29 years or 48
  years of this mostly being my pattern. Let me really look at it. How soon does it come?
  What situations cause it to arise? What does it feel like in the body? What's going on
  with me in that moment? What's the experience like?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So the second thing is to identify it, the best you can,
  without judgment. It's hard because we tend to say these are bad -- it's bad to be
  irritated or to be fearful or to be angry, or it's bad to be desiring or wanting. If we
  want to learn about them, the key is to be mindful, which is to say, to see and observe
  them as if you were studying a different person. Say, &quot;Gee, this is an interesting
  force. How is this operating?&quot; It's also important to see that they're workable. When
  you identify or label it, it changes from being overwhelming to, &quot;Oh, this is just
  the dark night of the soul.&quot; It's difficult, but you know what to call it. Or in your
  relationship, instead of saying, &quot;Oh, this is not going right, I should look for
  another partner,&quot; it might be, &quot;Oh, this is just a state of doubt or
  restlessness. Let me see if I can look at that in myself.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the third piece is to make friends with it, to really
  receive it with your heart as well as your attention, because if you dislike it, even in a
  subtle way in your heart, when you say, &quot;desire, desire, desire&quot; or
  &quot;aversion&quot; or whatever, it's not going to go away or change. You won't even
  learn much about it because you're still in struggle with it. The more that you struggle
  with pains or experiences, actually the more real they become inside.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fourth is to observe how it changes -- the more
  carefully, the better. Maybe you should study one a week. Pick one and observe what does
  it feel like in the body. How long does it last when you label it? How many labels long?
  What triggers it to arise? What state usually follows it? What is it like if you're
  working with desire and you note &quot;desire, desire, desire,&quot; or whatever it
  happens to be? What's the moment like when it stops? I keep thinking of this cartoon that
  was in mad magazine: Alfred E. Newman was at the blackboard, and he was writing, he was
  down to about his hundredth time, and it said, &quot;Cessation of desire, cessation of
  desire, cessation of desire,&quot; It was his assignment for that day. Look at and see if
  you're examining desire or fear or whatever, see what it feels like, and see if you can
  notice the moment when it changes. Very interesting moment, because at that moment you
  begin to realize not only its impermanence, but also that it's very impersonal, it comes
  according to a certain story or forces. It doesn't last very long unless we keep telling
  the story over and over.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You can practice with little ones. You can practice with
  annoyance with your partner or your spouse. Practice watching when you feel yourself to be
  right. Just practice watching for that little impulse that says, &quot;I'm right.&quot;
  It's a very interesting one. Or practice carefully with certain desires that arise that
  you know, those are the ones you'd like to learn about, and see what it's like as it
  arises.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">First is to look at key patterns and sort of recognize the
  territory for yourself. The second is to identify the experience in the moment. The third
  is to touch it with your heart as well as seeing and labeling it, to really let it in and
  not condemn it so much. The fourth is to notice how it changes, notice it's process,
  beginning and end, what comes before and afterward. Take little things to work with;
  practice easy ones.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next -- and this is really a key -- is see if you can
  discover or observe what it hides you from, what it distracts you from, what it covers up,
  what's the fear. When I said these are all forms of avoidance, if you let yourself feel
  desire, or fear, or boredom, or doubt, or restlessness, and you observe it, see if you can
  listen inside yourself a little more deeply, or even on a cellular level somehow, and see
  what it is that you're moving away from, that you run from. Some of it is moving away from
  being &quot;just this much,&quot; as Achaan Chaa says. We're always at war trying to make
  life more than it is, make it bigger, or grander, or happier, or sadder, or longer, or
  shorter, or lighter, or darker.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We move away from hunger, we move away from loneliness, we
  move away from grief, or unfinished business, or pain in our heart, or the fact that we
  haven't really been intimate in our relations at times, and that's difficult to
  acknowledge, so we distract ourselves, or we move away from pains that are unfinished in
  the past where we haven't forgiven, or meaninglessness, or we move away from fear that
  things are out of control. They are! Or we move away from space; it gets quiet and the
  whole sense of oneself which is built on busyness starts to go away, and that's scary, so
  we distract ourselves.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's not only to observe the hindrance or the state, but
  also to listen more deeply and see what you would experience if you let yourself just get
  here. What might you be avoiding? It's a little bit like going through a layer of ice
  that's a little painful, if you want to go into the water and explore the depths of it.
  There's all kinds of amazing things. But you have to stop skating, and then there's a
  moment where you say, &quot;Whoops, I think I'm going to break through the ice,&quot; and
  you do. It's okay to stop and feel what's actually present. This is a big part of
  practice, to open your body, to use your breath, your attention, and your heart, and feel
  what's here, and stop moving; to come to rest in the moment. This is where it gets very
  delicate. It's called, Watching the Movement of Mind.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I'll close again with something from Achaan Chah. He talks
  about the Middle Way:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On one side it's like you're being kicked on one side with
    desire, and the other is aversion, left and right. One who follows the Middle Way says,
    &quot;I will not get caught by the pleasure or pain. I will let go of each as they arise,
    accepting one moment after another. But it's hard. It's as though we're being kicked on
    both sides, like a cow bell or a pendulum knocked back and forth. We're always besieged by
    pleasure and pain, and then we follow by a response, &quot;I don't like it, I do like
    it.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you observe this, use your heart for guidance. You'll
    see that when the heart is in its natural state, it's unattached, it's accepting. When it
    stirs from the normal it's because of various thoughts and ideas, the process of
    construction, of images. This is the illusion.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Learn to see this process clearly. When the mind is
    stirred from its normal state it leads away from this moment into past, into future, into
    right and wrong, into indulgence and aversion, creating more illusion, more of movement.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Good and bad arise only in the mind. If you keep watch on
    this, studying this one topic your whole life, I guarantee you'll never be bored.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">He says in another place:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Just take one seat in the middle of the room and don't get
    up, and see the things as they come and go.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So working with these states in one's sitting practice, in
  driving in a traffic jam, in the supermarket, in one's marriage, or one's intimate
  relations, in the workplace -- they're the same forces. Begin to work by identifying them,
  start to see what your common patterns are, maybe take a look and see what you're avoiding
  by having them there, and see if you can bring your heart into them as well, because for
  the most part they arise out of some place of pain. If we can open and soften to that, to
  kind of melt to it, there's a much deeper place of well-being that is our Buddha-nature,
  that is our birthright, and it's there for anybody who stops.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is Emily Dickinson:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When much in the woods as a little girl,<br>
    I was told that the snake would bite me,<br>
    that I might pick a poisonous flower<br>
    or mushroom, or the goblins would kidnap me.<br>
    But I went along and met none but angels.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I guess the second half will wait until another night. We
  have a few moments for thoughts, comments, questions. And in the second half we'll take
  more time because I'd like to hear from you about common hindrances that you discover in
  your daily life and how you've learned to look at them or work with them.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">THE AUDIENCE: A question about depression. I've read that
  depression can be stated as anger turning inward. Any comments about that, regarding anger
  being one of the hindrances?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">JACK: Is this for yourself particularly?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">THE AUDIENCE: Yes.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">JACK: So at times you experience depression and you wonder
  how it relates to anger? Is that it?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">THE AUDIENCE: What's going on?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">JACK: It is often the case, although not always, that
  depression is a cover for anger; that one has had some circumstance in life that first
  brought a lot of pain, and then the response to that pain is anger. If that's unexpressed
  in people, the energy to keep that anger down is as strong as the anger itself, and it
  bottles up a great deal of energy, and then one can feel fearful, depressed, lacking any
  sense of personal empowerment. So often, although not always, in working with depression,
  you might look to see where you've really cut yourself off from your true feelings or your
  true inner relationship to things around. That's not the only cause for depression, and
  it's important to see that it's a very personal process that we're discussing; that there
  isn't some rote formula. For someone else it might be loss and there might be a bit of
  anger but there could be some other sense of grief or loss, possibly other reasons as
  well. So it's more an inquiry. What you might do is look at what time of day it gets the
  strongest or in what circumstances, and then stop and sit. Say, &quot;Alright, I'm going
  to feel this,&quot; and see what images come, where you feel it in your body, what images
  might arise.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Do you feel it in your body when you're depressed?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">THE AUDIENCE: Yes. Then it becomes sleepiness.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">JACK: So you get sleepy. So that's one function. Do you
  feel it in any particular place?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">THE AUDIENCE: All over.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">JACK: So then you might sit with that and feel the
  sleepiness and see what's under that, what would come up if you weren't sleepy. Just pay
  careful attention. If you really want to go further, see if you can feel the strongest
  sensation in your body, and then let an image arise, whatever image wants to come out of
  it that may show you a picture of what that inner conflict really is.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's a good question.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">THE AUDIENCE: What would be an interesting discussion one
  night is talk about when we're happy. It seems to seduce us away from the inner work. I
  mean, me.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">JACK: What seduces us away?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">THE AUDIENCE: Happiness. When I'm feeling really happy and
  things are going right, some things are going right, it's like, &quot;Well, I might not
  have time to go to meditation.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">JACK: I'd love to talk about happiness some night. I see
  it much broader than that. That's a very good point, that at times happiness can lead to a
  kind of complacency. However, there are other kinds of happiness that are very genuine and
  really nurturing of spiritual life, that touching them actually gives us the strength to
  deal with difficulties. So it's a whole range, and there can be great joys that come out
  of spiritual practice as well. Seeing the layer of things that we've avoided, there's a
  very deep level of joy that can come. It's a good topic to talk about.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">THE AUDIENCE: One of the things that hurts me, you naming
  them, I know all of them, is that it's like I'm paying attention.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">JACK: People do have all of them. They're all common human
  forces that operate in each of us. There may be ones that we tend to have more than
  another, but they're all the elements of the make-up of the normal human mind. So it's not
  so much a question of which we have or don't have. Some people have them all at once,
  what's called, A Multiple Hindrance Attack. What's important in meditation is not what the
  experience is, but what is our relationship to it as it arises. So as we get to see what
  are our top ten tunes, and the popular ones for us, then we can also begin to look at
  whether we can develop a mindful or a skillful or a passionate relationship that leads us
  to freedom in relation to that. It may be that we all have to work down the list or up the
  list, depending on where you want to start. I think that's true. </font></p>
