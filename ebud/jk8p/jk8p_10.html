<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We have begun to look at what the Buddhists traditionally
  call &quot;hindrances&quot; or difficult energies which arise in the mind and in one's
  life as a part of meditation practice, particularly as householders, and how we might look
  at them, deal with them, and work with them.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I want to read a passage from an article by a woman named
  Portia Nelson. It's called <i>Autobiography in Five Chapters</i>.</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Chapter One:<br>
    I walk down the street. There is a deep hole in the sidewalk. I fall in. I'm lost. I'm
    helpless. It isn't my fault. It takes forever to find a way out.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Chapter Two:<br>
    I walk down the same street. There is a deep hole in the sidewalk. I pretend I don't see
    it. I fall in again. I can't believe I'm in the same place, but it isn't my fault. It
    still takes a long time to get out.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Chapter Three:<br>
    I walk down the same street. There is a deep hole in the sidewalk. I see it is there. I
    fall in. It's a habit. But my eyes are open. I know where I am. It is my fault and I get
    out immediately.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Chapter Four:<br>
    I walk down the same street. There's a deep hole in the sidewalk. I walk around it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Chapter Five:<br>
    I try walking down a different street.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It somehow speaks very directly to our human experience
  which is not that one sees and immediately learns, but that in some sense our spiritual
  practice and our life of growing in general is a process of making mistakes and
  confronting our demons, and oftentimes looking at the same patterns and difficulties. They
  are the forces that the great Christian Desert Father Teacher Evagrius described attacking
  those people who went out to meditate in the desert in Egypt in the second century A.D.
  There they talked about them in terms of demons. They would be assailed by the demons of
  desire, wanting to go back to Alexandria and have a pizza, or whatever they served in
  Alexandria at that time, or wanting a soft bed, or the demons of aversion and frustration
  because it was too hot or too cold or what we call the Noonday Demon, which is the demon
  of sleepiness that would creep up in the middle of the day to want to take them into
  unconsciousness. Or if you got rid of all those, the demon of pride who would come only
  after you were successful in routing the other demons, to say, &quot;See how good I am? I
  got rid of desire, frustration and anger, and I'm really a good meditator.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of course, what one discovers is that what was available
  and in fact a part of meditation in Egypt in the 2nd Century A.D., or in ancient India, or
  in China, are exactly the same forces, the same demons one encounters here, in our lives,
  in our work, in our families. As I mentioned, there was an article that articulated this
  very well that describes the traditional hindrances of desire, anger, judgment,
  restlessness, sleepiness, laziness and doubt in terms of marriage. In fact, in relating to
  anything, whether it's our meditation, our work, our financial life, the same states of
  mind will have the tendency to arise.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What's important to understand is that these very states
  are the place of practice. The doubt, the fear, the difficulty, the anger, that arise in
  our life are what make practice juicy. If you could just sit and be peaceful and get up,
  your meditation wouldn't take you very far in terms of opening a heart of very deep
  compassion, or in terms of some inner centeredness, a capacity to relate to birth and
  death -- and all of the changes that are inevitable in life -- with wisdom, with deep
  understanding.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Buddhist tradition there are a number of different
  strategies for dealing with these hindrances or difficulties. An image that's used is of
  these hindrances or difficulties being the same as a poisoned tree. One strategy is that
  you go and find the poisoned tree and you cut it down; you chop it down and try to get rid
  of it. We'll talk about working with that strategy. A second strategy is to simply put up
  a sign near the tree that says, &quot;This is a poisoned tree. Don't eat the berries,
  don't eat the leaves,&quot; and instead of killing it, to take shade in it, and to enjoy
  it for what there is of value in it, to have some friendly relationship to it rather than
  one based on fear. The third and the most interesting strategy is the person who comes
  along and says, &quot;Oh, a poisoned tree of this kind, just what I've been looking for.
  These berries make the best medicine for curing a number of illnesses, including the
  illness of greed, fear, desire, anger and doubt.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's the person that takes the very energies that are
  difficult and learns to work with them or distills them in their own body and heart until
  something more valuable comes to them. The phrase that Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche used was,
  &quot; These difficulties are manure for <i>bodhi</i>, manure for awakening or
  enlightenment.&quot; The most famous biographer of Sigmund Freud, Lou Andre Salome, at one
  point in the introduction wrote a statement -- This is a paraphrase. I didn't have it to
  look up but I basically remember it -- When we look at the life of a great person, rather
  than condemn their faults and weaknesses, should we not be grateful and awestruck that
  such light could shine through in spite of them.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's a very different spirit of relating to difficulties,
  when seeing them as who we are, to see that there is some light of our being, of our
  wisdom, of our heart, that can shine through even in the midst of these, even in spite of
  them.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As we talked about hindrances and difficulties before we
  found that mostly as they arise they're based on stories we tell ourselves -- he did, she
  did, they did, I wish, if only -- and as we begin to look at the nature of mind, we can
  see what storytellers we are. I mean, I'm a storyteller by profession. In part, that's
  what I do. But I don't think I'm the only storyteller in the room. It goes on and on
  inside there.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The stories do a couple of things. They make us right,
  they make us feel better, they justify, they make us feel more comfortable, and they also
  help us to avoid feeling things that we don't want to feel, or facing things that are just
  here in front of us. These hindrances, in a sense, are an avoidance of what is present in
  the reality of the moment.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One philosopher wrote:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Millions of people long for immortality who do not know
    what to do with themselves on a rainy Sunday afternoon.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's nice to have visions of eternal peace or whatever
  one's spiritual ends might be, but in fact, it's really more about facing our life each
  day, each hour, and each moment.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">How can we relate when these different forces arise during
  the day? Here are a number of strategies one can work with in meditation and in one's
  daily life. The first and the major way to relate in terms of skillfulness is to identify
  with the present and to become mindful of it, whether it's fear, judgment, anger or
  desire. If you want to, you can work with mental notes or labels, &quot;fear, fear,
  judging, judging, anger, anger, irritated, irritated,&quot; not just when you're sitting
  on a cushion, but try it if you're in an argument with somebody, or if you're feeling
  frustrated over something, or if you feel very confused one morning, note, &quot;Okay,
  I'll look at this and label it, 'confused, confused,'&quot; and see what that experience
  is like. To pay attention to it means to let yourself experience what arises in the body,
  in the feelings, and in the mind, all of them. Confusion might arise and there will be a
  physical sense with it. It will arise and there will be a certain feeling, a state of
  being confused. There will be a quality of pleasant or unpleasant. In most cases it will
  probably be unpleasant. There also might be an aversion or judgment, &quot;I shouldn't be
  confused. I wish it would go away.&quot; If you try to make it go away, what happens?
  Anybody ever try it? It generally gets worse, plus which you add more judgment, &quot;I
  shouldn't be judging, I shouldn't be confused, I'm really not doing it right, if only this
  would go away,&quot; and all of a sudden you have four more judgments on top of the first
  one.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There was a person at a retreat who came to me because she
  noticed in her mind that in most everything she did there was a voice of judgment. So I
  asked her in a simple way, a 15-second psychotherapy, what were the first names of her
  parents. It turns out to be this person and that. Did that voice in her mind remind her of
  either of those? It could have been someone else, but in this case it happened to be her
  mother. She grew up in an Italian family. I said, &quot;Alright, every time you hear that
  voice saying you're not doing it right or you should do more, or whatever, first of all,
  count the judgments for awhile just to see them.&quot; She tried that and she was still
  fighting with them. I said, &quot;Alright, say 'Thank you, Mom.' Whenever that voice
  comes, you should do a little bit more, you should get that better, 'Thank you,
  Mom.'&quot; She said, &quot;That's not really right because I called her 'Mama' and I
  would have spoken to her in Italian. It's more like 'grazie, Mama.'&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">She wrote this note after a couple of days of trying it.</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dear Jack:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The judging process and saying, &quot;Grazie, Mama,&quot;
    was very useful and even became amusing. At one point the judging process of mind seemed
    to be a giant web of interconnected judgments. Once I started counting them, there were so
    many. I counted during two sittings all told about 220. Many of them were repeats. But it
    got to be fun after awhile.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">She also had difficulty in walking meditation. She would
  get bored or frustrated. So I said, &quot;Instead of walking a little bit, do a long walk.
  Take an hour and a half or two hours and just walk back and forth and die. Whatever
  arises, you just keep walking.&quot;</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I also did the hour and a half walking this morning. It
    was proceeded by an hour sitting in dread anticipation, frustration, anger at you, and
    irritation at the upcoming walk. The walk itself was like all things, good and awful. The
    first 15 or 20 minutes I really got into it and thought, &quot;This isn't too bad.&quot;
    Then a lot of aversion came out, mostly impatience, then rage, then calmness, then sort of
    psychedelic nature stuff, then pride, lots and lots and lots of pride, over and over
    again, theN planning on what I'd write you in this note, then more pride, I did it so
    well, then back to my feet and legs and sensations, then irritation, then &quot;Grazie,
    Mama,&quot; again. Then it all started all over.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I noticed that most of my unawareness occurred during the
    time between sitting and walking, so I realized that's the place for me to focus on next
    in my practice.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Anyway, after ten years of sporadic vipassana, I touch for
    a moment into beginner's mind.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Grazie.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first spirit of it, whatever it is that you're dealing
  with, whether it's fear, whether it's judgment, whether it's anger, whether it's doubt or
  confusion, is just to begin to name it and identify it. You might find that it fits your
  habitual tendency like some people's tendency to move out of the present through desire
  all the time; others have a tendency through judgment or aversion or disliking; for others
  it might be through confusion. It's useful just to begin to be aware of what your habit
  is, what your strategy is. Basically, it's a strategy to deal with what's uncomfortable.
  For certain people when it's uncomfortable there will come desire, for others there will
  be aversion, for some there will be spacing out and confusion. Begin to be aware of that
  and notice just what's there.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As you start to look, like our friend here, you see how
  amazingly frequent it is, how many mind moments we spend desiring, judging, irritated,
  sleepiness or doubting. It's really quite a lot. Has anybody ever noticed that? Then you
  say, &quot;Oh, my God, this is an impossible task. A little mindfulness to overcome all of
  that?&quot; But it's really universal. It was true in Egypt 2,000 years ago, and it was
  true in India 2,500 years ago with the Buddha, and it's true in the monasteries on Mt.
  Athos, it's true in the Zen temples of Japan, and it's true in Fairfax, San Raphael,
  Sausalito, Berkeley. It's the same thing. It's really universal and it's just part of what
  the mind does.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There's a book that I've been reading on three-year olds
  and it's entitled, <i>Three-Year Old, Friend or Enemy</i>. It is written by a well-known
  psychologist writing on this particular stage. Three-year-olds have a lot of aggression
  and a lot of testing of limits and a lot of periods where they regress and get very needy
  and they go through all these things. I see myself in her, it's not just that she does
  that, but there she is acting out all this stuff that I find in myself. There are times
  when I just get completely frustrated with her and want to just throw her out the window.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I remember teaching at Esalen and there was a whole group
  of us in one large room. There was some conversation about spiritual life. One of the
  people there had their child. It was a young two- or three-year-old who was crying and
  making a lot of noise, being very difficult at that particular time, and finally just
  started to wail and cry. The mother picked it up and carried him out of the room, and
  there was this kind of, &quot;Ahh,&quot; a relief of everybody in the room. One woman
  among the many who had children, just said exactly that. She said, &quot;Do you remember
  the time when you really just wanted to pick them up and throw them out the window, and
  you didn't care how far down it was to the street?&quot; Everybody in the room who had
  children laughed because they all remembered that moment. It's not that you do it, mind
  you, but that it just comes along with everything else that arises.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What you need to do is to see that it's human and begin to
  look at it directly anyway, to label it, to acknowledge, &quot;Well, there it is, there's
  aversion, there's irritation, there's judgment, there's confusion&quot; or &quot;there's
  fear.&quot; Actually, when we see it truly, the moment that we can name it, it's like we
  turn around and face it rather than being caught or running away. We say, &quot;Oh, I know
  you.&quot; Maybe it's the dark night instead of psychosis, or maybe it's just boredom
  after being with a person for some years. Instead of saying, &quot;Oh, I've got the wrong
  relationship&quot; or the wrong marriage, when you don't face it, it seems much bigger and
  worse, but when you turn around and actually look at it, it's not as bad as it seemed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That's the first step. Things become workable when you
  simply acknowledge what that energy is that has arisen in that time in your life, in your
  practice. To work with these forces, in addition to naming them and being aware of them,
  you really have to let yourself touch them with your heart. It's not just to name it, but
  somehow it's to let it in, to let yourself connect with it from a place of tenderness or
  caring, somehow to make friends with it or at least not to be upset or judgmental of it,
  whatever it is.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you find that there's anger, or fear, or desire, maybe
  it's your food craving, and you eat over and over again, and you say, &quot;Oh, I wish I
  didn't do it,&quot; or maybe it's the way you treat your body in some other fashion, maybe
  it's the relationship with some person in your life, you look at it and say, &quot;Ugh, I
  hate that.&quot; See if you can acknowledge what that state is. Is it judgment, is it
  aversion, is it dislike, is it fear, and then in acknowledging it, send some loving
  kindness, send some <i>metta</i> to it or embrace it. Let your heart connect with it as if
  it were a poor down-trodden dog or something like that, that generally whenever it came
  you kicked it, and instead you are going to be nice to it today and touch it in some way
  with more tenderness. If we can't let things into our heart, we don't really let ourselves
  grow and there is still some sense of aversion or trying to get over them or rid of them.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">See it and identify it, let yourself be touched by it
  without pushing it away, and as you open to it, notice its nature and then study it as if
  you were a botanist or a biologist. It's a part of the nature of mind. It's what every
  mind does. Every mind doubts, every mind gets restless, every mind gets confused, every
  mind judges. Anybody who doesn't have all of those things? Not a single person back there.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So you look at its nature. When does it begin? What's the
  middle of it? How intense does it get? What's its end like? Is there something you want to
  learn about? What's the most powerful point of it? What are the body sensations like, if
  you want to learn to deal with this particular energy? What triggers it, what's the
  thought or the image that generally comes right before it? What's the story line that goes
  along with it? There you are driving and you're annoyed by some driver for doing something
  for the umpteenth time. What's the story that goes through your mind? &quot;California
  drivers are this . . .&quot; or &quot;People who drive on the road should . . .&quot; or
  what is it? Just look at not only what the event is but what's that inner thing that
  triggers it. See what the story is. Just look at it, and then ask yourself one other
  question. Who is making up the story? Very useful question at that moment. It's really
  beginning to observe the movement or the dance of the mind.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is called, &quot;The Cosmic Dance&quot; or in other
  traditions, &quot;The Dance of Shiva,&quot; or &quot;The Dance of Maya.&quot;</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The restless waters of the lake appear to make the moon
    dance.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's our own storytelling that makes things move. You pay
  attention and you watch its beginning, its end, its nature, what it feels like in the
  body, if it is painful, if it is pleasant. If you want to learn, if you have some
  hindrance or difficulty in your life that you want to learn about, particularly study the
  moment when it just ends. Suppose it's desire. We'll take a simple one. You have a desire
  for something you want to eat. Maybe you have a chocolate craving, and you decide to go
  out and get an extraordinary triple fudge Swiss chocolate cake, or whatever it is, and you
  fantasize and you imagine, and finally you get to that place that specializes in catering
  to people just like you. They know you're coming and they put all the extras on, and there
  it is. Instead of just going for the cake, this time you're going to watch. You feel the
  desire in the body, you watch the salivation in the mouth, you imagine the pictures and
  the satisfaction. You really let yourself look at it and you feel it. It's tense. In that
  very craving, there's a certain amount of tension and pain. That's alright, you're going
  to get it satisfied. You get in your car, you go to the ultimate bakery and you get that
  thing. You don't even take it to your car. You sit down at the table, you take your first
  bite, and then all of a sudden there's this whole shift that happens in your body. From
  this place of tension, it all just softens and relaxes. That chocolate touches your tongue
  and it melts some in your mouth, it tastes delicious, it's really good. At that point, it
  almost doesn't matter whether you have any more than that. That's probably just about
  enough. If you watch, the desire moves at that moment and the desire ends. Why is that?
  Anybody have an answer? Because the great happiness of it is not just the pleasure,
  although there's pleasure and that comes from sense delight, a certain happiness, but the
  great happiness comes because the desire ends.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you want to learn something really powerful about the
  mind or about particular energies that are arising in your life, whether it's in relation
  to food, people, love, work, look at it and discover what happens at the moment in your
  mind when that anger, that confusion, that doubt at a certain moment ends -- it is a very,
  very interesting place to study. There is where you learn a lot about its nature.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It doesn't happen easily. Whatever this is, it requires
  practice. How many times have these states arisen in our lives? Countless, unbelievable
  number of times. So you practice. Maybe you start with little ones. Remember that quote of
  William Blake?</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If one is to do good,<br>
    it must be done in the minute particulars.<br>
    General good is the plea of the hypocrite,<br>
    the scoundrel and the flatterer.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To do anything well, it has to be done here immediately,
  in this moment, rather than with some ideal -- &quot;I'll get rid of this,&quot; or
  &quot;I'll change the world.&quot; How do we actually relate to our family, to the people
  nearest to us, to our coworkers, to the people that we encounter in the day, or to the
  immediate circumstances of our life? I regret to say this about Mr. Blake, but I also have
  a quote from Catherine, his wife, who was asked about William, particularly about the
  quality of his company. She replied:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I regret to say I have very little of Mr. Blake's company.
    He's always busy in paradise</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some person who I know whom I will not name said:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you really want to know about a master, a Zen master or
    otherwise, talk to their spouse.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Actually, this was a woman. She said, &quot;Talk to their
  wife,&quot; but there are a number of female Zen masters. That's really where you learn
  about yourself, and that's also where you learn about what it means to be free. It's not
  in the theory but in the nitty-gritty, in the little things. In traffic, as I said, when
  somebody cuts you off or does some idiotic thing which only a human being could do, and
  they do it, that's the place that you learn. You have that argument with your lover or
  your husband. Maybe you come home and you know you want to argue. Have you ever seen that
  one? If you look at it, there is a desire to make contact, but not too close. It's sort of
  a safe way to make a connection and still keep some distance at the same time, or maybe to
  discharge something because you're grumpy at someone else, or some other reason. These are
  very interesting places to learn about our minds, to learn about how things operate.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The desire to be right, you might just listen for that
  voice. I don't know if any of you have that. I just love to be right, it feels so good to
  be right. Do you know what I mean? You notice that voice that comes, and you feel its
  quality, what's it like in the body, what does it do in that moment to the relationship,
  and what is the sense of self that is built around that story that I'm right and therefore
  somebody else is not. You look at it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This isn't anything new, is it? There's nothing new in
  tonight's talk. It's really old stuff. Here it is again. It's the nature of mind, and
  we're learning to relate to mind in a friendly, compassionate and wise way, not to stomp
  it out or get rid of it. You need it for certain things, like planning a few things here
  and there, writing once in awhile. It has its place.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What is interesting is watching as you begin to allow
  yourself to look at these energies and not just act them out habitually. You might just
  pick one for the next week or two. Pick one hindrance or difficulty in your life and study
  it. Maybe we can have a little botany lab work here. At the end of a couple of weeks we
  could have a meeting and we'll share. We'll have a little time and people can share which
  particular hindrance they picked and what they learned about it as they observed it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As you look you also discover that each has a beautiful
  side. Isn't that interesting, that each has some creative energy locked up in it? For
  example, the Tibetans talk about those forces of greed, hatred and delusion, in terms of
  Buddha families or types of personality energies -- if you will, archetypes. The <i>padma</i>
  energy, which is that of greed and seduction, when one learns to work with it and doesn't
  get quite so personally caught up in it, turns instead to incredible creativity and a
  beautiful sense of esthetics and beauty that's not oriented toward manipulation or
  grasping but can be part of something creative and skillful. Or the <i>vajra</i> type of
  mind which is in its negative or its difficult aspect portrayed as cold, hard, judgmental,
  and seeing what's wrong with everything, when one learns to work with that energy and open
  it and not be so afraid and learns how to use it skillfully, it becomes transformed into
  what's called &quot;discriminating wisdom.&quot; Instead of being something that's
  undermining, it's the clarity of mind to see exactly what is going on and to know how to
  relate to it wisely. It is depicted as the sword which cuts through all illusion and all
  nonsense. Similarly, the Buddha family type which is associated with delusion and being
  spaced out, not being so present, avoiding things, when one learns to work with that
  energy and allows it without getting caught in the story, it moves to a place of great
  peacefulness, of spaciousness, of a kind of mirror-like quality which can receive
  everything in the world without doing battle with it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What if these things are strong, what if desire, fear,
  anger, judgment and so forth, are very strong, and it's really too hard to pay attention,
  how can you work with them? There are five traditional strategies that are also listed as
  ways to work with them.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first strategy is called, &quot;Letting it go.&quot;
  It arises, you see it, and you just let it go. Terrific if you can do it. The thing is it
  is not so easy to do. There's also a danger in it that letting go of the judgment, or the
  desire, or the fear, or whatever, often gets twisted in our minds a little bit until it
  becomes, &quot;I can't wait to let go of this,&quot; which is to say, &quot;I can't wait
  to get rid of it.&quot; It becomes an aversion, &quot;I don't like that.&quot; A better
  phrase for it is to &quot;let it be,&quot; better than &quot;letting go,&quot; more the
  quality of &quot;letting be.&quot; To be mindful and just see it, see that &quot;it's
  mine,&quot; and let it into the heart rather than resisting it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What is interesting if you let things be is first of all
  they come and go on their own. It's quite terrific if you really watch them. They do that
  all by themselves. Secondly, if you pay attention and you really let them be and let them
  in, what you see is not so much greed, hatred, delusion, desire or restlessness. Even
  those, deep though they are, are something more superficial or on some medium level, and
  underneath what you touch when those arise is pain, emptiness, loneliness, fear, some
  grief or sorrow, or some kind of contraction. All those things arise as a strategy to not
  feel something.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you let them be, it's not only to let that state be,
  but to really open yourself to feel what is present, and to soften your heart enough so
  that you can get just to the bottom of it, whatever that particular energy is, and that's
  what begins to heal you. That's what begins to allow you to work with it in a different
  way. That's the first strategy. Suppose that doesn't work, what other ones can you use?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There's a second one. That first strategy is like turning
  the poison into something valuable, into insight. That's the strategy of making it into a
  useful medicine. A second strategy is one of balance. For example, if there is a great
  deal of desire, you can reflect on the brevity of life, on death and impermanence, and
  think, &quot;Is this something I really want?&quot; or &quot;What really matters to me? If
  I only had another month or another six months to live, what would I be wanting to do with
  my body, heart and mind? How would I want to live?&quot; Very often it puts desires into
  perspective. The balance for doubt is faith, to seek out some inspiration. If there's
  confusion and doubt, to read something or to speak with someone -- it just reminds you of
  another part of yourself that's a counter to that ,so then you come into enough balance to
  watch it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The balance for anger and judgment -- and it's a difficult
  one -- is forgiveness. You can't do it too soon, but some time when you're ready. At first
  you can extend maybe a little, and then maybe a little more, with forgiveness to yourself
  or to another person. You can work with forgiveness when the anger is too strong to just
  observe.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The balance to sleepiness or laziness is to do those
  things which raise energy.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This set of strategies, if it's too strong, you can kind
  of cool it out a little by raising energy when you feel yourself being too sleepy or dull,
  or by working with forgiveness when the anger is too strong to just observe.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third strategy is suppression. Very interesting that
  this should be listed in here. It is generally talked about as a bad thing. You don't want
  to suppress things because it makes you sick and it just comes out some other way anyway.
  This is like the old adage of counting to ten when something is difficult. You just stop
  and you count to ten.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I'll give you a better example. Suppose you are a surgeon
  and you're in the middle of having an argument with your husband. You're on call that day
  and your beeper goes off. He did something, and you're quite upset. It's time to go the
  hospital. You get in your car and drive right over. Someone is lying on the table and they
  need open heart surgery. You get scrubbed, you get your gloves on, and you're about to do
  surgery. That's not a very good place to ruminate and think about that argument and try
  and finish it up. That's a very good place to put it aside and just complete your task of
  surgery and wait until there is a skillful place, a place that's the right container,
  where it feels safe, where there's the support or the time to let yourself solve it.
  Sometimes it is a skillful strategy, when something is very strong, to put it aside,
  especially if you're willing to say, &quot;I will come back to it when a better or a safer
  opportunity arises after this circumstance is over.&quot; It requires patience.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There's letting things be and being aware of them, that's
  the first one. Bringing some balance is the second. The third strategy is suppress them if
  necessary or put them aside for awhile. The fourth is sublimation, taking the energy and
  transforming it into something else.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The traditional example, if you're very angry, is to take
  that and do something useful with it, to go and chop the firewood that you need for the
  woodstove for the winter and get some of it out of your system, let go of it and also do
  something useful. That's externally. Internally, you can work with it in the same way. For
  example, if there is a lot of lust and sexual desire that's really compulsive, just as you
  can move it outwardly, you can also through some practice move the energy in your body and
  take it from being just sexual up into your chest and heart in some way that the desire is
  still there but it is transformed more into the desire to be loved or to love or to
  connect in some way. It is to find some other outlet for it that is skillful.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The last of these categories is the most interesting and
  dangerous one They actually get more dangerous as you go down the list because suppression
  is dangerous if you don't work it out later, and sublimation is dangerous also or can be
  because it can be an avoidance. The most dangerous, but also the most interesting, is the
  category where you exaggerate it. If you haven't learned, it is, &quot;Alright, let's do
  it; let's look at it.&quot; I don't mean particularly if it is going to be harmful to
  someone. There are two ways to do this. First is just put in your mind Part A, where you
  take that desire or anger, whatever it is, and you imagine taking it to its extreme. What
  would you do? How far can you imagine taking it? Instead of resisting it, you play it out
  to the umpteenth degree. The only way that this is a spiritual practice is if you do it
  and you pay attention. If you do it and you're not very mindful, then it is reinforcing it
  and pretty soon you'll go after that unconsciously. It can be done very skillfully. If you
  have that desire or that anger, imagine what you would do to that person. If you have a
  desire and imagine getting it a hundred times as elaborate as can be -- see what it's
  like. There, you've ended the 100th time, and how do you feel? There you are in the same
  place. Does it arise again? Can you really see that it's endless if you just try to
  fulfill it?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second part, Part B, is to actually act it out, which
  we do all the time anyway. It's nothing terrible to say that most of the time we act on
  our desires, and that's fine. Even for these difficult ones, go out and indulge that
  thing, whatever it is, see, but just do it by paying attention as well, and learn from it
  -- not just automatically.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The story I usually tell with this is one of Munindra,
  Joseph Goldstein's teacher in India, who had this incredible craving for Indian sweets,
  particularly for gulabjaman. Gulabjaman are so sweet, they're in this sugar water and they
  make baklava seem like dry toast. He loved them. After each meal he would want to go and
  have his gulabjaman. Finally, he was tired of this craving, so he went into town, brought
  some money with him, and he ordered something like 20 or 30 rupees of gulabjaman, this
  enormous plate full of it. He sat down. I don't know how far he got into it, but I don't
  think he could eat very much before he started getting really sick, and certainly sick of
  gulabjaman. After that he said he could take it or leave it, as one would say.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you're going to do it, okay, pay attention. At least
  learn from it. As one Zen master said:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This life is a series of mistakes. True practice is one
    continuous mistake, one after another anyway.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The only difference is that you pay attention so you learn
  from it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I hope you can hear in going through these strategies of
  letting it be, of observing it, feeling it in the body, of noticing what the loneliness or
  pain or fear or contraction is out of which it comes, of sublimating it or transforming it
  in some way, or even acting it out and observing it, that if you're willing to do it with
  the experience or particular hindrance in your life, it starts to make the practice quite
  alive. That is where it becomes juicy, where you learn from it. It frees a tremendous
  energy. Instead of running away or acting habitually, you start to evoke and allow this
  inner energy that's been bound up in these patterns to be understood and to become more a
  part of your conscious being.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In all of these, in all of them, what's important is to
  learn to watch the movement of mind, the mind that wants to close or is afraid, that wants
  to defend itself or to avoid opening to the fact of whatever is actually here, to the
  &quot;just this much&quot; of the moment, to the spaciousness of it or the meaningless of
  it in certain moments, or the emptiness of it, or the birth and death of it, the loss, and
  the next thing that comes.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The whole process of working with these states of mind and
  these energies, is to finally learn to come to rest, to open to this moment, one after
  another, as it is, and find a kind of stillness that allows for all the coming and going
  of the ten thousand joys and the ten thousand sorrows, and it brings an ease and humanness
  and compassion.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I close by reading a letter. This is from one of
  Munindra's students, a woman who was in a prisoner of war camp in Europe during World War
  II, and involved at that time in very painful and horrible things that were happening in
  the war camps in Europe. She finally escaped as a teenager at the end of the war and moved
  to Australia. She wrote him this letter after doing some years of meditation practice. She
  said:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A few weeks ago I was sorting out old files with notes and
    stories and thoughts which I had written down over the years. Reading through them before
    destroying them, I was more amazed than I have ever been in my life of so much misery and
    unhappiness. How is it possible that a human being could live for 55 years through so much
    fear, despair, unhappiness, morbidity, depression, pain, suffering, and not be utterly
    destroyed by it? I must have been stronger than I thought. And when I look back over the
    past four years, since the first time I came to practice in India, life has become simple
    and so serene that it's unbelievable.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">She's a very fine yogi. She is one of Munindra's greatest
  students.</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After reaching the first deep stages in my mental
    development, I lost my depression. My headaches, fears and nightmares went away, and after
    doing deep practice for another year, during my second visit to you, I don't even
    understand anymore what all the fuss was about, those first 55 years of my life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I just live life as it is and as it comes in a calm
    wholeness with some equanimity and I find myself content with whatever arises. Sometimes I
    meditate, sometimes I don't meditate at all, but you see my life has become more of a
    meditation because I try to live each minute of the day in mindfulness and openness, and
    somehow nothing seems to be able to touch me in the same way anymore. It's like living on
    two levels. The outer level to make conversation with people and say the right things at
    the right time, but under that is a second level where there is a core of untouched and
    untouchable stillness, of quiet attention and peace, because somehow life is so simple,
    uncomplicated, and all those old upheavals were after all really just of my own making,
    weren't they. You only get upheaval through the ways you react to things, and once you
    react the right way, the direct and simple way, there aren't problems left, and somehow
    the right way of reacting is most of the time not reacting at all.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I hope this makes some sense to you. I'll tell you a
    little story to show you what an enormous success you are as a teacher.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I think her success was that she had suffered so deeply in
  some way that she brought that strength and that genuineness that had gotten her through
  that to her spiritual life. She said:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A few months ago the man who I love more than any in the
    world, and who was for the past 17 years as close to me as any man and woman could be,
    died rather suddenly. If that had happened before you started to teach me, I'm sure it
    would have completely destroyed me. I would have committed a quick suicide and ended it
    all. But now of course I felt sorrow about losing this man's close love for me and I
    missed his company, but for the rest, a stone thrown in the water would have caused more
    ripples than his death.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I accepted his death with an amazing serenity and
    detachment. He's just finished this life trip of his and they have already started another
    one. I don't know that, but apart from this personal loss and his companionship, there
    isn't the kind of upset and conflict in me about death. I am not afraid as I used to be.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Apparently I've always been able to see and understand
    other people's problems and help them somehow, but in the old days other people's miseries
    tore out my heart and gave me stomach ulcers in my pity and concern for them. But now when
    people come to see me with their miseries, I can listen to them, sometimes help them, and
    have a much deeper compassion, but when they leave, it's over and done with, and they
    haven't torn my guts out in the process.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I've been working with an alcoholic this past month or so,
    and for some odd reason my willingness to listen seems to help him in his struggle to stay
    away from alcohol and find his true spirit again.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I think you can be proud of yourself as a teacher and
    content with me as your pupil.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is something really wonderful and joyful about
  working even with the pains and difficulties in one's life and mind, for that moment when
  you realize, &quot;For that little thing, I don't have to take it so seriously. I really
  can be free to touch that.&quot; It makes practice wonderful.</font></p>
