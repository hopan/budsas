The Eightfold Noble Path<br>
-- Right Action</font></h2>
</font>

<hr WIDTH="100%" ALIGN="center" SIZE="8" NOSHADE>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fourth step of the Eightfold Path, Right Action, is
  traditionally taught as the major aspect of the precepts. Its fundamental quality is <i>ahimsa</i>
  in Sanskrit, or non-harming. It means acting in such a way that we don't harm other
  beings. Gandhi said:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To come to the heart of consciousness or of truth one must
    be able to love the meanest creature as oneself. And those that think that religion has
    nothing to do with politics do not know what religion really means.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To live in this complicated society in a political,
  economic and social reality, a major part of our spiritual practice is how we relate to
  all the other people and all the other beings around us, non-harming. It sounds so simple,
  and yet we look at the world around us, and there are currently on the planet between 40
  and 50 wars, there are approximately 60 countries or more that Amnesty International lists
  as places where people are tortured and put in prison for their views; religious,
  political, social views. Even in countries where that doesn't happen so much and there
  isn't war, there's a lot of harm being inflicted from one person or one being to another.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So we need to begin to inquire, why does this harm happen?
  Why do we hurt people? Have you ever hurt anyone in your life in some fashion or other?
  Perhaps there's no one in the room who could not think of some instance. Why do we do it?
  Have you ever looked? If we want to become conscious and learn the meaning of <i>ahimsa</i>
  or harmlessness, let's see if we can figure out why we harm. For some people, if you look
  or you inquire very deeply, you see that the moment you would hurt someone else through
  your actions, or your words, you're in pain.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we really look at it, a lot of the source is our own
  pain, maybe not all, and I don't want to explain it completely, but to just say some
  things for you to look into: Do we ever hurt people when we're not really in pain
  ourselves? And the pain that we have generates fear -- we're afraid of some more pain or
  we're afraid of some pain we've experienced in the past. We're afraid of the pain of
  hunger, or the pain of loss, or the pain of denial, or the pain of some other kind of
  thing. So fear gets generated.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then out of our fear comes aggression. It can be the
  aggression of hatred, or the aggression of greed, of grasping -- to try to keep us safe,
  to get what we need so we won't have to experience pain. So we look at our hearts. Anybody
  who really meditates deeply sees that within us is rage and fear and greed and cruelty.
  Has anyone meditated for a long time and not seen cruelty in themselves, that capacity to
  be cruel? And there also is love, joy, tenderness, and compassion, and all of the virtues
  of Jesus and the great bodhisattvas. It's all in there.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We're talking about non-harming now. One part is that we
  see that we have aggression, hatred, and greed, and it comes from fear, and that's
  generated from pain. What's the route of that, what's the route of all that? Maybe the
  route is a very simple thing, deep but very simple. The sense of &quot;me,&quot; of
  &quot;mine,&quot; of separateness. &quot;I have this, I want this, I want to keep this
  body, this sensation, this feeling, this way of being.&quot; And out of that comes fear,
  or out of that comes identification, pain; then fear.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we want to learn about Right Action and non-harming, we
  need to look at this sense of self, of &quot;I&quot;, and we need to look at our own pain.
  We need to see how we separate ourselves. Who in the world do you consider &quot;we&quot;
  and who do you consider &quot;them?&quot; Are the Russians &quot;them,&quot; are the
  Republicans &quot;them,&quot; are the Democrats &quot;them,&quot; are women
  &quot;them,&quot; are men &quot;them,&quot; are poor people &quot;them,&quot; are rich
  people &quot;them,&quot; are angry people &quot;them,&quot; or spiritual people
  &quot;us,&quot; or non-spiritual people &quot;us&quot;? Wherever there's that sense of
  &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them,&quot; it's like an extension of &quot;I,&quot;
  &quot;me,&quot; &quot;mine.&quot;. It's now &quot;we,&quot; &quot;us,&quot;
  &quot;ours,&quot; and &quot;them&quot; and they're different. And then it becomes possible
  to harm.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">From the Tibetan lama Kalu Rinpoche:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">You live in the illusion and appearance of things.<br>
    There is a reality, but you do not know this.<br>
    You are that reality.<br>
    When you understand this,<br>
    you will see that you are nothing,<br>
    and being nothing,<br>
    you are everything.<br>
    That is all.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Very simple teaching. Very profound and deep.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The basis for virtue, for Right Action, is both mystical
  and practical, in that it comes truly from non-harming; it comes out of a sense of our
  connectedness with one another, and with all of life. It's mystical and practical, and it
  ties those levels of our experience together.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha taught the path to happiness through body,
  through speech, through the heart, through the mind -- altogether. And the tools he gave
  were those of virtue, of learning how to speak, and acting kindly and wisely, of
  generosity, of learning how to give and love, so we'll be happier. Virtue makes us
  happier; acting honestly and truly, and non-harming makes us happier, generosity makes us
  happy, and then meditation, calming of the mind and opening of the heart. All of these
  parts are the path and bring a certain joy, a certain strength to our practice.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">These are the instructions the Buddha gave the people who
  understood his teachings:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Go forth, O monks, for the gain of the many, for the
    welfare of many and compassion for the world, for the good, the gain, the welfare of all
    beings. Proclaim, O monks, the glorious Dharma and treat your life of holiness, perfect
    and pure.&quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">For householders, which is what we are as a group, our
  main practice is virtue. You could say our main practice is awareness, but the main
  teachings are working with virtue, which means working with how we act in the world since
  we are not renunciates; how we speak and act with one another, to learn to be grounded in <i>ahimsa</i>
  or non-harming. In discovering the uprightness of heart and action, there's a real
  strength that comes to us.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Dhammapada, the very first verses of the Buddha,
  it's said:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One person on the battlefield conquers<br>
    an army of a thousand men,<br>
    another conquers themselves<br>
    and they are the greater.<br>
    Conquer yourself, not others,<br>
    discipline yourself and learn<br>
    true freedom.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There's not only a sense of joy that comes from living an
  honest and straightforward life, but there's a power to it. Power is wonderful if it's
  used properly. There's a strength and a power to living honestly.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The element of Right Action or virtue really holds two
  parts to it; one is the non-harming which we'll call &quot;restraint&quot;; and the other
  is the positive side, not that of restraining oneself, but of caring or acting, which we
  call compassion or love.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the shortest talk the Buddha ever gave, someone asked,
  &quot;Give me the gist of your teachings real simply.&quot; He said, &quot;Fine. Refrain
  from that which is unskillful or that which harms; do good, and purify your heart.&quot;
  That's it!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The teaching of the heart and the training of it is to
  begin to learn how to care for all that we do with our world. My teacher Achaan Chaa loved
  to talk about virtue. He would give talks to the villagers week after week about it. You
  would think, God, he'd get bored. He doesn't want to talk about <i>nirvana</i>, or
  enlightenment, or the <i>Abhidharma</i> (Buddhist psychology), all the different mental
  states, no. He loved virtue. He loved virtue the way people love trees or air or their
  loved ones. He just thought it was the most marvelous, wonderful thing. And it is
  actually, it's fantastic. It's not talked about in our culture; we forget it. It's in the
  Ten Commandments, and it's in the churches. If we kept the first Commandments, maybe one
  of the commandments not to kill, maybe not even the Buddhist precept of not killing any
  life, but just half a precept not to kill people, what an amazingly different world it
  would be. Can you imagine a world in which people didn't kill each other? It sounds like
  such a horrible thing. I mean, we're not going to go and murder somebody, right? But yet
  what a transformed planet it would be for just half a precept. He loved virtue because
  they're so wonderful. It has the power to transform us.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let's look at the traditional precepts one at a time. The
  first one is not to kill. That's the restraint side of it. It means non-hatred, non-acting
  on our aversion, not to kill people, not to kill animals, not even to kill little things
  if we can avoid it. Someone says, &quot;Well, what does that mean, 'if we can avoid
  it?&quot; You have to figure that out. But it means to live lightly on the earth, to take
  care with all the life around us. At many retreats I use that cartoon from the New Yorker
  of the two deer on the hillside, the hunter is down below, and the deer are talking to one
  another and saying, &quot;Why don't they thin their own goddamned herd?&quot; It's not a
  problem with the deer, as far as I can tell in this world. There are too many somethings
  but it's not deer. We get all of these excuses and concepts about it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To non-harm, to not kill, first we have to look at our
  mind states. Can you kill even little things, even insects, without there being some
  aversion? There's hatred, &quot;I don't like it, let's get rid of it.&quot; That's a
  little bit of it. But the principle or it is to begin to connect and care for life and see
  that it's interconnected, that it's not separate. To refrain from killing means you have
  to look at your mind states. If you're about to kill even a little thing, look and see if
  there's an alternative, or look and see if there isn't aversion or hatred, just a little
  bit of it. It's only a small thing, so it doesn't take a lot. Begin to study your heart
  and your mind, and see what it really means to take care with your action.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That's one side, not to kill. The other side is a
  cultivation. The negative is to refrain; the positive is the cultivation of care and
  reverence for all life, of seeing the interconnectedness. We need insects; we need sea
  creatures; we need krill, those tiny shrimp-like things by the billions in the ocean near
  Antarctica. They feed the other creatures in the sea. It has a whole effect on keeping the
  air and the whole environment workable for all the rest of the beings. We need bees.
  Without bees flowers wouldn't be pollinated, and we couldn't eat a lot of our food -- and
  plants and trees wouldn't be able to reproduce, and the planet would be denuded. We need
  earthworms to aerate the soil.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I was at a conference once at the Menninger Foundation,
  and there were all these psychologists talking about hooking Tibetan lamas up to
  electrodes and what they could learn from that, and that kind of stuff. One of the people
  at the conference was an old Indian medicine man named Mad Bear from the Iroquois tribe in
  New York, the Iroquois Nation. He said, &quot;It's my turn to speak. I don't want to tell
  you about experiments.&quot; He said, &quot;Please come with me, I want to do a prayer.
  And all of these psychiatrists and psychologists and researchers said, &quot;A prayer,
  huh?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We all went out and we held hands in this huge field in
  Kansas where you look as far as you can and you see nothing but just more fields. It's
  beautiful. And we held hands in a circle of about 40 people. And he started to chant, and
  then he started this prayer. The prayer lasted for 45 minutes. He said:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;First, I want to thank the wind, our brothers and
  sisters in the wind.&quot; He talked about how the wind came and it cleansed the air, and
  it moved the clouds, and it gave us fresh, sweet tasting oxygen and air to breathe, and
  how beautiful the wind was, how it touched our skin and it made us feel more alive, and it
  made the leaves and the trees move, how it brought rain into a season, and took it away
  when it was finished.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then he thanked the clouds. He spent five minutes thanking
  the clouds, blessing them. You would look up and you would see these clouds, and you
  developed this nice relationship with the clouds. Then he thanked the wheat and the
  growing plants, and he thanked the sun, and he thanked the earth, and he thanked the
  earthworms. He spent about three minutes on the earthworms. He said, &quot;Feel them under
  your feet, for all that they did to make our life possible. Our life is somehow connected
  with the earthworms.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he was done, what I realized was that his prayer was
  the most beautiful mindfulness meditation. We stood out in that field, and felt the wind,
  felt the heat of the sun, and felt our feet on the earth and the soil. You couldn't help
  but see that you were connected. We kind of forget it on Highway l0l, you know, but we
  are.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Out of this sense of connectedness naturally comes a
  compassion, a caring, an ecology, not because you're supposed to be ecological, but
  because you don't want to hurt a part of this that you're a part of; you don't want to
  hurt yourself; you don't want to hurt all the things that contribute to this planet. Like
  the astronauts looking way back from the moon and seeing this tiny little sphere the size
  of your thumb at arms length -- it's blue, it's really fragile, and it's very small, and
  it has this thin layer of life on it, 8,000 miles of rock, and maybe six or twelve or
  fifteen feet of life. It's sort of like this little green layer of algae on the earth, and
  it's very precious.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The precept of not killing is both not to kill and also to
  sense, to connect with the life around us, with <i>gaia</i>, the fact that the earth is
  alive, and we're a part of that movement.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next one is not to steal. The same thing. It's a
  restraint. If not killing was a restraint of not harming through hatred, not stealing is
  non-greed. There was non-hatred, now there's non-greed, not coveting or grasping. Don't
  take what isn't given to you. Have you ever tried it? We all have. I used to steal a lot
  when I was young. I stole a lot, not even so young, in high school and college. I thought
  it was kind of fun to see what I could get away with. I was much worse than that actually.
  That's nothing. That's true. I wasn't a terrible delinquent, but I was a medium one, I was
  a middle class delinquent. In some ways they're worse because they have very little excuse
  for it. We all have done it at some time or another, taken what isn't given, fudging on
  this or that. I won't even say what &quot;this&quot; or &quot;that&quot; might be.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What does it do to your mind when you do that? It brings
  complexity, fear, paranoia, and worry. That's one of the beauties of virtue; it eliminates
  fear, paranoia and complexity. Hoarding and wars, and all of these things happen because
  we're afraid we don't have enough.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So again, not to steal, on one side as a restraint, means
  to look at your heart, and see what's there -- in the moment where it really isn't yours
  -- or where you fudged that thing, and see what it will do to your heart and mind, not
  because it's bad -- you can do anything you like in this world -- but because these are
  the laws of happiness, and that's how they work. Examine it yourself. It also has a
  positive side of cultivation, to cultivate a sensitivity for the resources that we share,
  not only not to take that which isn't given, but to see that the world is very limited,
  and there are five billion humans and lots of other animals, and to take care of what we
  use of the resources; they're limited.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Someone taught me this exercise of lying down on the earth
  at night, and looking up into the stars on a clear night, and then doing one little
  reversal of it. You lie back there on the grass or something, and you let yourself imagine
  that instead of lying on top of the earth, you're on the bottom, and that it's a big
  magnet that has you stuck against it, and you're looking down into space and the stars.
  It's a nice reversal because it gives you a sense of the infinity of the depth of space
  and all these spheres and things, and that somehow by the grace of gravity, you are stuck
  on here, and you don't fall off; To cultivate then, a responsibility for this planet that
  we're attached to, and that we're a part of.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Imagine if you walked through town or even walked in your
  yard, or wherever you are, as a caretaker, as a gardener, and then you extended it, from
  that place that you love to the Bay Area, or to the state, or to this country, or the
  planet; that you were a guardian or a caretaker of our beloved, the earth. What a
  wonderful way to walk on the earth. It means, if you come to something that's in the
  middle of the road, even if it's not your lane, it's a nice thing to pick it up, move it
  aside, because you care for the earth; not because you're supposed to, but because it
  brings joy.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Also, it means to cultivate in non-greed, in not stealing,
  Dharma, or giving. There are three traditional levels of giving: beggarly giving, where
  you give some; It's a way to practice and it's good. If you give anything it's nice,
  because what &quot;giving&quot; means is you're practicing being free, since you don't own
  it anyway. When you die, you give up much more than you could imagine you could give up
  before that. You're the accountant in the firm. You get to kind of count it for awhile and
  then it's taken away. The beggarly giving -- you give reluctantly. &quot;I don't think
  I'll use this. Maybe I should put it in the attic. No, better I should give it to
  Goodwill,&quot; and you give it and it feels good. And friendly giving is after you've
  practiced or this comes into you, and you give things that you care about to people as if
  they're your brothers and sisters. &quot;Here, let's share this,&quot; and it feels even
  better; it's wonderful. And kingly or queenly giving is when you so learn to enjoy the
  happiness of others when you give of your things, of your money, of your love, of your
  time, of your energy, because it's wonderful. You give your best, not because you're
  supposed to, but just because it brings such a sense of freedom and joy.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The villagers where I lived as a monk understood this,
  sometimes anyway. I used to feel strange because I lived in one little cave-forest
  monastery where the people were very poor. In the dry season there was rice, and tree
  leaves, and batmeat curry, and anything they could get to feed themselves in the dry
  season. And here I'd go as a rich American, because we're all rich by their standards of
  making $100 a year or something like that. And they'd give me food. At first I thought,
  &quot;This is really amazing; I can't do this; I can't take their food.&quot; And I
  thought about it, and talked to people about it, and realized for them it really was a
  privilege. They were saying when you came in the morning with your bowl, &quot;We so
  treasure and value what you represent as a monk, as a nun, as a meditator, as someone who
  is trying to cultivate a purity of heart and awareness; that we want to give of the little
  that we have to you to support that, because we want it in our world, and in our society,
  and in our life.&quot; It really was touching.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I'll read a couple of stories tonight from <i>The Tales of
  a Magic Monastery</i> by a Trappist monk who is a friend and a wonderful teacher. This is
  called The Pearl of Great Price:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He asked me what I was looking for,<br>
    &quot;Frankly,&quot; I said, &quot;I'm looking for the pearl of great price.&quot;<br>
    He slipped his hand into his pocket and<br>
    drew it out and gave it to me.<br>
    It was just like that.<br>
    I was dumbfounded.<br>
    Then I began to protest,<br>
    &quot;You don't want to give it to me.<br>
    Don't you want to keep it for yourself?<br>
    But, but --&quot; When I kept this up,<br>
    he said finally, &quot;Look, is it better to have the pearl<br>
    of great price or to give it away?&quot;<br>
    Well, now I have it.<br>
    I don't tell anyone.<br>
    For some though it would just be<br>
    disbelief and ridicule.<br>
    &quot;You have the great pearl of great price?&quot;<br>
    Others would be jealous because<br>
    someone might steal it.<br>
    Yes, I do have it but there's that question<br>
    that keeps coming back,<br>
    &quot;Is it better to have it or to give it away?&quot;<br>
    How long will that question rob me of my joy?</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To not kill, to not steal, which is to say is to cultivate
  reverence for life, a caring, and a generosity with all the things that we get and which
  go away anyway. Have you ever given anything away and for the most part regretted it much
  a while later? You forget you even had it. You do!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Restraint from sexual misconduct is a third precept.
  Again, it's non-greed, non-harming. Don't act sexually in those ways which hurt people.
  It's very straightforward. Traditionally it means adultery or incest or sexuality with
  minors. For the most part in our culture we don't know who is married anymore. It means
  that we have to look at our sexual actions and not do it where it's going to hurt
  somebody. It's that simple. It goes from harming to non-harming. Why do we harm? Out of
  our own pain, out of our greed, out of our need. When you look, it's out of pain.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There's a positive side that can be cultivated in this.
  Not only non-harming because sexuality is such a powerful force. Who in this room has not
  been an idiot about sexuality at some time in their life? Is there a person who dare
  speak? And who in this room hasn't experienced some hurt by it or some fear about it? It's
  powerful. That's why there's a precept about it. We can cultivate a positive side which is
  sexuality for householders, not for renunciates, or monks, or nuns. It can be associated
  on one side with compulsion, grasping, greed, and fear. You know that kind? On the other
  side, as a neutral energy, it can be associated with love, with tenderness, with
  communion, with intimacy, with a growing consciousness. So we can begin to cultivate an
  expression of tenderness.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Why is sex so powerful? It's powerful; you know that,
  right? Why? Well, one reason is that it's so close to birth and death. Birth comes out of
  it. They call &quot;orgasm&quot; death in French, &quot;petit mal&quot; -- it's the little
  death. It's powerful because it's close to our biological being, our incarnation. It's
  also powerful because of the union or the surrender of it. It's one of the few places in
  life where there's natural <i>samadhi</i>, where the mind becomes unified, and it's so
  fantastic -- not all the time, you know how sex is, but sometimes. When you stop thinking
  and you're there, it's like everything comes together, the body, the heart, the mind, and
  there's a sense of unity, a union, and then there's a transcendence or a going beyond
  oneself, a surrender, of touching something greater than yourself, of losing this prison
  of &quot;I, me, mine,&quot; and it's fantastic.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So we crave it then and unfortunately we get into
  attachment and greed. It's powerful, and for a good reason. I'm writing an article on it
  entitled, &quot;Do gurus have normal sex lives?&quot; and hopefully it will come out this
  fall. It's really about sexuality of gurus and teachers and disciples in many spiritual
  fields in the West. I won't talk so much about it tonight . There's a balance between
  indulgence and repression. On one side, you turn on the TV and it says, &quot;Indulge,
  indulge, that will make you happy.&quot; You've tried it. It doesn't work that way because
  you get it and it just reinforces your greed. Or on the other side, suppression/repression
  in combination. So that sexuality can cause pain or it can be associated with
  consciousness and love, and it's so powerful.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next precept of the four traditional ones that we'll
  cover tonight is drugs and intoxicants and alcohol; a different kind of precept. Again,
  it's the restraint-side. Not killing was non-hatred; not stealing was non-greed; no drugs
  or intoxicants to excess means non-delusion. Greed, hatred and delusion, the three roots
  of our suffering; grasping, aversion, and not seeing clearly. It means don't take
  intoxicants or drugs or alcohol to a point where you become heedless, where you lose your
  awareness. Awareness is really precious and it's hard to come by. If any of you have done
  a retreat, you know how hard it is to even get a few moments of it. It's precious to live
  in the present moment, to be alive. It doesn't mean don't have a glass of wine or
  whatever, but it means pay attention, don't harm yourself or the things around you by
  indulgence in a way that leads to carelessness or heedlessness or loss of consciousness.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That's the negative side. The positive side is that
  instead of that, we can find ways to cultivate the seeds of greater awareness or
  sensitivity. Look in your life at what it is that makes you more conscious. Rather than
  being less conscious, rather than running away or deluding yourself, what brings you
  face-to-face with life and wakes you up -- Cultivate that.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This quality of virtue -- I spoke of it mostly in terms of
  the precepts because they're the fundamental principles -- means restraint of our greed,
  hatred and delusion, not harming beings, and not taking that which isn't ours, and taking
  care with our sexual and our intoxicant life. That's one side. And it means cultivating
  the opposite of greed, hatred and delusion, which is love, generosity and consciousness.
  The opposite of greed is generosity; the opposite of hatred is love; the opposite of
  delusion is awareness.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">These are called &quot;training precepts&quot; in
  Sanskrit. &quot;I undertake the training precepts of not killing. I'll try it; I'll work
  with it. I undertake the training precept of not harming.&quot; And if you learn to do
  this, if you train with them, they'll teach you a tremendous amount about your own mind
  and your own heart. If you look at them, they provide a great power in your life. There's
  almost no power like the power of someone who is virtuous. It's like a rock to stand on in
  the winds at the end of the Roman Empire. That feels like the society we live in at times.
  It's a rock, and it's a wonderful one; it's a really beautiful place to rest.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There's the virtue of the training precepts, of restraint
  and cultivation, and then that leads to inner strength or power, and then the third level
  that it leads to is called <i>abhisila</i>, or the highest virtue. This is natural virtue.
  You train with it, you practice with it, you get a sense of its strength, and why you
  would harm, and how that works, and what it means to live in an upright way where you
  don't harm. Gradually that understanding seeps into the mind and the heart until it
  becomes your way of being, and then you don't think, &quot;I'm not going to harm,&quot; or
  &quot;I won't do this,&quot; or &quot;I'll take care with that,&quot; but you feel
  connected with life in the world through wisdom, through the clear seeing that we are not
  separate, we are not an individual. It's a ruse; it's a play of consciousness; it's a
  fiction. You take care of the planet and the creatures and the animals like it was your
  garden. What a wonderful way to relate to it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You know, our hearts are good. Even though there's plenty
  of greed, hatred and delusion in there, their basic root is goodness, is love. Maybe
  that's what we're made of is love. But we forget to look, and we forget to ask, so we get
  caught up in a whirlwind of busy-ness in our lives, and we break the precepts or we get
  caught up in a whirlwind of habit.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Each week we've been working with a different exercise.
  The exercise for this week is to look when you might break a precept in the tiniest way,
  of harming a creature, not taking care with the planet around, or fudging, taking that
  which really isn't yours, or your sexuality, or intoxicants, or other things like it, and
  look and see what's there under it. You might see greed, or hatred, or fear. And then look
  to see if there's pain. Look to see if there's pain in you that you're trying to get away
  from by doing something else.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the true meaning of the greatness of heart which
  spiritual practice teaches and demands of us, a heart which can even open to that pain,
  which doesn't say as a TV show in Marin County did, &quot;I want it all now,&quot; and
  acts out of greed, hatred, and delusion, but recognizes, &quot;I am it all now, that it's
  all a part of me,&quot; so instead of grasping, it settles and opens and says, &quot;Pain
  is a part of me, and pleasure is, and all of life is a part of me. And I can feel pain and
  I can feel joy and love and compassion and hurt.&quot; If you can open to that in your
  heart, you never need to break a precept.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Study it this week, and look at when it might happen and
  if there's pain. And if you open your heart in that way, there comes a silent kind of
  awareness, a real tenderness. It's a bridge to our connectedness with all of life around
  us</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I read you a last story, again from <i>The Tales of a
  Magic Monastery</i>: It is called A Visit from the Buddha.</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Why did I visit the magic monastery?<br>
    Well, I'm a monk myself,<br>
    and the strangest thing happened in my monastery.<br>
    We had a visit from the Buddha.<br>
    We prepared for it and gave him a very<br>
    warm and solemn welcome.<br>
    He stayed overnight, but he slipped away<br>
    very early in the morning.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the monks woke up they found<br>
    graffiti all over the cloister walls.<br>
    Imagine!<br>
    And do you know what he wrote?<br>
    One word. &quot;Trivia, trivia, trivia, trivia&quot;<br>
    all over our monastery walls.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We went into a rage.<br>
    But then when I quieted down,<br>
    I looked about and realized, &quot;Yup, it's true.&quot;<br>
    So much of what I saw was trivia, and most of what I heard.<br>
    But what's worse, when I closed my eyes,<br>
    all inside was trivia.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For several weeks this was my experience,<br>
    and my very efforts to rectify it just made it worse.<br>
    I left my monastery and headed for the magic monastery.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The brother showed me around.<br>
    First, the hall of laughter.<br>
    Everything said the flame of laughter,<br>
    big things and small, sacred, solemn, inconsequential, only laughter there.<br>
    What a wonderful room.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Next, the room of sorrow, the very essence of bitter
    tears,<br>
    those of the bereaved mother, the lonely,<br>
    the depressed, only sorrow here.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, the hall of words, words upon words spoken,<br>
    and written alone they must have had some sense,<br>
    but altogether total confusion.<br>
    &quot;Words, words,&quot; I cried, &quot;Stop, stop,&quot;<br>
    but I was only adding word to words.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Next, the great hall of silence.<br>
    Here there is no space and no time.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He took me finally to the Hall of Treasures.<br>
    &quot;Take anything you want,&quot; he whispered.&quot;<br>
    I chose the heart of Jesus, and with<br>
    that I am heading back to my own monastery.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The heart of Jesus or our own hearts; to awaken, the root,
  the foundation of our practice, is this non-harming, is learning to see inside and to
  connect ourselves with life.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That's a lot of words, the fourth step of the Eightfold
  Path. </font></p>
