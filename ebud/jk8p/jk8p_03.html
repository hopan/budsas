<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next steps in the Eightfold Path, have to do with
  what's called Uprightness of Heart, how to live in an upright way, not crooked, or bent,
  or wobbly, or something like that.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Don Juan teaches and talks very often in his writings, in
  his speaking with Carlos Casteneda, about choosing &quot;a path with heart,&quot; -- about
  picking a way of practice and a way of life, and that one question needs to be addressed:
  Is this a path with heart? Is this one that I can follow and live according to, and live
  in harmony with the deepest longings of my heart?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Each path with heart, whatever we've chosen as our path,
  has a particular foundation or support. Support for what? What do we really want in our
  spiritual practice or in the path that we may have chosen? What do you want, what do you
  want for the world around you? Think about it. What do we want for the world around us,
  and then what do we want for ourselves? Often the answer is the same, a bit more peaceful,
  more loving, a little wiser, or taking it all less seriously. I don't mean no anger or no
  fear -- that gets a little too idealistic -- but perhaps in our world and in ourselves,
  not to be so caught in it, not to get caught into where it leads, as it does in the world,
  to so much violence, sorrow and hatred.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Do you have a sense of what you want, just a little bit,
  for the world or for yourself? How do we get this? The foundation or support for a path
  with heart, or a world with heart, rests on the foundation of a basic harmony of our
  being. For if your life is out of harmony, there won't be peace, or there won't be
  compassion, or there won't be wisdom. What does it mean, this basic harmony? Well, if it's
  missing, if it's not there, it's difficult to see clearly and we suffer because of the
  pain of our conflict with the natural laws around us.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the laws of every path with heart is the law of
  non-harming. Harmony means an absence of excessive greed, hatred and delusion. It's a very
  specific definition. Excessive greed, hatred and delusion means so much greed, or so much
  hatred, or so much ignorance, that we act through them in ways that harm other beings or
  that harm ourselves. It's really the same, because if you hurt someone or something, what
  happens? Generally, you feel bad and you suffer. They feel bad. Often they get you back
  later, or they say, &quot;Your karma gets you back in some fashion; it happens back to
  you.&quot; It's not that this is sinful or bad or anything -- it's one of the principles
  of how this game operates.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Harmony has a positive meaning as well. It means a
  nurturing of that karma of joy, or serenity in truth, or integrity, so that our speech and
  our actions -- our being in the world -- manifests from the heart. It's called <i>sila</i>
  in Sanskrit, uprightness of heart.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There's a beautiful <i>Jataka</i> Tale about a beautiful
  and wonderful young man in ancient times, who went to a far-off university in India, away
  from his family, and he was telling his professor why his family life had been so happy,
  and why his own life had been so happy. The professor told him that his only child, his
  son had died. The young boy said, &quot;That doesn't happen in our family, children don't
  die, people don't die young.&quot; The professor was just aghast. &quot;How could that be?
  It happens all over to everyone.&quot; The boy said, &quot;Well, there's something special
  in our family, and for the last many dozen generations that we've recorded, no one has
  died young.&quot; So the professor became very intrigued, especially since he was grieving
  over the loss of his own child, and he took a pack, put on his traveling clothes, and left
  the university to go back to the town where this boy lived, to visit his parents, and
  discover why people in that family did not die young.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There's a beautiful poem that comes from this particular <i>Jataka</i>
  Tale. He went in to meet the father and he told the father, &quot;I've come with terrible
  news. Your boy who is in my care at the university was struck by illness and has
  died.&quot; The father laughed. Very unusual, amazing, how could this be! And the
  professor said, &quot;Why are you laughing?&quot; The father's eyes were really bright and
  he smiled and he said, &quot;Because the people in our family don't die young.&quot; He
  said, &quot;It must be some other boy. It can't be my son.&quot; The professor took out
  some bones from this bag and said, &quot;See these, this is your son.&quot; They were
  really some sheep bones that he brought along. The father laughed, &quot;Oh, they're sheep
  bones; they're not the bones of my boy.&quot; He says, &quot;How can you be so sure? How
  do you know?&quot; The man laughed a really heartful deep laugh, very joyful. He said,
  &quot;Because we've recorded generation after generation in our family that children don't
  die young. The professor said, &quot;Why is this so?&quot; Then the man began his poem.</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because every morning when we rise,<br>
    we rise with care,<br>
    and we take time in the morning to contact each<br>
    person in the family and see that they are well,<br>
    and speak with them<br>
    And every day when we rise we look after the<br>
    animals that are part of our family and we see to it<br>
    that they are fed and cared for and that they're<br>
    not in distress.<br>
    And every day when we begin our<br>
    conversations with people,<br>
    we take care with our words, and we speak<br>
    only that which is sweet, and that which is true,<br>
    and that which is helpful.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And because of this, people in our family<br>
    do not die young.<br>
    And every day when we go to work,<br>
    in our fields, or in business, or in commerce, we<br>
    act in ways which are kind to the other people,<br>
    which are honest, and have integrity,<br>
    and because of this the people in our<br>
    family do not die young.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And every day we look around<br>
    us in the community<br>
    and we see if there is someone or<br>
    some being in need,<br>
    and we give what we are able to<br>
    share and help them. Because of this,<br>
    for many generations<br>
    the people in our family do not die young.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">He goes on and on with this poem. And it's so sweet, it's
  like nectar to listen to. It's nectar because it's true. It's not necessarily speaking
  about chronological age and death, but again it's talking about the heart and what it
  means for the heart to be awakened or open and to live in that way. That's what it means
  to be alive.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When your heart is closed it's like you've already died in
  some way. When I listen to the story or read it, I just feel such delight in thinking what
  power it has for us to begin to live our life in a harmonious way. This is called <i>sila</i>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first two steps of the Eightfold Path are Right
  Understanding and Right Attitude. Last week we talked about openness, of discovery, of
  playing with our life rather than being in a rut, of being willing to investigate and look
  at the laws of our life and the world around us.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now <i>sila</i>. <i>Sila</i> on one side means restraint,
  non-harming. On the other side, its positive dimension is loving, caring. My teacher
  Achaan Chaa used to love to talk about <i>sila</i>. He would just light up, and he would
  go on for hours, and he would be so happy talking about a virtuous heart. We hear so
  little about it in our culture, in our time, and yet it's so important. It's the
  foundation of any path with heart. And it's beautiful. It's like the heart gets cleansed
  by our true words, by our virtuous action. It makes our life upright and strong.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Right Speech is the next step of the Eightfold Path and
  it's the first of the three steps that speak to this uprightness of heart or virtue, <i>sila.</i>
  Speech has enormous power.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There's a story of a Sufi master, a healer. He goes into
  this household one day where there's a sick child, and there are people gathered around.
  He goes over and he passes his hand over the child and he says some sacred words, a kind
  of prayer, and he says, &quot;Now you will be healed.&quot; The parents are very grateful,
  but a really disbelieving and somewhat aggressive man says, &quot;How can you heal a child
  just by saying some words, all this healing and this spiritual junk&quot;? The master
  turns to him and looks him in the eye and says, &quot;What do you know of this? You are an
  absolute fool. You know nothing!&quot; He says this in front of all the other people. The
  guy becomes enraged and he turns red and he is shaking with anger. And the master says,
  &quot;Wait a minute, sir. If a word of mine has the power to make you turn red and shake
  with anger, why should not a word also have the power to heal?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We speak a lot in our life. We talk so much to each other.
  Words have tremendous power. They have the power to put us to sleep. Do you know that one?
  &quot;La, la, la, yes, yes, no, no,&quot; back and forth for hours. Or they have the power
  to wake us up. Words of wisdom, words from the heart, words from the eye of wisdom can
  make all kinds of things clear to us, can help us to see, to let go, to discover, to
  awaken.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are two principles to Right Speech, to this
  foundation of speech as the first aspect of uprightness of heart. The first is that our
  words be true. Truth is so sweet. If you know anyone who really speaks honestly and
  truthfully, admittedly sometimes they're a pain in the ass, but mostly one's sense of that
  person is a delight, that here's somebody I can go and speak to or listen to and hear that
  which is true. It's just wonderful.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There's a story of Mullah Nasrudin, the old wise man and
  fool, this kind of strange character. He puts up his booth. It's sort of like Lucy in
  &quot;Peanuts.&quot; It says, &quot;Psychiatric Assistance&quot; or &quot;Psychological
  Counseling -- two questions,&quot; or something like that, only instead of five cents it's
  five old dinars. It's really a lot of money. People think, &quot;Gosh, he must be very,
  very good to charge so much money.&quot; So one person goes up to him, and takes out five
  old dinars and puts it on the counter. He says to Nasrudin, &quot;Isn't that an awful lot
  to charge for just two questions?&quot; Nasrudin looks back and says, &quot;Yes, it is;
  and what's your second question?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Two principles: First, that the words are true for Right
  Speech; and second, that they're kind or helpful, because it's possible to say what's true
  and not have it be helpful at all, what one might call &quot;brutal honesty&quot;.
  &quot;I'll tell you just what I think, whether it's helpful or not.&quot; The second
  principle is that speech be helpful, not only that it be true, but also that it speak in
  some way that's compassionate or kind or useful to someone.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What does communication do in our world? It makes society.
  Our society is built on communication. We're isolated individuals, in some measure anyway,
  even if perhaps cosmically we're one, but mostly we experience ourselves as separate. Our
  society, our friendships, our love, the laws, the whole world around us, is created by
  agreement through communication. It's very, very powerful. And when it's truthful, or it's
  honest, or its genuine, it builds trust, and it builds a society of harmony with our
  friends, with our loved ones, with our family. When its truthful, it opens a channel for
  our hearts to meet. When it's not, there's no chance for the hearts to meet, or very, very
  little. You probably know this in your relationships, don't you, that if you have stored
  things that you haven't communicated, stored resentments, what happens? Or if you have
  things that you've said that really haven't been true, that haven't come from your heart,
  that have been covered over, or were manipulative, or made to sound one way when they
  weren't -- what happens to that communion, that sharing, the space of love? It gets
  weakened or it disappears, for a little while anyway. It's not available to you. In many
  ways, the love between people that we live with or spend a lot of time with rides on the
  vehicle of our communication. If the communication is clear, or open, or truthful, where
  it's not held, where it's not stored, where there's forgiveness, then there's a real sense
  or communion.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Classically, wrong speech -- or what's not considered
  Right Speech -- is False Speech,or gossip. Most of you who have been to retreats have
  heard Joseph Goldstein tell the story of when he vowed not to gossip anymore for a period
  of time. He picked a month. And for him he meant in this particular vow not to speak about
  a person who wasn't there, even if it was a favorable thing, just not to talk behind
  someone's back. He discovered this amazing thing, that 90% of his speech was eliminated.
  We spend so much time talking about third people, most of which is pretty useless.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So it's not false speech, not gossiping, which is very
  helpful, not back -- biting or undermining people, refraining from harsh or abusive
  language -- these are the classical things, but they really speak to speech as a vehicle
  for love, as a vehicle for communion, as a vehicle for awakening. What Right Speech does,
  it acts as a question: Can we start to become conscious all of these hours where we talk
  on automatic pilot? Can we make our speech become more useful to ourselves and to our
  planet? To that question, I ask: What do you care about, what do you want for the world
  and for yourself?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we speak falsely, when we back -- bite, when we
  gossip, and all those other kinds of things, what makes us do that? Have you ever done
  that? Have you ever engaged in some kind of unskillful speech? Alright, so you know that.
  Now, look for a second -- for the process of awakening is in investigation. What makes us
  do that? Entertainment, justification, self-importance, anger, bonding. Yes, sometimes we
  do. We'll talk about somebody else and put them down because it makes us a little closer
  to this other person, or we do it for entertainment because we're bored. And God spare us
  in this culture if we ever had nothing to do and weren't entertained. It's horrible, you
  know! You come into someone's house and if they can't be with you, &quot;Here, I'll turn
  on the TV. Would you like some music? Here's something to eat. You can read.&quot;
  Anything but just waiting and being bored. Terrifying thing!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are all these reasons that we do it. Let's start to
  study it in our lives. Look at the moments. Don't judge it. We're just looking at the
  principles of what makes happiness. Happiness or harmony comes from understanding the
  principles of things. So this week let's also study speech a little bit -- start to look
  and see if you can find moments where you feel your speech isn't so skillful. Just look at
  what's cooking inside and what's going on when you do it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I would like to change the name of Right Speech to
  &quot;Speech from the Heart.&quot; What keeps us from speaking the truth, and with the
  value in what we know? What keeps us from speaking from the heart all the time? What does
  it? The society does, you know. I mean, it's not a very good example when you turn on the
  TV and most of what's there is false, or politics. It is l984 after all, double -- speak.
  That's one thing. We're in the soup where nobody can speak straight, nobody tells the
  truth. It's a very hard thing, advertising. It's not just our society. Don't think it's
  just ours. Sure, in our society we hide death and paint up the corpses and lock away old
  people and mental patients so we don't have to look at them. We are a society which really
  suppresses a lot. We just want to look at young, attractive people. It's not quite the
  youth culture it was since the baby boomers are getting a little older now. We settle for
  what Time Magazine called, &quot;active and attractive.&quot; Before it was, &quot;Young
  and glamorous,&quot; and now it's just &quot;active and attractive.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We still have a mass of youth in our culture, so there are
  all these things that we don't deal with. It's really the same in other cultures. I
  remember dealing with some Chinese merchants in Asia. Business is business, it has very
  little to do with virtue, generally. I went in this store and this Chinese merchant had
  these statues and I was interested in one. I said, &quot;That's a beautiful Cambodian
  statue.&quot; He said, &quot;It's ancient, fantastic, it's an antique.&quot; I said,
  &quot;Are you sure?&quot; He said, &quot;Oh, yes, yes; really, really old.&quot; He told
  me the whole story, where he got it. I said, &quot;How much?&quot; He said, &quot;Oh,
  $8,500.&quot; Wow, really fantastic. I looked at it, and I said, &quot;I know this statue,
  this was made over in Ban Cheng Dow. I know where they make them, and it's a copy, and
  it's not an antique at all. It looks like an antique. But they make it in that village, I
  know that's so.&quot; And he looked at me and he said, &quot;So how much will you give me
  for it?&quot; Not a moment's hesitation. It was $20 instead of $8,500. It's not to put
  down Chinese merchants particularly because we all have that in us in some way. We all
  have that part.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What is it that keeps us from speaking the truth? The
  society that hides things around us, the American or the Chinese society? Why else don't
  we speak the truth? We won't be loved. Look what happened to Jesus. You have to be real
  careful. That's an extreme admittedly. We feel that. We're really afraid. If we're not
  loved, then what will happen? Then we'll be pretty much ostracized and abandoned. What
  happens when you're abandoned? You die, you know. So we better be careful and say the
  right things.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Why else don't we speak the truth? Fear of rocking the
  boat. Fear of rocking the boat outwardly -- people will get upset, also a fear of being
  exposed inwardly. If we really speak the truth at times we'll show our own judgment and
  fear and violence, and all those things in ourselves that we may not want to let out so
  much. It would be wonderful to let them out with a little less judgment, because the fact
  that we all hide them and keep them in is what makes wars. We don't know how to express
  ourselves, we don't know how to share, we don't know how to see things and let them go and
  not be caught. It gets bottled up in us individually and as a culture, and then we go to
  war. War is the expression of the fact that we don't know how to deal with the violence in
  ourselves. So if we don't like nuclear war, it's tremendously compelling and important to
  learn about the shadow, about the dark side of ourselves, of our being.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">William Blake said:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If one is to do good,<br>
    it must be done in the minute particulars.<br>
    General good is the plea of the hypocrite,<br>
    the scoundrel and the flatterer.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we want to do good, it has to be in our words to the
  people that we live with, and the people that we meet on the street, and the people that
  we interact with in the stores, and the people that we work with. If you want to stop
  nuclear war, pay attention to your speech, pay attention how and when your words are
  connected to your heart and when your words aren't connected to your heart, and what's
  going on when they're not. Without judging it, just study it, begin to look at it. Look
  and see what you haven't said. Stop for a second just now. Think about your unfinished
  business, because life, as you know, goes quickly and sometimes it ends quickly. Who
  haven't you said something to that you really need to, words of the heart? Just think
  about it for a minute. Think about it and see if you can see what stops you from doing it.
  A lot of times what stops us is we think we're immortal and that we'll get to it; that
  we'll live forever.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As Don Juan said:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The problem with you, Carlos, is that you think you have
    time.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To undertake a path with heart is to begin to realize how
  precious time is, and that we have very little.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So let's turn it around and instead of asking why we're
  afraid to speak -- we can study that in ourselves -- let's ask: What do we value, again,
  going back to that question. Our life is short. What do you really value? What do you
  want? Courage, freedom, love, wholeness, integrity, happiness, pleasure; what is it that
  you love, that you value?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Gandhi was teaching about non-harming, non-harming of
  speech and action, <i>ahimsa</i>, the avoidance of harm to any living creature, in word or
  deed -- someone asked, &quot;Well, couldn't one kill a cobra to protect a child or
  oneself?&quot; And his reply was, &quot;I could not kill a cobra without violating two of
  my vows: fearlessness and non-harming. I would rather try inwardly to calm the snake by
  vibrations of love. I could not possibly lower my standards to suit my circumstances. But
  I must confess, I could not carry on this conversation so serenely were I faced with a
  cobra in this room.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we're reminded, most of us value integrity. It really
  lights up the heart to think about living in a way that comes from inside, where our
  actions, our words, and our inner being are connected. It's very precious. In the Buddhist
  tradition they're given as training precepts, training precepts which we practice. It's
  not some God -- given law that we must follow, but precepts which we begin to practice --
  to begin to learn to live our life from our hearts, to live our life, as I said, with an
  uprightness of heart.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Don Juan said:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Only when the inner dialogue stops can the hidden parts of
    ourselves be seen and revealed.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We keep this endless speech going on inside, as well.
  We'll get to the internal dialogue in another few nights. Really, it's the external
  dialogue. We go &quot;la, la, la&quot; and someone else goes &quot;la, la, la&quot; and
  we're on automatic, and we're making friends or passing the time, or whatever, and not
  waking up enough -- not so much to others but to ourselves. Why do we do that? Why do we
  talk so much? When the inner and the outer dialogue is going on, it hides our loneliness,
  it keeps us from being bored, doesn't it? It keeps us from feeling afraid. It fills up all
  that space that's empty, that's scary. It also blocks our heart from opening in some way
  and from the width of growing. We grow when things get quieter and we can look.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Think about it for a second. When we meet someone, they
  say all the things that are happening to them, and we say all the things that are
  happening to us. You know, mostly what's going on, we're just saying, &quot;Hi, I'm here!
  Are you in there?&quot; That's about all, it's just making a little contact. We have all
  this elaborate ritual to do it. Or maybe if we're a little quieter we might be saying,
  &quot;I love you,&quot; but that's a pretty scary thing to say, so we say a little here,
  and she says a little there, or whatever, and it keeps us amused, its true, but it's a
  safe way of touching another person.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So I just suggest to you that we can learn in our practice
  to let our words come a little more directly from our heart. It's a wonderful thing to
  learn and it takes some practice.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So the exercise for this week has two parts. One is to
  look to see if there are occasional moments of unskillful speech, and just see what's
  cooking in there, what's going on that motivates it. See if you understand it, without
  trying to change it. Just look! Are you trying to make friends, or are lonely or angry, or
  whatever it is, or you don't want to rock the boat Look and see if you'd be afraid of what
  would happen if you did.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And its opposite side; see if you can pay attention when
  you speak the rest of the time, the best you're able, and listen to your heart. See if you
  can begin practicing letting your words come from your heart. A good clue for this is if
  you're in a conversation that lasts more than five minutes, so you've been talking for
  awhile, pause, or wake up for a second in the middle of it, and ask inside, &quot;Now,
  what does my heart really want to say?&quot; You're having this conversation. &quot;What's
  in there that really wants to be said? Maybe I won't see this person ever again. What do I
  really want to say?&quot; That can begin to empower your speech, to transform it from
  automatic pilot to the place where you start to wake up. It's fantastic. It's really
  wonderful to work with.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I want to close by reading part of the &quot;Four
  Quartets&quot; by T.S. Eliot, this wonderful, wonderful poet. In this section, at the end
  he's talking about speech and about his life as a poet.</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What we call the beginning is often the end,<br>
    and to make an end is a beginning,<br>
    To make a beginning.<br>
    the end is where we start from<br>
    and every phrase and sentence that is right,<br>
    where every word is at home,<br>
    taking its place to support the others,<br>
    the word neither dissident nor ostentatious.<br>
    An easy commerce of the old and the new,<br>
    the common word exact with vulgarity,<br>
    the formal word precise but not pedantic,<br>
    the complete consort dancing together.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When every phrase and every sentence<br>
    is an end and a beginning,<br>
    every poem an epitaph,<br>
    and any action is a step to the block,<br>
    to the fire, down the sea's throat,<br>
    or to an illegible stone,<br>
    that's where we start.<br>
    We die with the dying.<br>
    See them depart and we go with them,<br>
    and we are born with the dead.<br>
    See, they're returned and bring us with them.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Every phrase and every sentence is an end and a beginning,
  every poem an epitaph. Any action, a step to the block, to the fire, down the sea's
  throat.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we could do just Right Speech we would change our
  lives, we would change the world, and we would become enlightened. Just in that.
  &quot;Enlighten&quot; means awaken to what we do and what's true, because to speak truly
  means that one has to touch one's heart, one has to listen to it, one has to be there.
  Then all the rest of what one calls The Path with Heart follows from that. </font></p>
