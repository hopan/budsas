<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes I think the translation of the word
  &quot;mindfulness&quot; is incorrect in two ways. Right Mindfulness is a step of the
  Eightfold Path and is the centerpoint of Buddhist practice. First, it's not a good
  translation because &quot;mindfulness&quot; is kind of an insipid word. &quot;Be
  mindful&quot; -- what does that mean? It doesn't have the kind of inspiring quality of
  spaciousness, courage, or living fully. Perhaps if you pronounced it differently and said,
  mindfulness, that would be a better understanding of the word and its power. But a more
  fundamental difficulty in even talking about mindfulness, whatever that means for us, is
  that the mind and the heart are the same word in Sanskrit or Pali. So perhaps a better
  word would be &quot;heartfulness&quot; -- live in a heartful way. Forget about this mind
  stuff all together. You could do without a lot of it, if you haven't noticed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha very often said that mindfulness was the heart
  or the essence of his practice -- to be heedful or aware -- that was the road to
  liberation and to the deathless, to freedom from even birth and death; that is, freedom
  from being caught in the cyclic nature of things, stepping outside the cycle of things.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What does &quot;mindfulness&quot; mean to us sitting here
  as a group. We sat for an hour this evening or a little bit less, but for those of you who
  have attended regularly, we've been sitting here for a year doing something supposedly
  related to paying attention and being mindful. What does it mean? What are the qualities
  of it, what are we doing here? We sit, we pay attention to the breath, or our body
  sensations, or the sounds, or the people walking by, or the various thoughts and images in
  our mind.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To be mindful first means simply to come into the present
  -- to listen with our senses, with our heart, with our physical body, with our ears, with
  our eyes, to what is actually here in the present; the body, the heart and the mind. It's
  that thing I've spoken of many times before, the sign from the casino in Las Vegas,
  &quot;You must be present to win.&quot; In Las Vegas, in therapy, in meditation, it's all
  the same thing. In order to awaken or to use our life in a skillful way, the first task is
  to get here, to start to live in the present moment, which means not living so much in our
  fantasies, in the future, not living so much in the past, in our images and memories, and
  reliving things that are gone already.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first is learning to be present, which itself is a
  very wonderful thing, because&quot;here&quot; and &quot;now&quot; and &quot;in the
  present&quot; are the only places that we can appreciate life to begin with. Otherwise,
  it's kind of second-hand, what happened a few years ago -- that's a nice memory -- or what
  we fantasize about. Where can you really appreciate this life we're given? Only in the
  present.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Also, there is something else which interests a lot of
  people and can only be found in the present, and that is love. If you want to love a
  person or you want to be loved -- some of you perhaps know anyway, right? -- where does
  love take place? Or &quot;when&quot; is a better question. Again, it's a nice memory,
  &quot;Gee, I was in love once or twice&quot; -- or more in some of your cases. It was very
  nice. It evokes a nice thing to remember it. Or it's in the future, &quot;Oh, if only I
  could meet that right wonderful person,&quot; or &quot;this person that I live with,&quot;
  or &quot;this family,&quot; or whatever, &quot;if they would change so they would become
  right, then I could fall in love all over again with them or be happy with them.&quot; The
  only place that you can really love a person or be loved is in the present. No other
  possibility for it. All the rest is fantasy.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Also in the present comes the possibility of touching our
  intuition, of creativity, of clarity; all kinds of things. So the first aspect of
  awareness is simply learning in some way to live more fully here in our present reality.
  If you learn nothing else from meditation practice than that, you get your money's worth
  -- especially since there's no charge.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Secondly, mindfulness or heartfulness mean seeing clearly.
  It means non-grasping, non-greed, non-hatred, it means not pushing away, and it means not
  going to sleep, but seeing what is present for us. Bare attention, remembering, being in
  the present, without trying to change it somehow, which is a hard thing to learn because
  we're generally planning on what we're going to make this something into next. But then
  what happens? We end up doing that all the time and missing all the somethings that are
  here, always waiting for the next one.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mindfulness is really a way of learning to see what is
  here in a very clear way. People talk about learning mystical things in meditation or
  spiritual life. There is nothing more mystical, or startling, or bizarre, or amazing, than
  what is right in front of us. In my days I've done a lot of strange things. I've been to a
  lot of different countries on this planet, and observed <i>saddhus</i> on beds of nails in
  India, and strange animals in other parts of the world, and in my early days I took a
  number of the various kinds of psychedelics and drugs one could take, and have had all
  kinds of realms and weird experiences, and all kinds of things in meditation. I have never
  encountered a realm as peculiar, or bizarre, or as interesting as this one.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Someone said:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The mystery of life is not a problem to solve,<br>
    or something that you find somewhere else,<br>
    but it's a reality to experience here.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We went to the zoo with the baby on Sunday. If you landed
  on some weird planet, and then you saw pygmy hippopotamuses or 300 pound ostriches and
  really wrinkled elephants -- Did you ever look at elephant skin? Just amazing! -- or the
  kind of snakes that are there, or sloths hanging upside down, you would say you had come
  by your spaceship to a really peculiar planet. And yet we forget that. We start to take it
  all for granted. It all becomes very ordinary, and it's not. If you attend a birth, it's
  an amazing thing to see a baby being born out of a human body. How does that happen? How
  does it get in there? I know you know how it gets in there. But I mean, how does it really
  get in there? Like the ship in the bottle. An incredible thing happens in there, the baby
  coming out of a woman. And we take it for granted.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So to pay attention means to somehow have a newer or a
  fresher vision, to see clearly. It means to stop our judging and our planning and just see
  what's here, which is part of what we do in meditation; to stop and not judge a single
  thing; let it be exactly how it is. Let God take over for a little while and run the show
  rather than our minds, which get very tired, and very full, and very busy anyway, and need
  a rest.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Someone said:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The classic question is: If you pay attention<br>
    and you don't judge, then how do you live<br>
    in the world? What part of attention or <br>
    awareness is that?</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That's called <i>sampajanna</i>. <i>Sati</i> is
  mindfulness, <i>sampajanna</i> means clear or right comprehension. It means not only do
  you pay attention to what's here, but then when you act in your life you also look at the
  context, at the suitability or the intention of it; what is present. When you act, you
  first have to see what's here, and then some intuition, or inspiration, or thought arises,
  &quot;I'll do this or do that.&quot; It's to pay attention to where your heart is, what
  motivates you, what the intention and the purpose of your action is, so that you pay
  attention but you also note the context.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The way Joseph, my colleague and friend, answers the
  question when people say, &quot;When you just pay attention and note 'lifting, moving,
  placing' in the walking, or the in and out of the breathing, how can you live?&quot; He
  said, &quot;Well, I was doing my lifting, moving, placing one day on a road in India near
  the Burmese temple where I lived, just moving my feet and paying attention, and all of a
  sudden I heard 'clang, clang' of the bells, and I recognized it. I knew what those bells
  were. I looked up and sure enough the elephant that lived in town was coming down the road
  right towards me. I noted 'hearing, hearing' and 'seeing, seeing'; then I noticed the
  intention to move out of the way arise, and then I walked out of the way.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So there are two parts. The first is seeing what is here,
  living in the reality of the present, and then responding to it wisely, being aware of the
  situation that we're in.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At times this year I've talked in this class about another
  aspect of awareness which I think is really important to remember in our lives, and that
  is the very interesting question of why we don't pay attention; why do we go to sleep, why
  do we drive on automatic pilot, why do we eat three meals a day, two-thirds or
  three-quarters or ninety percent of it on automatic pilot? Why do we live so much not
  here? It's a pretty interesting question, maybe even more interesting than saying,
  &quot;One should pay attention or live in the present.&quot; How come we don't?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There's a story:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Krushchev pronounced his famous denunciation of
    Stalin, someone in the Russian Congress Hall was reported to have said, &quot;And where
    were you, Comrade Krushchev, when all these innocent people were being slaughtered?&quot;
    Krushchev paused, looked around the hall, and said, &quot;Will the man who said that
    kindly stand up? Tension mounted in the hall. No one moved. Finally Krushchev said,
    &quot;Well, whoever you are, you have your answer now. I was in exactly the same position
    then that you are in now.&quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Why is it that we don't pay attention? One reason is fear,
  that if we actually come into the present, there are certain things we have to deal with
  that we haven't had to in our lives. For some people it's boredom. We're really afraid of
  being bored. For some it's loneliness. For some it's grieving, something in their hearts
  that's not finished. So it's better to distract yourself, see a lot of movies, talk to
  people, keep yourself busy, stay on the phone, and keep yourself working, so you don't
  have to feel certain things.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another reason we don't stay awake is habit. You could be
  very peaceful, not have any grieving to do, and be comfortable being alone, and so forth,
  but it's like there's this huge flywheel inside. And there you are. It's a quiet day,
  you're just sitting down in the park, and all of a sudden out of nowhere you start
  thinking about what you'll do next week or next year, making plans, and playing back
  memories, because there's this powerful habit of thinking. It takes training to kind of
  release the clutch and let it slow down. That's part of what meditation is about.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Also, pain is another reason, because if you live in the
  reality of the present moment, what do you experience? Up and down, light and dark, night
  and day, and pleasure and pain. And if you don't like pain which a lot of people don't --
  understandably -- then what you have to do is manufacture some fantasy, to live in a lot
  of thought and busy-ness so you don't feel it. However, you rob yourself of something
  very, very important when you do it, which is that you rob your life of living, of
  heartfulness, of fullness, of vitality, of your existence.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To live in the present means that you have to face your
  boredom and your loneliness when they come. They're not there all the time, and they're
  not so bad actually when you come to terms with them. They're a little scary but they're
  not so terrible. And you have to face the fact that there is this habit of greed, and
  hatred, and fantasy, sort of a machine that spins out thoughts out the habit of it. So you
  have to be willing to be aware of pain as well as pleasure. But if you are, the rewards
  are fantastic, because then you can really experience being with another person, walking
  down the beach, taking a walk in the park, walking outside and seeing the stars.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's really very interesting to start to pay attention to
  when we go on automatic pilot. If you were to look at something in your meditation, rather
  than trying to be aware, try to be mindful of when it is that you go to sleep, what it is
  that's hard for you to be aware of. That is something that is quite interesting to learn
  about. Use it as a signal. &quot;I haven't been very mindful today. I wonder what's going
  on? I haven't been very mindful this week. I wonder why? What's happening? Oh, I'm sad.
  It's hard to be sad, so I have to keep myself busy,&quot; or &quot;This thing is coming up
  that's difficult to deal with, so I think a lot and plan, rather than just notice that
  it's really hard.&quot; We learn somehow to find the center in the moment rather than
  toppling forward or into the past.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you let yourself do that, then everything stops. And
  one of the most wonderful things about awareness or heartfulness or mindfulness is that it
  allows us to come to rest, because there's really only one place to rest, which is in the
  present.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We're householders, we're not monks and nuns. And the
  question often asked is: In order to be mindful does it mean we have to talk slowly and
  sit many hours a day and go into an ashram or some monastery? How can we bring
  mindfulness, heartfulness, wisdom here into our lives? How do you do that? Well, of
  course, as I said in the past few weeks, sometimes you do have to look at your life and
  see if you want to slow it down a little bit, if it's crazy, if it's real busy. Because
  our culture is a little bit mad in that way, you might need to take a look and see,
  &quot;Gee, is it time to stop doing a few things, to make a little more space, to slow
  down?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Fundamentally, &quot;mindfulness&quot; means to learn to
  be aware where we are. If not here, where else? If not now, when? Mindfulness is the
  opposite of &quot;if only,&quot; it's the opposite of hope, it's the opposite of
  expectation. It has in it a certain kind of contentment, not that one might not choose to
  change the world, but a kind of acceptance that this is really what we get, these sights,
  these sounds, these smells, these tastes, these perceptions. This is it! Then in another
  moment, there will be another &quot;it.&quot; It's not something else. &quot;I know that
  this is all it is, but this is it.&quot; When one accepts it, then one can come to rest.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mindfulness in a way is the opposite of grasping, or
  attachment, or identification. And it can go very, very deep when we allow ourselves,
  because what we start to see -- if we slow down a little bit and pay attention -- is how
  it is a kind of conditioned phenomenon, like a machine, the mind spins this stuff out in a
  very orderly way by habit -- thoughts, fantasies and memories. The world works in certain
  conditioned patterns, and that's it's nature, and it's all impermanent and quite
  ungraspable. Where is yesterday? What happened to your weekend? Where is it? What happened
  to 1984, your 20's, or whatever it was -- maybe you're 20 now. For some of you, your 20's,
  30's, 40's and 50's, where did they go? They all disappeared, gone. Isn't that an amazing
  thing?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's a very profound thing to start to be aware of life
  coming out of nothing and disappearing into nothing. A day appears for awhile, and then
  it's gone. It can't be grasped, it's like a bird flying. You cannot hold time and
  fundamentally you can't hold yourself.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So the spirit of mindfulness is learning to live in an
  awake way. As the Buddha said, &quot;I'm not a man, I'm not a God. I'm none of these
  things. I'm awake.&quot; How can I convey the spirit of this? There are songs from the
  monks and nuns who lived after the Buddha died that are in these poems. If you read<i>Therigatha</i>,
  the songs of the sisters, there are many enlightenments that take place while they're
  walking through the forest. One nun is in the forest talking about how happy she is that
  she doesn't have to do housework anymore and she drops a cup or something like that on the
  ground, maybe it breaks, and all of a sudden she's enlightened. She says, &quot;Oh, that's
  how it is.&quot; Things arise for a while and then they pass away. If you can accept that
  and see that -- each day, each moment, with each person, to experience what's there -- and
  then leave it and go to the next, you can live in a deeply free way. So it really has the
  spirit of aliveness to it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the monastery it was beautiful. We had all these rules,
  227 major precepts and then some hundreds of minor precepts, and then they told you how to
  fold your robe, which side of the bowl you should put down, and how you should clean it
  properly. Even how to pee. There is a particular way monks are supposed to pee. You're
  supposed to squat down, you can't stand up, and you can't pee into water where there are
  obvious living things or on plants because you might harm them, and things like that. At
  first when I read this, I said, &quot;Well, what's the difference if I squat down? Nobody
  is looking, first of all. These rules are dumb.&quot; But after awhile of living them, in
  this beautiful forest monastery, where there wasn't anything else to do besides meditating
  and following the rules, which would drive you crazy initially, what you began to see is
  that somehow they brought you to see that everything was precious, that everything was
  worth caring for; that it mattered where you peed, that you could pee on the ground and
  not on a bush, and not harm it; or that it mattered how you took care of your bowl, which
  was one of your very few possessions. It was a gift from people who said, &quot;We want to
  support you because we think that monasteries and what you're doing is valuable in the
  world and reminds all of us of something precious. So we'll give you a bowl.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You take care with your bowl, you take care with your
  robe, you take care with your car, you take care with your house, you take care with your
  clothes, because to be aware in some way means to remember the preciousness of life and to
  begin to take care with the earth and all the creatures and things on it. It's to be aware
  of ourselves and our bodies, of our actions, to be aware politically, to be aware
  economically, to be aware socially as well.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Imagine if you were told that you have some disease, let's
  say AIDS because there's a lot of it that's happening, and it's both scary to people and
  very immediate and present, and real important to look at. Someone said, &quot;Well, at
  best you have four years, maybe you have a year to go.&quot; How would you start to live
  that year? Things would change for you, I assure you. Your life would become a lot more
  alive and precious for you. Or imagine that you've been in prison for a long time, as
  people are in many, many countries of the world. Amnesty International said that 55
  countries have political prisoners who are imprisoned and often tortured because of
  religious views. The majority of the large countries on the earth imprison people for what
  they think. It's really painful. And then you were let out after a long time in prison,
  how would it be just to walk down the street in San Anselmo? What would the trees be like?
  Just the experience of being free, watching the cars, being able to go into a
  confectionery store and order any kind of sweet that you wanted, or just seeing the sky
  and feeling the air and being able to decide whether you're going to go down the block to
  the right or to the left. It's that spirit of heartfulness, of mindfulness that it comes
  to. It's not so much that you're supposed to be tedious about it at all, but it's somehow
  much more the spirit of an appreciation of life and of seeing it in a clear way.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I remember when I was seven years old I spent a whole
  summer in bed. I had this kind of infection and I couldn't leave the house. And then when
  it ended and I finally could go out, I was given something like a dollar, which seemed
  like a lot of money at that time, and I went and I bought a ball and some bubble stuff,
  and I went to this big park near my house. It was like being let out of prison for a kid
  being in the house for a whole summer. I was so happy. To this day I remember the sun was
  shining, I could blow my bubbles and turn cartwheels and throw my ball and do anything I
  felt like. It was so wonderful. In some ways, that's part of the spirit of bringing
  awareness to our life. It also means, as I said, that we have to be willing to face that
  which is difficult, to open to what Zorba called &quot;the whole catastrophe,&quot; and to
  appreciate it in some way. It's really quite a trip.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So first it means to take care with the earth, to learn
  that awareness means to receive, to see the preciousness of things. Secondly, then it
  allows our world to teach us, to let it teach you very simple truths which are the most
  important. For example, one monk went to his master after a long time of training and
  begged the teacher to give him enlightenment. The master led him over to a bamboo grove.
  He said, &quot;See that bamboo there, how tall it is? See that one over there, see how
  short it is?&quot; And the monk was enlightened.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Things will teach us when we see them afresh, when we see
  them anew. We see them for a minute, we see the ungraspability of anything, of our own
  bodies -- they change -- of our thoughts, of our feelings, not to speak of the people and
  the things around us. -- changing, ungraspable. And that they do. Sometimes they're big
  and sometimes they're small. That's the way that things are. It teaches us the
  preciousness of life. When we pay attention we can learn. We can learn from our families.
  We can learn when our hearts are closed and when they're open. We can learn what it means
  to be attached, what it means to let go and be freer. We can learn about all the forces in
  the mind. We can learn about doubt and fear and anger, through awareness. We can learn
  about love and kindness through attention. It's really universal. We can learn to play
  tennis in a better way.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To train ourselves to be aware is the gift of the Buddha.
  He said: Here, I'll give you a gift that can make life come alive for you, that can bring
  both happiness and freedom. And it's a very simple thing. Learn to train yourself to live
  more in the present. Do what it takes to do that in your life. How can we do it? Here we
  are, householders, right; not like we have all day to sit and walk in some monastery.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some hints perhaps. First of all, as I've said in previous
  evenings, one of the most beautiful expressions of awareness comes from Zen master Thich
  Nhat Hanh where he says: See if you can learn to wash the dishes in order to wash the
  dishes. Usually we wash the dishes in order to get the dishes clean, right, and then we
  can get on and do something else, right, or talk to someone. Did you ever do anything like
  that, where you just did it in order to do it? Maybe we let ourselves do that on vacation.
  You go hiking in the Sierras, and if you're not too driven -- &quot;Can I get to this camp
  site by this hour,&quot; or something -- and you let go of that a little bit, you just
  walk along the mountains in order to be walking, everything becomes what it is. It's
  beautiful.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That's the first hint, to start to take some things in our
  lives and do them for their own sake. Does that make sense to you? Another way is to
  listen with your heart a little bit more, to try to pay attention to what it's like when
  you're with people, and see if you can let your words come out of your heart, to say
  really what you feel inside, what you care about, and to listen with your heart rather
  than your mind. That's a very good way to wake up; especially the people you live with --
  your kids, your spouse, family, and things like that.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">People say, &quot;How can you be mindful at work? I'm a
  writer,&quot; or &quot;I'm a mathematician.&quot; These are some of the questions I get at
  retreats. &quot;How do you do math mindfully? You have to think and ruminate.&quot; Or,
  how do you write mindfully, or watch a movie? The best I have been able to come to in that
  is that when you write, just write; when you watch a movie, just watch the movie; when you
  read, just read. Not writing and also thinking how people will view it when you're done
  writing, and planning, and seeing how many more minutes you have to write, and so forth.
  Just be present for the writing. It doesn't mean to think or be in some special mode. Just
  do what you do. Not so complicated. When you do math, do math.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of course, sometimes it gets a little more complicated
  than that, and at retreats I've often told the story of Zen master Soen-Sa-Nim who
  generally teaches his great Zen teachings, &quot;When you walk, just walk; when you're
  hungry, eat; when you're sitting, just sit.&quot; So there he was at the breakfast table
  eating breakfast and reading the paper. Students who saw this were very upset. &quot;You
  know, you're the Zen master. You tell us, 'When you eat, just eat,' and here you are
  eating and reading. How do you explain this?&quot; He said, &quot;Very simple. When you
  eat and read, just eat and read.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The spirit of it is not so complicated. It's not to make
  something really false or different about it. It's more the quality of being a bit more
  where you are. I think that comes from Yoda in Star Wars. Another thing is to remember the
  power of the act of coming into the present.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I told the story a few weeks ago of Robert Aitken-roshi
  who wanted to go to Japan to study Zen during the Korean War. It was considered a war zone
  and people weren't allowed. When he went to the consul or the ambassador who was a very
  learned and dignified Japanese man, he was told, &quot;I'm sorry, we just can't have
  visitors; it's war time. The American government doesn't want it and the Japanese
  government is following that.&quot; The ambassador offered tea. It was very nice. He said,
  &quot;Why do you want to do that? I mean, there's this war we have to stop.&quot; He took
  his cup of tea and he picked it up and he drank it very carefully and silently, and then
  he looked at the ambassador and said, &quot;Taking a cup of tea I stopped the war.&quot;
  With that the ambassador was wise and he understood that, and he arranged a visa for him
  to go to Japan to study.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What we do, if we do it with our full heart and our full
  being, is a way of bringing the planet back into balance. All you have to do is look at
  the news or read Time or Newsweek; it's crazy. And it's crazy because it's all mind and
  thought and going in circles and it's not connected with the heart and the earth. Taking a
  walk you stop the war, taking a cup of tea, sitting a little bit every day, you stop the
  nuclear arms race because you let yourself get quiet and feel the earth and the air, and
  then your actions and your vibrations and the effect you have on other people, and maybe
  even the concerns that you act out politically, all come from that connection with
  yourself and with the earth around you.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I have a good friend who is lawyer from Harvard Law
  School, a very fine lawyer. He sits through lots of meetings. He said he has really
  learned to work with his breath. Communication is kind of redundant. You could probably
  tune in on every tenth sentence and get most of the meaning of things. He is really in
  love. He says, &quot;I love my breath. It's much better than what goes on in the
  meetings.&quot; So you can use your meditation in grocery stores standing in line waiting
  for checkout, or traffic jams. Wonderful times to meditate.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I remember sitting at my teacher's cottage. He sort of sat
  in a little chair, and people would sit around and he would receive visitors. I was
  sitting there and waiting for him. It was a really hot day. Usually they had iced coffee
  on a very hot day in the tropics. Iced coffee is first so good because it's so cool and
  delicious; and the Thai coffee is half sugar. And secondly, since you don't eat except one
  meal in the morning, to have a big glass of dark iced coffee filled with sugar is like
  about three or four hours of caffeine and sugar stimulation before it wears off. It's
  great sitting. It was a great drug for sitting, there's no question about it. I was kind
  of in the doldrums. &quot;I've swept my cottage, now I'll go over and I'll sit and I'll
  wait.&quot; And on hot days like this, if the teacher sees a lot of people sitting around,
  he says, &quot;Okay, you can bring some iced coffee for these poor starving monks,&quot;
  or whatever. So we sat. I kept thinking about how I was going to go back and meditate. I'd
  get to my cottage and then after I had it, for two or three hours I would be very alert
  and awake, and I'm kind of sitting there sweaty and hot and a little bit depressed and
  just waiting and waiting and waiting. He must have known it, and I'm waiting and waiting.
  Hours go by and other people come by and I'm waiting and waiting. I think, &quot;God, when
  am I going to get this wonderful coffee so that it will perk me up and I can really
  meditate?&quot; Waiting, waiting. It never came. Finally, it became real clear after a lot
  of hours of waiting; waiting to meditate.I was sitting there doing nothing. When are we
  going to meditate? &quot;I'll do it when I get to the sitting, then I'll meditate,&quot;
  or &quot;I'll do it tomorrow.&quot; Somehow it's to remember that it's here in the present
  we're talking about.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In some way, mindfulness means coming back to our real
  home, coming to rest in the present. It is our real home. And our real home is not
  connected with grasping, our feelings, our bodies, our thoughts, our images, or all the
  things that are changing -- but it's the ease that we can find in being with up and down,
  light and dark, and all of this duality which is changing. With an open heart, with
  heartfulness, with mindfulness, being with it as it is, then receiving it and deciding, if
  we will, what things to choose to respond to in a wise or compassionate way.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is Don Juan to Carlos Casteneda:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For me the world is incredible because it is mysterious,
    awesome, stupendous, unfathomable. My interest has been to convince you that you must
    learn to make every act count in this marvelous world, in this marvelous time, I've tried
    to convince you. You must realize that you are going to be here for only a short while. In
    fact, too short for witnessing all the marvels of it. I wanted to convince you that you
    must learn to make every act count.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The spirit of awareness or mindfulness really means coming
  into our life, into the physical senses, into the feelings, into the movement of mind, and
  into the heart, and living each day from our heart. What do we care about? Taking a
  concern and a care for the preciousness of the earth. In the end what one discovers is
  that mindfulness and love are the same thing. To be aware, without grasping or resisting
  or trying to change -- to receive what's here -- is to love it; that they're not really
  separate, that the heart and the mind come together. Or as one of my teachers said: The
  mind creates the abyss and the heart crosses it. The mind creates distinctions, and coming
  into the present, into the heart, resolves all of that.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The talk in a way is a reminder. Let me ask you a few
  questions as a way of ending. First of all, what keeps you, what keeps each of us from
  really paying attention in our lives, from living more fully? Just think about it as I
  ask. What fear or difficulty in your life keeps you from living here in the present? What
  illusion or misunderstanding in your life keeps you from living here in the present? What
  would you have to do to make your life really support living mindfully? What would you
  have to change to make a real support for this mindfulness or this heartfulness? What
  would you have to change in your life to allow yourself to love more fully? And the last
  question is to ask in your heart should you make those changes. See what it said.
  Generally, it has a good answer.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even mindfulness, however, cannot be grasped. There are
  days when you're going to be more mindful and days when you're less mindful. And it too,
  like all things, comes and goes. What you can do is nourish and find ways. That's what we
  do together here. We sit together, sometimes we have discussions and questions, sometimes
  I talk to myself out loud and you get to participate, sort of listen to it. It is a way to
  remind ourselves that there's something really precious. Spiritual life is pretty simple.
  It's not easy but it's pretty simple. </font></p>
