<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This meditation practice, as many of you have done with
  this day of sitting and walking, was actually quite a lot. Some people will start with a
  20-minute sitting and do that for a number of months, or go to a class and have some
  instruction and sit for a little bit. There are people who also will come to a ten-day
  retreat. We've even had a few kind of unusual people sign up for a three-month retreat who
  had never meditated before, and say, &quot;Well, I guess I'll just do it.&quot; But as you
  can discover, even in just one day of sitting, though some things are interesting and you
  learn some from it, it's also not so easy. There aren't a lot of distractions and
  diversions here. It's pretty simple. All that's really left for you in this place is your
  own body and mind, and there's not a lot to take one away from that.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What is the essence of meditation practice? Here is a
  story. After the Buddha was enlightened he was walking down the road in a very happy
  state. He was supposed to have been quite a handsome prince before going off to be a monk.
  So here's this handsome prince now recently enlightened, wearing golden robes and
  obviously quite happy, and very special from all accounts. And he met some people and they
  said, &quot;You seem very special. What are you, are some kind of an angel or a
  deva?&quot; He seemed inhuman in some way. &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Well, are you some kind
  of a god then?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Well, then are you some kind of a wizard or
  magician?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; he replied. &quot;Well, are you a man?&quot;
  &quot;No,&quot; he said. &quot;Then what are you?&quot; And he answered, &quot;I am
  awake.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And in those three words --&quot;I am awake&quot;-- he
  gave the whole teaching which Buddhism contains. To be a Buddha is to be one who has
  awakened, awakened to the nature of life and death and the world in which we live,
  awakened to the body and mind. So the purpose of practicing meditation, the Buddhist and
  other traditions, is not to become a meditator, or a spiritual person, or a Buddhist, or
  to join something. Rather, it is to understand this capacity we have as humans to awaken.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What is that which we can awaken to, what is the Dharma
  which we can awaken to? <i>Dharma</i> is the Sanskrit word and <i>Dhamma</i> is the Pali
  word which refers to that which is universal, to the laws of the universe, teachings which
  describe it. The Dharma as a law is that the way things work are always here to be
  discovered; they're quite immediate.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There's a story of a pious man who very much believed in
  God. One day, at the place where he dwelled, it started to rain heavily and it rained and
  rained, and a big flood came. He went from the first floor to the second floor of his
  house and the water rose until he was on the roof. Someone rowed by and said, &quot;Get
  in, my friend, I'll save you; the water is rising.&quot; He said, &quot;No, I believe in
  God; I really have faith; I believe.&quot; So he sent the rowboat away. It rained more and
  the water got all the way up to his neck. Another rowboat came by, picking up people.
  &quot;Get in, my friend, I'll save you.&quot; &quot;No, thank you. I have trust. I have
  lived my whole life. I believe in God; no need.&quot; The rowboat went away. It got up to
  his nose so he could just barely breathe. And a helicopter came over and lowered down a
  rope. &quot;Come up, my friend, I'll save you.&quot; &quot;No, thank you. I believe, I
  have faith, I trust.&quot; So the helicopter went away.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It rained some more and he drowned. He goes to heaven
  after that. Soon after that he gets an interview with God. So he goes in, and he sits down
  and pays his respects, and then he says, &quot;You know, I just don't understand. Here I
  was your faithful servant. I was so trusting, and prayed, and so believing, and I just
  don't understand what happened to me.&quot; And he recounts all of his circumstances.
  &quot;Where were you when I needed you?&quot; God looks up and kind of scratches his head
  and says, &quot;I don't understand it either. I sent you two rowboats and a
  helicopter.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We wait for God to come in some big flash or our spiritual
  awakening to be some wonderful other worldly experience. What the Dharma is, and what we
  can awaken to, is the truth that is here when we leave our fantasies and memories and
  things behind and come into the present.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What are these laws, what is it? First, there is the
  Dharma which is described as the law of cause and effect, or Karma, which means by one
  teacher's definition, &quot;To keep it simple, 'karma' means you don't get away with
  nothin'.&quot; But in a more explicit way, it means that we become what we do, or we
  create how our future will be. For example, if we practice being angry all the time, in a
  while, when a situation arises, that will be our response to it, and it will create that
  in other people; that will be the kind of society we end up in. If we practice being
  loving, that becomes the way of what will happen to us in the future.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the Buddha spoke to people who were interested in
  happiness -- which some people are -- they said, &quot;How can we be happy?&quot; He said,
  &quot;Well, one way is to understand the law of karma. If you cultivate generosity,
  kindness, awareness and giving. you will be happy because you'll learn that it's pleasant,
  and also the way that karma works is that your world will become more of a cycling rather
  than fear and holding. You will discover happiness in this generosity.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">He said, &quot;If you're kind to people, if you maintain a
  basic level of non-harming -- what's called Virtue -- if your words are honest and
  helpful, if your actions are truthful and helpful and based on kindness, your world will
  start to become kind. Inside you'll feel kinder and happier; outside people will treat you
  that way. The law of Karma is one of the first things you observe if you practice
  mindfulness and awareness. This is one thing you can discover through practice.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A second thing you can discover is that there are two
  places that we can live. There are many places, but one is to live in our fantasy, in our
  thoughts about things; and the other is to be more here in our bodies, in our eyes, our
  nose, in our senses, and the direct experience of things.</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For me -- says Don Juan -- the world is incredible because
    it is stupendous, mysterious, awesome, unfathomable. My interest has been to convince you
    that you must learn to make every act count. You must learn to assume responsibility for
    being here in this marvelous world, in this marvelous time, for in fact you will learn
    that you are only here for too short a time, a very short while, too short for witnessing
    all the marvels of it.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So one way is to be kind of lost in thoughts and
  fantasies, and the other is that while we have this life, to come into it; to live in our
  physical bodies, to be aware of the senses; to open, to see what they have to teach us.
  When we do that and we pay attention, we start to see some of the characteristics of the
  Dharma or the life in which we live.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One characteristic is impermanence.</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus shall you think of this fleeting world -- it says in
    one Buddhist sutra -- a star at dawn, a bubble in a stream, a flash of lightning in a
    summer cloud, an echo, a rainbow, a phantom and a dream.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That as you look, the more closely you observe, the more
  you realize that everything you look at is in change. Seeing changes, hearing changes,
  smelling, tasting and physical sensations are changing; all the experiences in the body
  and mind, all the experiences of the senses change.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It seems solid -- That's the illusion of <i>santati</i>.
  -- It's like a movie. And when you watch the screen and get caught in the story, it seems
  like it's very real. But when you turn your attention to the projector, or slow it down,
  or focus your awareness very carefully, you start to see that it's one frame after
  another, one appearing and dissolving and the next arising.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's so for our life; it's really a process of change.
  That's so because things don't last. If you have something that lasts in your life, please
  raise your hand. Has anyone gotten any mental states of any kind to last very long?
  Someone once raised a hand and said, &quot;Yes, ignorance. It's lasted my whole
  life.&quot; But basically it's change. You sit here for one day -- you don't even have to
  be a very adept meditator to get the point that it moves all the time, that it changes.
  And because things don't last, if we're attached to them being a certain way, what
  happens? This is one of the laws. What happens? We suffer, or we get disappointed -- not
  because we should. You can be attached as much as you like, but even though you're
  attached, does it stop it from changing? You have a nice mental state and you try and hold
  on to it, does it last anyway?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You start to see the laws of things, that things are
  impermanent, that attachment doesn't work, and that there must be some other way. There is
  actually what Alan Watts called, &quot;the wisdom of insecurity,&quot; the ability to flow
  with things, to see them as a changing process. You also see not only are they impermanent
  and ungraspable, but that there's suffering if we're attached to them, and that there's
  pain as well as pleasure in this world; it's part of what we were born into. If you decide
  to get off on this planet and get one of these things with ten little things on the end
  here and ten little things on the end there, that grows for awhile, and that you put old
  dead plants and animals in, and mush them up in order to get it to kind of move around --
  if you choose one of these things which you have, it's too late already. What is the
  nature of it? It grows up, it grows old, it dies. Sometimes it gets sick, sometimes it
  feels good, sometimes it hurts; there's pleasure and pain in it. Anybody have one that
  doesn't hurt sometimes? If you don't want that, you've got to go to another planet because
  it's not the way things are here.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You sit, and you say, &quot;I'm just going to be with my
  body and mind,&quot; and what do you find? Sometimes you find it's pleasant and sometimes
  it's painful; sometimes it's quiet, sometimes it's restless, and you begin to relate to
  what Zorba called, &quot;It's the whole catastrophe,&quot; all of it, instead of fearing
  the painful things and running away all the time, and grasping after pleasant things,
  hoping that somehow by holding them they'll last and seeing that they don't.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">My teacher, Achaan Chah used to wander around the
  monastery at times and talk to people and just say, &quot;Are you suffering much
  today?&quot; And if you said, &quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;Oh, you must be quite
  attached,&quot; and kind of giggle and go along. There wasn't much more to say. You come
  to see that you don't own this body because it changes by itself, that you rent this
  house; you get it for a little while, and you can honor it and feed it and walk it, and
  jog it if you want, but it's not yours to possess. You can begin to see, in fact, that
  none of these things are possessible because the nature of life is nonpossession. You're
  an accountant in the firm -- you get to count it for awhile and that's all.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We sit to awaken, and we awaken by coming into our bodies
  and our senses, and we start to see the laws which govern life so we can come into a wiser
  relationship with it. What does this mean for our lives? Well, this really teaches a way
  of wholeness and awareness, of bringing our body and mind together, our heart and actions,
  being conscious with our speech, conscious with our eating, conscious with walking, making
  them each a part of what allows us to grow and live. To do this means accepting the fact
  of impermanence, and of some pain and suffering, and the fact that we don't control it
  very much. I mean, you control some of it, but not very much, and in a really limited way.
  If you can't accept those things, then you will probably want to stay in your fantasy,
  because they're what you encounter when you come here.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some people might ask, &quot;Doesn't meditation fragment
  us away from the world? You say that it makes us more present.&quot; It can if we become
  attached to solitude, if we sit and try to get quiet and block everything out, close our
  eyes and ears and nose or go into a cave.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There's another story of an elderly woman in New York who
  goes to a travel agent and says, &quot;Please get me a ticket to Tibet. I want to go see
  the guru.&quot; The travel agent says, &quot;You know, it's a long trip to Tibet. You'd be
  much happier going to Miami.&quot; She says &quot;I insist. I want to go.&quot; So this
  old lady gets a ticket, brings her things with her, gets on the plane and goes to India,
  gets the visa and the pass, takes the train up to Sikkim, gets a border pass, takes the
  bus up to the Tibetan plateau, and gets out. And they're all saying, &quot;Where are you
  going?&quot; &quot;I must go see the guru.&quot; They say, &quot;It's such a long way.
  You're an old lady. It's up in the mountains.&quot; She says, &quot;I'm going. I have to
  see the guru.&quot; They say,&quot;You know, you only get three words with him.&quot;
  &quot;It doesn't matter, I am going.&quot; So she goes, and she gets on the horse in
  Tibet, because there are no roads in this part, gets to the foot of this large mountain,
  and all these pilgrims are saying, &quot;Where are you going?&quot; She says, &quot;I want
  to see the guru.&quot; They say, &quot;Remember, you get just three words.&quot; She says,
  &quot;I know, I know.&quot; She gets in line, gets up there, finally past the guards at
  the door who say, 'Three words.only.&quot; She goes in and there's the guru sitting in his
  robes with a kind of scraggly beard. He looks up at her and she looks at him, and she
  says, &quot;Sheldon, come home.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I tell it mostly for a laugh but the fact is that for us
  who live in the Bay Area, the spirituality that's going to work for us is not a
  spirituality of finding peace by leaving the world. It's not to say you shouldn't go and
  take a vacation in Yosemite or have periodic retreats. But fundamentally, for spiritual
  practice to be vital in our lives, it has to be what we can use in the supermarket, while
  we drive, when we're walking, when we're dealing with our families; to make everything a
  part of it, and not to escape.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Someone might ask in the same vein, &quot;Doesn't
  meditation fragment us from the world?&quot; It can if one tries to escape, but what we're
  training here is an awareness that can be used throughout our day.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What about social responsibility? We're on the brink of
  nuclear war. There is exploitation and injustice in every country. There are 40 wars going
  on right now, in Iraq, Iran, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon,
  Cambodia, Laos, Libya, Angola, Afghanistan, all these places, and God knows where else.
  And it's not just a story. It's painful for millions of people, as is starvation, as are
  50,000 nuclear warheads which could literally destroy most of the human beings and many or
  most of the major animals that live on the planet in a painful way, easily, quickly.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One must listen to one's heart in this. It's interesting.
  You can make a compelling case for different sides. From that point of view you see that
  what's necessary is not to sit but to act. There is starvation. Nuclear war is imminent if
  we don't do something. There is compelling need, even in this very rich and affluent
  society, of people who are suffering in many ways. And what are we doing sitting around?
  It's quite convincing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is another side which is equally convincing, and
  that is: What is the cause of that starvation and all those wars, and that suffering? What
  do you think is the source of it? There's enough oil, there's enough food, there's enough
  resources on this planet. The cause of it is greed, and the cause of it is prejudice and
  hatred. We hate people of different religions, different skin color, different customs; we
  like our country, our family, our religion, our type. So there's hoarding, and there's
  grasping, and greed and hatred and ignorance. We've tried revolutions for many centuries.
  It's helped in some ways but in others it just keeps going around because we haven't
  touched the root of the problem. The way out of the root of the problem is for someone to
  discover what it means to not be caught up by anger, what it means to be free from that
  fear or that prejudice which arises in human hearts and minds, what it means to be
  unafraid of that which is painful as well as that which is pleasant -- to have the heart
  open to all of what the world presents.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We don't need more oil and food as much as we need
  somebody who understands how to avoid getting caught in anger and fear and prejudice. And
  that somebody is you. So instead of it being a luxury to meditate, from another point of
  view, it's a responsibility for anyone who can, to figure out in their own being, in their
  own life, what it means not to be caught by these forces, to learn some new way -- and
  then bring that to bear on the economic and social and political kinds of suffering as
  well in the world.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There's a favorite letter of mine from a Nobel Prize
  winner named George Wald, who is a biologist at Harvard. He wrote it in response to an
  argument about the starting of a Nobel laureate sperm bank. Some irate feminist wrote into
  the paper saying, &quot;Sperm banks, they should have an egg bank. Why just sperm?&quot;
  He says:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">You're right, Pauline. It takes an egg as well as a sperm
    to start a Nobel laureate. Everyone of them has had a mother as well as a father. Say all
    you want of fathers, their contribution to conception Is really rather small.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nobel laureates aside, there isn't much technically in the
    way of starting an egg bank. There are some problems but nothing so hard as involved in
    the other kinds of breeder reactors.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But think of a man so vain as to insist on getting a
    superior egg from an egg bank. Then he has to fertilize it. And when it's fertilized,
    where does he go with it, To his wife? &quot;Here, dear,&quot; you can hear him saying,
    &quot;I just got this superior egg from an egg bank and just fertilized it myself. Will
    you take care of it?&quot; &quot;I've got eggs of my own to worry about,&quot; she
    replies. &quot;You know what you can do with your superior egg. Go rent a womb, and while
    you're at it, you better rent a room too.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">You see, it just won't work. For the truth is that what
    one really needs is not Nobel laureates but love. How do you think one gets to be a Nobel
    laureate? Wanting love, that's how. Wanting it so bad one works all the time and ends up a
    Nobel laureate. It's a consolation prize.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What matters is love. Forget sperm banks and egg banks.
    Banks and love are incompatible. If you don't know that, you don't know bankers. So just
    practice loving. Love a Russian. You'd be surprised how easy it is, and how it will
    brighten up your morning. Love whales, Iranians, Vietnamese, not just here but everywhere.
    When you've gotten really good you can even try loving some of our politicians.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the other voice. He said this amazing thing, that
  even the Nobel Prize is a consolation prize because what human beings most want is to be
  honored, to be loved, to be recognized. And what the world most compellingly needs is
  someone who understands how not to get caught in these ancient human patterns of
  prejudice, fear and anger.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Doesn't meditation make people withdraw from the world
  anyway? One has seen that for sure. There's a fine teaching in the Buddhist tradition
  called, The Near Enemies. The near enemy of love is attachment. It masquerades like love,
  it feels like it, but it's separate. It says, &quot;I love you but really I'm attached to
  you. I need you out there to make me whole.&quot; Rather, the sense of love is honoring
  and seeing our connection.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The near enemy to compassion is pity. &quot;Oh, that poor
  person, they're suffering. I don't suffer, not me certainly,.&quot; but they all do, and
  it separates them again. The near enemy to equanimity or balance of mind is indifference.
  It feels like, &quot;Ah, everything is fine basically because I don't give a shit. I don't
  care about anybody,&quot; believing that in not caring we can find some peace. Real
  equanimity is when the heart begins to open and we find a capacity to experience all that
  the world presents -- with balance, with love, with openness.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Our training in meditation is not a running away from the
  world at all. It's really a sitting down right in the middle of it, paying attention to
  that which is pleasant and that which is painful, that which makes a lot of noise, that
  which is silent, and begin to listen to our relationship to it, to observe it, to learn
  from it, and learn a wise way of relating.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then what is the heart of this inner way of practice? The
  heart of it is mindfulness, listening, paying attention to our bodies, to all the various
  energies, to the voices, paying attention when we eat. Which voice do you listen to when
  you stop a meal? Is it the belly which maybe speaks first and says, &quot;Oh, I had
  enough. Comfortable, nice and full.&quot; And then the tongue chimes in, &quot;Gee, but
  that fruit was so good, let's have a little more.&quot; And the eyes say, 'Yeah, there's
  more of that other stuff too that we haven't finished yet.&quot; And you hear all these
  different voices. In our culture we don't listen to our bodies so much. Like James Joyce
  somewhere in <i>Ulysses</i> said something like, &quot;Mr. Duffy lived a short distance
  from his body.&quot; We do in some fashion, you know.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first foundation of mindfulness -- to become wise --
  is to live in the physical reality of our body, to live in the feelings, to be aware of
  emotions, to be aware of the pleasant and neutral and unpleasant aspect of our experience,
  and to learn that we don't have to resist that which is painful and grasp that which is
  pleasant all the time. That's perhaps our conditioning, but in fact it doesn't lead to
  peace, it doesn't lead to happiness, because things change anyway. Even if you're attached
  to them they change.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's an open-hearted and non-judging awareness which comes
  into the body and into the feelings and then observes the mind as well as its laws, the
  law of karma, the laws of impermanence, and begins to see how to relate to it all out of
  compassion, kindness and wisdom, which means seeing how it's really operating. Sometimes
  it gets very painful when you sit. Sometimes it's pleasant; you have bliss and light. Then
  you get attached. Sometimes it gets painful and then you want to avoid it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thomas Merton said at one point:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">True prayer and love are learned in the hour when prayer
    becomes impossible and the heart is turned to stone.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes it's in the very greatest difficulties in our
  sitting or in our life that our heart opens the most, or we finally get the fact that we
  can't get attached to things and hold on to them; that they don't go the way we think but
  the way that they go. So wisdom begins to arise.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">How then to work with the basic difficulties which arise
  in meditation? What to do when there's physical pain? As best you can, sit and quietly
  mentally note &quot;pain, pain,&quot; paying attention. See if you can notice how it
  changes. Sit comfortably. Don't make pain for yourself. There's plenty in this life
  without it. But if you'll notice, sometimes it comes anyway. Then see if you can learn
  some balance with it. When you observe pain, one of three things will happen. Do you know
  what will happen if you observe it? Sometimes it will go away; sometimes it will stay the
  same; and sometimes it will get worse. That's not your business.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Your job in meditation is to start to see things as they
  are; light and dark, and up and down, pleasant things and painful things; to open to them,
  to start to pay attention to all of what makes up our reality. That develops what is
  called in spiritual discipline, a heart of greatness. If you open the door to the outside,
  what do you get when you open it? You get whatever is out there. You get the weather for
  that day. And if you keep the door open, you get the changes in the weather. If you open
  your mind and your body and your heart, what do you get? You get everything. You get
  what's painful and what's pleasant. And there is a way to come to a new relationship with
  it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In working with difficulties -- desire, anger,
  restlessness, doubt, fear which are the traditional hindrances which arise in meditation
  -- how can one work with them, how can one make one's spiritual practice so that these
  become workable?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There's a story in the community of George Gurdjieff of
  this obnoxious and very difficult man who finally left, for he was having such a hard
  time. Gurdjieff paid him to come back. Everyone was upset because they all had to pay a
  lot to live there, and here is Gurdjieff paying this old creepy guy who gets annoyed at
  everybody and is dirty. They asked him why he did that, and he said, &quot;This man is
  like yeast for bread. Without him, you wouldn't really learn the meaning of patience or
  compassion or loving kindness. You wouldn't learn that about yourself.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So when these states of mind arise -- restlessness,
  desire, fear, wanting, worry, agitation, or judgment, if only it were somehow different
  than it is, &quot;I don't like this&quot; -- what to do with them? Sit in the very middle
  of them and study them. Note how they feel in the body. There's desire. Desire runs much
  of our world. If you watch TV that's all they sell is desire. Pay attention to see what
  it's like, how do you feel it in the body, what is it like in the mind. Give clear and
  careful mindful attention to it, without getting caught -- not suppressing it, or trying
  to get it go away, and not getting involved. Just noting, &quot;desire, desire,
  wanting,&quot; until you come to see its nature and you come to some balance where you're
  not so caught up in it or afraid of it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The same for anger. Most of us are either afraid of it and
  stuff it down or we act it out. See if when judgment or anger arises you can just sit and
  note, &quot;angry, furious, judging,&quot; whatever it is, and feel it. Heat, movement,
  energy in the body, certain contractions, different qualities of mind, see if it is
  possible to experience that energy and learn from it. See how it changes, what it does to
  you, what its flavor is, its effect on you, and then maybe you can learn not to be quite
  so caught in it. It doesn't mean it won't still come, heaven knows, but your relationship
  to it can be a wiser one. Do it again and again -- with fear, with all the kinds of mental
  states that come up, especially the difficult ones -- until you can sit and allow them to
  come and go like cows or sheep in the meadow.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What if they're very strong, what if they're too
  difficult, they're really, really hard, what should you do? You're so restless you just
  can't stand it, what to do? Die! Be the first yogi to ever die of restlessness. Just say,
  &quot;Fine, take me.&quot; Surrender to it and let it kill you. And what you discover if
  you do that is that in a way you die; what dies is your resistance to it, and that you
  just carry on. You discover this powerful capacity we have, if you work with it, to open
  to all of our experience and find some balance in it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you're more advanced, if you've done practice for
  awhile, you may also wish to work with the capacity one has to go into the very middle of
  something. If there's desire, anger, or fear, or whatever it is, not just to feel it, but
  see if you can find the very center of it and discover what's there, and maybe go through
  the center in some way. I'll just leave that as a <i>koan</i> for you right now.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, what about all the different kinds of meditation?
  Here one is learning Vipassana. How about Tibetan meditation, Zen or TM, and so forth?
  There are a lot of good ways to practice. There are these two students of a master who
  were arguing. One says, &quot;It's really good to sit very still and not move and just
  work with whatever pain comes,&quot; and the other one says, &quot;No, no, that's macho.
  You want to relax and be gentle, and just be aware, but you don't make a lot of effort in
  it.&quot; And they're arguing and they can't seem to get any answer. And they go to the
  master. One says, &quot;You've really got to make effort to bring your mind back and to
  stay very present and not to move, and in that way you get through all this stuff. You
  learn how to be still in the middle of anything.&quot; And the master says, &quot;You're
  right.&quot; And the other one says, &quot;But wait a second. Don't you want to learn to
  be loving and gentle, to move if you really need to, and just to find a balance with it
  all, to be soft and not to struggle against it, but simply to open.&quot; The master says,
  &quot;You're right.&quot; And a third student who was sitting there says, &quot;But they
  can't both be right.&quot; And the master says, &quot;And you're right too.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are many good ways of meditation. There are some
  that are better than others, in the sense that some have a limited purpose, but there are
  many major schools of meditation which are wonderful if they develop awareness or
  mindfulness of the body, or the mind and the heart are sense-experienced, where you
  observe how the world is working. They can bring you to liberation, they can bring you to
  freedom. So it doesn't really matter which kind you've chosen. If you're doing Vipassana
  practice, wonderful! If what's accessible or interesting to you is Zen, fine! What's
  important is that you pick one and you stay with it and do it. Its takes discipline. If
  you want to learn to play the piano, it takes more than just a day once in awhile, a few
  minutes here and there. If you're lucky, after a year you'll be able to play &quot;Happy
  Birthday To You.&quot; If you really want to learn something in a full way -- tennis,
  piano, not to speak of training the mind and opening the heart -- it takes perseverance,
  patience and a systematic training. Pick a practice, use it, work with it every day, work
  with a teacher if you can, or in circumstances where you sit with other people. And in
  doing it over and over again, it starts to develop your capacity to open; it starts to
  train you to be more in the present moment; it starts to develop this sense of patience.
  When you sit and really feel what's in there, it brings a kind of compassion.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, what's the particular value of intensive retreats?
  What's the value of leaving the world to go off on a weekend or a ten-day retreat, or even
  a day here?. Why not just do it at home? There are two things to say. First again is a
  story of Mullah Nasrudin. He's out in his garden one day sprinkling bread crumbs around,
  and a friend comes by and says, &quot;Mullah, why are you sprinkling those bread
  crumbs?&quot; He says, &quot; Oh, I do it to keep the tigers away.&quot; And the friend
  says, &quot;But there aren't any tigers within thousands of miles of here.&quot; And
  Nasrudin says, &quot;Effective, isn't it?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One tends to get rote or go on automatic pilot in whatever
  one does. Have you noticed that? You learn how to do it, you master it a little bit, and
  then you check out. Part of the process of meditation is to wake up from being on
  automatic pilot or Zombieland. It's kind of ironic because you come here and you walk
  around very slowly, you don't look at anybody, and you look more like a zombie. But inside
  it's a different story. What we're doing is breaking our habit. If you walk at your normal
  pace, la, la, la, and whistle while you walk down the street, what would happen most
  likely is that your mind would immediately go off some place else.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We use the form of intensive retreats, of a day or a
  weekend, to use the silence, to use a bit of stillness, to slow down, all as ways to break
  the habit of automatic pilot, to begin to awaken in a new situation. Then you can take
  that back to your daily life. We use it also because there is a great strength that comes
  in meditating in groups. Especially in the beginning it's hard to do, and you're sitting
  here and squirming, and everybody looks like they've been meditating for hundreds of years
  except you, and you'd be embarrassed to get up, so you stay with it, which is not a bad
  thing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There's another reason for taking more than twenty minutes
  or half an hour or an hour a day for meditation, and that is, when you do it in a number
  of hours of succession, there's a greater possibility that you will really get
  concentrated, and that you'll get quiet and silent inside. And in doing so, it becomes
  possible to see more deeply, to kind of dissolve the thought and go to the nature of the
  experience more directly and immediately, and see, in fact, how rapidly it changes, and
  how we grasp things outside ourselves or our self-image, or even that the basic sense of
  oneself is made out of thought and attachment, and that fundamentally we don't exist as
  some separate entity, that that's all created out of our rapid thought and attachment. We
  come to some radical new way of seeing -- that we are not, in fact, separate.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Einstein put it his way:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A human being is a part of the whole, called by us
    &quot;universe,&quot; a part limited in time and space. We experience ourselves, our
    thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of
    our consciousness. This delusion is really a prison for us, restricting us to our personal
    desires, and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free
    ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of understanding and compassion, to
    embrace all living creatures in the whole of nature and its beauty.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As we get silent and our awareness gets refined and
  deeper, when we pay careful attention to it, the sense of separation and solidity breaks
  down. So this is one of the strengths of doing deep or silent or retreat practice in
  meditation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What to do if you actually attain something in meditation?
  People ask that sometimes. &quot;You should be so lucky,&quot; is the first answer. But
  there is a second one, and the most important one. I remember when I went to my teacher
  Achaan Chaa after many ventures in meditating in other monasteries and different kinds of
  practice and experiences and recounted them all to him, feeling kind of pleased with what
  I learned and how I'd opened, and he just looked at me and said, &quot;Well, do you still
  have any greed?&quot; I said, &quot;Yeah.&quot; He said, &quot;Still got fear and
  anger?&quot; I said, &quot;Yeah.&quot; &quot;Still got delusion?&quot; I said, &quot;Ah,
  ha.&quot; He said, &quot;Fine, continue.&quot; That was all he said, just
  &quot;continue.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So what you see is that meditation is not to attain some
  state of mind -- they don't stay, you can't get them to stay -- but to come to each moment
  with awareness, with a greater sense of openness of heart, and with a clear seeing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What can we learn of most value in all of this? When
  people die, they commonly tend to ask of themselves only a few questions, maybe just one
  or two. One might be, &quot;Did I learn to live well -- freely, honestly,
  authentically?&quot; And maybe even more fundamentally than that, &quot;Did I love
  well?&quot; All the other things that one does have a certain measure of importance, but
  when it really comes down to it, it is, &quot;Have I loved well?&quot; When somebody says,
  &quot;Okay, death comes to your left shoulder and taps you and says, 'This is your last
  dance and it's all over,&quot; what is your reflection to be? What do you care about? What
  meditation can open for us in our sitting, and even in the difficulties, is this
  possibility of learning to be freer in the ups and downs and changes of life and its
  pleasures and pains, and learning somehow to open and love, to be unafraid to express that
  love and to feel it in a full way.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the most beautiful images for meditation which I've
  seen was a poster of Swami Satchidananda wearing a little orange loin cloth, his long
  flowing beard, a very handsome kind of Indian guru figure, who is also a fine teacher. He
  teaches yoga and meditation. It showed him in the yoga posture standing on one leg, very
  graceful, only he was balanced on a surfboard on a big wave. It was very impressive. And
  underneath it said, &quot;You can't stop the waves but you can learn to surf. Meditate
  with Swami Satchidananda,&quot; or something like that. It captures the spirit of
  meditation practice and the teachings, and how to manifest it or bring it into a world
  that is full of senses, of sights and sounds and change.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The reason we go through all this trouble and do this
  strange looking thing, is to somehow live more fully, to see the people that we live with,
  to see the trees, to be present when we go for a walk in the park and not be thinking
  about the bills that need to be paid, and what happened yesterday; to live more fully
  here, to be able to love in a greater way by opening in ourselves all the corners of our
  minds to that which is difficult and that which is easy. Perhaps because it's our deepest
  desire to discover our true nature, to come to some sense of our oneness with life or to
  understand who we are or what all this strange thing that we got born into is about.
  Basically it's the only game in town, if you look at it; everything else is kind of
  transitory. It is simply to pay attention and discover what the whole process of life and
  death are about.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In order to do it, one needs to cultivate or practice
  mindfulness or awareness, to have it built on or foster some sense of inner stillness so
  that we can see and listen to all these things. It requires courage. It's not such an easy
  thing.</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Only as a warrior -- says Don Juan -- a spiritual warrior,
    can one withstand the path of knowledge. A spiritual warrior cannot complain or regret
    anything. His life is an endless challenge and challenges cannot possibly be good or bad.
    The basic difference between an ordinary person and a warrior is that a warrior takes
    everything as a challenge while an ordinary person takes everything as a blessing or a
    curse.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's a spirit of taking what comes to us and really
  working with it. Sometimes you take it as a challenge, and sometimes you do take it as a
  blessing or a curse, or you worry about it or complain. You can complain mindfully then,
  if that's what you want to do. You can learn from that as well as anything else. Let it be
  simple. The spirit of it is really one of opening, of discovery, of seeing; to sit, to
  walk, and to train yourself to bring the attention back, concentration, mindful balance,
  to observe the breath, the body, the feelings, the mind, and all of the movement of what
  we got ourselves into, and see how one can relate to it at times in ways that cause pain,
  how one can learn to relate to it with wisdom, with loving-kindness, with a greater sense
  of understanding and compassion.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's really not all that complicated. Sometimes it's
  difficult to do, but it's not all that complicated. Someone once asked Aldous Huxley as he
  was dying if he could say what he had learned in all of his experience with many spiritual
  teachers and gurus and much of his own spiritual life, and he said, &quot;It's
  embarrassing to tell you this, but it seems to come down mostly to just learning to be
  kinder.&quot; To be kind, though, means that you have to be here, you have to be present
  for what's actually in your experience. </font></p>
