        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In this presentation the author focuses 
        attention on the critical importance of the Doctrine of dependent 
        origination or Paticcasapumppàda in the realization of Liberation. He 
        also emphasizes its inter-connectedness with the Four Noble Truths, for 
        there is no gainsaying the fact that understanding and comprehending the 
        cause and end of suffering as explained in the Paticcasamuppàda is the 
        critical first step followed by the practice of the Noble Eightfold Path 
        that leads to liberation. &quot;It is through not understanding, not 
        penetrating this doctrine that this generation has become entangled like 
        a ball of string, . . . unable to pass beyond states of woe, ill 
        destiny, ruin and the round of birth and death-- <I>samsàra</I>&quot; (M. ii.

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This book would not have been possible but 
      for the encouragement I received from many people.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Madawala Seelawimala Mahathera and Bhikkhu 
      Bodhi Mahathera have been my primary sources of inspiration. The former, 
      my mentor for encouraging me and providing me with access to his library 
      and his deep knowledge of the suttas, and the latter by his continuing 
      authorship of a vast number of tracts explaining important suttas in 
      simple yet elegant and lucid language. To both of them I have much 
      pleasure in dedicating this book.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">My friend Sondra Jewel as well as Henepola 
      Gunaratana Nayaka Thera (author of several books on meditation), Madawela 
      Seelawimala Mahathera, and Prof. Lily de Silva read through the script 
      critically and pointed out inconsistencies and inaccuracies, and suggested 
      appropriate corrections.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">My three daughters, their spouses and my 
      three grandsons helped me in many ways. So did Dr. Udeni Balasuriya and 
      Dr. Jatal Mannapperuma. It is not possible to state in words how much I 
      owe Sita, my dearest wife of nearly fifty years. She has given me 
      much-needed encouragement at all times, and constantly prodded me to stay 
      on track.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Mr A.G.S. Kariyawasam has enriched this 
      presentation with careful editing.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Many people in the 
      Sacramento-Davis-Woodland area of California participated in my
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">vipassanà</SPAN> meditation programmes 
      over the last seven years, and many others participated in the Friday 
      meditation and discussion group at the West Sacramento Buddhist Temple. 
      Their enthusiasm, comments and questions have in many ways acted as a 
      catalyst to my comprehending many aspects of the Dhamma, which otherwise I 
      had previously taken for granted.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This book is written in memory of my dear 
      departed parents Arthur and Gertrude and our dear son Ajith. May their 
      journey through <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">sa§sàra</SPAN> be short 
      and free of difficulties and dangers.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In this presentation, we shall proceed on 
      a voyage of discovery. We shall first briefly discuss the fundamental 
      philosophy and doctrine of the Buddha, and then try to discover ourselves. 
      We shall see what we are really made of at the fundamental level. We shall 
      then observe how the mind and body work in close association, and the 
      pre-eminent position occupied by the mind in this process. Next we shall 
      address the issue of our moral weaknesses and strengths, and discover how 
      mindfulness can make us better members of society.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We shall discover the message underlying 
      the doctrine of Dependent Origination or <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">
      Paticcasamuppàda</SPAN> and then use such information as a tool to 
      understanding that everything in this world is insubstantial, conditioned 
      and that what we had understood as a permanent &quot;I&quot; is a mental illusion, 
      and that everything in the universe is subject to decay, impermanence and 
      suffering. This realization at the experiential level will encourage us to 
      follow the Noble Eightfold Path as a way to escape from the
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">samsàric</SPAN> round of births, deaths 
      and rebirths.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">At the end of each chapter, there will be 
      some footnotes giving references to the texts as well as Pàli words as 
      they first appear in the texts. References to the Buddha's own words as 
      quoted from the suttas have also been incorporated into the footnotes.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">To make some of the explanations easily 
      comprehensible, I have occasionally used examples from various scientific 
      disciplines. Undoubtedly these could be replaced by even better examples 
      as we continue expanding our scientific frontiers. Hopefully my attempts 
      will suffice for the present.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Let us only keep in mind the timelessness 
      of the Buddha-word.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The few pages on
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">vipassanà</SPAN> meditation were based on 
      the meditation practices of groups of participants and myself. They are 
      certainly not meant to replace well-recognized meditation masters or the 
      many excellent books on the practice. They are only for temporary guidance 
      until a suitable meditation master is found. Some books on meditation are 
      listed at the end of the book. However, meditation teachers and books can 
      help only up to a point. Ultimately it is the readers themselves who will 
      have to do the work.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I make no claim to originality in what I 
      have presented in this book. It is based on the discourses of the Buddha 
      and the commentaries and essays thereon by various distinguished authors 
      too numerous to enumerate. What is new is only the method of presentation 
      which emphasizes the fact that escape from suffering and attainment of 
      liberation is within our grasp, provided we make the attempt by 
      comprehending the Dhamma and gaining insight into the true nature of all 
      conditioned phenomena through <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">vipassanà</SPAN> 
      meditation.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Finally, I take full responsibility for 
      whatever omissions and errors there may be in the interpretation of the 
      profound doctrine of Dependent Origination or
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">Paticcasamuppàda</SPAN>, as well as in 
      the rest of the presentation.</FONT></P>

      It is acknowledged by all to be a teaching that continues to be a 
      challenge to students of Buddhism in their attempts at understanding it. 
      However, a mere intellectual understanding of dependent origination is not 
      enough. The truth contained therein must be directly grasped, personally 
      experienced and intuitively penetrated if we are to reap the maximum 
      benefits from it. In the text which follows, the term </SPAN>
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic; FONT-WEIGHT: normal">paticcasamuppàda</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There is yet another reason why we need to

      unsatisfactoriness or distress, and non-self or no-soul -
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">anicca, dukkha</SPAN>, and
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">anatta</SPAN>. It is with this combined 
      understanding that we can achieve liberation which is the extinction of 
      suffering and freedom from rebirth.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the contemporary scene with so much 
      interest in Buddhism in the West, it is perhaps opportune to offer a 
      simple and an easily understandable book containing the basic tenets of 
      Buddhism, plus an explanation of dependent origination and a method by 
      which this knowledge could be used to achieve liberation. What is not 
      called for is any previous knowledge of Buddhism. All that is required is 
      an open, unprejudiced mind. This book will, therefore, lead the reader 
      through an understanding of the doctrine of dependent origination to its 
      intimate relationship with the Four Noble Truths and finally to insight 
      into our very own selves through <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">

      <A NAME="The_Buddha"></A><B><FONT SIZE="4">The Buddha</FONT></B>
      <A HREF="#Chapt1">[Contents]</A>&nbsp;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha to-be was born over 2500 years 
      ago into the Sakyan Clan in a small state bordering India, which nestled 
      in the Himalayan foothills in what we now call Nepal. He was heir to the 
      Sakyan throne and lived a life of luxury in the capital city, Kapilavastu.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When he reached his late twenties, 
      shielded by his father from life's natural phenomena of birth, decay, 
      illness, and death, the prince was suddenly exposed to four eye-opening 
      experiences: A man weakened with age, a man decimated by sickness, decay, 
      and decrepitude, a corpse being carried on the shoulders of grieving 
      relatives for cremation, and an ascetic moving with measured step, 
      downcast eyes, and a serene countenance.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The prince thereafter became increasingly 
      introspective and thoughts such as the following began to stir within him 
      with increasing intensity: &quot;Youth, the prime of life, ends in old age and 
      man's senses fail him at a time when they are most needed. The hale and 
      hearty lose their vigour and health when disease creeps in. Finally death 
      comes perhaps suddenly and unexpectedly, and puts an end to this brief 
      span of life. Surely there must be an escape from this unsatisfactoriness, 
      from ageing and death.&quot;&nbsp;<A NAME="c1n6"></A><A HREF="#c1f6">[6]</A></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Suppose that, being myself subject to 
      ageing, sickness and death, to sorrow and defilement, I seek the unageing, 
      unailing, deathless, sorrowless and undefiled state, the supreme security 
      from bondage, Nibbàna&quot;.&nbsp;<A NAME="c1n7"></A><A HREF="#c1f7">[7]</A></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Accordingly, at the age of twenty-nine, on 
      the day of the birth of his only child Ràhula, he left his kingdom, going 
      from home to homelessness, discarding the enchantment of the royal life, 
      and rejecting the joys and pleasures that most young people yearn for. He 
      cut off his long hair with his sword, set aside his royal robes, and 
      putting on an ascetic's garb, retreated into sylvan solitude to seek a 
      solution to those problems of life that had deeply stirred his mind - a 
      solution, an answer to the riddle of life. He was searching for a true, 
      real, and practical way out of unsatisfactoriness and suffering, a way 
      leading to enlightenment<A NAME="c1n8"></A><A HREF="#c1f8">[8]</A><SPAN STYLE="FONT-WEIGHT: normal"> 
      and Nibbàna.&nbsp;<A NAME="c1n9"></A></SPAN><A HREF="#c1f9">[9]</A></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">He then spent six long years in 
      experimentation, self-mortification, reflection, contemplation and 
      meditation. Although these efforts were ultimately helpful in formulating 
      his doctrines in due course, they did not directly help in his quest for 
      enlightenment and liberation. The <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">
      bodhisatta</SPAN> (the name given to an aspirant before he attains 
      enlightenment) now thought 'is there another way for me to strive towards 
      enlightenment?'</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">And he brought to mind an incident which 
      took place just a short while back when a team of itinerant musicians and 
      dancing girls had passed through the grove where he was in meditation. 
      Unaware of his presence, they had played their instruments and one of the 
      dancing girls had shouted out to the lute-player and asked him to play a 
      tune, but warned him not to tune his lute too low nor too high. For, she 
      said, &quot;good music can be made only when the lute is tuned to the correct 
      pitch between these two extremes&quot;. And here a lesson could be learnt, he 
      thought.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Self-mortification and self-indulgence 
      are two extremes to be avoided.&quot;<A NAME="c1n10"></A><A HREF="#c1f10">[10]</A></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As a result, he decided then and there to 
      adopt this middle way, one which balanced care of the body with sufficient 
      time available for contemplation and deep investigation. One day when his 
      physical strength had returned, he approached a lovely spot in Uruvelà by 
      the banks of the river Neranjarà. There he prepared, underneath a Ficus 
      tree (later to be called the Bodhi Tree - <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">
      ficus religiosa</SPAN>), a seat of newly cut
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kusa</SPAN>-grass donated by a 
      grass-cutter. He then sat on it cross-legged, making a firm resolution 
      that he would not rise up until he had won the goal of liberation, 
      Nibbàna.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As night descended he entered into deeper 
      and deeper stages of meditation until his mind was perfectly calm and 
      composed. In the first watch of the night there unfolded before his inner 
      vision his experiences in many past births, extending over many cosmic 
      eons; in the middle watch of the night he developed the &quot;divine eye&quot; by 
      which he could see beings passing away and taking rebirth in accordance 
      with their <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma</SPAN><A HREF="#c1f11">[11]</A><SPAN STYLE="FONT-WEIGHT: normal"><A NAME="c1n11"></A> 
      and in the last watch he directed his concentration and focused his mind 
      to the penetration of the deeper truths of existence. Through this he 
      gained insight into the </SPAN>
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic; FONT-WEIGHT: normal">paticcasamuppàda</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="FONT-WEIGHT: normal"> 
      or the chain of conditioned existence encompassing the most basic laws of 
      reality and thereby removed from his mind even the subtlest veil of 
      ignorance. When dawn broke, he had achieved what he had been striving for. 
      He had &quot;awakened&quot; from ignorance. He had reached Enlightenment. He was a 
      Buddha who had in this very life attained the Deathless, the Unconditioned 
      which is Nibbàna.<A NAME="c1n12"></A></SPAN><A HREF="#c1f12">[12]</A></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">He was now ready to share his discoveries, 
      his Dhamma with one and all. Towards this end, he formulated his 
      discoveries into four simple laws, which he called the Four Noble Truths, 
      truths which, when fully and properly comprehended, ennobled the 
      practitioner by his realizing the goal of Nibbàna (hence the word 'Noble' 
      which precedes the word 'Truths').</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The 'world' in this case refers to us, the

      the tip of the middle finger of one outstretched hand to the tip of the 
      middle finger on the other outstretched hand; incidentally, this is the

      Path as it avoids the two extremes of self-indulgence and 
      self-mortification. It must be borne in mind that, although as a training 
      programme one is expected to graduate from virtue/morality to 
      concentration and then to wisdom, in actual practice they overlap or they 
      are interdependent and inter-related, and the further we progress, the

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Skilful 
      Speech:&nbsp;</SPAN>Along with skilful speech we must also look at non-skilful 
      speech such as slander, gossip, idle chatter, false and harsh speech. Once 
      we remove these impurities, we are left with skilful speech.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Skilful physical action:&nbsp;Non-skilful 
      physical action is when we hurt, wound or kill sentient beings. So also if 
      we steal, borrow with no intention of returning, participates in sexual 
      misconduct and use intoxicants. What will then remain is purity of action. 
      Intoxicants include, in the broader sense, various hallucinating drugs and 
      any substance which causes people to lose their sense of proportion or 
      their sense of values. A person could in fact become unskilful when 
      intoxicated with power because of the position the person holds.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Skilful 
      livelihood:&nbsp;</SPAN>It is important that we should abstain from earning a 
      living by means which bring harm to others, such as dealing in 
      intoxicants, firearms, running gambling dens, owning shares in casinos, 
      brothels, and so on.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;A good criterion for what is unskilful 
      livelihood is motivation. If one's motivation is impure, then that living 
      is unskilful. For example, if a practising physician were to wish that 
      people in his community be frequently struck down by epidemics, 
      necessitating medical intervention so that he could make more money, then 
      his motivation is bad. Similarly, if a merchant were to wish for 
      scarcities and non-availability of essential food items so that he could 
      raise the price of his goods arbitrarily, then his motivation too is bad, 
      and his livelihood is unskilful.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">How can both these persons conform to 
      skilful livelihood? One suggestion is that both of them change their 
      attitudes and develop <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">mettà</SPAN> or 
      universal kindness first towards themselves and then towards the rest of 
      the members of the community. Another is to set aside, in the case of the 
      physician, perhaps a half day each week for treatment of disadvantaged 
      members of the community and, in the case of the merchant, a certain 
      percentage of his monthly profits for charity or to subsidize purchases 
      made by disadvantaged persons in the neighbourhood.</FONT></P>

      at the surface level of the mind. By practising

      noticing bad and impure thoughts as they arise and surface. But, by simply 
      observing them with equanimity and letting them go, they can be 
      eradicated. Now our thought patterns change to thinking in the proper way

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">Samsàra</SPAN> 
      is the process of birth and death without beginning.
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">Samsàra</SPAN> means 'the round of 
      rebirth' or more literally 'the wandering around' continuously. According 
      to classical terminology, it could be said that
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">samsàra</SPAN> extends over manifold 
      worlds (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">loka</SPAN>) and involves rebirth 
      into various planes of existence, based on one's
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma</SPAN>. The Buddha has said: 
      &quot;Bhikkhus, this <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">samsàra</SPAN> is without 
      conceivable beginning. No first point is discerned of beings roaming and 
      wandering (in <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">samsàra</SPAN>), bonded by 
      ignorance and fettered by craving...&quot; (S. II, 178, 182). Our aim should 
      therefore be to terminate this cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In Buddhist texts, the word used to denote 
      the cosmos or universe is <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">loka</SPAN>. 
      Its uses are as numerous as the English word 'world'. The early Buddhist 
      texts do not state that the major world-systems are all there in the 
      universe. The question of whether the world is finite or infinite is left 
      unanswered. The standpoint of early Buddhism was to state that the 
      universe was &quot;without a known beginning&quot; and that it is 'conditioned'.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The first three of the aforementioned 
      mental processes are considered as concomitants or adjuncts of the fourth, 
      consciousness, which is defined as the primary factor of mental life. To 
      picture the way these four processes interact and work together, we have 
      to look at familiar examples. Consider our own endocrine system. It is a 
      group of specialized organs and body tissues that produce, store and 
      secrete chemical substances known as hormones. As the body's chemical 
      messengers, hormones transfer information and instructions from one set of 
      cells to another. Because of the hormones they produce, endocrine organs 
      have a great deal of influence over the body.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">These organs are sometimes called ductless 
      glands because they have no ducts connecting them to specific body parts. 
      The hormones they secrete are released directly into the bloodstream. The 
      primary glands that make up the human endocrine system are the 
      hypothalamus, pituitary, parathyroid, adrenal, pineal and the reproductive 
      glands. The pancreas, an organ often associated with the digestive system, 
      is also considered part of the endocrine system.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The hypothalamus, found deep within the 
      brain, directly controls the pituitary gland. It is often described as the 
      coordinator or the conductor of the endocrine system. When information 
      reaching the brain indicates that changes are needed somewhere in the 
      body, nerve cells in the hypothalamus secrete chemicals that either 
      stimulate or suppress hormone secretions from the pituitary gland. Acting 
      as liaison between the brain and the pituitary gland, the hypothalamus is 
      the primary link between the endocrine and the nervous systems.</FONT></P>
        <P ALIGN="left" STYLE="TEXT-ALIGN: left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">
        Now consider a musical sextet or a string quartet. Here too, the 
        individual musicians have to be coordinated under a single leader, a 
        conductor or lead-player in order to produce harmonious music. As in 
        these examples, our mind requires a lead-player, and it is consciousness 
        which plays this part. It is also consciousness which ensures the 
        continuity of the individual through the duration of a single life. When 
        a person is in an inactive state, like when he is sleeping or 
        unconscious, this life-continuum consciousness lies dormant in what is 
        called a <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">bhavanga</SPAN> state. But 
        when a sense organ makes contact (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">phassa</SPAN>) 
        with a sense object, then the appropriate sense consciousness is 
        activated as shown below, producing the desired effect:</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It will be noted from the above that in 
      addition to the functioning of the four aggregates comprising the mind, 
      two other activities of thought-perception and differentiation take place 
      immediately after perception and before reaction or mental formation (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">sankhàra</SPAN>). 
      In the Madhupinóika Sutta (M.18), the complete process is described as 
      follows: &quot;Dependent on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises. The 
      meeting of the three is contact. With contact as a condition there is 
      feeling. What one feels, that one perceives. What one perceives, that one 
      thinks about. What one thinks about, that one mentally proliferates. What 
      one has mentally proliferated as the source, perceptions and notions 
      tinged by mental proliferation beset a man with respect to past, future 
      and present forms cognizable through the eye.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One mind-moment takes only a nanosecond 
      and is immediately followed by another and still another. At a maximum, 
      seventeen mind-moments are needed for a single thought process to be 
      completed. It is only after numerous mind-moments that
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">sankhàras</SPAN> result in fruition as a 
      reaction. Hence it would not be incorrect to say that there is always 
      consciousness to monitor everything that is happening, while triggering 
      the other three aggregates to produce the desired effect. Thus, from the 
      moment a person is born up to his last breath or mind-moment, these four 
      processes occur continuously.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Perhaps we can better understand how the 
      four aggregates of the mind work by means of a practical example. Suppose 
      a man opens his front door, looks outside and sees an object moving in his 
      direction.</FONT></P>
      <UL TYPE="i">
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">He is first aware in a general way of an 
        approaching object. This is consciousness (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">vinnàna</SPAN>).</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">He then, taking past experiences of the 
        approaching person into consideration, will either like or dislike the 
        person. But if that person is unknown to him, he will remain neutral 
        about liking or disliking. This is sensation (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">vedanà</SPAN>).</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">He then recognizes the object/subject 
        (by instantaneously comparing it against previous experiences). This is 
        perception (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">sannà</SPAN>).</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Immediately thereafter, he will react (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">cetanà</SPAN>) 
        with either pleasure or displeasure, or with no reaction (indifference), 
        which will be followed by appropriate action. This is reaction (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">sankhàra</SPAN>).</FONT></P>
      </UL>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Once this mind-moment is completed, it 
      will be followed immediately by the next mind-moment and then another and 
      so on. This is the pattern, which will be followed throughout life, except 
      when one is asleep or rendered unconscious.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Hence, human experience can be considered 
      to be a rapid sequence of mind-moments, which occur, in a fixed sequence 
      of sensation, perception and reaction within the framework of 
      consciousness. When the sensation phases become concentrated through this 
      repetition of mind-moments, the reaction takes on a physical or a mental 
      aspect. For instance, in the above example, the man may welcome the 
      approaching person with kind words or, if he dislikes the person, the 
      welcome could be a negative one. Finally, if the approaching person is a 
      stranger, the welcome could be indifferent, such as 'may I help you?'</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Citta</SPAN>: A single 
      act of consciousness is called a <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">citta</SPAN>. 
      It is made up of many components. The principal factor in each citta is 
      consciousness itself. Its function is the basic experiencing of the object 
      and is itself given the name of the whole act viz,
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">citta</SPAN>. Besides the aggregates 
      themselves, there are the 'mental factors' such as emotions, which 
      influence and give the <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">cittas</SPAN> 
      their distinctive character. The most important of these are the acts of 
      consciousness influenced by the mind when it is subject to the three 
      defilements of greed, aversion and delusion, or to their 
      opposites-non-greed, non-hate and non-delusion.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Our consciousness receives signals all the 
      time from within ourselves or from outside. The functional continuity of 
      the consciousness of a person, as stated before, is ensured throughout 
      that person's existence in this life from conception to death. This 
      consciousness is called <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">bhavanga</SPAN>. 
      Whenever an object impinges on any sense-door, this
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">bhavanga</SPAN>-consciousness is 
      arrested, thus setting the stage for the cognitive and related processes 
      such as perception, sensation and reaction to perform their respective 
      functions. This is followed by volition (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">sankhàra</SPAN>). 
      This is the stage, which is most important from an ethical point of view, 
      since it is here that wholesome and unwholesome thoughts (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">cetanà</SPAN>), 
      which are <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kammically</SPAN> effective,

      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">sankhàra</SPAN> as well, but they are not 
      directly relevant to understanding how the four aggregates of mentality 
      work together. We need to remember that all four of the above 
      psychological states, namely consciousness, perception, sensation and 
      reaction are causally conditioned by various factors such as one's

      It is difficult to define <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">dhàtu</SPAN> in 
      modern terms and language, for they mean much more than what we know as 
      elements of the periodic table and as 'particles' of current 
      particle-science). For, in its original form, this word also conveys its

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">These four primary elements manifest 
      themselves in the human body in various permutations and combinations. But 
      at the fundamental level they are sub-atomic particles in constant motion, 
      arising and vanishing in unimaginably rapid succession. Ultimately matter 
      is nothing but crystallization of energy, thus giving them an apparent 
      false reality. Our skeletal structure has a preponderance of the solid 
      element with small quantities of the others. Our circulatory and lymphatic 
      systems are filled mainly with the fluid element, and the lungs and 
      respiratory system are filled with the air element. Digestion and body 
      warmth is performed by caloricity, and we can move about by a combination 
      of the air and the fluid element.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In addition to the above, combinations of 
      these primary elements are considered to have various types of secondary 
      qualities such as colour, odour, taste and nutritive essence. The five 
      aggregates, which we discussed above, cover the entire range of experience 
      of a sentient being. Form covers all physical phenomena, both within one's 
      body and without. The four remaining categories of mentality cover all 
      mental events: feelings are characterized by pleasure, pain and neither 
      pleasure nor pain, regardless of whether they are based on physical or 
      mental sensations. Perception denotes the mental act of applying labels or 
      names to physical or mental events. Mental formations cover the verbal and 
      mental processes of concocting thoughts, questions, urges or intentions in 
      the mind, while consciousness covers the act of consciousness at any of 
      the six sense-doors: the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body and intellect 
      (mind).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is by understanding the complex 
      inter-relationships among these aggregates that one is led into the area

      abandoned.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Let us take
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma</SPAN> first. It is the law that 
      every action has some effect, some reaction.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We may have experienced and also realized 
      that our actions affect the quality of our mind.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Each of our actions has an impact on our 
      mind, and thus the quality of our mind has a direct influence on the 
      quality of our life. The teaching of <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">
      kamma</SPAN>, however, goes much deeper and gives a more thorough 
      explanation of the whole process. Society is usually accustomed to measure 
      the quality of actions predominantly by the impact they have on its 
      surroundings. In the teaching of <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma</SPAN> 
      we instead focus on <SPAN STYLE="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">the effects our 
      various actions have on ourselves.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">All actions performed through the three 
      doors of body, speech and mind are <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma</SPAN>. 
      More precisely, <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma</SPAN> is the 
      volition, the intention - <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">cetanà</SPAN> - 
      behind the action. These <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kammic</SPAN> 
      volitions have the inherent potential to bring about a corresponding type 
      of result, a <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma-vipàka</SPAN>. 
      Volitions have often been compared to seeds and the results they bring 
      forth as the fruits. By <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma</SPAN> we 
      mean the whole accumulated potential of all present and past volitions 
      which have not yet produced their results.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The teaching of
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma</SPAN> is somewhat similar to the 
      physical law of the preservation of matter and energy.
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">Kamma</SPAN> might be considered an 
      example of this law - the conservation of the positive and negative 
      energy, which we generate, from the visible realm of matter into the more 
      subtle dimensions of the mind. But we need to emphasize that while the 
      physical law of action and reaction is mechanical, the law of
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma</SPAN> and
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma-vipàka</SPAN> rests on volition. 
      For, each of our volitions leaves behind an imprint or dormant bud of 
      energy in our minds, and when these kammic impulses ripen under suitable 
      external conditions, they will bring forth some result.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Let us remember that mental processes or 
      mental impulses are very significant. Think of the minds, which created 
      the microchip or sent man to the moon. Truly the mind, as the Buddha said, 
      is the forerunner of all actions. To impress on us the dynamics of kamma, 
      let us bring to mind Newton's third law of motion; &quot;For every action there 
      is an equal and opposite reaction&quot;. The law of kamma is an impersonal 
      energy dynamic, for when its effects are personalized or, in other words, 
      experienced from the point of view of the personality, they are 
      experienced as a reversal in that direction,
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">a coming back to the intender of the 
      energy of his or her intention</SPAN>. Those who can recollect playing 
      with a 'Newton's cradle' will remember this vividly.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In these examples the person who develops 
      hatred for others experiences hatred from others. On the other hand, the 
      person who develops love for others experiences love from others and so 
      forth. In other words, <SPAN STYLE="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">you receive from 
      the world what you give to the world; what goes around comes around!</SPAN> 
      However, we should always keep in mind that &quot;although we used physical 
      energy systems for ease of comprehension of
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma</SPAN> and
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma-vipàka</SPAN>, there is a distinct 
      difference between the law of <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma</SPAN> 
      and the law of physics. In the law of <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">
      kamma</SPAN>, volition plays a critical role, and in the absence of greed, 
      hatred and delusion, <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kammic</SPAN> energy 
      is not generated. Further, with the attainment of arahatship, no more
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kammic</SPAN> energy is generated for 
      this very reason.&quot;<A NAME="c2n8"></A><A HREF="#c2f8">[8]</A></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We should remember that
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma</SPAN> is an immanent law, which 
      governs the balancing of energy in our continuing existence. It is 
      impersonal, yet a law, and the balancing of energy does not always occur 
      within the span of a single lifetime. It is not a simple tit-for-tat kind 
      of law. Therefore, without some knowledge of rebirth along with that of
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma</SPAN>, it is not possible for a 
      person to understand the significance or the meaning of events in his or 
      her own life.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Let us take a hypothetical example: 
      classmates of a student give him a derogatory nickname. He is quite 
      unhappy and feels frustrated, and he does not understand that this 
      experience is simply bringing to completion an impersonal process. The 
      wrongs other people do to him are the direct result of one's own past 
      actions, both in previous as well as in this present existence. But the 
      student is not aware of this. Consequently, he could become, for example, 
      angry or vengeful or depressed, or withdraw into sorrow to suffer in 
      silence. Each of these responses creates <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">
      kamma</SPAN>, another imbalance of energy, which in turn must be balanced 
      sometime in the future. In this way, one <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">
      kammic</SPAN> debt has been paid, so to speak. Unfortunately, without his 
      realizing it, the student has created another
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kammic</SPAN> debt! (Incidentally, so 
      have his tormentors).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Let us now look at the ethical side. 
      Volitional actions may be 'morally wholesome', 'morally unwholesome', or 
      morally neutral, and they may be actions which find expression in 
      physical, verbal or mental behaviour.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The morally wholesome and unwholesome 
      actions are said to give rise to appropriate consequences: They may find 
      expression in this life, the next, or in lives to come unless their 
      potentialities are extinguished or they do not find an opportunity for 
      fruition. <SPAN STYLE="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">And the word kamma is used to 
      denote volitional acts, which find expression in thoughts, words and 
      deeds.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If the volition, or intention behind an 
      action is governed by the three unwholesome roots of greed, aversion or 
      delusion (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">lobha, dosa, moha</SPAN>), the 
      ensuing kamma is unwholesome and will bring forth unsatisfactory, 
      undesirable, unpleasant results. If our volition is governed by non-greed 
      (generosity, selflessness), non-hatred (kindness, friendliness), and 
      non-delusion (clear understanding, insight, wisdom), then the kammic force 
      will be wholesome, bringing forth happiness and other desirable results.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It must be kept in mind that the teaching 
      of Buddhism is not that of continuing to perform good kamma for the sake 
      of rewards in continued <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">samsàric</SPAN> 
      existence. <SPAN STYLE="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">On the contrary, it is the 
      elimination of the effects of </SPAN>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What happens to a person when he/she dies? 
      To the average person, the material and mental constituents of what we 
      call a 'person' disintegrates - ashes to ashes dust to dust. But is that 
      all? According to Buddhist understanding, the accumulated, and yet unused
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kammic </SPAN>energy gives impetus to the 
      start of a new life. To put it in another way, the stream of 
      mind-movements, driven forward by craving, conditions the initiation of a 
      new series of consciousness, which continues in a new life form. Thus a 
      new life comes into being.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Therefore, in the ultimate sense, our 
      present life is a series of mind-moments rapidly rising and passing away, 
      based on a single physical organism which too is subject to constant 
      change. After death, this series of mind-moments of the consciousness 
      continues, finding support in a new physical organism. The last moment of 
      this life is followed by the first mind-moment at rebirth or re-becoming 
      in a new existence. We may perhaps be uncertain as to whether there is a 
      difference between re-birth and re-becoming. The word used to describe the 
      evolution from existence to existence is re-becoming (bhava). Rebirth in 
      this sense continues to take place until a person has spiritually evolved 
      to the state of an arahat.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One may then ask, 'is it I who is reborn, 
      or is the being in the next existence someone else?' Before we answer this 
      question, we need to understand more clearly 'who am I'? Perhaps the 
      easiest way to comprehend this would be to look at your old photograph 
      album. Compare the baby you were in your first year of life, then the 
      child at 5 years of age, then at 10, next at 16, and so on to the present. 
      Are they the same person or not? It is hard to say, and you may probably 
      think that they, frankly, are not the same. Compare last month and now, 
      and what about yesterday and today, then an hour ago? In fact you are not 
      exactly the same person now as when you started to read this chapter, 
      because from moment to moment we are not exactly the same, yet neither are 
      we entirely different.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As another example, let us take a stream 
      and a person bathing in it. The stream when he started to bathe and the 
      stream when he finished bathing were not the same, for the water in the 
      stream had constantly flowed by. In fact we would be also correct when we 
      say that the person who bathed in the river is not the same as the one who 
      left the stream for dry land. He too has changed considerably, with many 
      biochemical and developmental changes having taken place during the 
      interim period. Re-becoming means exactly the same thing. The being of the 
      last existence and the being of the present life and the one due to arise 
      in the future are not quite the same, but also not entirely different. 
      According to Buddhism, 'he is neither the same nor another' (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">na 
      ca so, na ca anno</SPAN>) when we give a strictly accurate description, 
      although in common parlance we may say that he is the same person.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp; When we look at life, we see that 
      no physical matter --&nbsp; what we call materiality -- , from the dying 
      body passes over to a new life. Neither does any part of the mind or 
      aggregate of mentality (be it consciousness, or perception, or sensation) 
      pass from the old life to the new. What connects the past existence with 
      the present one is the same link that connects yesterday and today, and 
      today and tomorrow. It is not a real 'I' but simply the sequence of cause 
      and effect. It is important to see the relationship between
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma</SPAN> and rebirth in terms of the 
      Dhamma, for it is <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma</SPAN> and 
      rebirth which show us the principal laws of conditioned existence. These 
      we shall study in the next chapter.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">Kamma</SPAN> 
      should never be understood as a kind of unchangeable fate. The most 
      important and far-reaching result of our past
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma</SPAN> is re-becoming itself, 
      re-becoming in a particular plane of existence. The plane of existence 
      into which rebirth will occur is determined by the consciousness that 
      arises just prior to death. In the case of human life, it refers to the 
      place of birth, the country, the family and the parents. These crucial 
      circumstances of our life occur in accordance with our past
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma</SPAN>.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Therefore, the only way to escape this 
      wandering is by getting rid of as much defilements as possible. It is 
      necessary for us to remove greed, hatred and delusion and develop the 
      opposites of these, namely greedlessness, hatelessness or non-aversion, 
      and wisdom (non-delusion), respectively. These will eventually bring about 
      a happy and an equanimous disposition conducive to morality, compassion, 
      appreciative-joy and universal-kindness. With such positive mental 
      qualities, it should be possible for us to proceed successfully along the 
      Eightfold Path, ending finally in wisdom and liberation.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The arising of mind and body at conception 
      and its continuity during the course of life is the result of our past 
      volitions. More particularly, our mental and bodily features, our 
      personality traits, propensity towards health or illness, beauty or 
      ugliness, the quality of our sense faculties, our intelligence, 
      popularity, social status and skills, - all these are fundamentally rooted 
      in our past actions.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">According to the Dhamma, there are three 
      universal characteristics common to all living and non-living things in 
      the Universe.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">They are:</FONT></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">- the characteristic of impermanence<BR>
        - the characteristic of unsatisfactoriness<BR>
        - the characteristic of selflessness</FONT></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">These three characteristics are always 
      present in, or connected with, existence and they tell us about the nature 
      of existence.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As a result of understanding these three 
      characteristics, we can learn to develop detachment. Once we understand 
      and comprehend the fact that impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and non-self 
      universally characterize all existence, we can eliminate our attachment to 
      continued existence and enter the threshold of total liberation. This is 
      the purpose of understanding these three characteristics: it removes 
      attachment by identifying delusion and confusion --&nbsp; the 
      misunderstanding that existence is permanent, pleasant and has something 
      to do with the self.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is why understanding the three 
      characteristics is called wisdom.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The fact of impermanence should be obvious 
      to anyone who looks objectively at life and the world in which we live. 
      Everything is ever changing, subject to destruction, unstable, unreliable 
      and constantly decaying. No matter how much we try to hold on to 
      something, it is not the same as it was moments ago, --&nbsp; just like 
      the person bathing in the stream that we examined earlier.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Another useful exercise is to closely 
      observe and analyze in our minds the flame of a burning candle. We take 
      note of the flame and we see five unique characteristics: the flame's 
      arising, developing, continuing, flickering and dying out completely. This 
      is what we should see as happening to all of us. For ours too is a cycle 
      of impermanence of birth, growing up, being young and strong, ageing, 
      decaying and finally passing away. Similarly, our mental states are also 
      impermanent. At one moment we are happy, and at another sad. As infants, 
      we hardly understand anything: as adults in the prime of life, we 
      understand a great deal more and in our old age, we lose the power of our 
      mental faculties and become like infants once again.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The third universal characteristic of 
      existence is non-self, impersonality or insubstantiality. This is one of 
      the distinct and unique features of the teachings of the Buddha. The 
      Buddhist doctrine of non-self denies a permanent entity or soul which runs 
      through different existences without change of identity, while it does not 
      deny the continuity of an evolving consciousness --&nbsp; a stream of 
      consciousness determining its state of re-becoming in different forms of 
      cosmic existence.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp; Briefly, we could perhaps 
      understand that everything in this world could be considered as self-less 
      because we cannot find a part in anything that can be called the self; nor 
      can we tell our body not to get sick or to stop ageing. This so-called 
      being is composed of just five components - body, feeling, perception, 
      mental function and consciousness. None of these components can be called 
      the self and even outside of these five factors there is no permanent 
      'self'. If just one of these components is removed, nothing remains. Since 
      all things are changing all the time, including ourselves, there is no 
      rationale for us to believe that there is a permanent self.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Before we leave these three subjects, let 
      it be emphasized that the truth of impermanence must not only be accepted 
      intellectually, but it must be experienced as a reality within ourselves 
      during vipassanà meditation. By directly understanding impermanence, as 
      well as non-self and unsatisfactoriness, we reach true insight, which 
      leads to liberation. However, the Buddha realized and taught that full 
      liberation comes only when the three fundamental evils of desire, 
      hatred/aversion and delusion/confusion are extinguished. Then only one is 
      freed from the bondage of 'self' with the destruction of ignorance.</FONT></P>

      state of mind that realizes Nibbàna is called liberation (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">vimokkha</SPAN>). 
      The three contemplations leading to Nibbàna are called doors to liberation 
      (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">vimokkha-mukha</SPAN>). If the door to 
      liberation is the contemplation of impermanence, the signless liberation (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">animitta-vimokkha</SPAN>) 
      arises. If it is the contemplation of suffering, the desireless/wishless 
      liberation (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">appanihita-vimokkha</SPAN>) 
      arises. If it is the contemplation of non-self, the voidness/emptiness 
      liberation (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">sunnatà-vimokkha</SPAN>) 
      arises. The signless liberation focuses upon Nibbàna as devoid of the 
      'signs' determinative of a conditioned formation; the wishless liberation 
      as freedom from the hankering of desire; and the emptiness liberation as 
      devoid of a self or any kind of substantial identity. These three

      marks of the conditioned: impermanence, suffering, and selflessness.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In each case, the understanding of the 
      conditioned and the realization of the unconditioned are found to lock 
      together in direct connection, so that by penetrating the conditioned to 
      its very bottom and most significant features, the aspirant passes through 
      the door leading out of the conditioned to the supreme security of the 
      unconditioned, which is Nibbàna. The breakthrough to the unconditioned 
      comes in four stages called the four supramundane paths (described below).

      The Doctrine</B></FONT>&nbsp;<A HREF="#Chapt3"><BR>
      [Contents]</A></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha followed the expounding of the 
      Noble Eightfold Path with many other discourses, including those on kamma 
      and rebirth and other related subjects to explain the nature of reality in 
      a very encompassing way: in a way to make known the unsatisfactory and 
      untenable predicament of all beings in <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">
      samsàra</SPAN>. These dangers are very apparent when we consider the 
      workings of the immanent law of <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma</SPAN>. 
      In this way he made people to reflect on whether there was a reasoned and 
      acceptable method for escape from this spiral of continuing existence. The 
      Buddha, as a skilled teacher, adopted diverse styles of presentation of 
      his Dhamma, depending on his audience - whether they were
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">devas</SPAN><A NAME="c3n1"></A><A HREF="#c3f1">[1]</A><SPAN STYLE="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">,
      </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic; FONT-WEIGHT: normal">Sangha</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">, 
      lay-disciples or non-believers. Because he laid stress on the importance 
      of dependent origination<A NAME="c3n2"></A></SPAN><A HREF="#c3f2">[2]</A><SPAN STYLE="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">, 
      the Buddha in many later suttas (as recorded in the Tipitaka<A NAME="c3n3"></A></SPAN><A HREF="#c3f3">[3]</A><SPAN STYLE="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">) 
      has explained the dependent origination in many ways.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Determining that the manner in which this 
      profound doctrine would later be presented required the vast and unlimited 
      intelligence that is possessed only by a Buddha, he needed a mode of 
      presentation that was simple enough to memorize but not so simple as to 
      distort the teaching. It should be kept in mind that over two thousand 
      five hundred years ago, during the time of the Buddha, reading and writing 
      was the exclusive right of the priestly Brahmin class. Hence an oral 
      tradition had been developed to keep the Dhamma alive. He also needed 
      words that would point to the immediate realization of awareness in the 
      listener's mind. Finally, he needed a framework for the teaching as a 
      whole so that those who wanted to pursue specific points could also keep 
      track of the larger picture. The result was the
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">Paticcasamuppàda</SPAN> --&nbsp; 
      dependent origination, which was, of course, the Dhamma which the
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">bodhisatta</SPAN> had penetrated and 
      brought to fruition on the night of his awakening in becoming a Buddha, an 
      Enlightened One.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Consequently, over the last twenty-five 
      centuries the basic structure of this doctrine has come down to us 
      undiluted and unchanged. Many have mastered it, and those of us who wish 
      to do the same must follow the very same path used by our predecessors. At 
      the outset, the Buddha warned people that it was a profound and difficult 
      subject to comprehend. When Ànanda, his constant companion told him, &quot;It 
      is wonderful and marvelous, sir, how this dependent arising is so deep, 
      yet to myself it seems as clear as clear can be&quot;. The Buddha replied, &quot;Do 
      not say so, Ànanda! Do not say so, Ànanda! This dependent arising, Ànanda, 
      is deep and it appears deep.&quot; (Mahà Nidàna Sutta).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">By announcing this doctrine as deep, he 
      would stir the imagination and interest of the public, and people were 
      bound to inquire why this discourse was so deep. Then they would, more 
      often than not, want to study it. In a similar way, we too would like to 
      understand and comprehend the Dhamma as contained within this discourse. 
      For, in this age of advanced information technology, we now have many 
      special facilities to help us and at the end of the rainbow is the 
      proverbial pot of gold - Insight leading to liberation, and such release 
      from suffering and the round of <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">samsàra</SPAN> 
      is the attainment of Nibbàna.<A NAME="c3n4"></A><A HREF="#c3f4">[4]</A></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">You will recollect that in chapter one we 
      discussed what the Buddha discovered on the night of the day of his 
      Enlightenment, namely the Truth of conditioned arising. He did this by 
      reflecting on birth and death and the need to find the reason why one 
      wanders in <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">samsàra</SPAN> with no end in 
      sight. This he did by examining himself, both his body and his mind, at 
      the experiential level. As he went deeper and deeper into reflection and 
      meditation, he saw that it was clinging to the five aggregates, i.e., the 
      'form' and the four components of the mind-consciousness, perception, 
      sensation and reaction, which he called the 'five-aggregates of clinging, 
      (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">panca- upàdànakkhanda</SPAN>), rooted in 
      craving and born of ignorance that led to misery and suffering. Craving, 
      clinging and attachment at the surface level, he observed, are augmented 
      by greater misery at deeper levels.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">People may be happy with what they have, 
      but they always want something more. They develop attachment and become 
      addicted to craving resulting in endless misery. It is like a bottomless 
      pit, for, before long, one is attached to material things and identifies 
      them as 'I, mine'. People do not stop there; they become attached also to 
      beliefs, views, various theories and traditions and such among other 
      things.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;The Buddha out of compassion for the 
      world exclaimed that the people of this world fall into trouble and 
      sojourn on and on in <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">samsàra</SPAN>, not 
      knowing how to escape from their misery. There must be an escape, which 
      can be discerned. The Buddha then looked at this age-old problem 'with 
      careful attention, resulting in a breakthrough with wisdom' he asked 
      himself as to why was there sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, ageing, 
      decay and death. He saw that it was because of birth. He next asked 
      himself, 'Why birth? How does it come about?' The reason for this too was 
      very clear. It was due to becoming, the urge to exist, to become, to come 
      into being.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Let us look at these steps in the form of 
      a chart, with ageing, decay and death at the bottom, and then trace each

      and takes root. Where there are forms, sounds, smells, tastes, bodily 
      contacts and ideas, which are delightful and pleasurable, there craving 
      arises and takes root.&quot; (D.22) Craving is conditioned not only by the 
      pleasant, but by the unpleasant as well and those who suffer, be they the 
      poor, the unloved, the sick, the aged, the disabled, the unwanted - all 
      crave freedom from their suffering. Even the affluent and the healthy are 
      not free from craving. They crave for more and more. Man's appetite for 
      more and more is truly insatiable.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Clinging</SPAN>:&nbsp;Clinging 
      or attachment is four-fold. There is attachment to sense-desires, to wrong

      in an abiding self or an ego or 'I'. If this wrong notion is not got rid 
      of, the discernment of the other two characteristics of existence, namely 
      impermanence and suffering, becomes extremely difficult. On the other

      This is reminiscent of the relationship between certain species of fungi

      each was conditioned by the preceding factor, which in turn conditioned 
      the next and so on. Thus, for volitional formations the causal condition 
      was ignorance. For consciousness it was volitional formations and so on. 
      The Buddha explained it in this manner for the ease of memorisation and of 
      comprehension. However, he has stated elsewhere that there are in fact 
      twenty-four other conditions (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">paccaya</SPAN>) 
      also contributing in various combinations to condition each of the twelve 
      factors of dependent origination. It would suffice for our current

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the previous chapter was presented the 
      doctrine of dependent origination the way the Buddha discovered it and in 
      the manner in which he explained it. This was based on a number of 
      discourses of the Buddha. We left aside the more complex details, for our 
      purpose was simply to get the feel of this important subject.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha emphatically declared that the 
      first beginning of existence is inconceivable. It is impossible to think 
      or believe in a first beginning because no one can truly trace the 
      ultimate origin of anything, not even of a grain of sand, let alone of 
      human beings, - despite what present-day cosmologists are wont to say.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It should be realized that life is just a 
      'becoming'. It is merely a conflux of mind and body subject to 
      conditionality. According to the Buddha, all conditioned or compounded 
      things come into being, presently exist and then cease -
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">uppàda, thiti</SPAN>, and
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">bhanga</SPAN>.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">However, for us to fully understand this 
      profound subject, we need to review the information and explanations given 
      in Chapter&nbsp;2, plus the additional information given below. Even then, no 
      explanation can be expected to give a full and final understanding of the 
      process of dependent origination. Nevertheless, the information contained 
      here can be used to probe the process while at the same time train the 
      mind to come to a reasonable understanding of this profound and 
      fundamental doctrine.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One of the links of the
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">paticcasamuppàda</SPAN> which frequently 
      bothers people is the difficulty in visualizing how &quot;volitional 
      formations/kamma in one life conditions consciousness&quot; in the next. 
      Consciousness is the most subtle and deep point which is difficult to 
      grasp and comprehend, for it is this link that explains re-becoming and 
      rebirth. And this is what he told Ànanda:</FONT></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;If consciousness were not to descend 
        into the mother's womb, would mentality-materiality take shape in the

        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;If, after descending into the womb, 
        consciousness were to expire, would mentality-materiality be generated 
        into this present state of being?&quot; &quot;Certainly not, venerable Sir.&quot;...</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Therefore, Ànanda, this is the cause, 
        the source, the origin, and condition for mentality-materiality, namely, 
        consciousness.&quot; -- Mahà Nidàna Sutta.</FONT></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The rebirth-consciousness, which we are 
      discussing here is explained in the Abhidhamma as follows: for rebirth 
      consciousness to take place, it must be preceded by death in the immediate 
      previous existence. Death-consciousness or<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic"> 
      cuti-citta</SPAN> is the very last consciousness to occur at the moment of 
      death. It is the <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">citta</SPAN> which marks 
      the exit from a particular life. Death-consciousness is of the same type 
      as the rebirth-linking consciousness and moment-to-moment consciousness (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">bhavanga</SPAN>), 
      and like them it pertains to the process-freed side of existence, the 
      passive flow of consciousness outside an active cognitive process. 
      Death-consciousness is followed by a rebirth-linking consciousness called 
      the <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">patisandhi-citta</SPAN> which occurs 
      only once in any individual existence. It is at the moment of rebirth and 
      is conditioned immediately by the previous death-consciousness.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;This rebirth-linking consciousness is 
      followed by the usual moment-to-moment consciousness (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">bhavanga</SPAN>), 
      which continues to be present throughout a person's life. It is different 
      from the consciousness which arises when the six-sense bases in a live 
      person come into contact with their respective sense-objects as follows:</FONT></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;With eye and forms arises visual

      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">At that time, when perception, sensation 
      and reaction are operative, the <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">bhavanga</SPAN> 
      consciousness lies dormant and comes into effect immediately thereafter. 
      (Please also see Chapter&nbsp;2). In the proposition, volitional formations/<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma</SPAN> 
      conditions consciousness, we have to understand that
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">sankhàra</SPAN> is equated to
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma</SPAN> and that the consciousness 
      referred to here is rebirth- consciousness.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">To understand this subject better, it is 
      necessary first to have an understanding of energy systems. We are aware 
      that every phenomenon in the cosmos is based on energy and accordingly we 
      generate energy whenever we think or do anything. This energy is what we 
      can equate to <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma</SPAN> and this 
      accumulated <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kammic</SPAN> energy gets 
      attenuated to different degrees when a person attains the three 
      transcendental paths of stream-winner, once-returner and non-returner 
      respectively. It comes to an end with the attainment of the fourth 
      transcendental path, which is arahatship.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">However, for the life processes to 
      continue too, energy is necessary. And we know that mitochondria, which 
      generate energy for vital activities are in all the cells of our body. And 
      such energy falls within the domain of physical energy.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the case of human conception too, like 
      in all human activities, energy is necessary, which fact embryologists 
      know when they carry out in-vitro fertilization. Perhaps the same type of 
      system prevails in the human body too when
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">in-vivo</SPAN> fertilization takes place. 
      In other words, energy is required at the point of conception. The 
      question then is, 'where does this energy come from'? Is it from within 
      the uterus, or could it be from the energy of rebirth-consciousness and
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma</SPAN>?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So let us picture what may perhaps happen 
      when a person is about to die. According to dependent origination, it is 
      the accumulated <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma</SPAN> of the 
      previous birth that acts as the specific condition for rebirth-linking 
      consciousness in the next. The consciousness, which we are now discussing 
      is the rebirth-linking consciousness which is the first consciousness that 
      appears in the new life, i.e., in the zygote at the moment of its 
      initiation.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">According to the Dhamma, three conditions 
      must be present for a new life to come into being. They are the viable 
      spermatozoon of the father, a viable ovum (oocyte) of the mother and the 
      'person-to-be-born'. The energy to trigger the start of a new life is 
      presumably provided by the person-to-be-born, called
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">gandhabba</SPAN> in the Mahàtanhàsankhaya 
      Sutta.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Some sutta commentators believe that
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">gandhabba</SPAN><A NAME="c4n1"></A><A HREF="#c4f1">[1]</A><SPAN STYLE="FONT-WEIGHT: normal"> 
      is simply a term for rebirth-consciousness or </SPAN>
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic; FONT-WEIGHT: normal">patisandhi vinnàna</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">. 
      It is this energy potential released at the time a person dies in the 
      previous birth and conditioned by craving is the desire for becoming. This 
      energy is so formidable that it attracts itself to another appropriate 
      existence. It is the last thought-process that carries with it this 
      grasping force (energy) and the unused kamma and, like a flash of 
      lightning, it enters the mother's womb, and perhaps enters the oocyte 
      simultaneously with the spermatozoon and energizes the male and female 
      pro-nuclei in the zygote to undergo the first mitotic cell division, thus 
      laying the foundation for the start of a new life. The two-celled embryo 
      then divides itself into a four, eight, and sixteen-cell embryo and so on.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Unless rebirth-consciousness links up with 
      the zygote at its initiation, there can be no start of a new life. Along 
      with this consciousness the rest of the factors of mentality, as well as 
      the physical factors of materiality, begin to manifest.</FONT></P>

        relationship between consciousness and name-and-form (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">nàma-rùpa</SPAN>) 
        continues throughout the entire course of life; consciousness infuses 
        the whole mental and material structure to make them participants in all 
        experience; and the mental and material structure provide a footing for 
        consciousness to grow and flourish.&quot; -- Bhikkhu Bodhi</FONT></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In ancient commentaries this transfer of 
      consciousness and kamma is compared to what happens when one lighted 
      candle is used to light another candle. Nothing substantial moves from one 
      candle to the other, but the light does.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In understanding the above example we 
      should keep in mind that nothing of the five aggregates (which we call a 
      'being'), moves from the previous life to the present one. Only 
      conditionality exists. The Buddha has emphasized this as shown in the 
      following incident:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Sàti was a recalcitrant monk who had 
      insisted on misconstruing the Buddha's words. Sàti had insisted that 
      consciousness is a persistent transmigrating entity. The Buddha had then 
      reaffirmed his previous statement that consciousness is dependently arisen 
      in that it arises in dependence of conditions and that apart from 
      conditions there can be no origination of consciousness (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">annàtra 
      paccayà natthi vinnanassa sambhavo</SPAN>).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Getting back to human development, it is 
      seen that once the embryo is initiated, it will start developing rapidly 
      and by the third week will show the initiation of the heart and 
      circulation system as well as the start of the formation of the brain and 
      the nervous system. This is followed rapidly by the formation of the five 
      physical sense-organs and consciousness, namely the eyes, ears, nose, 
      tongue, body and the mental-base (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">ajjhattika</SPAN>), 
      and their respective external (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">bàhira</SPAN>) 
      bases which are: visible objects, sound, odour, taste, body and mind 
      objects. The ensuing mind-body phenomenon reaches foetal maturity at the 
      end of nine months.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The arising of the above primordial 
      mind-body combination during embryonic and foetal development, as well as 
      the continuing development during the course of life, is called the 'round 
      of results' (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">vipàkavatta</SPAN>), and is 
      the result of our past volitions<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic"> </SPAN>
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: normal">or </SPAN>
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma</SPAN>. The microscopic zygote thus 
      finally develops into a human being equipped with a six-sense base, during 
      the foetal-embryonic stage. It is perhaps useful to remember that when we 
      referred to rebirth-linking consciousness, we did not imply that this 
      consciousness is a permanent entity, which continues in the same state 
      without change throughout the cycle of existence. Consciousness too is 
      conditioned and is therefore not permanent. It comes into being, performs 
      and passes away yielding place to a new consciousness. It is explained as 
      a perpetual stream that goes on until the final cessation of 'becoming'. 
      When one gives it more thought, one realizes that in effect there is no 
      'being' in this world in the absence of consciousness, and in a way, 
      consciousness is existence, the will to live, to continue and to become (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">bhava</SPAN>).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We can now see that the
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">paticcasamuppàda</SPAN> is a teaching of 
      conditionality of everything in the world. It goes on forever, 
      uninterrupted and uncontrolled by any external agency or power of any

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the doctrine of dependent origination, 
      we refer to three periods of time: the past, the present and the future. 
      This is in order to exemplify how the twelve factors act upon the 
      consecutive sequence of lives. Ignorance and volitional formations belong 
      to the previous birth, the next eight links to the present, and the last 
      two links, birth and ageing and death belong to the next existence. Now, 
      how can this chain of cause and effect be broken in order to reach 
      liberation? Unless we can break the chain, we will surely drift forever in
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">samsàra</SPAN>, in a stream of birth, 
      death and rebirth.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha in his wisdom explored all the 
      possibilities and realized that there were, in fact, two points along this 
      chain where it could be broken. Of these, the first is 'ignorance' and the 
      other is at the point of 'craving.' He therefore, had to find a way to 
      stop craving. He recollected that by meditating with insight, wisdom and 
      equanimity, one could develop total awareness of every sensation which 
      occurs in the body. When one sees every sensation without greed, hatred or 
      delusion, one does not react to situations.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha has also shown us a way out of 
      ignorance, which in turn will prevent the arising of fresh reactions. This 
      is by means of <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic; FONT-WEIGHT: normal">
      vipassanà</SPAN> meditation, for, with continued
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">vipassanà</SPAN> meditation it is 
      possible for us to develop mindfulness and insight. Then will arise wisdom 
      with which we can successfully eradicate ignorance. Liberation follows.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is how an enlightened being, an 
      arahat, faces all incidents in his day-to-day life: with wisdom and 
      without volition. Having eliminated conceiving the arahat no longer finds 
      delight in the objects he encounters. He no longer pursues pleasure and 
      enjoyment and in the absence of delight and craving, there is no condition 
      for the renewal of samsàric existence. At the end of his present life, he 
      concludes his journey in <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">samsàra</SPAN> 
      and brings an end to it.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;We have so far depicted dependent 
      origination as a chain of causes and effects strung over time. However, 
      this is not necessarily the best way to show causal interconnectedness.</FONT></P>

      <A HREF="#Chapt4">[Contents]</A></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There are many ways to show the 
      interconnectedness between the twelve links of the Dependent Origination 
      and the four Noble Truths. For instance, in one analysis it is shown that 
      the first Noble Truth, (the existence of suffering or unsatisfactoriness), 
      is related to the links of consciousness, name and form, the six-sense 
      bases, contact, sensation, birth, ageing and death. The balance five links 
      of ignorance, reaction, craving, clinging and becoming are related to the 
      second Noble Truth (the origin of suffering).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We can then say that the latter set of 
      five are the causal factors, while the former set of seven are the 
      effective factors. We thus see that it is the origin of suffering which 
      causes suffering, for suffering is dependent on its origin and will not 
      exist in its absence.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is also possible to show that, in the 
      doctrine of dependent origination, all four Noble Truths are embodied: 
      &quot;The <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">paticcasamuppàda</SPAN> in its order 
      of arising manifests the process of becoming (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">bhava</SPAN>): 
      in other words, the appearance of suffering (the First Truth); and how 
      this process of becoming or suffering is conditioned (the Second Truth). 
      In its order of ceasing, the <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">
      paticcasamuppàda</SPAN> makes plain the cessation of this becoming, this 
      suffering (the Third Truth), and how it ceases (the Fourth Truth)&quot;.<A NAME="c4n3"></A><A HREF="#c4f3">[3]</A></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">To study and comprehend the
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">paticcasamuppàda</SPAN>, it is important 
      that there be a total immersion in this sutta. It requires a &quot;paradigm 
      shift&quot;. We need to look at it not merely as a doctrine but as something 
      personal, which one can experience. By doing so, it comes alive. We also 
      need this focus not only in regard to this doctrine, but also to all 
      doctrines of the Buddha, for he spoke only of 'suffering and how to end 
      suffering.' In fact, when we look at the twelve links, we see that the 
      last few words in the sutta refer to 'this whole mass of suffering'.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Hence, the purpose of understanding this 
      sutta is to find a solution, a way to end this otherwise ceaseless 
      wandering in <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">samsàra</SPAN>. If we lose 
      track of this fundamental point, we would only be looking at the byways 
      and not at the main highway to Nibbàna.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Let us examine what we have learnt and 
      understood by looking at the twelve links in the standard descending 
      order, as if we are the live participants in this
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">samsàric</SPAN> process of the rounds of 
      rebirths. In the discussion which follows, 'I' and 'we' are used in the 
      conventional sense merely as expedients (much like the way the Buddha 
      referred to his previous births).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Starting with ignorance, we looked at how 
      we had perhaps conducted ourselves in our previous birth, which, for 
      purposes of discussion, we assumed was here on earth. We believed that 
      conditioned by our ignorance of the dangers inherent in the three 
      fundamental evils of greed, aversion and delusion, and not understanding 
      the three eternal verities of impermanence, suffering and the absence of a 
      permanent 'I' or 'self', we remained unaware that there was no permanent 
      self or 'I'. We also had no knowledge of the working of the immanent law 
      of <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma</SPAN> and rebirth. In fact, we 
      did not know the four Noble Truths. As a result, we accumulated a 
      considerable amount of negative <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma</SPAN>.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">On the other hand, although we were not 
      aware of the above factors of defilements, we were inherently good people, 
      for we had perhaps been kind, compassionate, sharing, forbearing, patient 
      and also morally above reproach in our previous birth. Consequently, we 
      did spiritually evolve a little more and became 'eligible' for an earth 
      life because the accumulated positive <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">
      kamma </SPAN>outweighed the negative <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">
      kamma</SPAN>. Therefore, when we died, we received another chance to 
      spiritually evolve further by birth in this world of sentient beings. We 
      are now reaping some of the 'benefits' of our
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma</SPAN>, as
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma-vipàka</SPAN> or in other words the 
      consequences of our previous actions in <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">
      samsàra</SPAN>.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This earthly life did not come about 
      fortuitously, but conditioned by our previous volitions (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kamma</SPAN>). 
      We now have a chance to progress in our evolution and hopefully can move 
      closer to liberation if we get rid of ignorance, greed, hatred and 
      delusion, and practise generosity, morality and the four sublime states of 
      loving-kindness, compassion, participating joy and equanimity. We now also 
      have the opportunity to understand dependent origination as a way out of 
      ignorance.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;It has become clear to us how 
      rebirth-consciousness appears at the time of conception in the mother's 
      womb in this re-becoming and we then pictured how mind-and-matter develops 
      in the embryo and the foetus, followed by the development of the six-sense 
      organs and the related six sense-consciousnesses. We then came to 
      appreciate that although we had considered ourselves as unique entities, 
      we are in fact nothing but body and mind, which together comprise the five 
      aggregates of clinging. There is no permanent 'I'.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We saw how, because of the six-fold 
      contact of our senses with their respective objects, we started to have 
      feelings, which turned to craving and then clinging and how we could 
      become enslaved to our cravings and clingings. We also saw how the energy 
      so generated would lead to our wanting survival or becoming or existence, 
      in other words, giving way to the atavistic tendency for survival and 
      perpetuation of the species.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If during this lifetime we are to find a 
      way out of the <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">samsàric</SPAN> round, we 
      need to mend our ways. We need to not only get rid of our inherent 
      tendency towards craving, but to eradicate it totally.</FONT></P>

      whole mass of suffering. We, therefore, have understood that we need to 
      step back and mindfully change direction, change course and adopt one of 
      the proven methods of the Buddha to develop wisdom and thereby attain 
      liberation.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">However, to develop wisdom, it is 
      necessary to understand the Dhamma, and this we can do by reading or

      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">sutamaya-pannà</SPAN>. (In the present 
      context it is repeatedly reading and understanding this book). Then by 
      reflection and contemplation, we can gain the wisdom called<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">

      </DIV>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When we look at the Upanisà sutta in the 
      above form, we see in part one, the now familiar twelve links of dependent 
      origination, which we had studied before in Chapter&nbsp;3. The only difference 
      is in the twelfth link, where the Buddha has purposefully replaced &quot;death 
      and decay&quot; with &quot;suffering&quot;. For it is this substitution, which helps to 
      lead to the second application (part 2) of dependent arising, which is to 
      show a path leading to liberation.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Part two begins with, confidence (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">saddhà</SPAN>), 
      i.e., confidence in the Buddha and his doctrines, and then leads up to 
      tranquillity and happiness. From there on are shown the progressive steps 
      leading finally to liberation and with it the destruction of taints. This 
      second application of 'dependent arising' has been given the name 
      'transcendental or supramundane dependent arising' as it leads to 
      transcendence.<A NAME="c5n1"></A><A HREF="#c5f1">[1]</A></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It appears that in the second part of this 
      sutta, the Buddha is telling us not to stop but to move forward till we 
      are fully liberated (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">vimutti</SPAN>) and 
      all cankers/taints (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">àsava</SPAN>) are 
      destroyed. For, by now, having comprehended the doctrine of dependent 
      origination, and understood conditionality experientially, the learner is 
      suffused with confidence and acceptance of the Truth in the Buddha Dhamma. 
      He should now wish to go forward. This decision in turn will generate joy 
      or gladness in the meditator, who also knows that he is proceeding in the 
      right direction.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">At this stage, the meditator would check 
      within him as to whether his morality is completely above reproach and 
      whether he is practising the <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">sìla</SPAN> 
      portion of the Noble Eightfold Path. When this is self-confirmed, the 
      meditator will be suffused with rapture and will make a determined effort 
      to proceed intensively through the concentration and wisdom groups of the 
      Noble Eightfold Path.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">He would now realize that further progress 
      is not possible without <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">vipassanà</SPAN> 
      meditation. The links of joy, rapture, tranquillity, happiness, 
      concentration, knowledge-and-vision-of-things as-they-are, disenchantment 
      and dispassion- (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">pàmojja, pìti, 
      passaddhi, sukha, samàdhi, yathàbhùta-nàna-dassana, nibbidà</SPAN>, and 
      dispassion respectively --&nbsp; as shown in the Upanisà sutta), are 
      states of mind. They are sequential steps in spiritual development leading 
      to transcendence. They also act as signposts, which help identify our 
      progress along the path to <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">vimutti</SPAN>.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We should also understand that each of the 
      above steps arises in dependence on the previous one, and hence represents 
      dependent origination, and demonstrates in the Upanisà sutta how they lead 
      to dispassion and liberation.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There are also a number of suttas 
      scattered in the Sutta Pitaka<A NAME="c5n2"></A><A HREF="#c5f2">[2]</A><SPAN STYLE="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">, 
      which show steps similar to those shown in the Upanisà sutta leading to 
      liberation, but with individual variations, for, there are many ways to 
      reach the goal. Some of the pathways are long and some are short. But the 
      main signposts along the way remain the same, for we already know 
      (Chapter&nbsp;3) that the Buddha varied his methods of teaching according to 
      circumstances. The Upanisà sutta was directly addressed to his bhikkhus, 
      who we can assume were already familiar with </SPAN>
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic; FONT-WEIGHT: normal">vipassanà</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="FONT-WEIGHT: normal"> 
      meditation. All he needed therefore to do was merely to highlight the most 
      important steps leading to liberation and leave it to the bhikkhus to fill 
      in the gaps.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We are now ready for the final part of our

      and that there is no such thing as a continuing self or 'I'.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Life is a continuing process of evolution. 
      Each of us has the potential to evolve morally and spiritually. In fact, 
      we have been doing so during our journey through
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">samsàra</SPAN> every time we have had an 
      earthly life. We now have the added advantage of a time period in which 
      the Buddha's Dhamma is available to guide us. This opportunity is not 
      accidental but a result of the <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">pàramis</SPAN><A HREF="#c6f1">[1]</A><SPAN STYLE="FONT-WEIGHT: normal"> 
      which we had developed to a certain level in previous births.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      were not true, we would not even have had the inclination or the 
      opportunity to select this book for reading, let alone studying and 
      comprehending its contents.</FONT></SPAN></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We now have complete confidence in the 
      Buddha and the Dhamma, and are eager to experience the truth embodied in 
      the <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">paticcasamuppàda</SPAN>, for we have 
      realized that craving, clinging and attachment are the byproducts of 
      ignorance, which ensure our continuing journey in
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">samsàra</SPAN>.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A special effort is needed to truly 
      comprehend and realize the supramundane in a short series of steps. These 
      steps are incorporated into the practice of
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">vipassanà</SPAN> meditation, but to take 
      these steps we have to promise ourselves that we shall make a sustained 
      effort, for we are now well aware of the rewards that lie ahead. We can 
      therefore perhaps repeat what the poet Robert Frost (1874-1963) said:</FONT></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;But I have promises to keep,<BR>
        And miles to go before I sleep&quot; <BR>
        (From: &quot;Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening&quot;)</FONT></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The time has come for this effort. 
      However, this last part of the journey has to be crafted carefully and 
      followed conscientiously.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha has repeatedly emphasized the 
      importance of contemplation and meditation as a way, in fact an essential 
      requirement, to achieve liberation. The classical suttas in this regard 
      are the Satipatthàna Sutta (M.10) we referred to in Chapter&nbsp;2, the 
      Ànàpànasati Sutta (M.118) and the Upanisà Sutta with which we became 
      familiar in the previous chapter.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There are now numerous meditation centers 
      in the USA, UK, Europe and Asia that conduct courses on a regular basis in 
      the Theravàda tradition and are popularly known as
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">vipassanà</SPAN> meditation centers. The 
      focus is on strictly following the instructions as contained in the 
      Satipatthàna Sutta. The courses range from 1-3 months of total immersion, 
      or shorter retreats of ten days' total immersion, as well as still shorter 
      workshops. The teachers at these centers are second or third generation 
      descendents of the original vipassanà meditation masters who are said to 
      have individually 're-discovered' <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">
      vipassanà</SPAN> meditation techniques in Myanmar (Burma) and used them 
      with success to attain liberation.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The need for the earnest student to find a 
      suitable meditation teacher must be emphasized. Even if the reader is very 
      knowledgeable in the Buddha Dhamma, the fact remains that one is now 
      journeying along an unfamiliar path. Consequently, there will be many 
      occasions when one could benefit from the advice and instructions of a 
      competent, experienced meditation master.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is also advisable for the student to 
      enquire whether such a teacher uses an understanding and contemplation of 
      the <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">paticcasamuppàda</SPAN> with its 
      twelve links as an essential part of the <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">
      vipassanà</SPAN> practice, for we can recollect from our previous studies 
      what the Buddha has said in this regard:</FONT></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;He who sees dependent origination sees 
        the Dhamma, he who sees the Dhamma sees the dependent origination&quot;. -- 
        M.28</FONT></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Then by inference, could we not perhaps 
      say 'one who does not see dependent origination does not see the Dhamma' 
      and 'he who does not see the Dhamma does not see dependent origination'?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But while the reader is searching for a 
      teacher, he may perhaps find the information given below sufficient to 
      start meditating in the <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">vipassanà</SPAN> 
      way. <SPAN STYLE="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">It should however be kept in mind 
      that these instructions are poor substitutes for a competent and proven 
      meditation guide.</SPAN> The instructions given below are drawn from the 
      limited experiences of my fellow meditators and myself.</FONT></P>

      Preliminary Steps in Meditation</FONT></B> <A HREF="#Chapt6">[Contents]</A></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The beginner must first feel sufficiently 
      motivated to proceed on his own. He should dedicate himself earnestly to 
      the task ahead. Next he has to select a place suitable for his daily 
      meditation and decide on a time frame for each meditation session. (He can 
      of course change this as he moves along and as his competency improves). 
      Further, he has to select a suitable place relatively free of 
      disturbances. Then, by experimentation, he must choose a suitable posture 
      in which he can remain for a considerable length of time with the minimum 
      of bodily movements. He also needs to have the patience to continue in the 
      practice even when there are no visible signs of progress. In summary, the 
      meditator needs to find each day, the time followed by the following six 
      Ps:</FONT></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Time, and place - posture - practice - 
        patience - perseverance - and still more practice!</FONT></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A person may find it beneficial to start a 
      meditation session by first looking inwards and ensuring that he is 
      skilful in speech, action and livelihood (steps in the Noble Eightfold 
      Path).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The usual practice is then to arrive at a 
      sublime and a tranquil state of mind by wishing himself and all sentient 
      beings to be happy and well. By doing so, he is able, at least for the 
      duration of the meditation session, to suppress the negativities of anger 
      and greed. The tool to be used is often called an 'invocation' or a 
      'wish'. The meditator himself can formulate it, or the following model (or 
      a modification) could be used instead. Most vipassanà teachers suggest 
      this kind of invocation to be used by their students.</FONT></P>

      one's efforts. (Western meditators may find that they are unable to adopt 
      this posture for physiological or other reasons, in which case, sitting 
      upright on a straight-backed chair with the feet firmly placed on the 
      ground has been found by present day meditation teachers to give 
      comparable results). The meditator now focuses his attention on his normal 
      breath and watches how the air flows in and out through his nostrils. He 
      follows the breath only at the point of entry and exit. Following points

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the suttas we find a simile 
      illustrating the effect of these different obstructions. Imagine a pond of 
      clear water where a rare gem lies at the bottom. We now add a number of 
      bright dyes to the water, which then takes on beautiful psychedelic 
      patterns. We become entranced with the beauty and intricacy of the colours 
      and do not penetrate to the depths. This can be compared to sensual 
      desires. Anger, ill will and aversion can be compared to boiling water. 
      Water that is boiling, as in a geyser, is very turbulent and we cannot see 
      through to the bottom. Sloth and torpor are like the pond getting covered 
      by a dense layer of algae. One cannot possibly penetrate to the bottom. 
      Restlessness and worry are like a wind-swept pond. The surface is agitated 
      and the bottom is impenetrable. Doubt is like the water when muddied; the 
      bottom is obscured.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Happily, there are specific ways to deal 
      with them as they confront us along the path. The first is to recognize 
      them, to see them clearly every moment they appear. This very recognition 
      is the most powerful and effective way of overcoming them. Recognition 
      leads to mindfulness and mindfulness means not clinging, not condemning 
      and not identifying oneself with the object. All hindrances are 
      impermanent mental factors. They arise and pass away. If we are mindful of 
      them as soon as they arise, do only note them without reacting, (in fact, 
      decline to identify ourselves with them); then they would pass through the 
      mind without creating 'waves'. Mindfulness is the best and most effective 
      way of dealing with them.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We can then see the bottom of the pond 
      clearly and we will find no difficulty in picking up this rare gem, which 
      as you already would have guessed, is 'wisdom'. As we know, this wisdom 
      leads to insight and insight in turn leads to liberation.</FONT></P>

      concentrate on the breath, or any other subject of his choice for a 
      reasonable period of time and to stay focused, he is ready to be 
      introduced to insight or vipassanà meditation proper.
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">Vipassanà</SPAN> is the experiential 
      understanding of the real nature of all phenomena in one's own mind and 
      body. It is the very same model, which the Buddha adopted on the day of

      Walking Meditation</B> </FONT><A HREF="#Chapt6">[Contents]</A></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The meditator will choose a subject such 
      as the breath, or walking, to discriminate mentally and recognize the 
      subtle differences in the ultimate constituents of actuality via the 
      chosen subject of meditation. Let us assume that he has selected walking 
      meditation.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">
      vipassanà</SPAN> meditation, a crucial factor is learning to concentrate 
      and to be mindful. You will remember that previously, we learnt to 
      concentrate and be mindful of the breath while in the sitting posture. 
      Walking meditation too can lead to concentration as well as awareness. 
      With proper walking meditation one can even gain insight into mind and 
      matter and their impermanence.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A meditator should practise walking 
      meditation with full awareness of the manner in which the steps are taken. 
      At this introductory stage, he should note as 'left' when he takes a left 
      step and when taking a right step, to note it as 'right'. The mind must 
      observe the movement of the foot. He should lay stress on awareness, sharp 
      awareness of the movement of the foot. To do walking meditation, he will 
      need a private place with enough space for about eight or more paces. He 
      will be walking back and forth very slowly.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The physical directions for walking 
      meditation proper are simple. Start at one end and stay for the time it 
      takes to breathe two or three times. Your arms should be held in a way 
      that is comfortable in front, behind or at your sides. Lift the heel of 
      one foot, then rest that foot on its toes. Next lift the foot and carry it 
      forward slowly in a short step and then bring it down. Next shift your 
      weight onto this leg and then slowly repeat with the other foot. Continue 
      till you come to the end of the walk and stop for the time it takes you to 
      breathe twice. About-turn clockwise, very slowly and mindfully, (this is 
      in keeping with the Buddhist tradition of circumambulation). On completion 
      of the turn, remain stationary for two breaths, then proceed walking in 
      the previous fashion till you come back to your starting point. Repeat 
      this slow walking with mindfulness and total concentration until it is 
      time to end your meditation session. Remember to keep your head up and 
      your neck relaxed. Keep your eyes open to maintain balance, but in a 
      rather unfocussed manner so that you are not looking at anything in 
      particular. Walk naturally but at the slowest pace that is comfortable. 
      Watch out for tensions as soon as you spot them. Your objective is to 
      attain total alertness, heightened sensitivity and a full, unblocked 
      experience of the motion of walking.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">You will now observe that a step, which 
      appeared to be smooth and continuous, is in fact composed of a complex 
      series of tiny activities. Try not to miss anything. You can break down 
      each step to many component parts. At the start you can notice at least 
      four of these: lifting of the foot, moving the foot forward, dropping it 
      down and shifting the body weight onto that foot.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">You will also see that with good 
      concentration you will not be aware of the form of the foot. Nor will you 
      be aware of the body or bodily form. What you know is just movement of the 
      foot. You will in fact find yourself fully immersed in a fluid, unbroken 
      awareness of motion.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If your mind wanders, note the distraction 
      in the usual way, then return your attention to walking.
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Don't think, just feel.</SPAN> Register 
      the sensations as they flow. The <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">
      vipassanà</SPAN> walking technique is designed to flood your consciousness 
      with simple sensations, and to do it so thoroughly that all else is pushed 
      aside. When you do so over a period of time, many things are revealed to 
      you.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Let us discuss the practice of walking 
      meditation a little more. We started by trying to be mindful of the act of 
      stepping, then we moved onto focusing on two stages of walking. Stepping 
      and putting the foot down, stepping, putting down. We then started to note 
      mindfully four stages in each step. Raising our heel, lifting our foot, 
      moving it forward and finally placing it on the ground. We progressed to 
      the point where we noted five stages: raising, lifting, moving, placing 
      (frequently called 'pressing'), and shifting your weight.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">By now you should have realized that when 
      you were mindful of these five stages when taking a single step, you were 
      naturally slowing down your walking, which came automatically. This 
      slowing down is particularly beneficial because it is only then that you 
      can be truly mindful and fully aware of all the movements. Whereas 
      previously you thought that when taking a step it was a continuous 
      movement, you now realize that this is not so. The raising movement of the 
      heel is not mixed with the lifting movement of the foot and the lifting 
      movement of the foot is not mixed with the moving forward movement, and so 
      on. You will observe all movements clearly and distinctly.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">
      vipassanà</SPAN> meditators, you will notice much more as you continue 
      with the practice. When you lift the foot you will experience the 
      lightness of the foot. When you push the foot forward you will notice 
      movement from one place to another. When you put the foot down you will 
      feel the heaviness of the foot because the foot becomes heavier and 
      heavier as it descends. When you put the foot down and shift your weight, 
      you feel the touch of the ground as either hard or soft.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When you observe these four processes you 
      are perceiving the four primary particles - they are the solid, liquid, 
      heat/caloricity and finally air particles.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Let us go into a little more detail about 
      the characteristics of these primary elements during walking meditation. 
      In the first movement of lifting the foot when you felt lightness, you 
      perceived caloricity. This energy allows us to raise the foot and move it 
      forward, but in the lifting and carrying forward of the foot there was 
      also movement. Movement is one aspect of air and it is dominant as we move 
      the foot forward. When you move the foot down, there is a kind of 
      heaviness in the foot. Heaviness is a characteristic of liquid. Thus you 
      have perceived the liquid element. Finally when pressing the foot down and 
      shifting your weight onto that foot, you perceive the hardness or softness 
      of the ground. You have now felt the characteristic and the nature of 
      solidity and have seen, experientially, the composition of the aggregates 
      of <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">rùpa</SPAN> or matter.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We thus see that in just one step, we can 
      perceive many processes. Only those who practise walking meditation can 
      ever hope to see these things.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When you continue to practise walking 
      meditation you will come to realize that with every movement, there is 
      also the noting mind, the awareness of movement. There is the lifting 
      movement and the awareness of the lifting movement, then the movement and 
      the awareness thereof, and so on. You then come to realize that both the 
      movement and the mind (which is aware of the movement) arise and disappear 
      in that very moment. Movement --&nbsp; awareness-disappearance. The moment 
      of awareness is in the mind, whereas matter achieves the movement of the 
      foot. In other words, mentality and materiality are working together.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Another thing, which you discovered, is 
      that an intention precedes every one of the movements. You lift your foot 
      because you want to. You move it forward because you want to, and so on. 
      You thus realize that an intention has always preceded a movement, and you 
      understood from practical experience that, as the Buddha said, &quot;mind is 
      the forerunner of all phenomena&quot;. This discovery by actual experience and 
      practice during <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">vipassanà</SPAN> 
      meditation is the first of the <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">vipassanà</SPAN> 
      insights. It is called <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">
      nàma-rùpa-pariccheda-nàna</SPAN>, or insight knowledge of how mind and 
      matter always work together.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">You now understand that there is a cause 
      or a condition for every movement, and in this case, the condition is the 
      intention preceding each movement. You thus finally comprehend the 
      relationship of conditioning and the conditioned, cause and effect. With 
      this understanding, you have taken a giant step forward in your 
      meditation.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We are now well on our way: a voyage 
      within our own body and mind to find the truth unclouded by the delusion 
      of a self-perpetuating 'I'. However, before we proceed to the next step in
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">vipassanà</SPAN> meditation, it is useful 
      to take stock of how far we have progressed in the development of the 
      mind, for we need to make sure that we have removed all negative feelings 
      and emotions which would otherwise impede our progress. If we continue to 
      harbour hatred, aversion, greed, selfishness and sensual desires, it will 
      virtually be impossible for us to proceed towards the development of 
      insight.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There are many known methods for getting 
      rid of these negativities permanently. One proven method is for us to look 
      inwards during a meditation session and see with an open, non-judgmental 
      mind whether we indeed have these negative characteristics within 
      ourselves or not. Another recommended way is to contemplate on the 
      opposite positive factors, namely the four sublime states of universal 
      kindness, compassion, participating joy and equanimity. When we do so, 
      taking one subject at a time, we can see whether even the tiniest of their 
      opposites are yet in our minds or not.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha has laid down a method for 
      developing the sublime states: &quot;Here, monks, a disciple dwells pervading 
      one direction with his heart filled with loving-kindness, likewise the 
      second, the third and the fourth direction; so above, below and around; he 
      dwells pervading the entire world everywhere and equally with his heart 
      filled with loving-kindness, abundant, grown great, measureless, free from 
      enmity and free of distress.&quot; (D.13). He repeats the same advice for the 
      other three sublime states as well.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In 'pervading' and 'directions', one's 
      thoughts should be directed first to the east, then to the west, next to 
      the north and then to the south. This should be followed by directing 
      one's thoughts to the areas in between and finally to the zenith and the 
      nadir, i.e., above and below, including the skies and birds and the seas 
      and fish and so on.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In practising meditation using 
      loving-kindness as a model, we first repeat the 'invocation' or 'wish' as 
      given earlier and then we direct such thoughts to those we love, and so on 
      (as described in the invocation) till we come to disagreeable people. This 
      of course is the hardest task, but as true meditators we can breakdown the 
      remaining barriers by heroic effort. We make no discriminations in our 
      pervasive thoughts of loving-kindness, and extend our thoughts of 
      loving-kindness equally to all. (There is a Sinhala saying which comes to 
      mind: &quot;when serving rice, do so to everyone using the very same spoon&quot;.)<A NAME="c6n3"></A><A HREF="#c6f3">[3]</A></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">At this point of proper practice, we 
      should have come to a higher stage of concentration, and we would in fact 
      have reached access-concentration (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">upacàra-samàdhi</SPAN>). 
      Further progress will lead to full concentration (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">appanà</SPAN>) 
      reaching fruition as the first <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">jhàna</SPAN>, 
      then onto the higher <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">jhànas</SPAN>. The 
      ultimate aim of attaining the <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">jhànas</SPAN> 
      relating to the four sublime states is to produce a state of mind that can 
      serve as a firm foundation for the development of liberating insight into 
      the true nature of all phenomena as being impermanent, subject to 
      suffering and being void. A mind that has achieved meditational absorption 
      induced by the sublime states will now be pure, tranquil, firm, collected 
      and largely free of negativities. A meditator is then well prepared for 
      the final effort, which is aimed at deliverance.<A NAME="c6n4"></A><A HREF="#c6f4">[4]</A></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Meditative development of the sublime 
      states will be aided by repeated reflection upon the benefits they bring 
      and the dangers of their opposites. As the Buddha has said 'What a person 
      considers and reflects upon for a long time, to that his mind will bend 
      and incline'.<A NAME="c6n5"></A><A HREF="#c6f5">[5]</A></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As persons who have made a study of the
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">paticcasamuppàda</SPAN> in the previous 
      chapters, it would be appropriate to use it as the subject for our 
      advanced <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">vipassanà</SPAN> meditation. 
      This is also particularly appropriate because of the fact that the Buddha 
      on his road to enlightenment used this very subject for his awakening. The 
      Buddha categorically says that this was his eye-opening discovery in one 
      sentence: 'He who sees Dependent Origination sees the Dhamma. He who sees 
      the Dhamma sees Dependent Origination (M.28) . Arahat Assaji was the first 
      to see this clearly, as was shown earlier.</FONT></P>

      Paticcasamuppàda </B><A HREF="#Chapt6">[Contents]</A></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The meditator will now look at the
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">paticcasamuppàda</SPAN> as part of his 
      personal experience from different angles. He contemplates, reflects and 
      analyzes it. He finds that whichever way he looks at it, the inevitable 
      conclusion in the ultimate sense is that there is no being or individual, 
      but only a continuity of conditioned, dependent phenomena occurring in 
      what appears as a causal chain constantly undergoing origination and 
      dissolution.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">With further application of concentration 
      focused into laser-sharpness, he looks again at the twelve links of the
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">paticcasamuppàda</SPAN> in the forward 
      and reverse directions. Forward contemplation shows us the existence of 
      suffering. He first sees how ignorance sets in motion the life cycle. 
      Ignorance thus conditions action, and action conditions consciousness. 
      From consciousness he proceeds to contemplation of name-and-form, then the 
      six senses and so on. Finally he sees that craving leads to clinging and 
      then to becoming. With becoming he sees that birth is inevitable. Now with 
      insight he sees that birth is always followed by sickness, ageing and 
      death - all of which cause considerable suffering. Contemplating the 
      twelve links in this manner will lead him to a profound understanding of 
      mind-matter phenomena called an individual (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">puggala</SPAN>).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">He would then practise the reverse 
      contemplation, but he should not do so by starting with the twelfth link 
      and proceeding backwards to the first link. On the contrary, he should 
      start in this case too with ignorance, for, once there is no ignorance, 
      there will be no deluded action. When actions are not governed by greed, 
      hatred and delusion, he sees that there is no defilement of consciousness. 
      He proceeds in this manner till he comes to becoming, birth and death --&nbsp; 
      thus seeing with insight how this whole chain of becoming ceases. He then 
      realizes that he has been gradually engaging the Eightfold Path (the 
      Fourth Noble Truth) of skilful understanding, skilful thought, skilful 
      action and so on, to put an end to the chain of suffering.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">He next sees that this five-aggregate 
      'person' is at the ultimate level nothing but a combination of the five 
      formations or the five groups of clinging (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">pancupadànakkhandha</SPAN>) 
      which are subject to decay, suffering and death. He also sees with insight 
      that he cannot find a permanent core or entity in the entire conditioned 
      dependent chain. He finds only phenomena and becomes detached from them, 
      and with this detachment he comprehends the fact of non-self or
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">anatta</SPAN>.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The meditator now spreads his focus to 
      other phenomena and sees clearly that all formations, which he looks at, 
      along with their causes and conditions, originate and dissolve before his 
      very eyes. They are all impermanent, <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">
      anicca</SPAN>.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">At this point of self-realization, a 
      meditator is often beset by certain corruptions of insight called
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">vipassanà upakkilesa</SPAN>. These are 
      extraordinary experiences that arise when insight meditation begins to 
      gather momentum. Examples are the perception of one or more of the 
      following: bright lights, an aura around the meditator, a sharp increase 
      in understanding, happiness, rapture, or a feeling of being energized. 
      While these are useful indicators telling the meditator that he is now 
      progressing well, they become corruptions or kilesa when he begins to get 
      attached and proceeds to enjoy and dwell in them, thinking that he is now 
      liberated.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The meditator should instead, recognize 
      them merely as imposters and examine these experiences with equanimity and 
      according to the three universal characteristics of all conditioned 
      phenomena, namely as impermanent, subject, to suffering and non-self. With 
      this insight he will then let go and proceed with renewed enthusiasm.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the second stage of insight meditation 
      we have used the subject of <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">
      paticcasamuppàda</SPAN> because of our familiarity with it. There are, in 
      addition, numerous topics that are suitable for advanced meditation. In 
      fact, in the Satipatthàna Sutta itself, the Buddha has recommended four 
      subjects as suitable for insight meditation, which are:</FONT></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The body (including the breath) -
        <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">kàyànupassanà</SPAN><BR>
        Feelings or sensations - <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">
        vedanànupassanà</SPAN><BR>
        The mind - <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">cittànupassanà</SPAN> and<BR>
        Mental formations - <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">dhammànupassanà.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Out of all of these, the breath often 
      takes precedence as the subject most suitable for meditation. However, it 
      is the meditation teacher who will be the most competent person to suggest 
      a meditation subject to the novice meditator, and he will do so according 
      to his assessment of the novice's individual aptitudes.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The meditator who has practised insight 
      meditation successfully at stage two for some time, will now continue 
      self-examination with added zest and energy. He will observe 
      non-judgmentally everything happening within his body, while at the same 
      time not allowing proliferation of thoughts. He will merely observe 
      phenomena: their appearance, short existence and immediate dissolution (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">uppàda, 
      thiti, bhanga</SPAN>), unconnected to anything else.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">He will then be following the instructions 
      that the Buddha gave the advanced meditator, Bàhiya Dàrucìriya - an 
      injunction so deep that it brought Bàhiya to enlightenment right on the 
      spot:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;In the seen there will be only the seen; 
      in the heard there will be only the heard; in the sensed there will be 
      only the sensed; in the cognized there will be only the cognized. This is 
      how you must train yourself, Bàhiya&quot; (Udàna,1:10).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The meditator now sees with insight that 
      all formations within himself, as well as in the whole universe, are 
      indeed characterized by impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and devoid of 
      'self'.<A NAME="c6n6"></A><A HREF="#c6f6">[6]</A><SPAN STYLE="FONT-WEIGHT: normal"> 
      He fixes his mind on just one of the above characteristics and quite soon 
      is able to make a break-through to full understanding. Noble 
      Path-consciousness arises, and he transcends the mundane and passes to the 
      supramundane, which is the peace of Nibbàna, for the first time.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">On the other hand, if he is contemplating 
      and reflecting on the <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">paticcasamuppàda</SPAN>, 
      he would be fixing his mind on all three characteristics simultaneously, 
      and it will not be long before he too is able, as in the previous example, 
      to transcend the mundane, pass onto the supramundane peace of Nibbàna for 
      the first time. He then completes the experiential understanding of the 
      Four Noble Truths by attaining the knowledge of the Path of stream entry,
      <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">sotàpatti-magga-nàna</SPAN>. He has 
      totally uprooted and discarded forever the three fetters, the of false 
      view of personality, doubt, and attachment to rites and rituals.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">He rounds up his effort by achieving the 
      knowledge of fruition (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">phala-nàna</SPAN>) 
      and the blissful peace of Nibbàna. It is at this stage that there arises 
      in the meditator the reviewing knowledge of the Path and the Fruit (item 
      16 in <A HREF="#i__Mahasi_Sayadaw">i. Mahasi_Sayadaw</A>) by which the 
      meditator reviews the defilements that have been eliminated and those that 
      yet remain.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A noble disciple may perhaps not stop now. 
      What is left is only the need to eliminate the remaining seven defilements 
      or fetters in order to become an arahat - the fully liberated person.</FONT></P>

      light of the Dhamma.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha has shown that the first 
      critical step on our way to liberation is to first understand and 
      comprehend the doctrine of dependent origination: &quot;It is through not 
      understanding, not penetrating this doctrine that this generation has 
      become entangled like a tangled ball of string unable to pass beyond the 
      round of <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">samsàra</SPAN>.&quot; (M.ii.55). The 
      final step is to practise the Dhamma via the Four Noble Truths, for we now 
      realize that liberation is not possible until we eradicate ignorance (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">avijjà</SPAN>) 
      and the three root defilements of greed (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">lobha</SPAN>), 
      hatred (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">dosa</SPAN>) and delusion (<SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">moha</SPAN>)

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When we do so, it can be as rewarding an 
      experience for you, as it has been for me. We would perhaps have also 
      realized that <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic">vipassanà</SPAN> meditation 
      when targeted towards liberation entails an intensive and dedicated

      contemplating with total awareness and mindfulness all the time. It is

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Insight and the development of 
      understanding come when the mind is quiet. When we have an open and 
      non-judgmental mind and see everything happening in our own body and mind 
      from moment to moment with insight, the true Dhamma unwinds before our 
      very eyes, and we commence to see the truth. How fast we progress

            fruition. (Nyanatiloka, Buddhist Dictionary). <A HREF="#c2n4">
