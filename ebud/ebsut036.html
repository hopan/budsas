  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">S</font>ister Rocana left
  Bodhinyana Monastery recently to take a 'higher' ordination in England. As I
  mentioned in the 'Sangha News' article, she visited Thailand en-route and was
  rather disappointed at what she saw of the opportunities for nuns there. The
  place of women in Theravada monasticism is a problem no less prickly than some
  of the native bushes here in the monastery! But it cannot be avoided. It can
  only be understood in relation to the VINAYA, the body of monastic rules and
  regulations established by the Buddha which are binding on every Buddhist monk
  and nun. Thus in this fifth article in the series I will discuss the
  ORDINATION OF WOMEN.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Bhikkhu' is the name which denotes a fully
  ordained Buddhist monk. The term literally means one who depends on alms.
  Correspondingly, a 'Bhikkhuni' is a fully ordained Buddhist nun. During his
  lifetime, the Buddha established thriving communities of both bhikkhus and
  bhikkhunis. However, not only did the Buddha lay down more rules of discipline
  for the bhikkhunis, 311 as against the bhikkhus' 227, but he also made it more
  difficult for them to be ordained.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To become a bhikkhuni a woman had to begin by
  asking for 'ordination' as a <b><i>sikkhamana</i></b> (meaning a woman in
  training) before an assembly of at least 5 bhikkhunis. Her training consisted
  of 6 rules: the Five Precepts, the third of which being extended to complete
  celibacy, plus abstaining from eating outside of the morning time. Only when
  she had kept these six rules UNBROKEN FOR TWO YEARS could she, with the
  permission of her parents and husband, take higher ordination as a bhikkhuni.
  Should she break a precept then she would begin her period of training anew.
  Having completed her training, she should then seek an experienced bhikkhuni
  of at least 12 years standing to be her preceptor. A preceptor has to be
  agreed upon as such by the local community of bhikkhunis before she may ordain
  another and even then, she may only ordain one candidate every other year. the
  candidate is first ordained in a formal meeting of at least five bhikkhunis
  and afterwards this 'ordination on one side' is confirmed before a formal
  meeting of at least five bhikkhus. Only then is she a fully ordained nun
  according to Theravada tradition.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Bhikkhuni Sangha flourished for many
  centuries and spread throughout South and East Asia. It seems to have died out
  in Sri Lanka in the 11 th century C.E. (according to Professor Malalasekera)
  mainly due to the civil turmoil coming from invasion and war. The fact that
  the Bhikkhuni Sangha was not re-established in the last decades of the 11 th
  century when Sri Lanka was again peaceful strongly suggests that there were
  few if any bhikkhunis in neighbouring lands, such as India or Burma, who could
  be invited to Sri Lanka to re-establish the tradition. For, as explained
  above, to ordain another bhikkhuni one requires a minimum of five existing
  bhikkhunis; once their number drops to below five then the Institution is
  doomed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">For many centuries the Buddhists in Sri Lanka,
  Thailand and Burma have assumed that the Order of Bhikkhunis died out ages ago
  and that it is impossible to revive. To compensate for this, other female
  monastic traditions have been established by the monks to help give the
  opportunity to women to live a simple meditative life. Such an Order is that
  of the white robed nuns of Thailand keeping the 8 Precepts and such a nun was
  Sister Rocana. But being a later addition, this ordination lacks the status of
  having been established by the Buddha and lacks the authority of an ancient
  tradition and thus social and cultural prejudices have been able to take root
  and prevail. For this reason many senior monks, such as Ajahn Sumedho in
  England for example, have attempted to revive and build upon the female novice
  ordination. Though still less than a bhikkhuni, a female novice wears brown
  and essentially keeps 10 precepts, the last of which is abstaining from the
  use or possession of money. Thus a female novice is more of a renunciant than
  the white robed Thai nun, and, wearing robes similar in appearance to those of
  a monk, she may get more of the respect she deserves.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There has even been much discussion recently,
  that is in the last decade or so, that it may be possible to revive the full
  bhikkhuni ordination. There are bhiksunis of the Mahayana tradition in Taiwan
  and Hong Kong. 'Bhiksuni' is merely the Sanskrit (the language of Mahayana)
  equivalent to our 'Bhikkhuni'. If it turns out that the ordination procedure
  used by the Mahayana bhiksunis contains the vital ingredient of a formal
  resolution, put three times to a gathering of at least 5 bhikkhunis, informing
  those gathered that the candidate wishes for ordination as a bhikkhuni and
  asking their approval, then the ordination is probably valid by Theravada
  standards. Should this be so, and I have no information on this at present,
  then we may see the full female counterpart of the monks restored to the
  Theravada tradition.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Whatever the technicalities, one should always
  keep in mind the old English proverb: &quot;Where there is a will, there is a
  way&quot;. I am often amazed to see how far rules can be bent under the weight
  of compassion. All it needs is the motive for doing the bending, and that
  motive will increase as do the numbers of women who show by their example a
  willingness to surrender to a renunciant's life.</font></p>
