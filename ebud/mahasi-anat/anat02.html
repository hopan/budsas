        </blockquote>
        </i>
        <p><font size="6">T</font>here are three kinds of feeling:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>1. <i>Sukha vedanā </i>-- pleasant feeling.</p>
          <p>2. <i>Dukkha vedanā -</i>- unpleasant feeling.</p>
          <p>3. <i>Upekkhā vedanā</i> -- equanimous feeling, neither pleasant 
          nor painful. Generally, equanimous or neutral feeling is not noticed, 
          only the pleasurable and unpleasant feelings.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It is a pleasure to feel the touch of a cool breeze or cold water 
        when the weather is scorching hot; it feels so cozy to be wrapped up in 
        warm, woolen blankets during a cold spell; one feels so comfortable 
        after stretching the limbs or changing positions to relieve stiffness. 
        All these comfortable feelings, through contact with pleasant objects, 
        are <i>sukha vedanā</i>, pleasurable feelings, which sentient beings 
        assume to be self, &quot;I feel pleasant, I feel comfortable&quot; and 
        go in pursuit of.</p>
        <p>Unpleasant feelings that arise on coming into contact with unpleasant 
        objects, such as heat, tiredness in the limbs, discomfort due to intense 
        cold, and itchiness, are classified as <i>dukkha vedanā</i>, unpleasant 
        sensations. These are also assumed to be self: &quot;I feel painful, I 
        feel hot, I feel itchy, I feel unpleasant.&quot; Therefore, sentient 
        beings try hard to avoid contact with these unpleasant objects.</p>
        <p>What I have just described relates to the pleasant and unpleasant 
        feelings in the physical body. There are also states of mind. Thoughts 
        on pleasant objects give rise to happiness and gladness, <i>sukha vedanā</i>; 
        thinking about things which cause dejection, despondency, despair, 
        sadness, grief, fear and so on, gives rise to unhappiness, <i>dukkha 
        vedanā</i>. Dwelling on ordinary everyday affairs gives rise to 
        neutral, equanimous feeling, <i>upekkhā vedanā</i>.</p>
        <p>These are the three kinds of feelings that are related to thoughts or 
        imaginations. While in such states of mind, sentient beings assume these 
        feelings to be self, &quot;I am feeling glad; I am despondent; I am 
        feeling neither happy nor unhappy, I am feeling indifferent.&quot;</p>
        <p>When pleasant objects are seen, heard, smelt or tasted, pleasurable 
        feelings arise. These are also regarded as self: &quot;I feel good, I 
        feel happy.&quot; Thus people go in pursuit of the good things of life, 
        visiting places of entertainment, using fragrant flowers and perfumes, 
        and going to any length and trouble to satisfy their gustatory demands.</p>
        <p>When unpleasant objects are seen, heard, smelt or tasted, unpleasant 
        feelings arise. These are also assumed to be self; people try, 
        therefore, to have nothing to do with unpleasant objects.</p>
        <p>The ordinary, everyday scenes which we see and hear, indifferent 
        sense objects, excite neither a feeling of pleasure nor unpleasantness. 
        This is neutral feeling, which is also assumed to be self. People are 
        never content with this medial condition of neither pleasantness nor 
        unpleasantness, and so they strive hard to attain the state of 
        pleasantness, to enjoy pleasurable feelings.</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>A DISCREPANCY BETWEEN ABHIDHAMMA AND SUTTAS</b></font></p>
        <p>According to the teachings of the <i>Abhidhamma</i>, there is neither 
        pleasant nor unpleasant feeling at the moment of seeing, hearing, 
        smelling, or tasting, just equanimous feeling. But in the <i>Suttas</i> 
        there are discourses which describe how all these feelings, pleasant, 
        unpleasant and neutral, arise at all the sense doors, and there are 
        discourses exhorting us to contemplate these feelings at the moment of 
        seeing and hearing so as to comprehend their true nature.</p>
        <p>The Sub-Commentary of the <i>Visuddhimagga</i> explains how pleasant, 
        unpleasant and neutral feelings become evident at the moment of seeing 
        and hearing in these words:</p>
        <p>&quot;Although it is said that eye consciousness is accompanied by 
        equanimity, the resultant effect of an unwholesome act is unpleasant in 
        nature, it cannot be pleasant. Likewise, although it is stated that the 
        resultant effect of a wholesome act is equanimity, it is pleasant in 
        nature. All moral acts bear good, pleasant results.&quot;</p>
        <p>This explanation is most appropriate and can be verified through 
        practical experience. When a beautiful object is sighted, the feeling of 
        pleasantness is evident even as the object is being seen. When a 
        terrifying, repulsive, or hateful object is sighted, the feeling of 
        horror or aversion is quite evident, too, even while seeing the object. 
        These experiences are more pronounced in the case of hearing than in the 
        case of seeing. A sweet, pleasant sound produces a sweet, pleasant 
        effect; an extremely loud sound may inflict unbearable pain on the 
        hearer. The resultant effect is distinct also in smelling: a pleasant 
        sensation arises in the nose as soon as a fragrant aroma is smelt, 
        whereas a foul, putrid smell may cause immediate nausea, headache or 
        other ills. A whiff of a poisonous odor may even cause death. The most 
        pronounced effect may be experienced in the act of eating. While a 
        tasty, delicious dish produces a delightful sensation on the tongue, the 
        bitter taste of some medicines is very unpleasant and disagreeable. A 
        poisonous substance will cause intense suffering and may even result in 
        death.</p>
        <p>&quot;Thus, although it is stated that eye-consciousness is 
        accompanied by indifference, the unwholesome resultant equanimity which 
        experiences disagreeable objects is in the nature of suffering, and the 
        wholesome resultant equanimity which experiences agreeable objects has 
        the nature of happiness.&quot; These comments from the Sub-Commentary 
        are most appropriate. We find therefore the <i>Suttas</i> mention that 
        all three types of feeling may be excited at the moment of sensory 
        awareness. Alternatively, as it is possible for any of the three 
        feelings to arise at the moment of <i>javana</i>, impulsion 
        consciousness, during the eye-door thought process <i>(cakkhudvāra vithī),</i> 
        the <i>Suttas</i> mention all three types of feeling being excited 
        during sensory awareness.</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>MISTAKING FEELING FOR SELF</b></font></p>
        <p>Therefore, enjoyment of sense-objects, pleasant or unpleasant, every 
        time they are seen, heard, touched or known, constitutes <i>vedanā</i>. 
        When an agreeable sensation is felt, there arises the clinging of self: 
        &quot;I feel pleasant.&quot; When the sensation is disagreeable, there 
        arises the clinging of self: &quot;I don't feel pleasant;&quot; or, 
        &quot;previously I felt pleasant, but now I feel unpleasant.&quot; When 
        the feeling is one of indifference, self is quite pronounced too, as 
        &quot;I feel neither pleasant nor unpleasant. I feel indifferent.&quot; 
        This is <i>attā</i> clinging with respect to feeling, known as <i>vedaka 
        attā, </i>the belief that it is self or soul who enjoys pleasant and 
        unpleasant feelings.</p>
        <p>This is how every ordinary worldling clings on to the notion of self. 
        In Indian literature, <i>vedanā</i> is described as self or having the 
        attributes of a self, but in Burma this notion does not seem to have 
        been put down in writing. All the same, there is the clinging to the 
        belief that, on happy occasions, &quot;It is I who enjoys pleasant 
        things,&quot; and when faced with difficult circumstances, &quot;It is I 
        who suffers.&quot; The reason for such beliefs lies in the fact that 
        inanimate objects, such as stones or sticks, do not feel heat or cold. 
        They feel neither happy nor sad under pleasant or unpleasant 
        circumstances. Animate objects, sentient beings, on the other hand, 
        suffer or rejoice according to pleasant or unpleasant circumstances. We 
        assume, therefore, that sentient beings must be endowed with an 
        animating spirit, a living entity, and it is this living entity which 
        enjoys on moments of pleasure or suffers on occasions of distress.</p>
        <p>In reality, feeling is not self, not living entity, but merely a 
        phenomenon that arises and vanishes as conditioned by circumstances. 
        Therefore, the Buddha declared first and foremost the truth: <i>&quot;Monks, 
        feeling is not self.&quot;</i> Then he continued to explain why:</p>
        <i>
        <p>&quot;Monks, if feeling were self, it would not tend to afflict or 
        distress, and one should be able to say of it, 'Let my feeling be thus 
        (always pleasant); let my feeling not be thus (unpleasant).' It should 
        be possible to influence feeling in this manner as one wishes.&quot;</p>
        </i>
        <p>True, if feeling were self, it would not cause distress, because it 
        is not usual for beings to inflict suffering on themselves, and it 
        should be possible to manage feeling as one wishes. These results should 
        all follow from the supposition &quot;if feeling were self.&quot; If 
        feeling did not tend to afflict, if our feelings were always pleasant as 
        we desire and never unpleasant, then we could regard feelings to be 
        truly self.</p>
        <p>This hypothetical statement, &quot;if feeling were self,&quot; is a 
        device to make us pause and consider whether feeling afflicts us or not, 
        and whether it can always be managed as we desire. On careful 
        examination, it will become obvious that feeling is almost always 
        afflicting us and that it arises not in accordance with our desires, but 
        with its own conditioning circumstances.</p>
        <p>You can see from your own personal experience how feeling afflicts 
        you; that you cannot have things your way by always enjoying pleasant 
        sights, sounds, and smells, pleasant foods and pleasant bodily feelings. 
        You will have discovered that unpleasant feelings outweigh the pleasant 
        ones. The reason one cannot have feeling as one wishes is because it is 
        not self or one's inner substance. The Blessed one continued to explain 
        why feeling is not self:</p>
        <i>
        <p>&quot;Monks, truly, feeling is not self. Since feeling is not self, 
        it tends to affliction, and it is not possible to say of it,'Let my 
        feelings be thus, let my feelings not be thus'.&quot;</p>
        </i>
        <p>Although it is evident that feeling is oppressive and ungovernable, 
        there are people with strong attachment to belief in self and intense 
        craving, <i>taṇhā,</i> who, trusting in pleasurable sensations, cling 
        to feeling as self and take delight in it. Careful consideration, 
        however, will reveal that moments of joy and happiness are few compared 
        to occasions of suffering and distress.</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>HOW FEELING INFLICTS SUFFERING</b></font></p>
        <p>There has to be constant accommodation and adjustment to maintain 
        ourselves comfortably. We suffer the discomfort of stiffness, cramp, 
        heat and pain when we are confined to one position for long, unless we 
        make the necessary adjustments in our bodily postures to relieve the 
        pain. The oppressive nature of feeling is evident even in the eye, which 
        needs constant accommodation by blinking and closing. Without these 
        adjustments, tiredness in the eye becomes unbearable. Other organs of 
        the body need similar accommodation. Even with constant adjustment, 
        under certain circumstances feeling is likely to inflict severe 
        suffering and may lead to serious ailment or even death. There have been 
        many cases of sick people, unable to bear their pain any longer, seeking 
        relief through suicide.</p>
        <p>Physical pains and suffering are not inflicted entirely by feeling; 
        the physical form <i>(rūpa)</i> also contributes its share, being the 
        original source of troubles. Thus, in the previous chapter on the 
        suffering caused by the body, I described different types of feelings, 
        and these may also be regarded as afflictions brought about by the <i>vedanakkhandha</i>.</p>
        <p>Mental distress and suffering, on the other hand, are afflictions 
        caused solely by <i>vedanā </i>without the aid of <i>rūpa</i>. When 
        loved ones, parents, husbands, wives, sons and daughters die, feeling 
        inflicts sorrow and grief. Loss of wealth and property may produce 
        intense mental suffering, and that may in turn result in death. 
        Frustration and discontent owing to failure to solve life's problems, 
        separation from associates and friends, and unfulfilled hopes and 
        desires, are other forms of oppression inflicted by feeling. Even 
        pleasant feelings, which are very comforting while they last, eventually 
        prove to be a source of distress. When they disappear after their brief 
        sojourn one is left with lingering memories and yearning. One has to be 
        constantly trying to maintain pleasant, happy states. Thus people go in 
        pursuit of pleasant states even at the risk of their lives. If they 
        happen to use illegal and immoral means in their pursuits, retribution 
        is bound to overtake them, either in this lifetime or in the states of 
        woe. Thus it is that apparently pleasant sensations, <i>sukha vedanā</i>, 
        also inflict pain and distress.</p>
        <i>
        <p>Upekkha vedanā</i>, equanimous feeling, like pleasant feeling, 
        produces comfort and happiness. And like pleasant feeling, it requires 
        constant effort to maintain, which of course entails tiredness and 
        trouble. Both pleasant and neutral feeling are short-lived. Being of 
        fleeting nature, they require constant labor for their maintenance, and 
        this involves continuous striving, which is <i>saṅkhāra dukkha</i>, 
        suffering due to conditioned things. This is just a brief indication of 
        the oppressive nature of all three kinds of feelings.</p>
        <p>If there were no feeling there would be no experience of pain or 
        pleasure, either physically or mentally; there would be freedom from 
        suffering. Consider for instance a log, a post, a stone or a lump of 
        earth: having no feeling, they do not suffer. Even when hacked, beaten, 
        crushed or burned they are unaffected.</p>
        <p>The continuum of corporeality and mentality which are associated with 
        feeling is, however, afflicted with suffering in many ways.</p>
        <p>Thus it is plain that feeling is not self, not inner substance.</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>HOW FEELING IS UNMANAGEABLE</b></font></p>
        <p>Feeling is unmanageable and not amenable to one's will. Just notice 
        how we cannot manage to see and hear only what is pleasant or taste and 
        smell only what is delicious and sweet. Even when, with great effort and 
        labor, we pick out only what is most desirable to see, hear, taste or 
        smell, these objects do not last. We can enjoy them only for a short 
        while before they vanish. Thus we cannot manage or maintain a state in 
        which pleasant and desirable things will remain permanently as we wish. 
        When pleasant sense objects vanish, they are replaced by undesirable 
        objects which, of course, cause suffering. We have already explained 
        that unpleasant sounds are more oppressive than unpleasant sights; 
        undesirable smells worse than undesirable sounds and undesirable tastes 
        far worse still. Further, toxic substances may even cause death. Worst 
        of all are unpleasant sensations of touch: when injured by accidents, 
        weapons, or fire or afflicted by disease, the suffering which ensues is 
        always very painful; it may be so intense as to cause wailing or even 
        death. These are unpleasant feelings which cannot be forbidden from 
        happening. That which is unmanageable is surely not self. Feeling is 
        thus not self, and it is not proper to cling to it as self, one's inner 
        substance.</p>
        <p>So far I have described only those feelings experienced in the human 
        world. The feelings of the four nether worlds are far more excruciating. 
        Animals such as cattle, buffaloes, chickens and pigs have to face 
        torment almost all the time, with no one to assist them or guard them 
        against these afflictions. The <i>petas</i> (hungry ghosts) have to 
        suffer more than the animals, but the denizens of hell, the <i>Niriya </i>states, 
        suffer the most. We cannot afford to remain smug in the thought that 
        these four nether worlds have nothing to do with us. Until and unless we 
        have attained the stage of the Noble Ones, there is always the 
        possibility of having to face the suffering of the lower worlds.</p>
        <p>Thus, as feeling tends to affliction in every existence, it cannot be 
        regarded as self or the inner core of existence, and it is not possible 
        to prevent unpleasant feeling from arising. Undesirable feelings arise 
        inevitably of their own accord. Mental distress, which we do not wish to 
        arise, makes its appearance all the same. This all goes to show the 
        uncontrollable nature of feeling. Each being has to contend with feeling 
        which cannot be controlled, and hence, cannot be self or one's own inner 
        substance.</p>
        <p>As stated in the Canonical text, the feelings which are felt in one's 
        own body tend to cause affliction and are not amenable to control. Hence 
        it is very clear that feeling is not self, not one's inner substance. 
        Nevertheless, ordinary worldlings cling to the belief: &quot;It is I who 
        suffers after experiencing happiness; it is I who enjoys, as 
        circumstances favor, after going through distress.&quot; It is not easy 
        to completely eradicate clinging to belief in self. The ingrained belief 
        in feeling as self is abandoned only through personal realization of 
        feeling's true nature, which can be brought about by contemplation in 
        accordance with <i>Satipaṭṭhāna Vipassanā</i> practice, or the 
        Middle Way, as instructed by the Blessed One. We will now deal with how 
        this self-clinging can be discarded by contemplation on feeling.</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>CONTEMPLATION OF FEELINGS</b></font></p>
        <p>A brief description of <i>vipassanā</i> meditation has been given in 
        the first chapter. The meditator who keeps note of rising, falling, 
        sitting and so on as described therein will come to notice in time 
        uncomfortable sensations such as pain, stiffness and heat. He must 
        concentrate on these different feelings as they arise by noting, 
        &quot;pain, pain,&quot; &quot;stiffness, stiffness,&quot; &quot;heat, 
        heat,&quot; whatever the case may be. During the initial period when 
        concentration is not yet strong, these distressing sensations may get 
        more and more intense, but the meditator must put up with the pain and 
        discomfort as long as possible and keep on noting the sensations as they 
        arise. As his concentration gets strengthened, the discomforting pains 
        will gradually lose their intensity and begin to fade away. With very 
        deep concentration they will suddenly vanish, as if removed by hand, 
        even while they are being noted, never again to come back and trouble 
        the meditator. We see examples of such cessation of feeling in the story 
        of the <i>Bojjhaṅga Sutta</i>, in which the Venerable Mahā Kassapa 
        and others were relieved of illnesses by listening to teachings on the 
        Factors of Enlightenment <i>(Bojjhaṅga).</p>
        </i>
        <p>However, prior to the advent of strong concentration, the meditator 
        will find that painful sensations in one place disappear only to arise 
        in another form at another site. When the new sensation is heedfully 
        noted, it vanishes to be replaced in turn by another form of sensation 
        in yet another place. When distressing feelings have been seen 
        repeatedly appearing and vanishing in this way for a considerable time, 
        personal realization comes to the meditator that &quot;feeling is always 
        oppressive. Unpleasant feeling cannot be prevented from arising; it is 
        uncontrollable. Both pleasant and unpleasant feelings are not self, not 
        one's inner substance.&quot; This is the true knowledge of contemplation 
        on nonself.</p>
        <p>The meditator who has observed the vanishing of feeling in the course 
        of contemplation recalls the oppressive nature of feeling while it 
        lasted; he knows that feeling has disappeared not because of his wishing 
        for it, nor in obedience to his commands, but as a result of necessary 
        conditions brought about by concentrated mental power. It is truly 
        ungovernable. Thus the meditator realizes that feeling, whether pleasant 
        or painful, is a natural process, arising of its own accord. It is not 
        self or inner substance. Furthermore the incessant arising and vanishing 
        of feeling as it is being noted also establishes the fact that feeling 
        has the nature of nonself.</p>
        <p>When the meditator reaches the stage of <i>udayabbaya ñāṇa</i>, 
        knowledge of the arising and falling of compounded things, he notices 
        that his meditation practice of noting phenomena is proceeding with ease 
        and comfort un-accompanied by pain or suffering. This is manifestation 
        of an especially pleasant feeling, which cannot be maintained for long, 
        however much the meditator wishes it. When his concentration wanes and 
        becomes weakened, that pleasant feeling vanishes and may not arise again 
        in spite of his yearning for it. Then it dawns upon him that feeling is 
        not subjected to one's will and is ungovernable, and so it is not self 
        or inner essence. The meditator then realizes through personal 
        experience the nonself nature of feeling.</p>
        <p>He also vividly sees the nonself nature of feeling because of its 
        dissolution on each occasion of noting. In the initial stages of 
        meditating, the meditator suffers from physical pain of stiffness, 
        itching, or heat. Occasionally, he suffers the mental distress of 
        disappointment, dejection, fear or repugnance. He should keep on noting 
        these unpleasant feelings. He will come to know that while unpleasant 
        feelings are manifesting, pleasant sensations do not arise.</p>
        <p>On some occasions, however, the meditator experiences very pleasant 
        sensations in the course of meditation, both physical and mental. When 
        he thinks of happy incidents, for instance, happy feelings are evoked. 
        He should keep on noting the pleasant feelings as they arise. He will 
        come to know then that while pleasant feelings are manifesting, 
        unpleasant sensations do not arise.</p>
        <p>On the whole, however, the meditator is mostly engaged in noting the 
        origination and dissolution of ordinary corporeal and mental processes, 
        such as the rise and fall of the abdomen, which excite neither painful 
        nor pleasant sensations.</p>
        <p>The meditator notes these occasions in which only neutral feeling is 
        evident. He knows, therefore, that when equanimous feeling arises, both 
        painful and pleasant feelings are absent. With this personal knowledge 
        comes the realization that feeling makes a momentary appearance, only to 
        quickly vanish, hence it is transitory and not self, not a permanent 
        ego.</p>
        <p>At this juncture, I would like to include a description of the <i>Dīghanakha 
        Sutta</i>, as it affords a good illustration of how such realization 
        comes about. We must, however, first begin with an account of how the 
        Venerable Sārīputta, who played a major role in that <i>Sutta</i>, 
        attained to higher knowledge.</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>THE VENERABLE SĀRĪPUTTA'S SEARCH FOR 
        HIGHER KNOWLEDGE</b></font></p>
        <p>Two young men, Upatissa and Kolita, who were later to become known as 
        the Venerables Sārīputta and Moggallāna (two of the Buddha's foremost 
        disciples), became wandering ascetics under the great teacher Sañjaya, 
        with a view to seek the un-aging, the un-decaying and the Deathless 
        [i.e., <i>Nibbāna</i>]. They learned all that had to be taught by the 
        great Sañjaya in a few days' time and came to realize that there was no 
        substance in his teaching. Consequently the two of them left the great 
        teacher and roamed about the entire Middle Country in further search of 
        Truth.</p>
        <p>Finding it nowhere, they made their way back to the city of Rājagaha. 
        It was in that city that the wanderer Upatissa came upon the Venerable 
        Assaji, the youngest member of the Group of Five, while he was going on 
        alms round. Upatissa followed him closely to his eating place after the 
        round. He prepared a seat for the monk and</p>
        <p>offered him drinking water, then asked him about his Master and his 
        Teaching. The Venerable Assaji replied that his teacher was the 
        Perfectly Enlightened One, the Buddha. As to the Teaching, since he had 
        just come to the Buddha's Dispensation, he said, he knew only little of 
        it. Upatissa then said, &quot;Please, tell me whatever little you know 
        of the Teaching. I shall expand upon it myself.&quot;</p>
        <p>Thereupon, the Venerable Assaji gave the wanderer Upatissa this short 
        summary of the Buddha's Teaching:</p>
        <b><i>
        <p>Ye dhammā hetuppabhavā, tesaṁ hetuṁ</i> <i>tathāgato āha. Te 
        sañjā yo nirodho</i>. <i>Evaṁ vādi Mahāsamaṇo.</p>
        </i></b>
        <p>&quot;There are these <i>dhammas (dukkha</i> <i>sacca; </i>the truth 
        of suffering) which have arisen because of certain causes <i>(samudaya</i> 
        <i>sacca; </i>the truth of the cause of suffering): our Master, the 
        Perfect One, has told about these causes. And there is this state <i>(Nibbāna)</i> 
        where all these <i>Dhammas</i> and their causes come to cessation. The 
        Perfect One has told of this cessation too. This is the Teaching of our 
        Master, the Blessed Noble <i>Samaṇa</i>.&quot;</p>
        <p>This is the short account of the teaching given by the Venerable 
        Assaji. Quite brief: &quot;All <i>dhammas</i> arise because of causes. 
        Our Master has taught about the causes.&quot; But this condensed 
        teaching was sufficient for the wanderer Upatissa to see the light of <i>Dhamma</i> 
        and attain the knowledge of the first Path and Fruition and become a 
        Stream Enterer. A very speedy achievement, I must say. I find that 
        present-day meditators show no remarkable progress after meditating for 
        a whole day and night. Only after seven days of hard work do they begin 
        to get a glimpse of the corporeal and mental processes and the nature of 
        impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and insub- stantiality. Most meditators 
        take about a month and a half to reach the stage which may be called the 
        knowledge of the First Path and Fruition. It may be two and half months 
        to three months before others can be said to have made similar 
        attainments. Quite a long time, is it not?</p>
        <p>The speedy achievement of the wanderer Upatissa may be attributed to 
        the fact that he had already developed meditation almost to the stage of 
        the Path and Fruition throughout his previous existences. He could have 
        achieved the knowledge of the Path and Fruition in those past 
        existences, but he had made a vow to become a chief Disciple of a 
        Buddha. In this last existence (when his vow would be fulfilled), 
        propelled by the momentum of <i>Vipassanā</i> practices of his previous 
        existences, he made speedy progress through the sequence of <i>Vipassanā 
        ñāṇas</i> to attain the knowledge of the First Path and Fruition. 
        Although the teaching was brief, it contained an illuminating message 
        for development of insight knowledge.</p>
        <p>Prior to the teachings of the Buddha, it was generally held that 
        &quot;each individual being has living entity, an inner substance, a 
        self, which is everlasting, permanent. It is not simply conditions 
        arisen dependent on causes, but has been in permanent existence.&quot; 
        Venerable Assaji's statement said that there is no such permanent 
        entity; there is only the truth of suffering, corporeality and 
        mentality, which are the result of the workings of craving <i>(taṇhā)</i> 
        and clinging <i>(upādāna)</i>, the truth of the origin of suffering. 
        These resultant effects of the<b> </b>cause of suffering are none other 
        than the corporeality and mentality of one's own person which are 
        involved in the acts of seeing, hearing and so on.</p>
        <p>Upatissa realized at once that all that had been manifesting in sense 
        awareness since the time of his birth was simply a process of 
        incessantly arising and ceasing corporeality and mentality. They arose 
        as a result of craving and clinging to life and existence. It should be 
        noted that Upatissa developed insight knowledge by taking note of the 
        phenomenon of change even as he was receiving the message from the 
        Venerable Assaji, and in consequence instantly attained the knowledge of 
        the Path and Fruition.</p>
        <p>Having become a Stream Enterer, Upatissa asked the Venerable Assaji 
        where the Blessed One was then staying. Before the monk departed, 
        Upatissa informed him that he would be going to see the Buddha. He then 
        went back to his friend, Kolita, who, noticing his composed features and 
        clear countenance, asked him, &quot;Well, friend, is it possible that 
        you have found the Deathless?&quot; Upatissa declared that he had indeed 
        found the Deathless and recounted to his friend what had happened. In 
        doing so, he quoted the verse recited for him by the Venerable Assaji. 
        As a consequence, Kolita also instantly became a Stream Enterer.</p>
        <p>The two of them then decided to go to the Blessed One. But first they 
        went to the great teacher Sañjaya and invited him to go with them. Sañjaya 
        declined their invitation, saying, &quot;You go along. I have no wish to 
        go. From being a big storage tank, I can't become a small carrying pot, 
        becoming a disciple to others.&quot; The two friends reminded him, 
        &quot;The Blessed One is a truly Enlightened One. People will go to him 
        instead.&quot; To this, Sañjaya replied, &quot;Have no worry on that 
        account. There are more fools in this world than wise people. The wise 
        will go to the Samaṇa Gotama. The fools, who form the majority, will 
        come to me. You go along as you wish.&quot;</p>
        <p>Nowadays, there are many imposters and bogus religious teachers who 
        hold views similar to that of this wanderer Sañjaya. People should be 
        wary of such teachers.</p>
        <p>Then Upatissa and Kolita went with two hundred and fifty wanderers, 
        who were their followers, to the Blessed One. After listening to the 
        discourse given by the Blessed One, the two hundred and fifty followers 
        became <i>Arahats</i>. The two leaders, with their two hundred and fifty 
        <i>Arahat</i> followers, then requested admission to the Order, and the 
        Blessed One gave them the <i>Ehi bhikkhu</i> ordination, saying, 
        &quot;Come, monk.&quot; From that time the wanderer Upatissa became 
        known as the Elder Sāriputta, and the wanderer Kolita, the Elder Mahā 
        Moggallāna.</p>
        <p>Having been thus ordained, they continued with the practice of 
        meditation. The Elder Moggallāna attained <i>Arahatship</i> within 
        seven days of ordination. The Elder Sāriputta was, however, still 
        practicing <i>vipassanā </i>meditation, employing the <i>anupada dhamma</i> 
        method of meditation (reviewing and analyzing all levels of 
        consciousness step by step with insight) up to the full moon day of 
        February (two weeks after his ordination).</p>
        <p>On that full moon day, the wanderer Dīghanakha, who had stayed 
        behind with the teacher Sañjaya, thought to himself &quot;Whenever my 
        uncle, Upatissa, went to see other religious teachers, he always came 
        back soon. But on this visit to Samaṇa Gotama he has been gone for a 
        whole fortnight, and there is no news of him. What if I followed him to 
        find out if there is any substance (in Buddha Gotama's Teaching)?&quot; 
        So he set out to where the Venerable Sāriputta was staying to inquire 
        about the Buddha's Teaching.</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>DĪGHANAKHA SUTTA</b></font></p>
        <p>On that day, at that time, the Blessed One was staying in the 
        Sukarakhātā Cave in the Vultures' Peak. The Venerable Sāriputta was 
        standing behind the Blessed One, gently waving a fan. The wanderer Dīghanakha 
        approached the Blessed One and, after exchanging greetings, said: 
        &quot;My theory and view is this, Master Gotama, 'I have no liking for 
        any'.&quot; What he meant by this statement was that he did not like any 
        belief in fresh becoming; in other words, in the belief that a new 
        existence arises after passing away from the present one. But since he 
        said he had no liking for anything, it amounted to declaring that he did 
        not like his own belief either. Therefore the Blessed One asked him: 
        &quot;Have you also no liking for this view of yours: 'I have no liking 
        for any'?&quot;</p>
        <p>To this, Dīghanakha gave an ambiguous reply: &quot;Even if I had a 
        liking for this view of mine, it would all be the same.&quot; This is 
        typical of those who, holding on to wrong views, equivocate when they 
        realize that what they believe in or have said is wrong.</p>
        <p>In order to bring out the wanderer's view, the Blessed One said, 
        &quot;The belief in eternalism <i>(sassata)</i> is close to craving, 
        close to fetter, to relishing, to accepting, to holding tight and 
        clinging. The belief in annihilationism <i>(uccheda)</i> is close to 
        non-craving, to non-fetter, to non-relishing, non-accepting, non-holding 
        tight, and non-clinging.&quot; Upon this Dīghanakha remarked, 
        &quot;Master Gotama commends my view; Master Gotama commends my 
        view.&quot;</p>
        <p>However the Blessed One was merely explaining the true virtues and 
        faults of the views of the eternalists and annihilationists. The 
        eternalists abhor and avoid unmeritorious <i>(akusala)</i> acts in order 
        to avoid the evil consequences in coming existences. They engage in 
        wholesome deeds, but they relish and take delight in pleasures which 
        would promote further rounds of existence. And, the Commentary says, it 
        is very hard to abandon the eternalist view. Even those who have 
        professedly embraced Buddhism find it difficult to accept that there is 
        no self, no living entity, only a continuous process of corporeality and 
        mentality. For <i>Arahats,</i> having completely eradicated clinging and 
        craving, there is no fresh arising of corporeality and mentality in a 
        new existence after <i>Parinibbāna</i>. The process of corporeality and 
        mentality comes to a complete cessation. The eternalists would like to 
        believe that after <i>Parinibbāna</i>, the <i>Arahats</i> continue to 
        exist in special forms of corporeality and mentality.</p>
        <p>The Commentary has this to say on the subject:</p>
        <p>&quot;The eternalists know that there is a present life and an 
        afterlife. They know there are resultant good or bad effects consequent 
        on good or bad deeds. They undertake meritorious deeds and shrink from 
        bad deeds, but they relish and take delight in pleasures which could 
        give rise to fresh existences. Even when they encounter the Blessed One 
        or his disciples, they find it hard to abandon their beliefs. So it may 
        be said of the eternalist belief that, although its faults are not 
        grave, it is hard to give up.</p>
        <p>&quot;On the other hand, annihilationists do not know that there is 
        passage to the human world from other existences and that there is an 
        afterlife. They do not know that there are resultant good or bad 
        consequences to good or bad deeds. They do not engage in meritorious 
        actions. They have no fear of bad deeds. They do not relish or take 
        delight in pleasures which could give rise to fresh existences (because 
        they do not believe in afterlife), but when they enter the presence of 
        the Blessed One or his disciples, they can abandon their belief 
        immediately. Thus, with regard to the annihilationist belief, it may be 
        said that its faults are grave but it is easy to give up.&quot;</p>
        <p>Dīghanakha could not grasp the motive behind the Blessed One's 
        statement. He assumed that the Blessed One was commending him for his 
        view that there is nothing after death, that is why he said, 
        &quot;Master Gotama commends my view.&quot; In order to enable him to 
        abandon his view, the Blessed One continued to give a critical review of 
        three beliefs current in those days: namely, the eternalist view, which 
        holds &quot;I have a liking for all&quot;; the annihilationist view 
        which holds &quot;I have no liking for any&quot;; and a form of 
        eternalist view which holds &quot;I have a liking for some, I have no 
        liking for some&quot;.</p>
        <p>To summarize what the Blessed One said, it was explained: &quot;When 
        one holds fast to any one of the above views, there is a likelihood of 
        clashing with the other two. And when there is clash, there are 
        disputes, which lead to quarrels. And when there are quarrels, there is 
        harm.&quot; Therefore the Blessed One urged that all three beliefs 
        should be discarded.</p>
        <p>Here it may be asked whether the Buddhist view that &quot;fresh 
        becomings arise in new existences as conditioned by one's <i>kamma</i>&quot; 
        is not the same as the eternalist view. The answer is no. The Buddhist 
        view does not infer the transfer of self, living entity, from one 
        existence to another. It means only the arising of new corporeality and 
        mentality in a new existence, depending on previous <i>kamma</i>. The 
        eternalists believe that it is the self that migrates to a new 
        existence. The two views are, therefore, clearly different.</p>
        <p>Again, the question may arise whether the Buddhist teaching of 
        cessation of corporeality and mentality after the <i>Parinibbāna</i> of 
        <i>Arahats</i> and the non-arrival in a new existence is not the same as 
        the annihilationist view, which maintains that nothing remains after 
        death. Here, too, there is no similarity. According to the 
        annihilationists, a living entity exists before death and disappears 
        after death. No special effort is needed to make it disappear; it makes 
        its own &quot;exit&quot;.</p>
        <p>In addition, materialists think that there is suffering only before 
        death. This clinging to the notion of suffering or enjoyment before 
        death is clinging to self. In Buddhist teachings, the <i>Arahat</i> has, 
        before <i>Parinibbāna</i>, no sense of self, and sees only a continuous 
        process of corporeality and mentality. Suffering and happiness are the 
        natural manifestations of feeling, which happen recurrently. After <i>Parinibbāna</i>, 
        the continuous process of corporeality and mentality comes to cessation 
        in an <i>Arahat</i>. This cessation does not come about on its own, but 
        by virtue of the Noble Path, in which <i>kilesa</i> and <i>kamma</i>, 
        which are responsible for the arising of corporeality and mentality, are 
        eradicated. When the cause of their becoming disappears, no new 
        corporeality and mentality arise. Thus there is a world of difference 
        between cessation after <i>Parinibbāna</i> described in Buddhist 
        teachings and the cessation envisaged by the annihilationists.</p>
        <p>A further question may be asked: &quot;Just as the eternalists 
        dispute with the annihilationists, is there not the possibility of 
        disputes between those who believe in nonself and those who hold on to 
        the notion of self?&quot; Teaching about Right View is not disputing, it 
        is promoting knowledge and truth for the benefit of others. That there 
        is only a continuous process of change from old to new corporeality and 
        mentality, no permanent self, is the doctrine of nonself, which is Right 
        View. For those who hold the Right View of nonself, there is no 
        likelihood of involvement in disputes or controversies. We will find the 
        Buddha's own explanation on this point when we come to the last part of 
        this <i>Sutta</i>. After explaining that the three wrong views of 
        eternalism, annihilationism, and partial eternalism should be abolished, 
        the Blessed One went on to advise giving up clinging to the material 
        body:</p>
        <p>&quot;Aggivessana [Dīghanakha's clan name], this material body of 
        ours is made up of the four great primary elements, sprung from the 
        blood and sperm of our parents, and built up by food such as rice and 
        bread. Being subject to impermanence, it has to be maintained by massage 
        and anointing; even when sustained thus, it still dissolves and 
        disintegrates. It should be regarded as impermanent, suffering, a 
        disease, a spike, an abscess, an evil, an ailment; as alien, as 
        destructible, as void of self. When it is regarded so, there is 
        abandonment of craving and clinging to it.&quot;</p>
        <p>Having thus talked on the nature of corporeality, <i>rūpa</i>, the 
        Blessed One continued with the teaching on the nature of mentality, <i>nāma</i>.</p>
        <p>&quot;Aggivessana, there are three kinds of feeling in our physical 
        makeup: pleasant, painful and neither painful nor pleasant feeling. When 
        a person experiences any one of the feelings, he does not experience the 
        other two. Since each feeling arises singly, it should be understood 
        that it is impermanent, conditionally formed <i>(saṅkhata),</i> 
        dependently originated <i>(Paṭiccasamuppāda),</i> subject to 
        exhaustion and dissolution <i>(khaya, vaya),</i><b> </b>fading and 
        ceasing <i>(virāga, nirodha).&quot;</i> (It should be noted that by 
        these words the Blessed One showed how, by contemplating on feeling, one 
        comes to know its arising depending on circumstances and its immediate 
        exhaustion, fading and dissolution.)</p>
        <p>Meditators who are taking note of the corporeal and mental phenomena 
        starting from the rise and fall of the abdomen, as I have instructed, 
        should also concentrate on feelings and take note of them as 
        &quot;painful, painful&quot; when a painful feeling arises; 
        &quot;unhappy, unhappy&quot; when an unhappy feeling appears; 
        &quot;pleasant, pleasant,&quot; when a pleasant feeling arises; and 
        &quot;happy, happy&quot; when feeling happy. When the sensation is not 
        vividly pleasant or painful, attention should be directed on the body or 
        on whichever mental state is prominent.</p>
        <p>While thus heedfully observing feelings, the pleasant or painful 
        feelings will be perceived clearly, arising recurrently and instantly 
        vanishing, like raindrops falling on a person walking in the rain and 
        then disappearing. Just like external raindrops, the inner 
        &quot;raindrops&quot; appear as if they have fallen on the body from an 
        external source. When this phenomenon is clearly seen, realization comes 
        to the meditator that these feelings are impermanent, imperfect because 
        of incessant arising and ceasing, and not self, having no 
        substantiality. As a consequence of such realization, there develops the 
        sense of weariness and dispassion, which the Blessed One continued to 
        explain:</p>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">WEARINESS THROUGH CONTEMPLATING FEELING</font></b></p>
        <p>&quot;Aggivessana, when the meditator sees the three forms of feeling 
        as impermanent, he becomes wearied of pleasant feeling, of unpleasant 
        feeling, and of feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant.&quot;</p>
        <p>These words should be specially borne in mind. The purpose of insight 
        <i>(vipassanā)</i> meditation is to develop <i>nibbidā ñāṇa</i>, 
        the knowledge of disenchantment, a sense of weariness. Only when the 
        phenomenon of incessant arising and ceasing has been personally seen and 
        experienced can the nature of impermanence be fully and thoroughly 
        grasped and the sense of disenchantment developed.</p>
        <p>Note that in this <i>Dīghanakha Sutta</i>, no mention is made of 
        detailed observation of the separate components of body.</p>
        <p>The body must be contemplated as an aggregate. From the words quoted 
        above, it is clear that it is possible to develop a sense of weariness 
        without contemplating on separate components of the body as described in 
        the <i>Abhidhamma</i>.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, in connection with the contemplation on mentality, only 
        the three components of feeling are mentioned. Nothing was said of other 
        mental components, such as consciousness and mental formations. It is 
        clear here, too, that a sense of weariness can be developed simply by 
        taking note of the three feelings at the moment of their arising. It 
        must be noted, however, that it is not just painful feeling, but all the 
        three kinds of feeling that should be contemplated, because all three 
        manifest.</p>
        <p>The Blessed One then went on to explain how knowledge of the Path and 
        Fruition and knowledge of retrospection arise after development of the 
        sense of disenchantment.</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>THE PATH AND FRUITION ARISING THROUGH 
        DISENCHANTMENT</b></font></p>
        <p>When weariness has been developed, or because of weariness 
        (disenchantment), the meditator's lust (craving) fades away. In other 
        words, he becomes passion-free and the knowledge of the Noble Path 
        arises. By virtue of knowledge of the Noble Path, which causes the 
        destruction of craving, he is liberated. In other words, Fruition of 
        liberation <i>(arahattaphala)</i> appears. When he is thus liberated, 
        there comes the knowledge that his mind is liberated.</p>
        <p>He understands by retrospection that, &quot;Birth is exhausted, the 
        Holy Life has been lived out, what had to be done has been done, there 
        is no more of this to come.&quot;</p>
        <p>In these words, the Blessed One described how <i>Arahatship</i> was 
        attained and knowledge of retrospection developed. Then he continued to 
        explain that the liberated person, after attaining <i>Arahatship</i>, 
        does not get involved in quarrels or disputes.</p>
        <p>&quot;Aggivessana, the monk who is thus liberated from taints <i>(āsava)</i> 
        disputes with no-one. Although he employs the conventional expressions 
        such as 'I, you, man, woman,' he does not wrongly hold the notion that 
        they represent the ultimate truth. He does not quarrel with anyone 
        because he has come to know the truth and talks only about the 
        truth.&quot;</p>
        <p>The <i>Puppha Sutta</i> of the <i>Khandhavagga</i>, in the <i>Saṁyutta 
        Nikāya</i>, has this to say:</p>
        <i>
        <p>Nahaṁ bhikkhave lokena vivadāmi. Lokova mayā vivadati. Na 
        bhikkhave dhammavādi kenaci lokasmiṁ vivadati.</p>
        </i>
        <p>&quot;Monks, I do not dispute with the world, it is the world that 
        disputes with me. Monks, one who is in the habit of speaking the truth 
        does not engage in arguments or disputes with anyone in the world. In 
        other words, as he speaks the truth, it cannot be said of him that he is 
        argumentative.&quot;</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>ARAHATSHIP OF THE VENERABLE SĀRIPUTTA</b></font></p>
        <p>While the Blessed One was explaining to the wanderer Dīghanakha how 
        the three feelings should be contemplated, and how through such 
        contemplation <i>Arahatship</i> may be gained, the Venerable Sāriputta 
        was standing behind him, fanning him. When he heard the discourse on the 
        three feelings, the Venerable Sāriputta, already a <i>Stream Enterer</i>, 
        gained the highest knowledge of <i>Arahatship</i>, even as he was 
        fanning the Blessed One.</p>
        <p>In the <i>Anupada Sutta</i>, his attainment of <i>Arahatship</i> is 
        described thus: The Venerable Sāriputta went into the first <i>jhāna</i>, 
        second <i>jhāna</i> and so on through all the <i>jhānas</i> of form 
        and the formless <i>jhānas</i>. As he came out of each <i>jhāna</i>, 
        he contemplated its nature, and by such contemplation he became an <i>Arahat 
        </i>on the fifteenth day of meditation.</p>
        <p>In another <i>Sutta</i> the Venerable Sāriputta himself explained 
        that he attained <i>Arahatship</i> through contemplating the corporeal 
        and mental processes going on inside him.</p>
        <p>The three <i>Suttas</i> may be reconciled by assuming that the 
        Venerable Sāriputta had gone into <i>jhāna</i> while listening to the 
        discourse on the three feelings, and, on coming out of the <i>jhānas</i>, 
        had contemplated on the feelings of the <i>jhānic</i> stages and 
        consequently attained the higher Path and Fruition.</p>
        <p>His nephew, the wanderer Dīghanakha, became a Stream Enterer while 
        listening to the discourse. It must be understood here that he did so by 
        virtue of insight developed by contemplating the feelings which arose in 
        him while listening to it.</p>
        <p>At the end of the Discourse, the Blessed One came down from the 
        Vultures' Peak and convened a meeting of his disciples. The Venerable Sāriputta, 
        knowing of the meeting through reflective insight, made his way to the 
        Veḷuvana Monastery by means of psychic powers.</p>
        <p>The distinguishing features of this congregation of disciples were:</p>
        <p>1. It was held on the full-moon day of February, when the 
        constellation of the lion comes into prominence.</p>
        <p>2. The monks attending the conference came uninvited, on their own 
        initiative.</p>
        <p>3. All the attending monks were <i>Arahats</i> endowed with the six<b> 
        </b><i>abhiññā</i>, super knowledges.</p>
        <p>4. All the monks had received the <i>&quot;Ehi bhikkhu&quot;</i> 
        ordination.</p>
        <p>It is stated that one thousand two hundred and fifty monks attended 
        that conference convened by the Blessed One.</p>
        <p>We have digressed from the original discourse on <i>Anattalakkhaṇa 
        Sutta</i> by including the <i>Dīghanakha Sutta</i> in our discussions. 
        I shall end the discourse today by recapitulating the passage which says 
        that feeling is not self.</p>
        <i>
        <p>&quot;Monks, feeling is not self; if feeling were self, it would not 
        tend to afflict or distress, and it should be possible to say of 
        feeling, 'Let feeling be thus, let feeling not be thus.' It is not 
        possible to influence feeling in this manner.&quot;</p>
