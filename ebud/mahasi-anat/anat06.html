        </i></b>
        <p><font size="6">T</font>he Blessed One asked: &quot;Is feeling 
        permanent or impermanent?&quot; &quot;Impermanent, Lord, replied the 
        Group of Five. We have spoken about feeling to a certain extent in the 
        previous chapters, but as it is next to be considered according to the <i>Sutta</i>, 
        we shall explain it a little more.</p>
        <p>Feeling is of three kinds: feeling of pleasantness or happiness; 
        feeling of unpleasantness or unhappiness; feeling of neither 
        pleasantness nor unpleasantness. Ordinary worldlings regard all three 
        types of feeling as self, living substance, as enduring and permanent. 
        These forms of clinging are called <i>nivāsī</i> <i>attā </i>clinging 
        and <i>vedaka attā </i>clinging.</p>
        <i>
        <p>Nivāsī attā </i>clinging is belief in a permanent, continuous 
        entity or self. Ordinary people believe that there exists a living 
        entity, a self, in their body from the time of conception to the time of 
        death and, some believe, even after death. This is <i>nivāsī attā</i> 
        clinging. They think that this same permanent entity in the body is the 
        one that feels pleasant or unpleasant sensations; this self feels now 
        pleasant in mind and body, now unpleasant and uncomfortable. Thus they 
        believe that feelings last forever, that they are enduring. Actually, 
        when feeling pleasant, there is no unpleasant or neutral feeling; when 
        feeling unpleasant there is no pleasant or neutral feeling. Similarly 
        when feeling neutral, there is no pleasant or unpleasant feeling. There 
        is no feeling which is everlasting. Whether pleasant, unpleasant or 
        neutral, feeling arises depending on conditions, lasts only a moment and 
        then disappears.</p>
        <p>An untrained person who is unable to follow the feelings as they 
        arise is liable to develop the impression that all three feelings exist 
        simultaneously. Thus, while feeling a painful sensation in the body one 
        hears some glad news and is happy over it<b>. </b>Or one may be enjoying 
        a pleasant sensation in the body when one happens to think about an 
        unhappy event and feel unhappy. On these occasions, it is usually 
        believed that both pleasant and unpleasant sensations are being felt at 
        the same time. This is because one lacks the ability to distinguish 
        between two successive minds or feelings. In reality, the feelings arise 
        one at a time, one after another.</p>
        <p>Thus when the meditator who is diligently noting the phenomena of 
        rising and falling notices the appearance of a painful feeling in the 
        body, he should give concentrated attention to it and note it 
        continuously as &quot;pain, pain.&quot; If his concentration is strong 
        enough, the unbearable pain keeps decreasing in intensity even as he is 
        taking note of it and may disappear altogether. For some, the pain will 
        vanish completely and suddenly as if removed by hand. When there is no 
        pain or pleasant feeling to take note of, the meditator reverts back to 
        noting the usual, neutral phenomena of the rising and falling of the 
        abdomen. This is contemplating neutral feeling. While thus contemplating 
        neutral feeling, if pleasant feeling arises, attention should be 
        switched on to it. Similarly, attention should be given to any 
        unpleasant feeling that happens to arise. Taking note of the pleasant, 
        unpleasant and neutral feelings as they arise in this manner, personal 
        knowledge confirms that they are not everlasting. This is discerning 
        each kind of feeling as it occurs in the &quot;continuity of the 
        present.&quot;</p>
        <p>The meditator who has advanced to the stages of <i>udayabbaya</i> and 
        <i>bhaṅga ñāṇa</i> finds that feeling vanishes and ceases section 
        by section, bit by bit. The ordinary phenomena of rise and fall are also 
        found to be passing away section by section, bit by bit. When pleasant 
        feelings and neutral feelings appear in turn, they are separated, not 
        one, continuous phenomenon or process. Similarly with unpleasant feeling 
        appearing along with neutral feeling, they are noted as two distinct 
        feelings. The meditator observing in this manner perceives each feeling 
        or sensation to arise and disappear instantly, and this drives home the 
        fact that feeling is not everlasting. This is knowing the phenomenon 
        section by section in terms of the momentary present. The meditator who 
        is watching the phenomena of rising, falling, and feeling painful is 
        doing so in order to see each phenomenon section by section, bit by bit, 
        in its momentary present.</p>
        <p>Therefore, the meditator clearly perceives how pleasant, unpleasant 
        and neutral feelings with respect to sense objects vanish immediately 
        after they have arisen, and he realizes with personal knowledge that all 
        feelings are of an impermanent nature.</p>
        <p>In answer to the question, &quot;Is feeling permanent or 
        impermanent?&quot; the Group of Five monks, having reached the stage of 
        Stream Entry through this kind of contemplation, replied from their own 
        personal experience, &quot;Not permanent, Lord.&quot;</p>
        <p>Is unbearable pain in the body permanent or impermanent? It is not 
        permanent because the pain was not here before, it arose at a certain 
        moment. While noting the pain as &quot;pain, pain,&quot; it vanishes. 
        For the meditator whose concentration is getting quite strong, each 
        sensation of pain disappears with each noting. As one sensation 
        disappears, a fresh one arises, only to vanish instantly.</p>
        <p>When concentration is very good, good feelings may be observed 
        appearing in the body. When these feelings are noted they quickly 
        disappear. Disappearing thus, are these good feelings permanent or 
        impermanent?</p>
        <p>Sometimes unhappiness or worry arise; when these are noted as 
        &quot;unhappiness,&quot; or as &quot;worry,&quot; they disappear, so 
        they are impermanent.</p>
        <p>On seeing a pleasant sight, an agreeable feeling arises; this also 
        disappears when noted. Is it permanent or impermanent? In a similar 
        manner, an unpleasant sight causes a disagreeable feeling which 
        disappears when noted. Pleasant or unpleasant feelings which arise from 
        hearing, smelling or tasting also disappear when noted.</p>
        <p>When noting something not particularly pleasant or unpleasant, 
        neutral objects of contemplation such as the rising and falling of the 
        abdomen, the feeling observed is a neutral one, and it also disappears 
        with every noting. Is that permanent or impermanent?</p>
        <p>All three feelings, pleasant, unpleasant and neutral, are 
        impermanent. When these three kinds of feelings are perceived to be 
        impermanent, it is realized too that they are suffering, not self, just 
        phenomena. The Blessed One continued to question: &quot;That which is 
        impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?&quot; &quot;Suffering, 
        Lord.&quot;</p>
        <p>We have dealt considerably with this before, so it needs little 
        elaboration. People like pleasant sensations, they see them as enduring, 
        everlasting. When they see sensations dissolving every moment, not even 
        lasting for a tenth of a second, they lose their passion for them. Just 
        for the sake of enjoying this so-called happiness, they have to go in 
        pursuit of it, not for one hour, not for one day, not for one year, but 
        their whole lives. While in pursuit of this happiness, they meet their 
        death. There is nothing one can rely upon. Even if the happiness one is 
        seeking is not obtained, one has to find means of avoiding unhappiness 
        or unpleasantness, of maintaining oneself in a neutral condition. Even 
        as the neutral feeling of neither happiness nor unhappiness is being 
        sought, physical pain and mental anguish may arise. And they appear 
        because happy feelings and neutral feelings are not permanent. Thus, 
        impermanent happy feelings and neutral feelings are also not dependable. 
        To go after them is suffering; when they disappear it is suffering too, 
        because unhappy feeling comes in to take their place, especially after 
        the disappearance of a happy feeling, when one may be plunged into the 
        depths of despair. Take, for instance, the plight of parents who have 
        been given delight and happiness by the presence of their children, when 
        suddenly deprived of them through death; or of a united, happy family 
        when suddenly bereft of dear ones through death or separation; or of 
        someone who has been happy with his wealth and affluence, and is 
        suddenly deprived of them. They are all subjected to intense 
        unhappiness, which may even cost them their lives. Thus, feeling is 
        terrifying because of its impermanent nature.</p>
        <p>Coming to the next paragraph of the Pāli text:</p>
        <p>&quot;That which is impermanent, suffering and subject to change, is 
        it proper to regard it as 'This is mine, this I am, this is my 
        self'?&quot; &quot;It is not, Lord.&quot;</p>
        <p>This is the same type of question and answer employed when explaining 
        form. The difference is that in the case of form, the term involves not 
        only the material qualities inside one's body, but also all external 
        objects, animate and inanimate. As to feelings, it is chiefly the 
        internal ones which are grasped as one's own. In feelings of happiness, 
        one takes delight in announcing, &quot;this is mine.&quot; Neutral 
        feelings, being devoid of unpleasantness, have the nature of happiness: 
        although attachment to them is not so strong, there is still some 
        delight in the very fact that they are neither pleasant nor unpleasant. 
        Unpleasant feelings are no doubt undesirable, but thinking &quot;it is I 
        who is suffering,&quot; is still grasping them as self.</p>
        <p>Attachment to feelings in this way is brought about by ignorance of 
        the real nature of impermanence, suffering and subjection to change. The 
        meditator who is taking note of feelings as they occur knows at once 
        their oppressive nature. Is there any difference between the meditator 
        and the ordinary person with regard to their awareness of feelings? 
        There is indeed a great difference: the ordinary person perceives 
        feeling in terms of self -- &quot;I suffer; I feel happy; I feel pain 
        while delighting in happiness; if this pain goes away, I will feel 
        happy&quot;-- whereas the meditator knows from the very outset that 
        there is just continuous arising and perishing of the aggregates. When 
        unhappy feeling appears, the meditator perceives it as an undesirable 
        intrusion occurring in the continuous process of mental and physical 
        properties. He perceives it as another process of arising and perishing 
        superimposed on the one he has been observing. From its very first 
        appearance, the meditator recognizes its oppressive nature, just like a 
        thorn which has become embedded in the flesh.</p>
        <p>A happy feeling appears to be pleasant and good while it is 
        happening, but the effort that has to be made in search of or for 
        maintaining it is itself suffering. If an unwholesome <i>(akusala)</i> 
        act is performed in pursuit of pleasurable feeling, suffering has to be 
        faced in the woeful state to which one will accordingly be doomed. 
        Delight in pleasurable sensations keeps renewing the cycle of 
        existences, resulting in the suffering of old age and death. When happy 
        feeling disappears, the attachment to it gives rise to intense 
        unhappiness. Therefore, happy feeling is to be regarded as suffering.</p>
        <p>The <i>Daṭṭhabba Sutta</i> of the <i>Saṁyutta Nikāya</i> 
        describes how these feelings should be noted and regarded:</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>SEEING FEELINGS AS THEY REALLY ARE</b></font></p>
        <b><i>
        <p>Yo sukhaṁ dukkhato adda, dukkha madakkhi sallato,<br>
        Adukkhamasukhaṁ santaṁ, addakkhiṇaṁ aniccato,<br>
        Suve sammaddaso bhikkhu, parijānāti vedanā</i>.</p>
        </b><i>
        <p>&quot;A monk sees the happy feeling as suffering, the unhappy feeling 
        as a thorn and the neutral feeling as suffering too, because of their 
        impermanence.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;That monk has seen the feelings rightly and well (so as not to 
        give rise to notions of permanence, happiness and self) and 
        comprehensively.&quot;</p>
        </i>
        <p>The meditator who is constantly noting sees unpleasant feelings as an 
        oppression, like a thorn. Pleasant feelings are seen as frightful, due 
        to the trouble of having to pursue them and the pain caused when they 
        are lost. Neutral feelings are seen as suffering because of their 
        impermanence and the effort required to maintain them. Thus when asked 
        whether it is proper to regard feeling as &quot;This is mine, this I am, 
        this is my self,&quot; the Group of Five replied, &quot;Not indeed, 
        Lord.&quot;</p>
        <p>The Blessed One taught that feeling is not to be viewed as 
        &quot;mine&quot;, &quot;me&quot;,<b> </b>&quot;my self.&quot; For the 
        Group of Five, who were already Stream Enterers, this teaching was for 
        countering the perception of feeling as permanent, as &quot;mine, 
        me,&quot; and its subsequent craving and conceit. For the ordinary 
        worldling, the teaching counters the wrong view &quot;this is my 
        self.&quot;</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>IMPERMANENCE OF PERCEPTION</b></font></p>
        <b><i>

        </i></b><i>
        <p>&quot;Is saññā, perception, permanent or impermanent,&quot; asked 
        the Blessed One.<br>
        &quot;Impermanent, Lord.&quot;</p>
        </i>
        <p>It is perception which remembers objects previously seen. Perception 
        is an essential factor in learning and remembering. A good <i>saññā</i> 
        will long remember something seen or heard only once. This retentiveness 
        is wrongly taken to be everlasting, to be good, to be self.</p>
        <p>But once <i>saññā</i> has recognized an object it vanishes. What 
        are recognized later are the functions of later <i>saññā</i>. The 
        same applies to hearing. What is heard and remembered first vanishes, 
        followed by what is heard and recognized later. The meditator who is 
        taking note of everything seen or heard perceives that the two processes 
        of seeing and recognizing, or hearing and recognizing, vanish together. 
        Knowing this, the meditator concludes that <i>saññā</i> is also 
        impermanent. Knowing this, the Group of Five, when asked whether <i>saññā</i> 
        is permanent or impermanent, replied &quot;Impermanent, Lord,&quot; 
        because they found the words of the Blessed One quickly vanishing even 
        while hearing and recognizing them.</p>
        <p>&quot;Furthermore, that which is impermanent, is it suffering or 
        happiness?&quot; &quot;Suffering, Lord.&quot; &quot;Satisfactory or 
        unsatisfactory?&quot; &quot;Unsatisfactory, Lord.&quot; &quot;Now, that 
        which is impermanent, unsatisfactory, subject to change, is it proper to 
        regard it as ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self'?&quot; 
        &quot;Not proper, Lord.&quot;</p>
        <p>These are the same questions and answers we have discussed before. It 
        is necessary to know only how <i>saññā</i> is attached to with 
        craving, conceit and wrong view. Generally, people who cannot 
        contemplate corporeal and mental phenomena are pleased with <i>saññā</i>, 
        clinging to it (with craving) as &quot;this is mine&quot;. One thinks 
        one's retentive memory is better than others and is proud of it: this is 
        clinging by conceit. One thinks also that every act of seeing and 
        hearing is recognized and remembered by one, which is clinging through 
        the view, &quot;this is my self.&quot;</p>
        <p>Actually, the <i>saññā </i>of visible objects is imperma-nent, it 
        arises and instantly vanishes. The ever-watchful meditator knows <i>saññā 
        </i>to be impermanent because he sees it arising and instantly 
        vanishing; he knows it to be suffering because of its impermanence. <i>Saññā</i> 
        may retain memories of terrible things and be oppressive. It does not 
        stay in one form but keeps on changing. <i>Saññā</i> is not worth 
        craving as something pleasant, nor taking pride in as everlasting, nor 
        believing to be a living entity. Therefore the Group of Five replied 
        that it was not proper to regard <i>saññā</i> as &quot;mine, me, my 
        self.&quot;</p>
        <p>The Blessed One asked these questions so as to counter clinging<b> </b>with 
        craving and conceit in the minds of the Group of Five to the 
        impermanent, suffering, changing <i>saññā</i> as &quot;This is mine, 
        this I am&quot;, and, for the common worldling, to uproot the wrong view 
        of self.</p>

        <p>&quot;Are saṅkhārā, volitional formations, permanent or 
        impermanent?&quot; asked the Blessed One. &quot;Not permanent, 
        Lord.&quot;</p>
        <p>Saṅkhārā</i> are the volitional motivations responsible for 
        physical, vocal and mental actions. In the abstract sense, they are the 
        fifty kinds of mental concomitants headed by <i>cetanā</i>, volition, 
        which we have already talked about. They cover an extensive field. The 
        motivating power behind all physical actions, such as going, standing, 
        sitting, lying, bending, stretching, and moving, is <i>saṅkhāra;</i> 
        vocal actions are also caused by the same <i>saṅkhāra</i> agents. My 
        talking now is urged on by <i>saṅkhāra</i>. In talking and reciting, 
        every word uttered has been primed by <i>saṅkhāra</i>. It is <i>saṅkhāra</i>, 
        too, which are at the back of all thoughts and mental proliferation.</p>
        <p>Ordinary people think all these actions (physical, vocal and mental) 
        are being done by &quot;me, my self&quot; and this self, the doer, is 
        permanent. But the meditator who is ever watchful of the rising and 
        falling of the abdomen takes note of any activity of the mind as soon as 
        it occurs. <i>Cetanā</i>, volition, accompanied by greed <i>(lobha) </i>is 
        perceived by the meditator to be arousing desire and urging one to go 
        after that which is wanted. The meditator notes these mental activities 
        as &quot;liking,&quot; &quot;wanting&quot;. When associated with 
        aversion, volition appears as anger or rage that has to be noted as 
        &quot;anger&quot;, &quot;rage&quot;. When headed by delusion, wrong 
        actions are thought about; these thoughts have to be noted. When 
        associated with conceit, volition bloats one with ego and one has to get 
        rid of it by noting, &quot;conceit, conceit&quot;. When accompanied by 
        envy, jealousy, or avarice, volition manifests as envy and avarice, and 
        it should be noted as such.</p>
        <p>When volition appears associated with faith and confidence, devotion 
        and piety develop towards the <i>Buddha,</i> the <i>Dhamma</i> and the <i>Saṅgha,</i> 
        urging one to give homage and respect to them. These thoughts are noted 
        as they arise as faith, devotion and piety. <i>Akusala</i> leads to 
        unwholesome results, but volition may interrupt an unwholesome train of 
        thought, discouraging one from that thought, hindering it. <i>Kusala</i> 
        leads to wholesome results; volition may arouse one to follow it. 
        Volition may manifest in any number of ways, and should be noted 
        accordingly. It may appear accompanied by mindfulness, heedful of the 
        fact that at such and such a time, such a wholesome act will be done. It 
        may arise in various ways, and the mental attitudes of those moments 
        should also be noted. When <i>mettā</i>, loving-kindness, arises with 
        volition, there is a feeling of benevolence to others, thoughts of 
        making others happy. With compassion, volition arises accompanied by 
        pity for others and thoughts of how to help them out of suffering. All 
        these mental attitudes should be carefully noted.</p>
        <p>While noting the rise and fall of the abdomen, if feelings of 
        stiffness or heat appear they should be noted. As these are being noted, 
        the thought or urge to bend, to stretch and change postures may appear. 
        These, too, have to be noted. Then there is the urge to lower or raise 
        the head, to move forward or backward, to get up and walk. These are 
        physical activities conditioned and willed by volition, and they are all 
        to be noted.</p>
        <p>Then there is volitional urging concerning vocal activities, urging 
        and directing what to say and how to say it, just as I am now talking. 
        The meditator who keeps constant track of all these volitional 
        activities knows from personal experience that they appear and vanish 
        instantly and are, therefore, impermanent.</p>
        <p>And the Group of Five had become Stream Enterers through their own 
        knowledge of the nature of impermanence.</p>
        <p>While listening to the <i>Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta</i>, they saw again 
        the nature of impermanence, by perceiving the constant arising and 
        falling of the <i>saṅkhāra</i>, such as <i>phassa </i>(sense 
        contact), <i>cetanā</i> (intention), <i>manasikāra</i> (attention), <i>saddhā</i> 
        (faith), and <i>sati</i> (mindfulness). Thus, to the question, &quot;Are 
        volitional formations permanent or impermanent?&quot; they replied, 
        &quot;Not permanent, Lord.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Furthermore, that which is impermanent, is it suffering or 
        happiness?&quot; ... &quot;Suffering, Lord.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;That which is impermanent, suffering and subject to change ... 
        Is it fitting to regard that as ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my 
        self'?&quot; &quot;It is not proper, Lord.&quot;</p>
        <p>These are the same types of questions and answers as dealt with 
        before. We have only to know here how <i>saṅkhārā</i> could be clung 
        to with craving, conceit and wrong view, and how to become free of these 
        kinds of clinging.</p>
        <p>Ordinary people who cannot take note of corporeal and mental 
        phenomena as they occur believe that volitional activities are good and 
        take delight in them. This is clinging with craving. To think that these 
        activities are one's to perform, that one can perform better than 
        others, is clinging with conceit. Thinking that activities such as 
        going, stopping, sitting, bending, stretching, and moving are being done 
        by a self – &quot;I do, it is I who does the action; I talk, it is I 
        who talks; I think, it is I who thinks; I see, hear, look, listen, it is 
        I who sees, hears, looks, and listens&quot; is clinging with wrong view. 
        As the clinging is in the person of the doer, it is known as <i>kāraka 
        attā</i> clinging, the belief that all actions, physical, vocal and 
        mental, are being done by self. Believing that this self resides 
        permanently in one's person is <i>nivāsī attā</i> clinging. Believing 
        that this self which resides permanently in one's person goes when it 
        wants, stands, sits, bends, stretches, talks, and thinks when it wants, 
        when it wills, and is subject to one's control is <i>sāmi attā </i>clinging.</p>
        <p>The meditator who is ever on the watch of physical and mental 
        phenomena perceives that every activity that arises, such as desire to 
        think, to see, to hear, to bend, to stretch, to change position, to 
        rise, to go, or to talk, vanishes immediately after it is noted. 
        Therefore, all these activities, incessantly arising and vanishing, are 
        impermanent. Consequently, they are not delightful or dependable, but 
        suffering; thus it is concluded through personal knowledge that there is 
        nothing to cling to as &quot;this is mine,&quot; to take pride in as 
        &quot;this I am,&quot; or to believe that &quot;this is my self.&quot; 
        The Group of Five had realized in this manner and become Stream 
        Enterers. While listening to this discourse too<b>,</b> they perceived 
        the volitional activities arising and ceasing. Therefore they replied to 
        the Blessed One that it was not proper to regard that which is 
        impermanent, suffering and subject to change as &quot;mine, me, my 
        self.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Is mind, consciousness, permanent or impermanent?&quot; asked 
        the Blessed One. The monks answered, &quot;Impermanent, Lord.&quot;</p>
        <p>Viññāṇa</i> is mind or consciousness; the term 
        &quot;consciousness&quot; is not as commonly used as the word 
        &quot;mind.&quot; Even mental concomitants such as volition, greed and 
        aversion are talked about as mind, because mind plays a leading role. We 
        shall also generally use the word &quot;mind&quot; instead of 
        &quot;consciousness&quot; in this chapter.</p>
        <p>Those who cannot watch and note the mind as it is arising imagine 
        that it is continuous, permanent; that it is the one mind that is 
        conscious of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and thinking, the one 
        mind that sees in a sustained manner, and that hears and smells in a 
        sustained manner, the one mind that was in existence when young, is 
        existing now and will continue to exist till death; that it is the one 
        mind that has been functioning throughout the whole of our existence. 
        Some even believe that it will be the same mind that will move on to 
        future existences. This is how mind is regarded to be permanent and 
        everlasting.</p>
        <p>When the meditator who is noting the rise and fall of the abdomen, 
        ever watchful of corporeal and mental phenomena, notices the arising of 
        an idea or a thought, he at once notes it as &quot;idea,&quot; 
        &quot;thought.&quot; When noted thus, the idea or thought vanishes. Thus 
        the meditator realizes: &quot;The thought was not in existence before; 
        it appeared just now and disappeared at once. I have previously imagined 
        thought to be permanent because I have not carefully observed it. Now 
        that I have watched it, and seen it disappearing, I know it truly as it 
        is, impermanent.&quot;</p>
        <p>When hearing too, if noted &quot;hearing, hearing,&quot; the mind 
        keeps on arising, vanishing, arising, vanishing, instantaneously. The 
        same applies to consciousnesses of smelling and tasting. Consciousness 
        of touch is noted to be arising and vanishing quickly, here and there, 
        all over the body. When concentration is very strong, the act of seeing 
        is observed to be arising and disappearing in a series of separate but 
        continuous events, one after another. Thus it is realized that 
        consciousnesses of thinking, hearing, touching, seeing and so on arise 
        separately and disappear one by one, all impermanent, unstable.</p>
        <p>The minds that want to change posture, to bend, get up or walk, renew 
        themselves afresh and dissolve instantly. The mind that takes note of 
        each phenomenon also vanishes with each noting. Thus the mind which is 
        conscious of various kinds of objects is incessantly arising and 
        vanishing and is therefore impermanent. The Group of Five had realized 
        the same thing when they became Stream Enterers. While listening to this 
        discourse on the <i>Anattatakkhaṇa Sutta</i>, they saw again the 
        nature of impermanence by perceiving the constant arising and vanishing 
        of consciousnesses. Therefore, to the Blessed One's question, &quot;Is 
        consciousness permanent or impermanent&quot;, they replied, &quot;Not 
        permanent, Lord.&quot; To the watchful meditator, this is of course very 
        clear.</p>
        <p>&quot;Furthermore; that which is impermanent, is it <i>dukkha</i> or <i>sukha 
        </i>?&quot; asked the Blessed One. &quot;<i>Dukkha, </i>Lord.&quot; 
        &quot;That which is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, is it 
        fitting to regard it as ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my 
        self'?&quot; &quot;Not fitting, Lord.&quot;</p>
        <p>These are the same questions and answers dealt with before. We have 
        only to know how thinking, knowing mind may be wrongly clung to with 
        craving, conceit and wrong view and how to become free from these kinds 
        of clinging.</p>
        <p>Ordinary people who cannot take note of the mind as it appears at the 
        six sense doors take delight in sense awareness as &quot;mine, me.&quot; 
        They are pleased with the mind which is manifesting at the present 
        moment; they are delighted with the mind which had arisen before and 
        they wish to enjoy such delightful mind in the future. This is clinging 
        with craving. As he notes, the meditator perceives that all 
        consciousnesses with respect to pleasant sights or sounds disappear even 
        as he is taking note of them. Thus he does not delight in them or yearn 
        for them. This is how one keeps free of clinging with craving.</p>
        <p>Ordinary people who cannot take note of the mind cannot distinguish 
        the preceding mind from the following one. They think the mind of their 
        younger days persists as one continuous, permanent mind. The mind that 
        was there before keeps on seeing, hearing, touching, and thinking. 
        Believing it to be permanent and having special qualities, conceit is 
        developed, &quot;I know in this way, I won't stand any nonsense, I have 
        a courageous mind.&quot; This is clinging with conceit. But the 
        ever-watchful meditator knows that all these moments of consciousnesses 
        are always disappearing as they are being noted. He knows their 
        impermanent nature. Just as no conceit arises in a person who knows he 
        is about to die, no conceit is developed by the meditator with regard to 
        his mind. This is how to become free from clinging with conceit. 
        Ordinary people believe &quot;It is I who sees, hears, smells, touches 
        and thinks; I can know various kinds of objects; I want to bend, 
        stretch, go, talk; all the thoughts and actions are undertaken by my 
        mind, by my self.&quot; This is <i>kāraka attā</i> clinging.</p>
        <p>Clinging in the form of volitional activities may be classed under <i>saṅkhāra</i>, 
        but is also concerned with mind <i>(viññāṇa)</i>. Generally, desire 
        to bend, stretch or do something is classed under mind or consciousness. 
        &quot;This mind or consciousness as self exists permanently in one's 
        person; it is this self which becomes conscious of seeing and 
        hearing.&quot; Believing in this manner is <i>nivāsī attā </i>clinging.</p>
        <p>Some modern religions talk about a consciousness or soul permanently 
        residing in one's body. According to them, when a person dies, the soul 
        leaves the dead body and goes to reside in a new one. At the time of the 
        Buddha, the monk Sāti took consciousness to be self. His story has been 
        told in Chapter Four. This is the wrong view of conscious-ness as self.</p>
        <p>Then there is the belief that one can think if one wishes or control 
        one's mind as one wills. This is <i>sāmi attā</i> clinging.</p>
        <p>For the meditator engaged in constant noting, even while noting, 
        &quot;thinking, thinking,&quot; the thinking mind disappears; noting 
        &quot;hearing, hearing,&quot; the consciousness of hearing disappears; 
        noting &quot;touching, touching,&quot; the consciousness of touching 
        disappears; noting &quot;seeing, seeing&quot; the consciousness of 
        seeing disappears. Thus perceiving the disappearance of consciousness 
        even while noting, realization comes that &quot;these various 
        conscious-nesses concerning thinking, hearing, touching, seeing, noting 
        and so on are mere phenomena which arise conditioned by their own causes 
        and then dissolve. They are not self, not a living entity.&quot;</p>
        <p>Realization comes in this way: in accordance with <i>cakkhuṁ ca paṭicca 
        rūpa ca uppajjati viññāṇaṁ</i> -- eye consciousness arises 
        dependent on eye and visible forms; ear consciousness arises dependent 
        on ear and sound; tactile consciousness arises dependent on the body and 
        tactile object; mental consciousness arises dependent on the heart base <i>(bhavaṅga</i> 
        and thinking) and mental object -- the consciousness of noting arises 
        dependent on the intention (to note) and the object noted. The various 
        kinds of consciousness arise because of their own causes and conditions. 
        With these conditioning causes they come into being and pass away, 
        whether we wish it to happen or not. In the absence of these 
        conditioning causes, no amount of wishing will produce them. We wish the 
        pleasant mind to endure, but it does not last, it quickly passes away.</p>
        <p>Thus the meditator can decide with his own personal knowledge that 
        &quot;consciousness is not a self which engages in activities, which is 
        permanent and subject to one's will.&quot; It comes into being in 
        accordance with conditioning causes and vanishes, a mere phenomenon. The 
        Group of Five monks' knowledge of these phenomena was not ordinary 
        knowledge; it was the insight resulting from attainment of Stream Entry, 
        entirely free from clinging. Thus, when the Blessed One asked, 
        &quot;That consciousness which is imper-manent, suffering and subject to 
        change, is it proper to regard it as ‘This is mine, this I am, this is 
        my self'?&quot; they replied, &quot;Not proper, Lord.&quot;</p>
        <p>We have fully explained the questions in the teaching dealing with 
        clinging through craving, conceit and wrong view concerning the five 
        aggregates of form, feeling, perception, volitional formations and 
        conscious-ness. Now we shall go on to how to contemplate to get clear of 
        these three types of clinging.</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>ELEVENFOLD ANALYSIS OF FORM</b></font></p>

        </i></b><i>
        <p>&quot;Monks, since it is not fitting to think of form as ‘This is 
        mine, this is I am, this is myself,' all kinds of material form, whether 
        past, future or present, internal or external, coarse or fine, whether 
        inferior or superior, far or near, should be regarded with right 
        understanding, according to reality, thus, ‘This is not mine, this I 
        am not, this is not my self.'</p>
        </i>
        <p>In the above statement, material form is described in eleven ways: as 
        past, future, present, internal, external, coarse, fine, inferior, 
        superior, far and near. With respect to time, form is described in terms 
        of past, future or present. &quot;The past&quot; refers to what has 
        arisen and ceased either in previous existences or previously in the 
        present existence. By &quot;future&quot; is meant that which has not yet 
        happened, which is going to happen at some time in the future. The 
        present means what is actually happening now. Sequentially, it covers 
        what happened before, what is happening now and what will happen in the 
        future. Thus, when form is enumerated in these three ways respective of 
        time, all the material form in oneself and in others, both animate and 
        inanimate, are covered.</p>
        <p>But for the purpose of <i>vipassanā</i> meditation, disciples are 
        mainly concerned with contemplating what is happening in the body, as 
        clearly stated in the Commentary and Sub-Commentary of the <i>Anupada 
        Sutta</i> in the <i>Majjhima Nikāya</i>. Phenomena happening elsewhere 
        need be known only conjecturally. Thus the meditator needs only to 
        understand the corporeal and mental phenomena happening inside his own 
        body and see their true nature with his own (insight) knowledge.</p>
        <p>Even in connection with the phenomena happening inside oneself, one 
        can only understand things in the future by inference, because they have 
        not yet occurred. What has occurred before cannot be known as it really 
        is, other than through guess work. Even with those phenomena that occur 
        during one's life time, it is not easy to see what really happened some 
        years ago, some months past or even some days previously. It is hard 
        even to know the absolute truth of what happened a few hours ago 
        because, for ordinary people, once an object is seen, heard or touched, 
        it is immediately attached to in terms of conventional concepts as 
        &quot;I&quot; &quot;he,&quot; &quot;a woman&quot; or &quot;a man.&quot;</p>
        <p>As stated in the <i>Bhaddekaratta Sutta, &quot;Paccup-pannañca yo 
        dhammaṁ, tattha tattha vipassati: </i>Only the present should be 
        contemplated in <i>vipassanā</i> meditation, that is, as phenomena are 
        being seen and experienced.&quot; In the <i>Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta</i>, 
        too, it is stated that the present phenomenon occurring while walking, 
        standing, sitting, and lying, should be noted initially. I have 
        carefully analyzed this paragraph because it mentions &quot;past, 
        present, future,&quot; and doubt may arise whether one should start 
        meditating about what had happened in the past. This analysis should 
        remove such doubts.</p>
        <p>Only those mental and physical phenomena which manifest at the six 
        doors at the time an object is seen, heard, tasted, smelt, touched or 
        thought should be noted, just as our meditators are now taking note of 
        the phenomena of rising, falling, sitting, touching and so on. In this 
        way, as the concentration is strengthened, the meditator comes to 
        differentiate between the rising and the noting of it; the falling and 
        the noting of it. The extension, pressure and motion of the moment of 
        rising do not last till the moment of falling; they disappear at the 
        moments of their respective occurrence. The distension and motion at the 
        moment of falling do not last till the next moment of rising; they 
        disappear and cease then and there.</p>
        <p>While walking too, the extension and motion involved in the 
        &quot;right step&quot; do not stay on till the &quot;left step&quot;; 
        similarly the material properties of the &quot;left step&quot; are not 
        retained till the &quot;right step.&quot; They vanish at the moment of 
        their appearance.</p>
        <p>The material properties of the &quot;raising&quot; moment do not last 
        till the moment of &quot;stepping out&quot;; those of the 
        &quot;stepping&quot; moment do not stay on till the moment of 
        &quot;dropping down&quot;; they all vanish at their respective moments 
        of arising.</p>
        <p>Similarly in bending and stretching, each phenomenon disappears at 
        its respective moment of appearance. When the concentration gets 
        particularly strong, the meditator will observe, during the period of 
        one act of bending or stretching, the process of dissolution in very 
        quick serial succession happening in the same place without change of 
        position.</p>
        <p>The meditator realizes that the nature of these phenomena was not 
        known before because they were not heedfully noted. Now that he is 
        noting them, he perceives that the aggregates do not pass on from one 
        moment to another, they constantly perish at the very moment of their 
        appearance. Thus the material properties which had occurred before do 
        not last till the present moment; they have all perished. The material 
        properties which are manifesting now in rising, falling, bending, 
        stretching, stepping, dropping, moving will not reach a future moment, 
        they will vanish in the present. The material properties of coming 
        phenomena will also cease at their respective moments of arising.</p>
        <p>Therefore, all kinds of material properties are impermanent, 
        incessantly arising and disappearing. They constitute suffering, not 
        self, mere phenomena, because they are not amenable to one's control, 
        they arise and vanish in accordance with their own conditioning causes. 
        The meditator comes to realize them through his own knowledge.</p>
        <p>To enable such realization, the Blessed One exhorted that meditative 
        effort should be made until it is perceived that &quot;this is not 
        mine.&quot;</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>CONTEMPLATION ON NETAṀ MAMA AND ANICCĀ --

        <i>
        <p>Netaṁ mama </i>-- &quot;This is not mine&quot;-- According to this 
        teaching it may be asked whether contemplation means reciting this 
        formula. No recitation should be done. Meditation should be carried out 
        so as to know the true nature of things as impermanent, suffering and 
        not-self. To know the real nature of compounded things is to know the 
        meaning of the ancient Pāli idiom, <i>netaṁ mama</i>.</p>
        <p>In the <i>Channa Sutta</i> of the <i>Saḷāyatanavagga</i> of the <i>Saṁyutta 
        Nikāya</i>, there is a passage where Channa is asked &quot;Do you 
        perceive thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self'?&quot; and 
        Channa replies, &quot;I perceive thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am 
        not, this is not my self'.&quot; The Commentary explains that it means 
        that Channa perceived things as merely impermanent, suffering and 
        not-self.</p>
        <p>Here, seeing &quot;this is not mine&quot; is the same as perceiving 
        that, as things are incessantly arising and passing away, there is 
        nothing delightful or dependable, there is just suffering. Seeing 
        &quot;this I am not&quot; is the same as perceiving that it is not 
        permanent. Conceit arises because things are believed to be permanent. 
        When the truth of their impermanent nature is known, there is nothing to 
        take pride in. Seeing &quot;this is not my self' is seeing <i>anattā</i>. 
        Failing to take note of corporeal and mental phenomena as they arise at 
        the six doors and believing them to be permanent leads to the conceit 
        &quot;this I am.&quot; But when phenomena are perceived to not last even 
        the blink of an eye, when everything is seen as impermanent, conceit 
        cannot arise. As long as things are not known to be selfless, there is 
        clinging to self; when things are seen to be not-self, no self-clinging 
        is possible. This is obvious and needs no elaboration.</p>
        <p>Ordinary people who cannot observe sensory phenomena at the moment of 
        their arising believe that the material properties at the moment of 
        seeing linger on to become material properties at the moment of hearing, 
        or vice versa, lasting from one moment to the next. They believe also 
        that it is the same &quot;I&quot; who sees as that which hears and 
        touches. They believe too that the material properties of the past have 
        arrived at the present, and the present ones will go on to the future, 
        which is clinging to the belief in their permanence.</p>
        <p>But the meditator who is watchful of these phenomena knows that the 
        material properties at the moment of seeing perish then and there, they 
        do not reach the moment of hearing; the material properties at the 
        moment of hearing perish then and there, they do not reach the moment of 
        seeing. Every act of seeing, hearing, touching and knowing is a new 
        arising. This is knowing the truth of impermanence as it really is. 
        Knowing this, the meditator realizes that the material properties of the 
        past have ceased in the past, they have not come forward to the present; 
        the present material properties are always perishing even as they are 
        being noted, and will not reach the future. He knows also that material 
        properties of the future will also perish at the moment of arising. He 
        realizes that a material property does not endure even for the flick of 
        an eyelid. Realizing thus, there is no opportunity for the arising of 
        clinging through craving &quot;this is mine,&quot; clinging through 
        conceit, &quot;this I am,&quot; or clinging through wrong view as 
        &quot;this is my self.&quot; The Blessed One exhorted the Group of Five 
        to contemplate in this way so as to be rid of clinging by craving and 
        conceit. Ordinary worldlings are also instructed to contemplate so as to 
        be free of the clinging by wrong view.</p>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">STREAM ENTERERS - INSTRUCTED TO CONTEMPLATE 
        NOT-SELF</font></b></p>
        <p>Why was the Group of Five, who had already become Stream Enterers, 
        instructed to get rid of self-view with the reflection &quot;this<b> </b>is 
        not my self'? This is something to ponder upon.</p>
        <p>According to the <i>Visuddhimagga</i>, Stream Enterers are free from 
        the illusions of wrong view of self clinging <i>(diṭṭhi vipallāsa), 
        </i>illusions of perceptions <i>(saññā vipallāsa) </i>and illusion 
        of the mind <i>(citta</i> <i>vipallāsa). </i>Since the monks of the 
        Group of Five were free from all the three kinds of self clinging, on 
        account of what kind of clinging was this exhortation on nonself given?</p>
        <p>In the first part of this book, it was explained how this <i>Anattatakkhaṇa 
        Sutta</i> was taught to remove <i>asmi māna</i>, which is akin to self 
        clinging. But here, as separate instruction has been given to remove <i>asmi 
        māna</i> in the phrase <i>neso hamasmi</i>, &quot;this I am not,&quot; 
        the instruction to contemplate on <i>na</i> <i>meso attā</i>, 
        &quot;this is not my self,&quot; cannot be for removing <i>asmi māna</i>.</p>
        <p>Then to remove what kind of clinging is this teaching for? This is 
        the point to consider.</p>
        <p>It is not easy to find a definite and accurate solution to this 
        problem. We shall attempt to solve it in three ways:</p>
        <p>(1) In the <i>Sīlavanta Sutta</i>, it is mentioned that the <i>Arahats</i> 
        also meditate on the nature of not-self. Reference may be made to page 
        470 of my discourse on the <i>Sīlavanta Sutta </i>[Burmese edition]. 
        Although a Stream Enterer has no self clinging to be rid of, he 
        nevertheless contemplates on nonself just like the <i>Arahats</i> for 
        the attainment of higher knowledge. If this first answer is not 
        satisfactory, here is our second answer:</p>
        <p>(2) This is in accordance with what is provided on page 330 of my 
        discourse on the <i>Sīlavanta Sutta</i>. There is no doubt that the 
        Stream Enterer is free from the illusion of belief in the permanency of 
        self. As to the illusion of perception, it should be understood that a 
        Stream Enterer is free from it only when he is intentionally reflecting 
        on it or when engaged in contemplation on impermanence and not-self. 
        Only then may the Stream Enterer be said to be free from wrong 
        perceptions of permanence and self. To say that he was free from these 
        illusions on other occasions also, when no particular attention is being 
        paid to them, would be putting Stream Enterers on the same level as <i>Arahats</i>, 
        who know all acts of seeing and hearing as impermanent and have no 
        conceit or lustful desires regarding men or women.</p>
        <p>Therefore, at inattentive moments, a Stream Enterer can have wrong 
        perceptions or notions of things. To enable the Group of Five to get rid 
        of such wrong perceptions and notions, they were asked to contemplate on 
        not-self. (3) This is based on an explanation offered by the Venerable 
        Khemaka, who had already reached the stage of <i>anāgāmi</i>. Khemaka 
        said that he did not cling to material form as &quot;I am&quot; nor to 
        each of the other aggregates of feeling, perception, volitional 
        formations and conscious-ness, but with regard to the five aggregates as 
        a whole, he was still not free of the notion &quot;I am&quot;. Just as 
        in this explanation, for a Stream Enterer, there is no clinging as self 
        towards any of the aggregates of form, feeling, perception, volitional 
        formations or consciousness, but with regard to the five aggregates as a 
        whole, a Stream Enterer is not free from the perception of them as man 
        or woman. Not being free from this perception, the sensual passions can 
        still arise in him, even to the extent that he may settle down to 
        married life. Therefore it should be regarded that the monks of the 
        Group of Five were exhorted to contemplate on not-self so as to become 
        free from such ordinary perceptions and notions.</p>
        <p>This is an attempt to reconcile the text in the Pāli Canon with the 
        statement in the Commentary, which states that Stream Enterers are free 
        from perceptions of self or notions of self.</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>THE ELEVENFOLD CONTEMPLATION</b></font></p>
        <p>I shall now discuss how material form of the past, present and future 
        are contemplated as impermanent. We have already described how the 
        meditator, observing how the physical properties at the moment of rising 
        and falling perish as they come into being, comes to know the 
        characteristics of impermanence, suffering and not-self. The meditator 
        who knows thus can deduce from his own experience that forms of the past 
        have not reached the present and that presently occurring forms will not 
        reach the future; they perish at the moment of coming into<b> </b>existence 
        and are therefore impermanent. Consequently, they are suffering, not 
        self, mere phenomena. The reflection is as follows:</p>
        <p>1. Forms of the past have ceased to exist; they do not carry over to 
        the present. As they have ceased now, they are impermanent. Because they 
        disappear instantly, they are fearsome, a source of suffering. Not being 
        a controlling authority <i>(sāmi)</i>, a permanent entity <i>(nivāsī),</i> 
        a doer <i>(kāraka),</i> an experiencer of sensations <i>(vedaka),</i> 
        they are not self, without essence.</p>
        <p>2. The forms of the present will perish and cease now, they will not 
        reach the future. As they are ceasing and vanishing, they are 
        impermanent. Because they are constantly disappearing, they are 
        fearsome, a source of suffering. Not being a controlling authority, a 
        permanent entity, they are not self, without essence.</p>
        <p>3. The forms which will come into being in the future will cease to 
        exist then and there, they will not be carried over to any further 
        existence. As they are constantly passing away, they are fearsome, a 
        source of suffering. Being without essence, they are not self.</p>
        <p>This is how the true nature of forms is generally considered. During 
        the meditation, we reflect as follows:</p>
        <p>1. Past forms at the moment of last rising (of the abdomen) did not 
        reach the stage of falling; the past forms at the moment of falling did 
        not reach the stage of rising, they perished at the moment of their 
        rising and falling and are therefore impermanent. Because they are 
        impermanent, they are suffering; because they are unmanageable, they are 
        not self.</p>
        <p>The last material form at the time of last seeing and hearing did not 
        reach the present moment of seeing and hearing; it is therefore 
        impermanent, suffering, not self.</p>
        <p>2. Material form rising in the present moment does not reach the 
        stage of falling; the presently falling material form does not reach the 
        stage of rising. They perish even while rising and falling and are 
        therefore impermanent, suffering, not self.</p>
        <p>The material forms at the present moment of seeing and hearing do not 
        reach the next moment of seeing and hearing. They pass away even while 
        seeing and hearing. They are, therefore, impermanent, suffering, not 
        self.</p>
        <p>3. The material forms at the moment of future rising and falling will 
        not reach the next future moments of rising and falling. They will fade 
        away at the respective moments of coming into being. They are, 
        therefore, impermanent, suffering, not self.</p>
        <p>This is how the material forms of the past, present and future are 
        considered while taking note of the phenomena of rising and falling. 
        There is also a method of reflecting on the material forms of the past 
        and the future by contemplating the material forms of the present. We 
        shall recite this method of reflection.</p>
        <p>Just as there are impermanent material forms with respect to rising, 
        falling, bending, stretching, raising, stepping, dropping, seeing, and 
        hearing, which rise and fall and perish even while they are being noted, 
        so there have been similar material forms with respect to rising, 
        falling, bending and stretching in the past perishing at their 
        respective moments of coming into being. They are, therefore, 
        impermanent, suffering and not self.</p>
        <p>Having perceived by oneself how the material form in one's person 
        passes away, there remains the task of reflecting on the material forms 
        of other people, and the material forms of the whole world. Just as the 
        material forms in one's person perish while being noted, the material 
        forms in other people and in the whole world will also perish and are 
        therefore impermanent, suffering and not self.</p>
        <b>
        <p><font color="#000080">Contemplating internal and external material 
        form</font></p>
        </b>
        <p>People imagine that when they spit, defecate or excrete, the material 
        form from inside the body gets expelled or thrown outside the body. When 
        food is eaten or air is breathed in, the external material forms are 
        believed to have come into the body. Actually, it is not like this. 
        Material forms undergo dissolution at the moment and place of their 
        coming into being, and new material forms rise afresh at the new place. 
        The meditator who is taking note perceives such dissolution and 
        cessation taking place at each place of origination.</p>
        <p>And this is how it is perceived: when mindfulness and concentration 
        get strong, the out-breath (during noting the rise and fall) is seen to 
        break into small sections in the chest, throat and nose before it 
        finally makes the exit from the body. The in-breath is also seen to be 
        entering, pushing in, in a series of small sections. The meditator who 
        smokes knows the smoke going out and pushing its way in, in a series of 
        small portions. A similar phenomenon is seen while drinking water, as it 
        pushes its way down the throat. Therefore, internal material forms do 
        not get outside; external material forms do not get inside.</p>
        <p>They cease and vanish at the place where they come into being, and 
        are thus impermanent, suffering, and not self.</p>
        <b>
        <p><font color="#000080">Contemplation of coarse and fine material forms</font></p>
        </b>
        <p>Ordinarily people believe that it is the tender material forms of our 
        young days which have become the coarse, gross material forms of adults; 
        the healthy, light, fine material forms that become the unhealthy, 
        heavy, gross material forms; the unhealthy, heavy, gross material forms 
        that become healthy, light, fine, material forms. The meditator who is 
        constantly watching tactile bodies perceives these material forms 
        breaking up into tiny bits even while being observed. Thus perceiving, 
        he knows that gross material forms do not become fine material forms, 
        neither do fine material forms become gross material forms. The gross, 
        hot or cold material forms do not become fine, cold or hot material 
        forms; fine, cold or hot material forms do not become gross, hot or cold 
        material forms. Gross, stiff, extending, moving material forms do not 
        become fine, stable, still material forms. They all vanish at the moment 
        of arising; they are thus impermanent and void of self.</p>
        <b>
        <p><font color="#000080">Contemplating in terms of inferiority or 
        superiority</font></p>
        </b>
        <p>Ordinarily, it is believed that the unhealthy, inferior material 
        forms become the healthy, superior material forms; the youthful material 
        forms become the material forms of an old man. But the meditator who 
        keeps track of material forms at the moment of their arising perceives 
        that any material form that arises ceases and vanishes as it is being 
        noted and therefore knows that the inferior material form has not become 
        the superior material form, nor does the superior one become an inferior 
        one. Thus they all have the nature of being suffering and nonself.</p>
        <b>
        <p><font color="#000080">Contemplating in terms of far and near</font></p>
        </b>
        <p>To normal perception, it seems that when a man is seen coming from 
        afar, he brings with him the material form of that far distance. When a 
        man goes from a near to a far distance, he carries away the material 
        form of the near distance. But the meditator who is always noting 
        corporeal and mental phenomena knows when watching, for instance, the 
        phenomenon of stretching the body, that the material form that stretches 
        vanishes in a series of blurring fade-outs without reaching any 
        distance; when bending, the material form that bends fades away in a 
        series of blurring fade-outs without reaching any distance. Perceiving 
        thus, the medi-tator is convinced that the material form which is near 
        has not gone afar; the distant material form has not come near. They 
        vanish at the respective moments of becoming and are, therefore, 
        impermanent, suffering and not-self.</p>
        <p>While looking at a man approaching from a distance, and noting, 
        &quot;seeing, seeing,&quot; we see him disappearing section by section, 
        part by part in a series of quick blurring fade-outs. While looking at 
        someone leaving from nearby and noting &quot;seeing, seeing,&quot; the 
        man disappears section by section, part by part in a series of quick, 
        blurring fade-outs. Thus the material form from a distance has not come 
        near; the material form which is near has not gone to a distance. The 
        old material form keeps on vanishing and the new material form keeps on 
        arising, giving the appearance of someone coming from afar and someone 
        going away. Only the meditator who has reached the stage of <i>bhaṅga</i> 
        <i>ñāṇa</i> and whose discernment is sharp can perceive the 
        phenomena as they really are in this manner. Others with not so sharp 
        insight may not perceive so clearly.</p>
        <p>Again, while walking to and fro and noting raising, stepping and 
        dropping, raising appears separately as one stage, stepping separately 
        as one stage and dropping separately as another. When insight is well 
        developed, the movements of body and limbs are seen as series of 
        blurring fade outs. Perceiving thus, the conclusion is reached that 
        material forms do not reach from one place to another; they cease and 
        vanish at the place they come into being. This is knowing in accordance 
        with the statement of the Sub-Commentary, &quot;Absolute realities do 
        not move over to another place; they cease and vanish at the places they 
        come into existence.&quot; Therefore, material forms from afar do not 
        come near; material forms which are near do not go afar. They cease and 
        vanish at the place where they come into existence. They are, therefore, 
        impermanent, suffering and not self.</p>
        <p>This is how material forms described in eleven ways are contemplated 
        as &quot;this is not mine&quot; ... <i>netaṁ mama</i>.</p>
