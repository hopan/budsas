        <p><font size="6">P</font>erception is sixfold in kind: 1. Perception 
        born of eye-contact. 2. Perception born of ear-contact. 3. Perception 
        born of nose-contact. 4. Perception born of tongue-contact. 5. 
        Perception born of body-contact. 6. Perception born of mind-contact.</p>
        <p>Whenever an object is<b> </b>seen, heard, touched, or known, we 
        usually think, &quot;It is I who perceives; this object is perceived and 
        remembered by me.&quot; On seeing a sight, it is remembered as a man or 
        a woman, or as an object perceived at such and such a time<b> </b>at 
        such and such a place. The same applies to audible objects and other 
        forms of sensory awareness. This process of perception or memory is 
        wrongly held to be a personal feat: &quot;It is I who remembers, my 
        memory is excellent.&quot; The Blessed One explains here that this view 
        is wrong, that there is nothing individual or personal in the process of 
        remembering, just insubstantial phenomena; it is not self.</p>
        <p>Explaining how perception is not self, the Buddha continued:</p>
        <i>
        <p>&quot;Monks, perceptions, saññā, are not self. If perceptions were 
        self, then they would not tend to afflict or oppress, and one should be 
        able to control perceptions thus: 'Let my perceptions be thus (all 
        pleasant), let my perceptions be not thus (unpleasant)'.&quot;</p>
        </i>
        <p>Were perceptions a living entity, our inner substance, there would be 
        no reason for them to inflict and oppress us -- it is not normal for 
        beings to cause themselves harm and injury -- and it should be possible 
        to manage that only good things are perceived and remembered. But since 
        perception is oppressing and does not yield to one's wish, it is not 
        self.</p>
        <i>
        <p>&quot;But monks, in reality, perception is not self. It is 
        oppressing, and no one can wish for and manage thus: 'Let my perceptions 
        be thus, let my perceptions be not thus'.&quot;</p>
        </i>
        <p>Perception has its good aspects. Cognition of the characteristics of 
        objects is certainly very useful. So is retentive memory: remembering 
        facts and retaining what has been acquired from learning is a good 
        function of perception. However, recalling to mind what is sad, 
        sorrowful, disgusting, or horrible form bad aspects of perception, which 
        are stressful and therefore oppressing. Some people suffer from haunting 
        memories of departed loved ones, sons, daughters, husbands or wives, or 
        of financial calamities that have befallen them. These lingering 
        memories bring about constant sorrow and consternation; only when such 
        memories fade away is one relieved of the suffering.</p>
        <p>Thus <i>saññā</i>, perception, the function of recognition and 
        remembering, is truly oppressing. So long as perception is bringing back 
        memories of bereavement and financial loss, so long will sorrow and 
        lamentation cause intense suffering, even resulting in death. This is 
        how perception oppresses by recalling to mind sad past experiences.</p>
        <p>Suddenly recalling some repulsive object during meal time is bound to 
        impair one's appetite. The memory of a dead body seen earlier in the day 
        may disturb one's sleep at night. Some people fantasize about dangerous 
        situations and anticipate them with great anxiety. This is how 
        perception oppresses by bringing back distressing mental objects.</p>
        <p>It is not self because its appearance is dependent on conditions.</p>
        <p>Perception cannot be manipulated as we wish by recalling only those 
        experiences which are beneficial and profitable, and suppressing those 
        which will cause distress and suffering. It is unmanageable, 
        ungovernable, and thus not self, not a living entity, but simply 
        insubstantial phenomena dependent on causes and conditions.</p>
        <p>Perception in one's own person, as stated in the text, is oppressing, 
        unmanageable, not subject to one's will. It is obvious, therefore, that 
        perception is not one's self, one's inner core or a living entity. But 
        people in general find, on recalling past experiences, that there are 
        some which are retained in memory and conclude that &quot;It is I who 
        has stored these experiences in mind; it is I who recalls them. The same 
        &quot;I&quot; who has stored them up has also brought them back to mind 
        now.&quot; They cling to the belief, therefore, that there is one 
        individual, the self, who stores up and recalls past experiences. This 
        wrong belief arises because of lack of heedful noting at the moment of 
        sensory activity and because of the fact that the real nature of the 
        phenomena is not yet known by <i>vipassanā</i> insight.</p>
        <p>When constant arising and ceasing of the phenomena of sensory 
        awareness is seen as it truly is through <i>vipassanā</i> insight, 
        realization dawns that perception is also a natural phenomenon, 
        constantly arising and ceasing.</p>
        <p>Here it may be asked: in view of the impermanent nature of 
        perception, how does recollection take place? The retentive power of 
        preceding perceptions is passed on to succeeding perceptions. As this 
        retentive power increases on being inherited by the succeeding 
        generations of perception, some people become equipped with the faculty 
        of recalling past lives. This is how the perception in the 
        life-continuum or death-consciousness of the past life ceases but arises 
        again, with reinforced powers of recall, as the birth consciousness and 
        life-continuum of the present life.</p>
        <p>It is because of this handing over of &quot;retentive power&quot; by 
        the previous perception to the succeeding one that we can recollect both 
        what is wholesome and pleasant as well as that which is unwholesome and 
        unpleasant. Without even thinking about them, the experiences of days 
        gone by may sometimes resurface. As his concentration gets stronger, a 
        meditator engaged in <i>Satipaṭṭhānā</i> medita-tion may find 
        memories of episodes from early childhood arising. The meditator should 
        dispose of them by noting them as they appear. Remorse over past 
        mistakes and faults may lead to worry and restlessness in the course of 
        meditation, and these may become a great hindrance to progress in the 
        development of concentration and <i>vipassanā </i>insight. They should 
        be discarded by taking note of them. Thus, perception which recalls past 
        incidents and produces worry and fret is oppressing. For this reason, 
        too, it may be taken that perception is not self.</p>
        <p>As explained in the previous discourse, there are four ways of 
        clinging to self, and perception is concerned with three of them: <i>sāmi 
        attā, nivāsī attā</i> and <i>kāraka attā</i>.</p>
        <p>Thinking that there is control over perception, remembering things as 
        willed and not remembering things when there is no wish to do so, is <i>sāmi 
        attā</i> clinging, that is, the belief that there is a self that 
        controls the process of remembering. This <i>sāmi attā</i> clinging is 
        rejected by the <i>Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta</i>, which states that it is 
        not possible to say of perception, &quot;Let perception be thus, let 
        perception be not thus.&quot;</p>
        <p>Thinking there is a continuous self ever present in the body, who 
        carries out the task of remembering things, is <i>nivāsī attā. </i>This 
        type of clinging can be discarded by taking note of every mental 
        phenomenon which arises. By doing so, one perceives personally that 
        memories keep appearing and instantly vanishing. Also, by taking note of 
        the past incidents in one's life as they reappear in the mind's door, 
        one comes to realize that there is no such thing as permanent, retentive 
        perception. There are only recurrent phenomena renewing themselves by 
        incessant arising and ceasing. This realization drives home the fact 
        that there is no permanent self or living entity residing in one's body 
        which does the task of remembering or recollecting.</p>
        <p>Thinking it is I or self which is doing the action of remembering or 
        recollecting is <i>kāraka attā</i> clinging, and this may also be 
        removed by meditative noting. When perception of sights or sounds takes 
        place, the meditator observes their arising and vanishing. Seeing that 
        perception of sight or sound is always arising and vanishing, there 
        comes the realization that perception is merely a recurrent mental 
        phenomenon and not the action of any abiding self or inner substance. 
        And in accordance with the <i>Anatta-lakkhaṇa Sutta</i>, it cannot be 
        managed in such a way that only pleasant, wholesome memories persist and 
        unpleasant, unwholesome memories fade away. Since it is thus 
        ungovernable and uncontrollable, realization comes to the meditator that 
        perception is not self or living entity, but merely a natural process 
        dependent on conditions, incessantly renewing itself and vanishing. The <i>Anatta-lakkhaṇa 
        Sutta</i> was taught by the Blessed One specifically for the purpose of 
        removing the <i>attā</i> clinging through such personal realization of 
        the true nature of the <i>khandhas.</p>
        </i>
        <p>Here the question may arise: what is the difference between the 
        mundane functions of perception, such as memory, and the recollective 
        powers of <i>sati, </i>or mindfulness, as described in the <i>Satipaṭṭhāna 
        Sutta?</i> There is a world of difference between the two; in fact it 
        may be said that they are diametrically opposed to each other in purpose 
        and objective. Perception perceives for retaining sense objects for 
        future recall; it may take in the form, shape or condition of the object 
        observed. Meditative note-taking according to the <i>Satipaṭṭhāna</i> 
        method is concerned just with the passing events of mental and corporeal 
        phenomena, so as to realize their impermanence, unsatis-factoriness and 
        insubstantiality.</p>

        <p>&quot;Monks, volitional formations </i>(saṅkhārā)<i> are not 
        self.&quot;</p>
        </i>
        <p>Here, it should be noted that <i>saṅkhāras</i> are of two kinds: 
        conditioned things and conditioning things. Conditioned things are those 
        aggregates that have arisen through such causes as <i>kamma</i> 
        (volitional activity), mind, climate (seasonal conditions) and 
        nutriments.</p>
        <p>Immediately after the rebirth consciousness, mental and corporeal 
        phenomena spring up<b> </b>as <i>kamma</i> resultants. <i>Vipāka</i> <i>(kamma</i> 
        resultant) types of consciousness and their concomitants and the 
        heart-base <i>(hadāya vatthu)</i> together with <i>kamma</i>-produced 
        physical properties such is eye, ear, nose, tongue and body, spring up 
        in this way. They are all conditioned things, resultant effects of <i>kammic</i> 
        activities, and they are called resultant <i>saṅkhāras</i> as 
        conditioned by <i>kamma.</p>
        </i>
        <p>Likewise, mind-produced physical properties, such as the movements of 
        bending, stretching, moving, going, standing, sitting, talking, and 
        smiling, are called<b> </b>resultant <i>saṅkhāras</i>. Because they 
        are born of thoughts, they are resultant <i>saṅkhāras</i> conditioned 
        by mind.</p>
        <p>Mind and its concomitants are mutually conditioned and conditioning. 
        We thus have <i>saṅkhāras</i> as causal agents as well as <i>saṅkhāras</i> 
        as resultants.</p>
        <p>Physical properties produced by climatic conditions are resultant <i>saṅkhāras</i> 
        conditioned by climatic conditions. Physical properties that arise 
        through intake of nutriment are resultant <i>saṅkhāras</i> 
        conditioned by nutriments.</p>
        <p>Finally, all succeeding mental states and all their concomitants are 
        resultant <i>saṅkhāras</i>, dependent on the preceding mental 
        conditions and their concomitants for their arising. All such aggregates 
        which arise because of <i>kamma</i>, mind, seasonal conditions and 
        nutriment are resultant <i>saṅkhāras</i>, conditioned things. This is 
        summarized in the famous formula:</p>
        <i>
        <p>Sabbe saṅkhāra anicca; Sabbe saṅkhāra dukkhā</p>
        </i>
        <p>All conditioned things are impermanent; all conditioned things are 
        suffering, <i>dukkha</i>.</p>
        <p>These are corporeal and mental aggregates which manifest during the 
        cognition of sense impressions, the five groups of grasping which must 
        be realized by <i>vipassanā</i> insight as impermanent, unsatisfactory 
        and insubstantial. In the above formula the Blessed One states that they 
        should be seen as such. In order to see them in such light, one must 
        take heedful note of every arising of these aggregates as they appear. 
        During this observation, as concentration gets strengthened, one becomes 
        aware that the aggregates are incessantly arising and vanishing. In 
        accordance with the Commentary statements, <i>hutvā abhāvato</i> -- 
        &quot;it is impermanent because having arisen it perishes&quot;-- and <i>udayabbaya</i> 
        <i>paṭipīḷanato -</i>- &quot;it is fearsome because it is oppressed 
        by constant arising and perishing.&quot; This is the contemplation that 
        conforms to the words of the Blessed One.</p>
        <p>There are people who are damaging the Buddha's Dispensation by 
        teaching in a way the exact opposite of what the Buddha taught. In the 
        above formula -- <i>sabbe</i> <i>saṅkhāra anicca</i> -- they teach <i>saṅkhāra</i> 
        to mean not &quot;conditioned things&quot; as explained above, but 
        &quot;activities.&quot; Thus, according to them, the above formula means 
        &quot;All activities are suffering.&quot; Hence they admonish against 
        any kind of activity, such as giving alms, keeping precepts and 
        practicing meditation. These activities, they say, will produce only <i>dukkha</i>. 
        They advise keeping the mind as it is. Such teachings are readily 
        accepted by uninstructed people who are not keen to put effort into 
        meditation practice, but it is obvious to anyone, even with a limited 
        knowledge of the teaching, that such teachings are against the words of 
        the Buddha. Accepting such teachings amounts to rejecting the teaching 
        of the Blessed One. Once the teaching is rejected, one will find oneself 
        outside the dispensation of the Buddha, which is a cause for some 
        concern.</p>
        <p>In the Pali text, <i>sabbe saṅkhāra dukkhā, saṅkhāra</i> means 
        &quot;conditioned things,&quot; resultants of determining conditions, 
        not &quot;conditioning things,&quot; &quot;activities&quot; or 
        &quot;efforts.&quot; All <i>saṅkhāras</i> as conditioned things are 
        to be contemplated as impermanent and suffering. It is wrong to 
        interpret <i>saṅkhāra</i> here as meritorious activities. What is 
        required is to carefully note and observe all the conditioned aggregates 
        in one's own body until their real nature is seen and dispassion 
        developed over them.</p>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">SANKHĀRA IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS SUTTA</font></b></p>
        <p>The <i>saṅkhāra</i> described so far, conditioned things produced 
        by <i>kamma</i>, mind, seasonal changes and nutriment, are not the <i>saṅkhāra</i> 
        referred to in this <i>Sutta</i>. In the context of this <i>Sutta, saṅkhāra</i> 
        refers to conditioning things, one of the five aggregates, namely, the 
        volitional formations or mental activities which produce <i>kamma.</p>
        </i>
        <p>The <i>Khandhavagga</i> of the <i>Saṁyutta Nikāya</i> gives the 
        following definition: that which brings about physical, vocal and mental 
        activities is <i>saṅkhāra</i> (of <i>saṅkhārak-khandha).</i> Of 
        the five aggregates, the aggregate of matter has the quality of being 
        changed or transformed by opposing circumstances. It cannot by itself 
        bring about any action or change, but it has substantive mass. The 
        movements of the volitional formations are expressed in the material 
        body, which then appears to be doing the action. The aggregate of 
        feelings <i>(vedanā)</i> experiences feelings, pleasant, unpleasant or 
        neutral. It cannot of itself produce any effective action. Neither can 
        the aggregate of perception, which merely recognizes or remembers 
        things, like a clerk in an office making a record for future reference. 
        The aggregate of consciousness just knows that a sight is seen, a sound 
        is heard, and so on. It is not capable of causing any action. It is the 
        aggregate of <i>saṅkhāra</i> which is responsible for physical, vocal 
        or mental actions, such as walking, standing, sitting, lying down, 
        bending, stretching, moving, smiling, talking, thinking, looking, or 
        listening. The wish to go, stand, sit or sleep is a function of <i>saṅkhāra</i>. 
        All three kinds of activities, physical, vocal, and mental, are 
        instigated and organized by <i>saṅkhāra.</p>
        </i>
        <p>To think that all these activities are carried out by one's self is 
        to hold the wrong view of self in the <i>saṅkhāra</i> and is known as 
        <i>kāraka attā</i> (agent self) clinging.</p>
        <p>To think that the self which performs all activities resides 
        permanently as a living entity in one's body is to cling to the wrong 
        view of <i>nivāsī attā</i> (continuous self).</p>
        <p>Thinking that this self, the living entity in one's body, can act 
        according to its wishes, that its actions are subject to one's will, is <i>sāmi 
        attā</i> (controlling self) clinging.</p>
        <p>Volitional formations are clung to by all three modes of clinging. In 
        reality, however, there is no self, no living entity to cling to, there 
        are merely natural processes faring according to their own conditions 
        and circumstances. The Blessed One taught that the functioning of <i>saṅkhāras</i> 
        is not the action of a living entity. From the viewpoint of the common 
        person, there seems to be a living entity that executes the actions of 
        going, standing, and sitting, but the Blessed One refuted this belief by 
        stating:</p>
        <i>
        <p>&quot;Monks, were volitional formations self, they would not inflict 
        suffering and it should be possible to say of them, 'Let volitional 
        activities be thus (all wholesome), let volitional activities be not 
        thus (unwholesome),' and manage them as one wishes.&quot;</p>
        <p>Saṅkhāras</i> are the mental states headed by <i>cetanā,</i> 
        volition. There are fifty-two kinds of mental states. With the exception 
        of feeling and perception, the remaining fifty constitute the aggregate 
        of volitional formations, <i>saṅkhārakkhandha</i>. In <i>Sutta</i> 
        discourses, only <i>cetanā</i>, volition, is specified as representing 
        the <i>saṅkhāra</i> activities, but according to the <i>Abhidhamma</i>, 
        we have other volitional formations that can produce <i>kamma</i>, such 
        as attention <i>(manasikāra</i>), initial application of thought <i>(vitakka),</i> 
        sustained application <i>(vicāra),</i> zest <i>(pīti),</i> greed <i>(lobha),</i> 
        hatred <i>(dosa),</i> delusion <i>(moha),</i> non-greed, non-hatred, and 
        non-delusion. These fifty kinds of volitional formations are responsible 
        for all kinds of activities, such as going, standing, sitting, sleeping, 
        bending, stretching, smiling, and speaking. These actions, as well as 
        mental activities such as thinking, visual-consciousness, and 
        auditory-conscious-ness, are carried out and directed by <i>saṅkhāra</i>.</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>HOW VOLITIONAL FORMATIONS OPPRESS</b></font></p>
        <p>The Blessed One urged us to reflect in this way: were volitional 
        formations self they would not oppress. Actually they do oppress in many 
        ways. When we do things out of desire or greed, we become exhausted and 
        distressed. When we say things which should not be said, we are 
        embarrassed. If we commit criminal offences, we get punished. We burn 
        ourselves with longing, losing our appetite and sleep. When we commit 
        evil deeds, such as stealing or telling lies, we land in woeful states 
        and undergo intense misery.</p>
        <p>Likewise, volition accompanied by hate motivates vocal and physical 
        actions which produce distress and suffering. Volition accompanied by 
        delusion, conceit and wrong views also leads to distress and suffering 
        in the present life and in the states of woe. These are the ways in 
        which volitional formations oppress. Were volitional formations self, 
        they would not be oppressive in this manner.</p>
        <p>Were volitional formations self it should be possible to arrange and 
        organize them in such a way that only wholesome activities bringing 
        beneficial results were carried out, not those which would cause harm. 
        Actually it is not possible to manage these activities as one wishes. We 
        may find ourselves involved in activities we should not do, saying 
        things we should not say, or thinking thoughts we should not think. In 
        this way it can be seen that volitional formations are not amenable to 
        control and are therefore not self. In order to see this clearly, the 
        Blessed One said:</p>
        <i>
        <p>&quot;Monks, in reality, volitional formations are not self, not 
        one's inner core. For this reason, they tend to inflict distress. 
        Furthermore, it is not possible to manage and say of volitional 
        formations: 'Let volitional formations be thus, let them not be 
        thus'.&quot;</p>
        </i>
        <p>Volitional formations are, therefore, not self, insubstantial, faring 
        in accordance with causes and conditions. Accordingly, they are 
        oppressing; how they are oppressing has been described above. Through 
        bad companions, through the defective guidance of poor teachers and 
        through wrong attitudes of mind, we do, say and think things we should 
        not do, say, or think about. In mundane affairs, we may get involved in 
        blameworthy, illegal activities and indulge in bad habits such as 
        drinking, drug-taking or gambling. Also because of greed or anger, we 
        vocalize things which should not be spoken about. These activities 
        result in destruction of property, punishment by legal authorities and 
        loss of friends and associates. From the spiritual and moral standpoint, 
        bad deeds such as killing and telling lies produce bad results, even 
        leading to the misery of the woeful states. Thus, volitional formations 
        oppress by producing bad <i>kammic </i>effects.</p>
        <p>Here I would like to recount a story of how an unwholesome volitional 
        activity of slandering resulted in dire distress.</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>THE STORY OF THE SPIKED PETA</b></font></p>
        <p>At one time the Venerable Lakkhaṇa and the Venerable Moggallāna 
        were coming down from the Vultures' Peak to go for alms food. On their 
        way down, the Venerable Moggallāna saw a <i>peta</i> by means of his 
        Divine Eye. The <i>peta</i> had needles piercing and passing through its 
        body. Some entered into its head and emerged from its mouth, some 
        entered into the mouth and came out from the chest, some entered from 
        the chest and came out through the stomach, some pierced through the 
        stomach and came out by the thigh, some came in by the thighs and out 
        through the legs, some entered into the legs and came out through the 
        feet.</p>
        <p>The <i>peta</i> was running about in intense pain, but the needles 
        followed him and pierced his body wherever he went. On seeing his 
        plight, the Venerable Moggallāna reflected that he had become divested 
        of all <i>kammic</i> effects that could land him in such an existence. 
        Pleased with the thought of self-liberation, he smiled to himself, and 
        this was duly noticed by his companion, the Venerable Lakkhaṇa, who 
        asked him the reason for his smile.</p>
        <p>The Venerable Lakkhaṇa was not developed enough to see <i>petas</i>, 
        and would have disbelieved the story and cast doubt on Moggallāna's 
        words, so the Venerable Moggallāna did not tell him then what he had 
        seen, but told him to ask about it again when they got to the presence 
        of the Blessed One.</p>
        <p>After finishing the meal, they went to the Buddha, and the Venerable 
        Lakkhaṇa asked once again why the Venerable Moggallāna had smiled as 
        they came down from the Vultures' Peak. The Venerable Moggallāna said 
        then that he saw a <i>peta</i> being tormented by piercing needles and 
        he smiled on reflecting that he had become free from such unwholesome 
        volitional activities as had landed the <i>peta</i> in his predicament.</p>
        <p>Then the Blessed One praised him, &quot;My disciple is well equipped 
        with the Divine Eye. I saw this <i>peta</i> on the eve of my 
        enlightenment while seated on the throne of wisdom, but since there was 
        no witness, I have not said a word about it. Now that I have the 
        Venerable Moggallāna to corroborate the story, I shall tell about 
        him.&quot;</p>
        <p>The Blessed One recounted that while in human existence, that being 
        had committed the grievous misdeed of slandering, for which unwholesome <i>kamma</i> 
        he had to undergo intense suffering in the nether worlds for many <i>lakhs 
        </i>of years. Having come up from that abode, he had become this <i>peta</i> 
        to suffer for the remaining portion of the resultant <i>saṅkhāras</i>.</p>
        <p>The <i>peta</i> was invisible to ordinary vision, that is why 
        Venerable Lakkhana did not see him. The needles that pierced the <i>peta 
        </i>did not fall upon other beings, only on that <i>peta</i>. This is an 
        example of how oppressing volitional formations can be.</p>
        <p>There were other <i>petas</i> visible to the Venerable Moggallāna, 
        such as the cattle slaughterer who had become a <i>peta</i> chased by 
        vultures, crows, and eagles, who attacked him with their beaks; the bird 
        hunter who had become a <i>peta </i>in the shape of a piece of meat, 
        pestered by vultures, crows and eagles, and who wailed as he fled from 
        his assailants; a former sheep slaughterer who had no skin covering his 
        body -- a bloody, messy lump of flesh -- he was also a target of attack 
        by vultures, crows and eagles; a <i>peta</i> who had previously been a 
        pig slaughterer who had knives and two edged swords falling upon him and 
        cutting him up; a hunter who had spears piercing him. They were all 
        running about wildly, shrieking and wailing. The Venerable Moggallāna 
        also saw <i>petas</i> who were suffering because of other unwholesome 
        volitional formations, such as torturing others and committing adultery. 
        They serve as further examples of the oppressive nature of unwholesome <i>saṅkhāras</i>.</p>
        <p>The denizens of the lower worlds and creatures of the animal world 
        are undergoing suffering because of unwholesome volitional formations 
        which they have done in the past. In this human world, miseries due to 
        the difficulties of earning a living, disease and maltreatment by others 
        have their origin in past unwholesome volitional formations. These 
        volitional formations oppress because they are not self, not one's inner 
        core.</p>
        <p>It is not possible to manage volitional formations so that 
        unwholesome ones are prevented from arising and only the wholesome ones 
        appear. This can be experienced personally by meditators: they want to 
        develop only the volitional formations pertaining to meditation, but 
        they find, especially in the beginning, undesirable distractions making 
        their appearance. Under the guidance of greed, various thoughts 
        suggesting different procedures for meditation practice are continually 
        arising. Other thoughts under the guidance of aversion and conceit, to 
        practice this way or that, arise. The meditators must discard these 
        distracting thoughts by noting &quot;liking,&quot; &quot;desiring,&quot; 
        &quot;thinking&quot; and so on. As stated above, all these volitional 
        activities tend to afflict, they are unmanageable, therefore they are 
        not self, not one's inner core; they are insubstantial phenomena, 
        dependent on conditions. They may be likened to the rain, the sun or the 
        wind. We have no control over the rain. Although we may wish for it, we 
        will not get it unless such conditions as clouds, humidity, and wind 
        elements permit. When the conditions are right, we get rain even if we 
        do not want it. Likewise with the sun: when the sun is covered by 
        clouds, there is no sunshine, no matter how much we may wish for it. In 
        the absence of cloud cover, the sun shines brightly whether we want it 
        or not. The wind blows only when atmospheric conditions are right. When 
        conditions are not favorable, there is no wind, however much we wish for 
        it. These external phenomena have nothing to do with us; we have no 
        control over them. Volitional formations are internal phenomena over 
        which we also have no control. They fare in accordance with conditions 
        and are, therefore, not self.</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>HOW REALIZATION OF NOT-SELF COMES ABOUT</b></font></p>
        <p>For the meditator constantly taking note of corporeal and mental 
        phenomena, it becomes very obvious how volitional formations are 
        uncontrollable and not amenable to one's will. While contemplating on 
        the movements of the abdomen and bodily motions, noting 
        &quot;rising,&quot; &quot;falling,&quot; &quot;sitting,&quot; 
        &quot;touching,&quot; if stiffness arises, it has to be noted as 
        &quot;stiffness, stiffness.&quot; Then the desire to change postures 
        follows. This desire is nothing but mental activity headed by <i>cetanā</i>, 
        volition. <i>Cetanā</i> is giving silent instructions, &quot;Now, 
        change the posture, change the posture.&quot; The meditator may want to 
        continue noting without changing posture, but because of the insistent 
        urgings of <i>cetanā,</i> he does change. This is an unwanted 
        volitional formation.</p>
        <p>Likewise, while noting feelings of pain, heat or itchiness, posture 
        is changed at the direction of ungovernable volitional formations.</p>
        <p>Again, during the course of meditating, sensual thoughts may appear. 
        These are volitional formations which the meditator does not wish for, 
        and they must be banished by vigilant noting. Volitional formations may 
        urge the meditator to go and talk to someone, to look around or do some 
        work. These are all undesirable volitional formations which arise all 
        the same whether one likes it or not.</p>
        <p>They are examples of the unmanageable, uncontrollable nature of 
        volitional formations. They should not be welcomed, but discarded by 
        heedful noting.</p>
        <p>To think that there is a manageable, controllable self is to adhere 
        to <i>sāmi attā</i> clinging. The meditator who takes note of the 
        processes of corporeality and mentality as they take place clearly 
        perceives that what one desires does not happen, and what is not desired 
        does happen. In this way he removes the <i>sāmi attā</i> clinging. As 
        he observes the processes of origination and dissolution taking place in 
        quick succession, and sees that which is cherished dissolving, <i>sāmi 
        attā</i> clinging is abandoned. Nothing is seen to remain stable; 
        everything is dissolving, perishing. In this way, <i>nivāsī attā</i> 
        clinging, the belief in the permanent existence of self or inner 
        substance, is also banished.</p>
        <p>Then the meditator perceives that events take place only when various 
        factors come together to fulfil the necessary conditions for their 
        happening. Take, for instance, the arising of eye-consciousness. There 
        must be the eye, an object of sight and sufficient light. Then there 
        must be the intention to look. When there is eye and a clearly visible 
        object of sight, the act of seeing is bound to ensue. Likewise a sound 
        is heard only when there is ear, sound, unobstructed space and intention 
        of inclining the mind to hearing. When there is ear and a clearly 
        audible sound, an act of hearing will surely take place. An act of 
        touching will take place when there is an object, the body, bodily 
        impression and intention to touch.</p>
        <p>Seeing that respective resultant events of seeing, hearing, and 
        touching take place only when corresponding factors necessary for their 
        arising have come together, the meditator realizes that there is no self 
        or living entity which is causing the seeing, hearing or touching. He 
        thus banishes the <i>kāraka attā</i> clinging which holds there is 
        self or living entity masterminding or overseeing activities. In order 
        to remove this <i>kāraka attā</i> clinging, the Blessed One taught 
        that <i>saṅkhāra</i>, volitional formations, are not self.</p>
        <p>I have now dealt fairly comprehensively with the exposition on 
        volitional formations not being self, and shall end the discourse here 
        for today.</p>
