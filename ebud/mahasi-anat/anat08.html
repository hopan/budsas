        <p><font size="6">T</font>he original <i>Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta</i> is 
        divided into four parts. The first part deals with the teaching that<b> 
        &quot;</b>the five aggregates of form, feeling, perception, volitional 
        formations and<b> </b>consciousness tend to afflict and, being 
        unmanageable, are therefore not self or inner essence.&quot;</p>
        <p>The second part deals with the questions, &quot;Are the five 
        aggregates permanent or impermanent? Are they suffering or 
        happiness&quot;' and explains that it is not fitting to regard that 
        which is not permanent, suffering, and subject to change as 
        &quot;mine,&quot; &quot;me,&quot; &quot;my self.&quot;</p>
        <p>In the third part, the five aggregates are classified and enumerated 
        under eleven headings and it is taught to contemplate them as &quot;not 
        mine, not me, not my self&quot; (impermanent, suffering, not self).</p>
        <p>In the fourth part, which we will deal with now, the Blessed One 
        taught how the meditator develops the knowledge of insight step by step, 
        and how <i>nibbidā ñāṇa</i>, knowledge of disenchantment, is 
        developed, leading to the attainment of the knowledge of the Path and 
        Fruition and final liberation as an <i>Arahat.</p>
        </i>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">HOW INSIGHT KNOWLEDGE IS DEVELOPED</font></b></p>
        <b><i>
        <p>Evaṁ passaṁ bhikkhave, sutvā ariyasāvako rūpa-smiṁpi

        </i></b><i>
        <p>&quot;Monks, the instructed noble disciple, seeing thus, grows 
        wearied of form, wearied of feeling, wearied of perception, wearied of 
        volitional formation, wearied of consciousness&quot;.</p>
        </i>
        <p>In this way, the Blessed One taught how <i>nibbidā ñāṇa</i> is 
        developed. &quot;Seeing thus&quot; in the above passage means seeing 
        impermanence, suffering and not self. He becomes the instructed 
        disciple, fully equipped with knowledge from both hearing and from 
        personal experience.</p>
        <p>He has learned from hearing that in order to perceive the nature of 
        impermanence, suffering and not-self in the five aggregates<b> </b>of 
        form, feeling, perception, volitional formations and consciousness he 
        has to take note of every act of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, 
        touching and thinking. He has also heard that one must contemplate the 
        five groups of grasping as just mental and physical properties and that 
        the knowing is (a function of) mind (mentality, <i>nāma</i>). He has 
        also heard about cause and effect, about the nature of incessant arising 
        and vanishing, impermanence and insubstantiality. All of this 
        constitutes knowledge acquired from hearsay or learning. Meditators are 
        accomplished in this form of knowledge even before they start 
        meditation.</p>
        <p>Then while taking note of rising, falling, bending, stretching, 
        moving, extending, pressing, feeling touch that is hard, coarse, soft, 
        smooth, hot, cold, and seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and touching, 
        the meditator realizes that the objects he is taking note of are 
        corporeality and the knowing of these objects is mentality, and that 
        there are only these two: corporeality and mentality. When he takes note 
        of eye consciousness, ear consciousness, touch consciousness and mental 
        consciousness, he knows that consciousness is mentality and the location 
        of this consciousness is corporeality; that there are only these two. 
        This is knowledge acquired through personal experience.</p>
        <p>Further, when there is desire to bend, he bends; when there is desire 
        to stretch, he stretches; when there is desire to walk, he walks. Noting 
        all these, he comes to realize that he bends because there is desire, he 
        stretches or walks because there is desire to do so; there is no living 
        entity making him bend, stretch or walk, there are only respective 
        causes for each result produced. This is also knowledge from personal 
        experience.</p>
        <p>If the meditator fails to take note of phenomena he cannot see them 
        as they really are. He develops liking for them. From liking comes 
        craving. Because he craves for them, he has to make efforts to obtain 
        them, thereby producing wholesome and unwholesome <i>kamma</i>, in 
        consequence of which there are new becomings. In this way he comes to 
        understand the Law of Dependent Origination concerning the cause and 
        effect of phenomena.</p>
        <p>Again, both the objects of form, feeling, perception, volitional 
        formations and consciousness and the knowing mind keep on arising afresh 
        and perishing. Thus he knows rightly, as the Blessed One instructed, 
        that they are impermanent, suffering and not-self.</p>
        <p>As stated above, various kinds of knowledge, beginning with that of 
        differentiation between corporeality and mentality, right up to 
        knowledge of their nature as impermanent, suffering and not-self, are 
        all gained by personal experience, not from hearing or learning. We dare 
        say that among the present audience there are many members who are 
        equipped with such personal knowledge. Thus we say that the person who 
        can perceive the true nature of impermanence, suffering and not-self 
        through personal experience is one who is well instructed, equipped with 
        both the knowledge of learning and the knowledge of personal experience.</p>
        <p>It<b> </b>goes without saying that the Group of Five, being Stream 
        Enterers, were fully equipped with both types of knowledge and were 
        therefore fully instructed.</p>
        <p>The disciple of the Blessed One who is thus fully instructed can 
        perceive, with his own knowledge, the five aggregates of form, feeling, 
        perception, volitional formations and consciousness as they manifest at 
        every moment of seeing, hearing, touching, and knowing, as impermanent, 
        suffering and not-self. The meditator who can perceive in this way soon 
        reaches the stage of<i> udayabbaya ñāṇa</i>, in which the rapid 
        arising and dissolution of corporeality and mentality are discerned. 
        According to the <i>Visuddhimagga</i>, when that stage is reached, the 
        meditator witnesses strange lights and aura, and experiences 
        unprecedented happiness, intense joy <i>(pīti)</i> and quietude. He 
        also experiences lightness in body and mind, softness and gentleness, 
        vigor and energy. He thus feels indescribably pleasant in body and mind. 
        His mindfulness is so perfect that it may be said that there is nothing 
        he is not mindful of, his intellect so keen and sharp that it seems 
        there is nothing he cannot comprehend. His religious fervor increases 
        and his faith and devotion in the Buddha, Dhamma and Saṅgha grow 
        unprecedentedly clear and bright.</p>
        <p>But all these strange developments have to be noted and rejected.</p>
        <p>When they are noted and rejected thus, this stage of knowledge is 
        passed and the next stage is reached with the appearance of <i>bhaṅga 
        ñāṇa</i>. At that time, the object of meditation and the meditating 
        mind are perceived to be disintegrating, vanishing pair by pair. For 
        instance, when the rising is noted, it vanishes together with the noting 
        mind. Each act of rising is discerned to be vanishing in successive 
        separate disappearances. This is discerned at every moment of noting. It 
        even appears that the object of meditation ceases first, and the noting 
        of it comes later. This is of course what actually happens. When arising 
        of thought is contemplated, the noting mind arises only after that 
        thought has disappeared. The same thing happens while noting other 
        objects: the noting takes place only after the object to be noted has 
        disappeared. But when knowledge is not yet fully developed, the object 
        to be noted seems to disappear simultaneously with the knowing mind. 
        This is in accord with the <i>Sutta</i> teaching that only the present 
        moment is contemplated. Perceiving the continuous and rapid process of 
        dissolution, one comes to know that death may occur at any time, which 
        is a terrifying thing to realize. This is knowledge of danger or terror, 
        <i>bhaya ñāṇa</i>. When things are seen as dangerous, the 
        understanding arises that they are baneful and full of danger. This is <i>ādinava 
        ñāṇa</i>. The meditator no longer finds delight in these baneful 
        aggregates of corporeality and mentality. He finds them detestable, 
        wearisome, and this is <i>nibbidā ñāṇa</i>. The Blessed One was 
        referring to this state of mind when he said, <i>rūpasmiṁpi 
        nibbindati</i>: &quot;He grows wearied of form ...&quot;</p>
        <p>Before the development of <i>nibbidā ñāṇa</i>, one may be quite 
        satisfied and happy with one's present physical form, and satisfied and 
        happy with the expectation of human or celestial physical form in a 
        future existence. One craves for and looks forward to the happiness of 
        human or celestial existence, and a beautiful, healthy body. With the 
        arising of this knowledge, one no longer feels happy, no longer lives 
        with joyful expectation. The so-called happi-ness of human life is made 
        up of incessantly arising and ceasing corporeality and mentality. The 
        meditator also visualizes that the so-called happiness in a celestial 
        being is similarly constituted of fleeting corporeality and mentality, 
        for which he has developed detestation and weariness. It is just like 
        the fisherman holding a dangerous snake, thinking it to be an eel: once 
        he realizes that he has a dangerous snake in his hand, not an eel, he 
        wants to throw it away as quickly as possible. This illustration was 
        described fully in my discourse on the <i>Sīlavanta Sutta</i>.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, before the advent of <i>nibbidā ñāṇa</i>, he takes 
        delight in all the feelings he is enjoying, and he yearns for 
        pleasurable feelings of the human or celestial worlds in future 
        existences. He takes delight in the good perceptions <i>(saññā)</i> 
        he is blessed with now; he longs for and is happy with the thought of 
        having good perceptions in future existences. He takes delight in 
        thoughts and actions of the present life and thoughts and actions in 
        future existences. Some people even pray for what they would like to do 
        when reborn. Some indulge and rejoice in daydreaming and ideation now 
        and look forward to doing similarly in coming existences. But when <i>nibbidā 
        ñāṇa</i> is developed, one sees the ever arising and ceasing of 
        feeling, perception, volitional formations and consciousness as they 
        truly are and feels a distaste for them. Just as they are quickly 
        passing away right now, whether one is reborn as a human or a celestial 
        being, feeling, perception, volitional formations and consciousness will 
        always be disintegrating. Considering thus, he feels dispassionate 
        towards all these formations (aggregates), and is dissatisfied with 
        them.</p>
        <p>It is essential that the meditator becomes genuinely dissatisfied and 
        wearied with conditions. Only when genuine distaste is developed towards 
        them does the wish to escape from them, to discard them, arise, and the 
        subsequent striving to get rid of them. It is then that <i>saṅkhārupekkhā 
        ñāṇa</i> will appear, and when that <i>ñāṇa</i> is fully 
        developed, <i>Nibbāna</i> can be realized through attainment of the 
        knowledge of the Noble Path and Fruition, becoming a Stream Enterer, a 
        Once Returner, a Non-Returner or an Arahat. Thus it is essential to 
        strive hard for the development of genuine <i>nibbidā ñāṇa</i>. It 
        is for this reason that the Blessed One taught:</p>
        <i><b>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Sabbe saṅkhārā aniccāti<br>
          yadā paññāya passati<br>
          atha nibbindati dukkhe<br>
          esa maggo visuddhiyā.</p>
        </blockquote>
        </b></i>
        <p>&quot;All compounded things, conditioned by <i>kamrna,</i> mind, 
        seasonal variations and nutriment, are transient. When one comprehends 
        this truth by <i>vipassanā ñāṇa</i>, one grows dissatisfied and 
        wearied with all this suffering (all compounded corporeality and 
        mentality). This dis-satisfaction and antipathy is the true and right 
        Path to purity, to <i>Nibbāna</i>, free from all defilements and 
        suffering.&quot;</p>
        <p>The meditator who takes note of every act of seeing, hearing, 
        touching and knowing as it arises perceives only phenomena rapidly 
        arising and vanishing. He knows, therefore, things as they truly are -- 
        all transient. With this knowledge of impermanence comes the realization 
        that there is nothing delightful and pleasant in the present mind and 
        body; future states of mind and body, having the same nature of 
        impermanence, will also be undelightful and unpleasant. He therefore 
        develops distaste for all mentality and corporeality, and he wants to be 
        free from them. He strives for liberation by continuing with his 
        meditation. Thereby <i>saṅkhārupekkhā ñāṇa</i> appears and <i>Nibbāna</i> 
        is realized through the Noble Path. Therefore the Blessed One taught 
        that the insight which sees only dissatisfaction and repugnance is the 
        true path to <i>Nibbāna</i>.</p>

        <p>&quot;All compounded things, conditioned by <i>kamma,</i> mind, 
        seasonal variations and nutriment, are suffering. When one comprehends 
        this truth ... &quot;</p>
        <p>A certain teacher has interpreted the word <i>&quot;saṅkhārā&quot;</i> 
        in this verse to mean the <i>cetanā</i> (volition) which produces 
        wholesome and unwholesome actions. Thus, according to him: 
        &quot;Wholesome acts such as charitable deeds and keeping precepts are 
        all <i>saṅkhārā</i>, and hence suffering. Likewise, practicing 
        concentration and insight meditation are <i>saṅkhāra</i>. All types 
        of action are thus productive of suffering. In order to attain the peace 
        of <i>Nibbāna</i>, engage in no activity. &quot;Keep the mind as it 
        is.&quot; Thus he misrepresents the teaching to suit his purpose, and 
        his disciples, who accept his views, spread his wrong teaching. As a 
        matter of fact, the word <i>&quot;saṅkhārā&quot;</i> of this verse 
        is not intended to mean wholesome and unwholesome volitional actions <i>(kusala, 
        akusala saṅkhārā)</i> which arise out of ignorance. Here, <i>saṅkhārā</i> 
        means simply the mentality and corporeality which arise as conditioned 
        by <i>kamma,</i> mind, seasonal variations and nutriment. Again, 
        mentality and corporeality do not include the supramundane path and 
        fruition consciousness, or mental concomitants which form the object of <i>vipassanā</i> 
        meditation. Only the mundane forms of mentality and corporeality, which 
        occur in the three spheres (sense sphere, form sphere and formless 
        sphere) are meant here, the same as the <i>saṅkhārā</i> of the 
        previous verse. Thus, all mentality and corporeality which manifest at 
        every moment of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, and 
        thinking are incessantly arising and vanishing, they are transient. 
        Because of their imperma-nence, they are suffering. This is what is 
        meant here.</p>
        <i>
        <p>&quot;All compounded things which arise as conditioned by kamma,<b> </b>mind, 
        seasonal variations and nutriment are suffering. When one comprehends 
        this truth by knowledge of bhaṅga ñāṇa, one becomes dissatisfied 
        and wearied with all this suffering. This dissatisfaction and weariness 
        is the true and right path to purity, to Nibbāna, free from all 
        defilements and suffering.&quot;</p>
        </i>
        <p>The meditator perceives that all the mentality and corporeality which 
        appear at the moment of sensory awareness are undergoing instant 
        dissolution and are therefore transient. Because they are impermanent 
        and liable to disintegrate at any moment, the meditator perceives them 
        as fearful and a source of suffering. For some meditators, unpleasant 
        sensations such as stiffness, heat, pain and itchiness are constantly 
        arising in various parts of the body. At every manifestation, these 
        sensations are noted, thereby enabling the meditator to perceive the 
        whole body as a mass of suffering. This is in accordance with the 
        teaching <i>dukkha maddhakkhi</i> <i>sallato: vipassanā</i> <i>ñāṇa</i> 
        perceives the body as a mass of suffering caused by piercing thorns or 
        spikes.</p>
        <p>It may be asked, &quot;What difference is there between the pain 
        experienced by an ordinary person and that experienced by the 
        meditator?&quot; The difference lies in the fact that the ordinary 
        person sees pain as, &quot;my feeling, I am suffering,&quot; but the 
        meditator knows unpleasant feeling without any self clinging, he 
        perceives it as just a phenomenon, arising and immediately perishing. It 
        is <i>vipassanā ñāṇa</i>, an object of insight knowledge, without 
        any self clinging.</p>
        <p>Whether perceived as suffering because of impermanence or as a mass 
        of unbearable suffering, there is no delight in compounded things, only 
        repugnance. There is dissatisfaction and weariness with regard to 
        present and future mentality and corporeality, a total distaste for all 
        mentality and corporeality. This is develop-ment of <i>nibbidā ñāṇa</i>. 
        When this <i>ñāṇa</i> is developed, there follows the wish to 
        discard mentality and corporeality, to be free of them. The meditator 
        continues with the work of meditation in order to achieve freedom. In 
        time, striving on, <i>saṅkharupekkhā ñāṇa</i> arises and <i>Nibbāna</i> 
        is realized by means of the knowledge of the Noble Path. Therefore the 
        Blessed One described the insight knowledge which considers all <i>saṅkhārā</i> 
        as suffering and as objects of disgust as the Path to <i>Nibbāna.</i> 
        In a similar manner, the Blessed One taught how they are perceived as 
        non-self and thus regarded with disgust and dislike.</p>

        <p>Dhamma in this verse has the same purpose as <i>saṅkhārā</i> of 
        the previous two verses, meaning mundane mentality and corporeality as 
        perceived by insight knowledge. <i>Anattā</i> is <i>dhamma</i> and <i>dhamma</i>, 
        phenomena, thus means <i>anattā</i>. In order to bring out more clearly 
        the meaning of <i>saṅkhārā</i> as nonself, the word <i>dhamma</i> is 
        employed here.</p>
        <p>This is the explanation given in the Commentary and we believe it is 
        quite appropriate and acceptable. But there are other views which hold 
        that the word <i>dhamma</i> is purposely used here to include the 
        supramundane Path, Fruition and the unconditioned <i>Nibbāna</i> as 
        well. We believe this interpretation is not quite tenable. The ordinary 
        person perceives <i>saṅkhārā</i>, such as acts of seeing and 
        hearing, as permanent and pleasant, whereas the meditator sees them as 
        transient and suffering. Likewise, what the ordinary person regards as 
        self, namely mundane mentality and corporeality, the meditator sees as 
        not-self, <i>anattā</i>. The meditator need not and cannot note 
        supramundane things. They cannot be objects of contemplation and he 
        could thus have no attachments for them. Thus it must be taken that <i>dhamma</i> 
        here means just mundane <i>saṅkhārā,</i> mentality and corporeality, 
        which can form the objects of <i>vipassanā </i>contemplation.</p>
        <i>
        <p>&quot;All mundane mentality and corporeality, such as acts of seeing 
        and hearing, are not self, not living entities. When one comprehends 
        this truth through vipassanā contemplation at the stage of bhaṅga ñāṇa, 
        one grows dissatisfied and wearied with all this suffering. Distaste is 
        the true and right path to purity, to Nibbāna, free from all 
        defilements and sufferings.&quot;</p>
        </i>
        <p>Because ordinary people take mentality and corporeality to be self, 
        living entity, they delight in them and feel happy about them. But the 
        meditator sees them only as incessantly arising and perishing phenomena, 
        and realizes, therefore, that they are not self. As explained in this <i>Sutta,</i> 
        because they tend to afflict they are seen to be not self and not 
        subject to one's will. Thus the meditator takes no more delight or 
        pleasure in mentality and corporeality. There arises the wish to discard 
        them, to get free of them. He continues with the meditation in order to 
        achieve freedom. In time, <i>saṅkhārupekkhā ñāṇa</i> arises and <i>Nibbāna</i> 
        is realized by means of the knowledge of the Noble Path.</p>
        <p>Therefore, the Blessed One described the insight knowledge which 
        considers all mental and corporeal conditions as not-self and leads to 
        disgust with them as the Path to <i>Nibbāna.</p>
        </i>
        <p>These three stanzas should be carefully noted. Unless the <i>saṅkhārā</i> 
        represented by mentality and corporeality are seen in one's own 
        experience as incessantly arising and disintegrating, true insight 
        knowledge of them as impermanent, suffering and not-self is not 
        developed. And without the development of genuine knowledge of 
        impermanence, suffering and not-self, <i>nibbidā ñāṇa</i>, the 
        distaste for the sufferings of mental and corporeal formations, will not 
        arise. And in the absence of <i>nibbidā ñāṇa</i> it is impossible 
        to realize <i>Nibbāna</i>. Only with the absence of personal knowledge 
        of the impermanent, suffering and not-self nature of <i>saṅkhārā</i> 
        will weariness develop and <i>nibbidā ñāṇa</i> appear. And it is 
        only after the appearance of this <i>nibbidā ñāṇa</i> that the 
        knowledge of the Path and Fruition, followed by the realization of <i>Nibbāna</i>, 
        will come. It is for this reason that the Blessed One stated in this 
        Sutta: <i>Evaṁ passaṁ bhikkhave, sutvā ariyasāvako, rūpasmiṁpi 
        nibbindati ... :</p>
        <p>&quot;Monks, the instructed Noble Disciple, seeing thus (seeing form, 
        feeling, perception, volitional formations and consciousness as ‘not 
        mine, not I, not my self') grows wearied of form, wearied of feeling, 
        wearied of perception, wearied of volitional formations, wearied of 
        consciousness&quot;.</p>
        </i>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">DEFINITION OF NIBBINDA ÑĀṆA</font></b></p>
        <p>In the above Pāli passage, &quot;Seeing thus&quot; is a summarized 
        statement of the development of <i>vipassanā</i> up to the state of <i>bhaṅga</i> 
        <i>ñāṇa</i>. And with the words &quot;wearied of ... &quot; 
        development of <i>vipassanā ñāṇa</i> from <i>bhaṅga</i>, <i>ādinava</i>, 
        and <i>nibbidā</i>, right up to <i>vuṭṭhānagāminī</i>, is very 
        concisely described. Thus in the cornmentary to the <i>Mūlapaṇṇāsa,</i> 
        we find this exposition:</p>
        <i>
        <p>Nibbindatīti ukkanthati. Ettha ca nibbindāti vuṭṭhānagāminī 
        vipassanā adhippeta.</p>
        <p>&quot;Nibbindati </i>... to feel weariness, means feeling bored, 
        feeling displeased, unhappy. To explain further, the words <i>‘Nibbindati</i> 
        ...' should be taken to mean the <i>vipassanā</i> which attains to the 
        Noble Path, known as <i>vuṭṭhāna.&quot;</p>
        </i>
        <p>In the <i>Paṭisambhidāmagga</i> and <i>Visuddhimagga</i>, <i>nibbinda 
        ñāṇa</i> is enumerated in seven successive stages of development: <i>bhaṅga, 
        ādīnava, nibbidā, muñcitukamyatā, paṭisaṅkhāra, saṅkhārupekkhā</i> 
        and <i>vuṭṭhānagāminī</i> <i>vipassanā ñāṇa</i>. We have so 
        far explained up to the stage of <i>nibbidā</i>. Now I shall continue 
        with the rest.</p>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">GENUINE DESIRE FOR NIBBĀNA</font></b></p>
        <p>Finding only rapid dissolution and disintegration at every instance 
        of contemplation, the meditator becomes wearied of and disenchanted with 
        the aggregates of mentality and corporeality manifested in the acts of 
        seeing, hearing and so on. He does not wish to hold onto them, he wants 
        to abandon them. He realizes that only in the absence of these 
        incessantly arising and perishing mental and corporeal phenomena will 
        there be peace. This is the arising of the wish for true, genuine <i>Nibbāna</i>. 
        Formerly, imagining <i>Nibbāna</i> to be something like a great 
        metropolis, one's wish to get there arose with a hope for permanent 
        enjoyment of all that the heart desires. This is not a desire for 
        genuine <i>Nibbāna</i>, but only the mundane type of happiness. Those 
        who have not really seen the dangers and faults of mentality and 
        corporeality wish for enjoyment of mundane types of bliss. They cannot 
        entertain the idea of complete cessation of all mentality and 
        corporeality, including every form of enjoyment.</p>
        <p>At one time, a certain young monk by the name of Lāludāyi heard the 
        Venerable Sārīputta murmuring, &quot;<i>Nibbāna</i> is blissful; <i>Nibbāna</i> 
        is blissful.&quot; He asked him &quot;Venerable Sārīputta, there is no 
        sensation in <i>Nibbāna</i>, so there is nothing to experience, is 
        there not? Then what is blissful in <i>Nibbāna</i>, where there is no 
        sensation?&quot; He raised this point having learned that <i>Nibbāna</i> 
        is void of all mentality and corporeality, and thus void of sensation, 
        but, having no personal experience of <i>Nibbāna</i>, he could not see 
        what was blissful about it. The Venerable Sārīputta's reply to this 
        question was, &quot;The fact that there is no sensation to experience is 
        itself blissful.&quot;</p>
        <p>True it is that peace and tranquility is more blissful than any 
        pleasant or delightful sensation. This is true bliss. A sensation is 
        thought of as blissful or delightful because of fondness and craving for 
        it. Without fondness, no sensation can be regarded as delightful. A 
        moment's consideration will prove this point. A tasty food seems 
        delightful and delicious while there is liking or craving for it, but 
        when one is not feeling well, or when one has eaten and is already full, 
        the same tasty food will no longer look appealing. If one were forced to 
        eat it, one would not find it at all enjoyable; it would not be regarded 
        as delicious, but rather as a source of suffering. Take another example: 
        how long can you keep on looking at a beautiful sight, or listening to a 
        pleasant sound? How many hours, days, months, or years? One cannot 
        maintain interest in them continuously even 24 hours before distaste and 
        dislike for them arise. To have to continue looking at that sight or 
        listening to that sound would become a terrible experience. It is clear, 
        therefore, that to be without any liking or craving, to be without 
        sensation (feeling), is to be blissful. A detailed account on this 
        subject has been given in our book entitled <i>Concerning Nibbāna </i>[Published 
        as <i>Nibbānapaṭisaṁyutta Kathā</i>: <i>On the Nature of Nibbāna</i>; 
        Yangon, Myanmar, May, 1995, by the Buddha Sasana Nuggaha Foundation].</p>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">ANTICIPATING NIBBĀNA</font></b></p>
        <p>The meditator who is developing <i>nibbinda ñāṇa</i> truly 
        perceives the baneful aspects of mentality and corporeality and has 
        become weary with them. He knows that in <i>Nibbāna</i>, where there is 
        no mentality and corporeality, no sensation, lies real peace, and so he 
        longs for it. This is like scanning the distance from a lookout post. It 
        is looking forward to <i>Nibbāna</i> by means of <i>muñcitukamyatā ñāṇa</i>, 
        knowledge of desire for liberation. As the will to attain real <i>Nibbāna</i> 
        and desire to be liberated from the ills of mentality and corporeality 
        develop, the meditator increases his efforts. With this doubling of 
        effort, he gains <i>paṭisaṅkhā ñāṇa</i>, (reflection on what 
        has been contemplated), in which comprehension of the nature of 
        impermanence, suffering and not-self is deeper than previously. 
        Particularly more pronounced and distinct is the understanding of the 
        nature of suffering. When <i>paṭisaṅkha ñāṇa</i> gains strength 
        and maturity, the meditator attains <i>saṅkhārupekkhā ñāṇa</i>, 
        knowledge of equanimity towards all conditioned things, all mentality 
        and corporeality. This is a general description of how, starting from <i>sammasana 
        ñāṇa</i>, the series of <i>vipassanā ṇāṇ</i>a gradually 
        develops step by step in a trainable <i>(neyya)</i> individual. With 
        noble people, such as a Stream Enterer, within a few moments after the 
        start of meditation, the stage of <i>saṅkhārupekkhā ñāṇa</i> may 
        be reached. There is no doubt that the five monks listening to the <i>Anattalakkhaṇa 
        Sutta</i> reached this stage instantly.</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>THE SIX CHARACTERISTICS OF SANKHĀRUPEKKHA 
        ÑĀṆA</b></font></p>
        <b>(1) Equanimity</b><i>
        <p>Saṅkhārupekkhā ñāṇa</i> is distinguished by six 
        characteristics. The first is maintenance of equanimity, being unmoved 
        by fear or unpleasantness, as stated in the <i>Visuddhimagga:</i> <i>Bhayañca 
        nandiñca vippahāya sabba saṅkhāresu udāsino.</i> How has this 
        equanimity come about? At the stage of <i>bhaya ñāṇa</i>, he has 
        contemplated fearsomeness and the knowledge thereby developed is 
        characterized by abhorrence. At the stage of <i>saṅkhār</i>-<i>upekkhā 
        ñāṇa</i>, all signs of fear have disappeared. At the stage of <i>ādinava</i>, 
        he regards all things as baneful; at the stage of <i>nibbidā</i>, all 
        things are distasteful and loathsome. At the <i>muñcitukamyatā</i> 
        stage he develops a desire to discard all the aggregates, to escape from 
        them. When he reaches the stage of <i>saṅkhārupekkhā ñāṇa</i>, 
        all these characteristics of the lower stages of insight <i>(ñāṇas),</i> 
        namely, seeing banefulness, feeling distaste and disgust, desire to 
        escape, and putting in extraordinary effort, have disappeared. The 
        quotation <i>bhayañca vippahāya</i> -- &quot;abandoning fear&quot; -- 
        from the <i>Visuddhimagga</i> refers to this progress in knowledge. In 
        accordance with this, it must be taken that with the disappearance of 
        fear, the other characteristics, namely seeing banefulness, feeling 
        disgust, desire to escape and extraordinary efforts, have also 
        disappeared.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, at the stage of <i>udayabbaya ñāṇa</i> the meditator 
        develops intense rapture and exultation, he is highly exultant. <i>Saṅkhārupekkhā 
        ñāṇa</i> is<b> </b>a superior development to <i>udayabbaya ñāṇa</i>; 
        nevertheless, at this stage all this rapture and exultation are absent. 
        Thus it is said in the <i>Visuddhimagga, nandiñca vippahāya -</i>- 
        &quot;abandoning delight.&quot; He has abandoned exultation, delight and 
        pleasure; he dwells contemplating all <i>saṅkhārā</i> manifested in 
        seeing, hearing and so on with complete equanimity. There is no longer 
        great exuberance, gladness, happiness, or delight such as occurs at the 
        stage of <i>udayabbaya ñāṇa</i>.</p>
        <p>This is absence of fear or delight with respect to the practice of <i>Dhamma</i>. 
        With regard to mundane affairs too, it becomes plain how a meditator 
        becomes free from fear and delight. When a meditator who has attained 
        the <i>saṅkhārupekkhā</i> stage of development hears worrying news 
        of worldly affairs or his personal life, he remains unperturbed, unmoved 
        by worry, anxiety or fear. He remains unperturbed, too, when he meets 
        with gladdening events, little moved by exultation, rejoicing or 
        delight. This is freedom from fear and delight in worldly matters.</p>
        <b>
        <p>(2) Balance</p>
        </b>
        <p>The second characteristic is balanced attitude of mind, feeling 
        neither glad over pleasant things nor sad and depressed by distressing 
        states of affairs. One can view things, both pleasant and unpleasant, 
        impartially and with equanimity. The Pali text quoted here is;</p>
        <i>
        <p>Cakkhunā rūpaṁ disvā neva sumano hoti na dummano, upekkhako 
        viharati, sato sampajāno</p>
        </i>
        <p>&quot;Having seen a visible form with the eye, the meditator remains 
        unaffected by it, neither glad nor unhappy. However beautiful or 
        attractive the sight is, the meditator does not feel excited and 
        jubilant over it; however ugly or repulsive the sight is, he remains 
        unperturbed. He maintains an equanimous attitude, mindful and clearly 
        comprehending.&quot;</p>
        <p>Taking note of everything seen, pleasant or unpleasant, and knowing 
        its real impermanent, suffering and not-self nature, and developing 
        neither liking nor aversion for it, the meditator views phenomena with 
        impartiality. He observes with detachment in order to know the 
        phenomenon of seeing, which is perishing every moment. The meditator who 
        has attained the stage of <i>saṅkhārupekkhā ñāṇa</i> understands 
        through personal experi-ence how this observation may take place. This 
        is how the phenomenon of seeing is observed with an equanimous attitude 
        of mind.</p>
        <p>The same thing holds true for all acts of hearing, smelling, knowing, 
        touching, and thinking, where observation is made with equanimity just 
        to know the respective phenomena. This ability to watch the events at 
        the six sense doors with unperturbed equanimity is known as <i>chalaṅgupekkhā</i>, 
        a virtue of the <i>Arahats</i>. But the ordinary worldling who has 
        attained to the stage of <i>saṅkhārupekkhā ñāṇa</i> can also 
        become accomplished in this way. According to the Commentary to the <i>Aṅguttara</i> 
        <i>Nikāya</i>, the meditator who has advanced to the stage of <i>udayabbaya 
        ñāṇ</i>a can be endowed with this <i>Arahat</i>-like virtue, but at 
        this stage the accomplishment is not very prominent. It becomes more 
        distinct at the <i>bhaṅga</i> stage and becomes well pronounced at the 
        <i>saṅkhārupekkhā</i> stage. Thus the meditator who has reached this 
        stage of develop-ment, sharing some of the virtues of an <i>Arahat</i>, 
        deserves high esteem and respect. Even if unknown to others, the 
        meditator himself, knowing personally his own virtue, may be well 
        pleased and gratified with his own progress and development.</p>
        <p><b>(3) Effortlessness</b></p>
        <p>The third characteristic is effortlessness in contemplation.</p>
        <i>
        <p>Saṅkhāra vicinane majjhattaṁ hutvā</i> says the <i>Visuddhimagga:</p>
        </i>
        <p>&quot;Taking a neutral attitude with regard to the practice of 
        contemplation.&quot;</p>
        <p>This is explained in the Sub-Commentary, which states that &quot;just 
        as mental equilibrium is maintained in the matter of <i>saṅkhārā</i> 
        as objects of contemplation, so also a neutral, balanced attitude should 
        be taken with regard to the practice of contemplation on them.&quot; At 
        the lower stages of development, the meditator has to make great efforts 
        for the appearance of the objects for contemplation and similar efforts 
        are needed to bring about contemplation on them. At the stage of <i>saṅkhārupekkhā</i> 
        <i>ñāṇa</i>, no special effort is needed for the appearance of 
        objects for contemplation. They appear of their own accord, one by one, 
        followed by effortless contemplation. The act of contemplation has 
        become a smooth, easy process.</p>
        <p>These are the three characteristics concerning equanimity and 
        balance. We shall go next to the three special characteristics of the <i>saṅkhārupekkhā 
        ñāṇa</i>.</p>
        <b>
        <p>(4) Lastingness</p>
        </b>
        <p>At the lower stages, it is not easy to keep the mind fixed on one 
        object, even for half an hour or an hour. At the <i>saṅkhārupekkhā</i> 
        level, the concentration may remain constant and steady for one, two or 
        three hours. This is within the experience of many of our meditators. It 
        is because of this characteristic that <i>saṅkhārupekkhā ñāṇa</i> 
        is defined by the <i>Paṭisambhidāmagga</i> as the <i>ñāṇa</i> 
        that lasts well. And the Sub-Commentary to the <i>Visuddhimagga </i>explains 
        that it means &quot;one long, continuous process of development.&quot; 
        Only when it lasts long it can be said to last well.</p>
        <b>
        <p>(5) Progressive growth in subtlety</p>
        </b>
        <p>The fifth characteristic is that of getting gradually finer and 
        subtler, just like sifting flour on the edge of a tray, as stated in the 
        <i>Visuddhimagga</i>. From the moment of its arising, <i>saṅkhārupekkhā 
        ñāṇa</i> is subtle, but as time passes it becomes still finer and 
        more subtle, and this phenomenon is within the experience of many of our 
        meditators.</p>
        <b>
        <p>(6) Non-dispersion</p>
        </b>
        <p>The last characteristic is that of non-dispersion. At the lower 
        levels, concentration is not strong, the mind is dispersed over many 
        objects, but at the level of <i>saṅkhārupekkhā ñāṇa</i>, the 
        mind is almost completely free of scattering or diffusion. Let alone 
        extraneous objects, the mind refuses to take in even those objects 
        appropriate for contemplation.</p>
        <p>On the <i>bhaṅga ñāṇa</i> level, the mind is directed over the 
        various parts of the body, and thus sensation of touch is felt in the 
        whole body. At this stage, however, dispersing the mind becomes 
        difficult; it remains fixed only on the few objects usually contemplated 
        on. Thus, from observing the whole body, the mind retracts and converges 
        only on four objects -- just knowing in sequence, rising, falling, 
        sitting and touching. Of these four objects, the sitting body may 
        disappear, leaving only three objects to be noted. Then the rising mind 
        falling may fade away, leaving only the touching. This cognition of 
        touching may disappear altogether, leaving just the knowing mind, which 
        is noted as &quot;knowing, knowing.&quot; At such time, it will be found 
        that whenever reflection is made on objects in which one is specially 
        interested, the mind does not stay on them for long, it reverts back to 
        the usual objects of contemplation. Thus it is said to be void of 
        dispersion. The Visuddhimagga description is <i>patiliyati patikutati na 
        sampasāriyati:</i> &quot;It retreats, retracts, and recoils; it does 
        not spread out.&quot; These are three signs or characteristics of <i>saṅkhārupekkhā 
        ñāṇa</i> which should be experienced personally by the meditator. If 
        these characteristic signs are not experienced, it means that one has 
        not yet developed this <i>ñāṇa.</p>
        </i>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">DEVELOPMENT OF VUṬṬHĀNAGĀMINĪ 
        VIPASSANĀ</font></b></p>
        <p>When <i>saṅkhārupekkhā ñāṇa</i> with these six 
        characteristics has become fully perfected, there appears a special kind 
        of knowledge which seems to occur very rapidly. This special kind of 
        cognition is known as <i>vuṭṭhānagāmiṇī vipassanā</i>. <i>Vuṭṭhāna</i> 
        means rising, getting up. <i>Vipassanā ñāṇa</i> is that knowledge 
        which dwells on the continual process of arising and ceasing formations 
        (mentality and corporeality). With each act of observation, the 
        attention falls on this continuous process of mentality and 
        corporeality. However, when insight into the Noble Path <i>(ariyamagga 
        ñāṇa)</i> is developed, the object of attention becomes the 
        cessation of mental and corporeal phenomena. This means that the mind 
        rises, or &quot;gets up&quot; from the continuous stream of mentality 
        and corporeality and its object becomes <i>Nibbāna</i>. For this reason 
        (&quot;getting up&quot;, turning away from the continuous stream of 
        mentality and corporeality) the Noble Path is known as <i>vuṭṭhāna</i>. 
        When this rapid <i>vipassanā</i> comes to an end, <i>Nibbāna</i> is 
        realized.</p>
        <p>Thus, in this special insight knowledge, the mind has gone over to 
        the Noble Path, having risen up from the safe which it previously 
        attended to; hence its name <i>vuṭṭhānagāminī.</p>
        </i>
        <p>This <i>vuṭṭhānagāminī vipassanā</i> arises while taking note 
        of one of the six consciousness, such as mind consciousness or touch 
        consciousness, which become manifest at that particular moment. While 
        the meditator contemplates the rapidly perishing phenomena, he perceives 
        the nature of impermanence, or he perceives the nature of 
        unsatisfactoriness, or the nature of non-self. This <i>vuṭṭhānagāminī</i> 
        rises at least two or three times; sometimes it may repeat four, five or 
        even ten times. As described in the texts, at the last moment of <i>vuṭṭhānagāminī</i>, 
        three thought moments -- <i>parikamma</i> (preparation), <i>upacāra </i>(approximation) 
        and <i>anuloma</i> (adaptation) -- of functional <i>javana</i> 
        (impulsion) appear, followed by one special moment of <i>kāmāvacara</i> 
        moral <i>javana</i>, which takes <i>Nibbāna</i>, where mental and 
        corporeal conditions cease, as its object. After that <i>javana</i> the 
        Noble Path arises, and the mind plunges into the object of <i>Nibbāna</i>, 
        void of mentality and corporeality, the cessation of all <i>saṅkhārā</i>. 
        Immediately after <i>magga javana</i> the <i>ariyaphala</i> (Noble 
        Fruit) <i>javana</i> arises two or three times. Its object is the same 
        as that of the Noble Path. With the occurrence of the Noble <i>magga</i> 
        and <i>phala</i> <i>javanas,</i> the ordinary common worldling attains 
        the status of a Stream Enterer; a Stream Enterer that of a Once 
        Returner; a Once Returner that of a Non-Returner; and a Non-Returner 
        finally becomes an <i>Arahat</i>.</p>
        <p>The wholesome impulsion <i>(kāmāvacara kusala javana)</i> which 
        takes <i>Nibbāna</i> as its object is known as <i>gotrabhū,</i> the 
        impulsion consciousness which overcomes the lineage of the ordinary 
        worldling. The <i>Paṭisambhidāmagga</i> defines <i>gotrabhū</i> as 
        follows:</p>
        <p>&quot;Rising from its objects of conditioned phenomena, which have 
        the characteristic of becoming, the mind has the tendency to plunge 
        headlong towards the object of <i>Nibbāna,</i> which is free from 
        becoming, and it is therefore called <i>gotrabhū.&quot;</i> Or, 
        &quot;Arising from its object of the continuous process of arising of 
        mentality and corporeality, the mind plunges headlong towards the object 
        of <i>Nibbāna</i>, free from the continuous process of becoming.&quot;</p>
        <p>The <i>Milindapañhā</i> states: &quot;The mind of the meditator who 
        is contemplating and taking note of one phenomenon after another, step 
        by step, overcomes the continuous stream of mentality and corporeality, 
        and plunges into the state where the stream of mentality and 
        corporeality comes to cessation.&quot;</p>
        <p>At first the meditator contemplates the ever-arising phenomena of 
        mentality and corporeality as manifested in the acts of thinking, 
        touching, hearing, seeing and so on. He perceives only a continuous and 
        apparently endless stream of mental and corporeal phenomena. While he is 
        thus contemplating on the endless phenomena of mentality and 
        corporeality and reflecting on their impermanence, suffering and 
        voidness of self, there comes a time, immediately after the last moment <i>(parikamma, 
        upacāra</i> and <i>anuloma)</i> of reflection, when the consciousness 
        suddenly inclines towards and descends into the state where all the 
        objects of contemplation and the contemplating mind come to complete 
        cessation. The inclining is towards <i>gotrabhū</i> consciousness 
        whereas the descending is the realization of <i>Nibbāna</i> by means of 
        Noble Path and Fruition. &quot;Oh, great King, the meditator having 
        practiced meditation in a correct manner, and plunging into where there 
        is cessation of the phenomena of mentality, is said to have realized <i>Nibbāna</i>.&quot; 
        This is the textual account of how <i>vuṭṭhānagāminī vipassanā </i>and 
        the Path and Fruition, are realized. Meditators have found this account 
        to be in conformity with what their personal experience.</p>
        <p>How the texts and experience conform: The meditator generally begins 
        by observing the consciousness of touch and thinking or acts of hearing, 
        seeing and so on; in short, contemplating on the nature of the five 
        groups of grasping.</p>
        <p>As stated earlier, at the <i>bhaṅga ñāṇa</i> stage, the 
        meditator constantly notes the rapid dissolution of mental and corporeal 
        phenomena and finds them to be dreadful, fearsome. This leads him to 
        regard them as baneful and disgusting.</p>
        <p>Wishing to be free of them, he strives harder till he reaches the 
        stage of <i>saṅkhārupekkhā ñāṇa</i>, when he views all things 
        with equanimity. When this <i>saṅkhār-upekkhā ñāṇa</i> is fully 
        perfected, there arise in him very fast moving and distinct <i>vuṭṭhānagāmirinī</i> 
        and <i>anuloma ñāṇas</i>, and the meditator descends into a state 
        that is completely void, where all objects and acts of contemplation 
        cease. This is the realization of <i>Nibbāna</i> by means of the Noble 
        Path and Fruition, elevating an ordinary worldling into the state of a 
        Stream Enterer; a Stream Enterer into that of a Once Returner; a Once 
        Returner into that of a Non-Returner and finally a Non-Returner into an 
        Arahat. The <i>Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta</i> gives the following 
        description of such transformations.</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>FROM DISTASTE TO NOBLE PATH AND FRUITION</b></font></p>
        <i>
        <p>Nibbindaṁ virajjati virāgā vimuccati</p>
        </i>
        <p>&quot;Being wearied, he becomes passion-free and the Noble Path is 
        developed. In his freedom from passion, and the Noble Path being 
        developed, he is emancipated from the outflows <i>(āsava)</i> and 
        defilements <i>(kilesa).&quot;</p>
        </i>
        <p>The meditator develops from the stage of <i>sammasana ñāṇa</i> to 
        that of <i>bhaṅga ñāṇa </i>by contemplating on the impermanent, 
        suffering and not-self nature of phenomena. The Blessed One was 
        referring to this development in the words <i>Evaṁ passaṁ -</i>- 
        &quot;Seeing thus&quot; -- in the above text. The stage from <i>bhaṅga</i> 
        to <i>saṅkhār-upekkhā</i> and anuloma was described as <i>&quot;nibbindati,&quot;</i> 
        feeling wearied or repulsed. Then comes <i>nibbindaṁ virajjati, 
        virāgā vimuccati:</i> &quot;when repulsed, he grows wearied; when 
        wearied, he becomes free from passion; when free from passion, he 
        becomes emancipated, to describe the develop-ment of the knowledge of 
        the Path and Fruition. A very concise description, perfectly matching 
        with the practical experience of meditators.</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>HOW THE EXPERIENCE AND DESCRIPTION MATCH</b></font></p>
        <p>As <i>saṅkhārupekkhā ñāṇa</i> gets stronger-, extra-ordinary 
        knowledge begins to rapidly appear. The meditator whose development of 
        the feeling of disgust is not yet strong enough to abandon mentality and 
        corporeality may be overtaken by anxiety: &quot;What is going to happen? 
        Am I about to die?&quot; If anxiety appears the concentration gets 
        weakened, but when the feeling of disenchantment is strong anxiety does 
        not arise, and the meditator continues to contemplate effortlessly and 
        smoothly. Soon he descends into the condition where there is freedom 
        from passion and attachment and complete cessation of all mental and 
        corporeal formations. This is emancipation from defilements and taints <i>(āsava).</p>
        </i>
        <p>When descending without any attachment into where there is cessation, 
        by means of the first Path <i>(sotāpattimagga),</i> the meditator 
        becomes liberated from the defilements of false views <i>(diṭṭhāsava),</i> 
        from ignorance which is associated with doubts and scepticism and from 
        the grosser forms of sense-desire which may lead to the <i>Nether</i> 
        regions. This is emancipation by virtue of Fruition of Stream Entry 
        which is the resultant of the Stream Entry Path.</p>
        <p>When descending to where there is cessation by means of the second 
        Path, Once Returner, there is freedom from the gross types of sense 
        desires. When descending to where there is cessation by means of the 
        third Path, the Non-Returner, one becomes free from subtle types of 
        sense-desires as well as from similarly fine types of ignorance. With 
        the attainment of Arahatship <i>(arahattamagga ñāṇa),</i> there is 
        the liberation from all kinds of defilements. This is in accordance with 
        the statement <i>virāgā vimuccati</i>. When free from passions and 
        descending to cessation, there arises emancipation by virtue of 
        Fruition, which is the result of the Path. This emancipation is 
        perceived vividly by a process of reflection.</p>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">REFLECTION OF AN ARAHAT</font></b></p>
        <p>The process of reflection in an <i>Arahat</i> is described in the 
        concluding words of the <i>Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta:</p>
        </i><b>
        <p>Vimuttasmiṁ vimuttamīti ñāṇaṁ hoti &quot;khīnā jāti 
        vusitaṁ brahmacariyaṁ kataṁ karaṇīyaṁ nāparaṁ 
        ittattāyā'ti pajāñātīti.</p>
        </b><i>
        <p>&quot;When emancipated, the knowledge arises on reflection that 
        freedom from defilements has been achieved, and he knows, ‘Birth is 
        exhausted; lived is the Holy Life (of contemplation and meditation), 
        what has to be done has been done, there is nothing more to be done.' He 
        knows thus by reflection.&quot;</p>
        </i>
        <p>This is how an <i>Arahat</i> reflects back on his attainment. Here it 
        may be asked, &quot;How does he know that birth is exhausted?&quot;</p>
        <p>So long as there is wrong view and illusion with regard to the mental 
        and corporeal aggregates and attachment to them as permanent, 
        satisfactory, and self, there will be renewal of becoming in the cycle 
        of existence. When one becomes free of wrong views and illusions, one is 
        also free of attachment. The <i>Arahat</i> knows on reflection that he 
        is free of wrong view and illusion with regard to the aggregates and 
        that he has no more attachments for them. Therefore he knows that birth 
        is exhausted for him. This is reflecting on the defilements which have 
        been discarded and exhausted.</p>
        <p>Here, &quot;Holy Life&quot; means the practice of morality, 
        concentration, and wisdom <i>(sīla, samādhi, paññā)</i>. Keeping 
        the precepts or developing concentration, however, will not in 
        themselves achieve the highest goals. These are achieved only by taking 
        note of mental and corporeal phenomena as they occur until attainment of 
        the Path and Fruition. Therefore it must be taken that &quot;the Holy 
        Life is lived&quot; means that meditation has been practiced to the 
        attainment of the highest goal.</p>
        <p>&quot;What was to be done&quot; means practicing meditation so as to 
        fully comprehend the Four Noble Truths. This task is accomplished with 
        the attainment of <i>arahattamagga.</i> Even after having personally 
        seen the nature of cessation by means of the three lower Paths and 
        having known the Truth of Suffering, which is the same as knowing the 
        nature of impermanence, suffering and not-self, certain illusions, such 
        as the illusions of perception and illusions of consciousness, still 
        remain to be eradicated. Because of them, there is still delight, 
        craving and belief in conditions as pleasurable and enjoyable. The 
        origin of craving has not yet been abandoned. So, even for the 
        Non-Returner there is still fresh becoming. At the stage of <i>arahattamagga</i>, 
        the Truth of Suffering is fully and well comprehended. All illusions of 
        perception and consciousness are eradicated. Since there are no more 
        illusions, there are no misconceptions about delight and enjoyment, and 
        no opportunity for the cause of craving to arise, as it is completely 
        eradicated. The task of knowing the Four Noble Truths is fully 
        accomplished. That is why he reflects that there is nothing more to be 
        done.</p>
        <p>In this account of the <i>Arahat's</i> reflection, there is no direct 
        mention of reflection on the Path, Fruition, <i>Nibbāna</i> and the 
        defilements, but it should be taken that they are reflected on first, 
        followed by reflection on the other subjects. Thus it should be taken 
        that the reflection &quot;The Holy Life is lived out, what has to be 
        done is done&quot; followed on from reflection on the Path, Fruition and 
        <i>Nibbāna</i>. &quot;The mind is free, birth is exhausted&quot; is 
        reflected on only after the reflection on the defilements which have 
        been eradicated. Accounts of reflection by the Stream Enterer, the Once 
        Returner and the Non-Retumer are given in my discourse on the <i>Sīlavanta 
        Sutta.</p>
        </i>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">RECAPITULATION</font></b></p>
        <p>&quot;Being wearied, he becomes passion free and the Noble Path 
        arises. Being freed from passion, and the Path arisen in him, he is 
        emancipated from the bonds of defilements. With emancipation comes the 
        reflection that the mind has become free, and he knows: ‘Birth is 
        exhausted; the Holy Life is lived; what has to be done is done, there is 
        no more of this becoming'.&quot;</p>
        <p>The Venerable Theras who recited the <i>Sutta</i> at the Council 
        recorded the following terminal passage:</p>
        <b>
        <p>Idamavoca Bhagavā attamanā pañcavaggiyā bhikkhū Bhagavato 
        bhāsitaṁ abhinanduṁ. Imasmiñca pana veyyā karaṇasmiṁ bhaññamāne 
        pañca-vaggiyānaṁ bhikkhūnaṁ anupādāya āsavehi cittāni vimucciṁsūti.</p>
        </b><i>
        <p>&quot;Thus the Blessed One spoke. Pleased, the Group of Five monks 
        were delighted with the exposition of the Blessed One. Moreover, as this 
        exposition was being spoken (or just at the end of this discourse), the 
        minds of the Group of Five were freed of attachments and became 
        emancipated from defilements.&quot;</p>
        </i>
        <p>Amongst the Group of Five, the Venerable Koṇḍañña became a 
        Stream Enterer on the first watch of the full moon of July while 
        listening to the discourse on the Turning of the Wheel of <i>Dhamma</i> <i>(Dhammacakkap-pavattana 
        Sutta).</i> He must have continued with the contemplation and 
        meditation, but he did not attain <i>Arahatship</i> until he heard the <i>Anattalakkhaṇa 
        Sutta.</i> Venerable Vappa become a Stream Enterer on the first waning 
        day of July, the Venerable Bhaddiya on the second, the Venerable Mahānāma 
        on the third and the Venerable Assaji on the fourth waning day of July 
        respectively. All five of them, Stream Enterers at the time of listening 
        to this <i>Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta</i>, contemplated on the five 
        aggregates as &quot;This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my 
        self&quot;; impermanent, suffering and not-self. They attained to the 
        three higher stages of knowledge, step by step and became <i>Arahats</i>. 
        According to the Commentary to the <i>Paṭisambhidā</i>, they gained <i>Arahatship</i> 
        just at the end of the discourse by reflecting on the reaching.</p>
        <p>It was in the year 103 of the great Era. Counting back from this year 
        (1963) it was 2,552 years ago. That year, on the fifth waning day of 
        July, at the completion of the discourse on the <i>Anattalakkhaṇa 
        Sutta</i>, there appeared six <i>Arahats</i>, including the Blessed One, 
        in the human world. It is very inspiring to visualize this scene at the 
        Deer Sanctuary near Vārānasī, with the Blessed One teaching the <i>Anattalakkhaṇa 
        Sutta</i> and the Group of Five monks, listening attentively and 
        attaining to <i>Arahatship</i>, the cessation of all defilements. Let us 
        try to visualize this scene.</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>HOMAGE TO THE SIX ARAHATS</b></font></p>
        <p>Two thousand five hundred and fifty two years ago, on the fifth 
        waning day of July, the Blessed One gave the discourse on the<i> 
        Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta</i> to the Group of Five monks. Listening to the 
        discourse and contemplating on the teaching, all five monks became freed 
        from defilements and attained to <i>Arahatship</i>.</p>
        <p>We pay reverential homage with raised hands, palms together, to the 
        All Enlightened One and the Group of Five, who were the first six <i>Arahats</i>,

        arising as &quot;not mine, not me, not my self,&quot; and perceiving 
        them rightly and well as incessantly arising and ceasing, as
