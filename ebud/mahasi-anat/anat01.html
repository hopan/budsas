        </i>
        <p><font size="6">A</font>ll teachings or beliefs outside of the 
        Buddha's Dispensation fall under the category of beliefs in a self, <i>attā</i>. 
        They hold to the view that there is such a thing as a soul, a living 
        entity, which actually resides in all living creatures.</p>
        <p>In the midst of the world holding fast to notions of self or soul the 
        Buddha declared, &quot;<i>Attā</i>, soul or living entity, is not a 
        reality; it is only a conventional nomencla-ture. What really exists, in 
        the ultimate sense, is a continuous flux of corporeal and mental 
        processes, impersonal phenomena.&quot;</p>
        <p>It is essential to thoroughly and comprehensively understand <i>anattā</i>, 
        the doctrine of impersonality propounded by the Buddha. He first touched 
        on the doctrine in his elaboration of the Four Noble Truths in the <i>Dhammacakka 
        Sutta</i>. He touched on it again when he taught the <i>Hemavata Sutta</i>, 
        explaining that &quot;with the arising of the six sense bases, (eye, 
        ear, nose, tongue, body, mind) there arises a world, a being.&quot; Then 
        the Buddha brought forth the doctrine of not-self explicitly and 
        comprehensively in this <i>Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta.</p>
        </i>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">THE SUTTA INTRODUCTION</font></b></p>
        <p>The introduction to the <i>Sutta</i> was recorded by the Elders of 
        the First Council in the <i>Khandhavagga</i> of the <i>Saṁyutta 
        Nikāya</i> of the Pāli Canon, in these words:</p>
        <b><i>
        <p>Evamme sutaṁ. Ekaṁ samayaṁ</i> <i>Bhagavā Bārāṇasiyaṁ 
        viharati</i> <i>Isipatane Migadāye. Tatra kho bhagavā pañcavaggiye 
        bhikkhū āmantesi, 'Bhikkhavo' ti. 'Bhadante' ti te bhikkhū Bhagavato 
        paccassosuṁ.</i> <i>Bhagavā etadavoca.</p>
        </i></b><i>
        <p>&quot;I, Ānanda, have heard thus,&quot;</i> began the Venerable 
        Ānanda, <i>&quot;At one time, the most Exalted One was staying in the 
        Pleasance of Isipatana, the Deer Sanctuary, near the township of 
        Varanasi.&quot;</p>
        </i>
        <p>The <i>Dhammacakka Sutta</i>, the First Discourse, was delivered on 
        the evening of the full moon day of July, 2,552 years ago. At that time, 
        only one of the Group of Five [*], Venerable Koṇḍañña, attained 
        the first stage of Higher Knowledge and became a <i>Sotāpanna</i>, a 
        Stream Enterer. Having fully penetrated into the <i>Dhamma</i>, with 
        firmly established confidence and unshakable faith in the Buddha's 
        Teaching, he sought and gained admission into the Order <i>(Saṅgha).</p>
        </i>
        <p>[* The Group of Five were the five ascetics who had previously 
        followed the Bodhisatta while he was practicing austerities and who 
        later heard the<b> </b>First Discourse and became the Buddha's first 
        monk disciples.]</p>
        <p>The remaining four monks, the Venerables Vappa, Bhaddiya, Mahānāma 
        and Assaji, had not yet achieved that Higher Knowledge, so the Blessed 
        One urged them to devote themselves to the strenuous practice of <i>Dhamma</i> 
        under his personal guidance. They did not go out, even for alms round. 
        The Blessed One himself also stayed in the monastery to attend to their 
        progress and assist them in removing the obstacles, hindrances and 
        impurities that arise in the course of meditation practice. Thus, 
        instructed and guided by the Blessed One, and striving arduously and 
        consistently, the Venerable Vappa attained the Path and Fruition on the 
        first waning day of July; the Venerable Bhaddiya on the 2nd, the 
        Venerable Mahānāma on the 3rd and the Venerable Assaji on the 4th 
        respectively, and each of them became a Stream Enterer.</p>
        <p>I have already dealt elaborately with the account of their 
        attainments in the concluding portions of the discourses on the <i>Dhammacakka 
        Sutta</i> [See <i>The Great Discourse on the Wheel of Dhamma</i>, by 
        Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw, translated by U Ko Lay; Buddhadhamma 
        Foundation.] I stated there that the four monks other than Koṇḍañña 
        were not accomplished enough to attain the Higher Knowledge by just 
        listening to the discourse, but had to strive for it, and that is why 
        the Blessed One wanted them to devote themselves to the practice of the <i>Dhamma</i>. 
        In view of this fact, I warned against being led astray by the mistaken 
        and irresponsible doctrine that the status of Stream Enterer can be 
        attained without the effort of <i>vipassanā</i> meditation, just by 
        listening to a discourse.</p>
        <p>The Commentaries say that after all five monks had become Stream 
        Enterers and received ordination as members of the Buddha's Order, the 
        Buddha taught them the <i>Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta</i> on the 5th waning 
        day of July. Thus, &quot;at one time&quot; in the introduction means the 
        5th waning day of July, while the Blessed One was still staying in the 
        Deer Sanctuary near the town of Varanasi.</p>
        <p>&quot;At that time, when the Blessed One was staying in the Deer 
        Sanctuary in the township of Varanasi, the Blessed One addressed the 
        Group of Five monks, 'O monks,' and the Group of Five monks answered, 
        'Revered Sir.' Then the Blessed One taught thus:</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>THE BUDDHA'S WORDS: BEGINNING THE SUTTA</b></font></p>
        <b><i>
        <p>Rūpaṁ bhikkhave</i> <i>anattā. Rūpañca hidaṁ bhikkhave attā 
        abhavissa nayidam rūpaṁ ābādhāya</i> <i>saṁvatteyya</i>; <i>labbhetha 
        ca rūpe evaṁ me rūpaṁ hotu, evaṁ me rūpaṁ mā ahosīti.</p>
        </i></b><i>
        <p>&quot;Monks, rūpa, the material body, is not self, soul or living 
        entity.&quot;</p>
        </i>
        <p>People in general see themselves and others as living entities, each 
        with a soul, self or ego, called in Pāli <i>attā</i>, corresponding 
        with the Sanskrit word <i>ātman</i>. <i>Attā</i> is also known as <i>jīva</i>, 
        life; thus <i>attā</i> conveys the concept of life, soul or living 
        entity. Holding the view that there exists a soul or a<b> </b>living 
        entity in man is known as the misconception or wrong belief in self <i>(attādiṭṭhi).</p>
        </i>
        <p>Ordinary worldlings are not free from this wrong belief in self; the 
        only difference from person to person lies in how firmly it is held and 
        how plainly it manifests. The <i>vipassanā</i> meditator who is 
        developing keen insight into the physical and mental processes, and 
        contemplating the fact that there is no self or living entity, is free 
        from that wrong notion of self, but only for the duration of his noting 
        the arising and passing away of corporeality and mentality. The 
        misconception of self is likely to return.</p>
        <p>In order to remove this misconception of self and make it clear that 
        there is no such thing as soul or living entity in the physical and 
        mental constituents, either of one's own body or in the bodies of 
        others, the Blessed One began the discourse with the statement, <i>&quot;Rūpaṁ</i> 
        <i>bhikkhave anattā :</i> Material form <i>(rūpa)</i> monks, is not 
        self, soul or living entity.&quot;</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>MISTAKING BODY FOR SELF</b></font></p>
        <p>What is this material form which we wrongly conceive as self? The 
        following material qualities form the foundation of a material form: the 
        sensitive part of the eye which enables us to see objects; the sensitive 
        part of the ear which enables us to hear sounds; the sensitive part of 
        the nose which enables us to smell odors; the sensitive part of the 
        tongue which enables us to sample tastes; the sensitive part of the body 
        which enables us to feel touch; the &quot;heart-base&quot; <i>(hadāya 
        vatthu),</i> that is, the seat of consciousness; and the material 
        quality of the life-principle or vital force.</p>
        <p>Careful consideration reveals that eye consciousness arises because 
        of the sensory organ of the eye; and with eye consciousness comes the 
        concept of a living entity or self. Similarly, because of the sensory 
        organs of the ear, nose, tongue, and body we have the consciousness of 
        hearing, smelling, tasting and touching. The heart base, the seat of 
        consciousness, is responsible for thoughts and thinking, resulting in 
        the notion of self or living entity. The life principle is the vital 
        force which vivifies all material bodies and preserves them from decay 
        and decomposition. This life principle, which is just a material 
        quality, is wrongly believed to be a soul, a living entity.</p>
        <p>In the absence of the sensory organs there is no such thing as soul 
        or living entity. Consider, for instance, a wooden figure of a<b> </b>man, 
        which resembles a living person in appearance but has none of the sense 
        organs that give rise to cognition. It could never be mistaken for a 
        living being with a soul or a living entity. Likewise we do not conceive 
        notions of a soul or a living entity with respect to a corpse, as there 
        are no functional sensory organs within it. So long as<b> </b>the 
        sensitive qualities exist, other material bodies which are their 
        adjuncts and concomitants, such as sights, sounds, odors, the 
        tangibility (of the<i> </i>earth <i>[paṭhavī]</i> , fire <i>[tejo], </i>and 
        air <i>[vāyo] </i>elements), moistness and fluidity (of the element of 
        cohesion <i>[āpo])</i> felt by the sense of touch, and the material 
        qualities of sex responsible for masculinity and femininity, are also 
        wrongly conceived as self. Material qualities such as sight, sound and 
        odor, which are concomitant with the sensory organs of the eye, ear and 
        nose, are misconceived as soul or living entities when seen, heard and 
        smelt. In short, the whole material world which coexists with sensory 
        awareness is regarded in terms of living entities.</p>
        <p>In common speech, too, the body which is compounded of the material 
        qualities is spoken of as self. To talk this way is not wrong, it 
        conforms to the convention of the world, but from the point of view of 
        ultimate, absolute reality, none of the material substances of the body 
        is self. They are merely aggregates of matter, or material qualities. 
        That is why the Blessed One clearly and explicitly stated that 
        &quot;although people view the aggregates of material qualities as a 
        living being, in reality they are not self, they are merely physical 
        phenomena.&quot;</p>
        <p>Exponents of the doctrine of self, however, who hold that their body 
        is self, are bound to come up with the question, &quot;Why is it not 
        self?&quot; The Blessed One provided the following explanation:</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>WHY BODY IS NOT SELF</b></font></p>
        <i>
        <p>&quot;Monks, if the body were self, the core of our being, then it 
        would not tend to affliction or distress, and one</i> <i>should be able 
        to say of it, 'Let my body be thus (in the best of conditions); let my 
        body not be thus (in a bad condition).' It should be possible to 
        influence the body in this manner.&quot;</p>
        </i>
        <p>Were the body the core of one's being, or self, it would not cause 
        suffering, but actually the body does impose suffering in many ways. It 
        does not remain youthful and vigorous, it grows old and decays, and it 
        dies. Without the body, one would be free from the afflictions of going 
        grey, becoming toothless, hunchbacked, deaf, near-sighted, wrinkled and 
        infirm. It is the body that inflicts these sufferings.</p>
        <p>Again, because of the body, one is troubled with pain -- eye 
        diseases, ear diseases, toothache, backache, flatulence, feelings of 
        heat, coldness, pain and itching -- and with diseases of the blood, 
        skin, stomach or urine. These ailments arise because of the body. We 
        suffer from hunger and thirst because of the body, and because of it we 
        are subjected to attack by mosquitoes and other antagonists. Suffering 
        in the miserable and woeful states is also due to the body. In short, 
        one suffers from all these ailments and afflictions because of the body.</p>
        <p>In addition, the body is responsible for the phenomenon of death in 
        human existence. When the material qualities in the body undergo 
        deterioration and decay, death occurs. It may be said, therefore, that 
        the physical form inflicts suffering by causing death.</p>
        <p>Thus we can reflect that if the physical form were self, it would not 
        inflict on us the sufferings of old age, disease and death. One might 
        cause suffering to others but not to oneself. If the body were self, it 
        should not inflict suffering on itself by bringing about old age and so 
        on.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, even before the onset of old age, disease and death, the 
        body is constantly subjecting us to many forms of distress. Even young 
        people, who are relatively free from illness and enjoy good health, 
        cannot remain long in any one of the body postures, such as sitting, 
        standing or walking. They have to change postures very often. We have 
        all experienced how hard it is to remain in any one body posture. We 
        find it difficult to remain seated for half an hour or one hour without 
        changing posture, or to lie down for two or three hours without moving. 
        We are constantly having to change postures because of the feelings of 
        heat or pain that arise in the limbs after a certain time in one 
        position. All this distress arises because of the physical form; in 
        other words, it is the body that is inflicting it.</p>
        <p>Thus we may reflect that if the body were self, it would not impose 
        these sufferings on us.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, it is stated, &quot;if the body were self it should be 
        possible to say of it, 'let my body be thus, let my body not be 
        thus'.&quot;</p>
        <p>All beings would like to see their bodies always healthy and youthful 
        in appearance, to keep them from old age, illness, decay and death. But 
        the material body is never obliging; it refuses to be subject to one's 
        will. Its fresh youthfulness fades into aged debility, its robust health 
        declines against one's will into illness and disease and finally 
        dissolution and death.</p>
        <p>If the body were self it would not inflict suffering on us, and it 
        should be possible to subject it to our will. While others may not be 
        amenable to one's control, it should at least be possible to manage our 
        own body as we desire. But the fact of the matter is that the body is 
        not self. That is why it inflicts suffering on us and refuses to be 
        controlled. The Blessed One continued to explain this fact.</p>
        <b><i>
        <p>Yasmā ca kho, bhikkhave, rūpaṁ anattā, tasmā rūpaṁ 
        ābādhāya saṁvattati, na ca labbhati rūpe evaṁ me rūpaṁ hotu, 
        evaṁ me rūpaṁ mā ahosī'ti.</p>
        </i></b>
        <p>&quot;<i>Monks, in fact, the body is not self. Since it is not self, 
        it tends to affliction and distress, and it is not possible to say of 
        the body, ‘Let it be thus, let it not be thus.' It is not possible to 
        influence and manage the body in this manner.&quot;</p>
        </i>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">JĪVA ATTĀ AND PARAMA ATTĀ</font></b></p>
        <p>Believers in the doctrines of self say that self is of two kinds: <i>jīva 
        attā</i> and <i>parama attā</i>. According to them, each individual 
        creature, man, <i>deva, </i>or animal, has a self, an inner soul or 
        substance called <i>jīva attā</i>, the life principle. This life 
        principle is usually believed to be created by God, but some believers 
        hold that these individual <i>jīvā attā</i> are small segments of the 
        bigger <i>attā</i> of God.</p>
        <i>
        <p>Parama attā</i> is the &quot;Big Self&quot; of God, who has created 
        the world together with all its creatures. According to some, this Big 
        Self permeates the whole world, but<b> </b>others say it lies in a 
        Heavenly Abode. These ideas of small self and Big Self are all, of 
        course, mere speculation. Nobody has met or seen the God which is the 
        embodiment of the Big Self.</p>
        <p>Belief in creation by God had existed long before the appearance of 
        the enlightened Buddha. This is clear from the story of Baka the Brahma.</p>
        <p>At one time, the Blessed One went to the realm of the Brahmas for the 
        purpose of clearing up the wrong views held by the great Brahma Baka.</p>
        <p>On arrival there, the great Brahma Baka welcomed the Blessed One to 
        his realm, in praise of which he said, &quot;Welcome, Venerable Gotama; 
        your coming is good, although it has taken a long time. This Brahma land 
        is permanent, stable, everlasting, perfect in every way. And no one dies 
        or passes away from here.&quot;</p>
        <p>For this statement, the Blessed One rebuked the Brahma Baka in these 
        words: &quot;Oh, Brahmas, how ignorant is Brahma Baka! In ignorance, he 
        describes his imper-manent realm to be permanent and stable.&quot;</p>
        <p>At this, one of the followers of Brahma Baka said indignantly,</p>
        <p>&quot;Monk Gotama, do not rebuke Brahma Baka, do not rebuke him. This 
        Brahma Baka is the Great Brahma, chief of the Brahmas, Conqueror over 
        All, Invincible; he sees all; he wields power and authority over every 
        creature; he is the maker of the world, creator of the whole world, the 
        noblest one; Assigner to each -- king, Brahmin, man, Deva, or animal -- 
        his station in this world; accomplished in attainments, the Father of 
        all past and future beings!&quot;</p>
        <p>Thus did he praise the virtues of Brahma Baka.</p>
        <p>In the <i>Brahmajāla Sutta</i>, where the origin of the wrong view 
        of permanency was explained, the Buddha gave a similar account of the 
        Brahma.</p>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">ORIGIN OF THE CREATION BELIEF</font></b></p>
        <p>According to that <i>Sutta</i>, after a world system has passed away, 
        there comes a time when a new world system begins evolving. The first 
        Brahma who appears then thinks: &quot;I am the Brahma, the Great Brahma, 
        Conqueror Invincible, Seer of All, All-powerful, the Lord, the Maker, 
        the Creator, the Noblest of All, Assigner to each his station, 
        accomplished in attainments, the Father of all past and future 
        beings.&quot;</p>
        <p>The Brahmas who appear later also think that he is the Great Brahma. 
        Of those Brahmas who pass away from the Brahma realm to be reborn in the 
        human world, there are some who can recall their past existence in the 
        Brahma realm. These people boldly announce that &quot;the Great Brahma 
        created the beings in the world. The Creator himself, the great Brahma, 
        is permanent, eternal; the creatures he has created, however, do not 
        last permanently; they pass away and die.&quot; These bold 
        announcements, given on personal experience, are readily believed and 
        accepted by those who hear them. The Blessed One explained that thus was 
        the origination of the notion that &quot;only the Creator of things is 
        permanent, eternal.&quot;</p>
        <p>From the passages we have just quoted, one can surmise that the 
        so-called God who is said to have created all beings, the God who is 
        said to be in Heaven, could be the great Brahma who first appeared in 
        the realm of the Brahmas at the beginning of the world. We could also 
        take it that the <i>parama attā</i>, the Big Self, is the self of that 
        great Brahma. Then it becomes clear from the teachings of the Buddha 
        that the <i>parama attā</i>, Big Self, of the great Brahma is basically 
        the same as <i>jīva attā, </i>the life principle, of other beings; it 
        is just a misconception of the continuous flux of material and mental 
        processes. Actually, there is no such thing as self apart from the 
        psycho-physical phenomena; it is a figment of the imagination.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the mental and physical properties of the great Brahma 
        are, like the mental and physical properties of other beings, subject to 
        the law of impermanence. When his life span becomes exhausted, the great 
        Brahma also faces death and has to pass away. In reality, the great 
        Brahma cannot have every wish fulfilled; he cannot maintain the physical 
        properties of his body according to his wish. Therefore, the body of the 
        great Brahma is also not self, <i>anattā.</p>
        </i>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>ATTACHMENT TO SELF</b></font></p>
        <p>In general, people hold on to the belief that there is an individual 
        soul, a living entity which lasts for the duration of the life span. 
        This is the view held by the annihilationists who maintain that there is 
        nothing after death. The etemalists, however, believe that the 
        individual soul remains undestroyed after death, living on in new 
        bodies, never perishing.</p>
        <p>According to the eternalists, the body of a being is made up of two 
        parts: the gross body and the subtle body. At the end of each existence, 
        when death ensues, the gross body is destroyed but the subtle body 
        departs from it to enter into a new body. Thus it remains eternal and 
        never perishes. This etemalist view, as described in their literature, 
        has been reproduced in full in the Sub-Commentary to the <i>Visuddhimagga</i>.</p>
        <p>I have given a detailed description of the various beliefs in self 
        and their origination in order to present more clearly the concept of <i>anattā</i>, 
        not-self. Among those who profess to be Buddhists, there are many who 
        actually do believe in the existence of a soul or a living entity, even 
        though they do not say so in so many words. They believe that at the 
        moment of death life departs via the nose or mouth. When conception 
        takes place in the womb, life enters through the mother's nose, her 
        mouth or her abdomen. And from birth to death, the life principle 
        remains steadfastly in the new body. All these views relate to a belief 
        in the existence of a soul, a living entity.</p>
        <p>In reality, death is simply the cessation of psycho-physical 
        processes, the non-arising of new mentality and corporeality after the 
        termination of the &quot;death consciousness.&quot;</p>
        <p>There is no such thing as a departing soul or living entity. A new 
        becoming means the arising of new consciousness at a new site together 
        with the physical base on which it finds its support. just before 
        death-consciousness terminates at the moment of death, consciousness 
        holds on to either <i>kamma, kamma nimitta</i> <i>(kamma</i>-image) or <i>gati 
        nimitta</i> (destination-image). Conditioned by these objects (held on 
        to at the last moment of consciousness), a new consciousness arises at a 
        new site in a new existence. This is called rebirth or re-linking 
        consciousness, as it forms a link between the previous and the next 
        existence. When the re-linking consciousness passes away, it is followed 
        by the life-continuum <i>(bhavaṅga)</i> consciousness, which continues 
        throughout life as prescribed by previous <i>karmic</i> energy. When 
        sense-objects such as sights and sounds appear at the sense-doors, the <i>bhavaṅga</i> 
        consciousness is<b> </b>replaced, for the respective moments, by 
        eye-consciousness and ear-consciousness, as the case may be.</p>
        <p>The arising of new consciousness in a new existence as conditioned by 
        the <i>kamma</i> of past existences is conventionally called migration 
        from an old existence to a new one, but in reality, there is no soul or 
        living entity which transmigrates from one existence to another.</p>
        <p>There are people who cannot grasp the concept of nonself because they 
        do not understand the theory of self in detail as explained above. They 
        think that if someone holds on to the shape and form of objects, it is 
        clinging to self. For instance, to recognize a tree as a tree, a stone 
        as a stone, a house as a house, or a monastery as a monastery, is, 
        according to them, clinging to self. In their view, the truth of 
        not-self is clearly grasped only when the concepts of shape and form are 
        transcended and replaced by perception of ultimate truth.</p>
        <p>In fact, merely perceiving forms and shapes does not amount to 
        self-clinging. Neither does no longer perceiving shapes and forms mean 
        that knowledge of not-self is established. Recognizing inanimate 
        objects, such as trees, stones, houses or monasteries, is not clinging 
        to the self-theory, it is merely apprehending in terms of conventional 
        concepts.</p>
        <p>Clinging to belief in self is assuming that sentient beings have an 
        intrinsic self. When one assumes oneself to be a living soul, or others 
        to be living entities, then one is attaching to the belief in self.</p>
        <p>The Brahma beings of the immaterial realms <i>(arūpa),</i> having no 
        material body, do not perceive themselves in conventional shapes and 
        forms, but those Brahma beings that are unenlightened are not free from 
        the distorted view of self. It is only when belief in the existence of a 
        self is discarded, and one's own and other's bodies are perceived as 
        merely psycho-physical phenomena, that knowledge of nonself arises, and 
        it is essential to develop this true knowledge.</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>FOUR KINDS OF SELF CLINGING</b></font></p>
        <p>There are four kinds of self clinging arising out of belief in self:</p>
        <p>1) <i>Sāmi attā </i>(&quot;controlling self') clinging: believing 
        that there is a living entity inside one's body who governs and directs 
        every wish and action, that it is this living soul which goes, stands up<b>,</b> 
        sits down, sleeps, and speaks whenever it wishes to.</p>
        <p>The Blessed One taught the <i>Anattatakkhaṇa Sutta</i> particularly 
        for removing this <i>sāmi attā</i> clinging. Now, as this <i>Sutta</i> 
        was taught to the Group of Five, who had already become Stream Enterers, 
        may it not be asked whether a Stream Enterer is still encumbered with 
        self clinging?</p>
        <p>At the stage of Stream Entry the fetters of personality-belief <i>(sakkāyadiṭṭhi), 
        </i>doubt<i> (vicikicchā), </i>and adherence to rites and rituals <i>(sīlabbataparāmasa)</i> 
        have been completely eradicated, but a Stream Enterer is not yet free 
        from <i>asmi-māna</i>, the I-conceit. To take pride in one's ability, 
        one's status -- &quot;I can do; I am noble&quot; -- is conceit. (A 
        Stream Enterer's conceit relates only to the genuine qualities and 
        virtues he or she actually possesses, it is not false pride based on 
        non-existing qualities and virtues). The Stream Enterer has, therefore, 
        to continue with the practice of insight in order to remove the fetter 
        of conceit. When insight knowledge <i>(vipassanāñāṇa)</i> is 
        considerably developed, this I-conceit becomes attenuated and is 
        partially removed by the Path of Once Returner <i>(Sakadāgāmi)</i>; 
        the Path of Non-Returner <i>(Anāgāmi)</i> further weakens it, but it 
        is only the final <i>Arahatta</i> Path that completely eradicates the 
        I-conceit. Thus we may take it that the Blessed One taught the <i>Anattalakkhaṇa 
        Sutta</i> in order to bring about total eradication of the I-conceit 
        lingering in the Group of Five.</p>
        <p>2) <i>Nivāsī attā </i>(&quot;continuous self') clinging: belief 
        that there is a living entity permanently residing in one's body.</p>
        <p>Most people believe that they exist permanently as living beings from 
        the moment of birth to the time of death. This is <i>nivāsī-attā</i> 
        clinging. Some hold that nothing remains after death; this is the wrong 
        view of' annihilationism. Yet others believe in the wrong view of 
        eternalism, which maintains that the living entity in the body remains 
        undestroyed after death and continues to reside in a new body in a new 
        existence. It was with clinging to the I-conceit in mind that the 
        Blessed One taught the <i>Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta</i>. That is to say, to 
        eradicate the I-conceit which still remained fettering the Group of Five 
        monks and other Noble Ones; and to remove the two wrong views (of self <i>sakkāyadiṭṭhi', 
        </i>and attachment to rites and rituals <i>sīlabbataparāmāsa)</i> as 
        well as the I-conceit of ordinary common worldlings.</p>
        <p>So long as we cling to the belief that there is a permanent living 
        entity or a soul, we hold that our body is amenable to our control. The <i>Anattalakkhaṇa</i> 
        <i>Sutta</i> was delivered to remove not only the <i>sāmi attā</i> 
        clinging but also the <i>nivāsī attā</i> clinging. Once the <i>sāmi 
        attā</i> clinging is removed, other types of self clinging and wrong 
        views are simultaneously eradicated.</p>
        <p>3) <i>Kāraka attā</i> (&quot;active agent self&quot;) clinging: 
        belief that there is a living entity, a soul, that effects every action, 
        physical, vocal and mental.</p>
        <p>This <i>kāraka attā</i> clinging is more concerned with <i>saṅkhārakkhandha</i>, 
        the aggregate of volitional formations. We shall deal with it more fully 
        when we come to the aggregate of volitional formations.</p>
        <p>4) <i>Vedaka attā </i>(&quot;experiencing self&quot;) clinging: 
        belief that it is self which feels sensations, pleasant or unpleasant. 
        This form of clinging is concerned with the <i>vedanak-khandha</i>, the 
        aggregate of feelings, which we will take up fully in the next chapter.</p>
        <p>That the aggregate of materiality is not self or a living entity has 
        been adequately expounded, but it still remains to explain how 
        meditators practicing <i>vipassanā</i> meditation come to perceive the 
        nonself and uncontrollable nature of the body.</p>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">CONTEMPLATION OF NONSELF IN RELATION TO THE 
        BODY</font></b></p>
        <i>
        <p>Vipassanā</i> meditation consists of contemplating the <i>upādānakkhandha</i>, 
        the groups of grasping which manifest at the moment of seeing, hearing, 
        smelling, tasting, touching and thinking. For new meditators, however, 
        it is hard to take note of each and every instance of sensory activity. 
        They must start their practice with only a few of the most prominent 
        objects of sensation. For instance, while sitting, the meditator may 
        concentrate on the nature of stiffness and resistance felt in the body 
        and note it as &quot;sitting, sitting.&quot; If the meditator finds this 
        too simple an exercise, he can combine it with noting touching, and note 
        &quot;sitting, touching,&quot; &quot;sitting, touching.&quot; But the 
        rising and falling of the abdomen is more pronounced. Thus, if one 
        heedfully notes &quot;rising&quot; as the abdomen rises, and 
        &quot;falling,&quot; as it falls, one will begin to distinctly see the 
        phenomena of stiffening, resisting, distending, relaxing, and moving 
        which take place in the abdomen. These are the characteristics, function 
        and proximate cause of <i>vāyo dhātu</i>, the element of motion. This 
        kind of contemplation and noting is in accordance with the <i>Visuddhimagga</i>, 
        which states that &quot;the nature of physical and mental phenomena 
        should be comprehended by observing their characteristics and 
        functions,&quot; and so on.</p>
        <p>I have accordingly instructed beginners in the practice of <i>vipassanā</i> 
        to start with observing the rising and falling of the abdomen. However, 
        this exercise of noting the rising and falling alone is not all that has 
        to be done in <i>vipassanā</i> meditation. While noting the rising and 
        falling of the abdomen, any thoughts that may occur must also be noted. 
        When feeling stiff, hot, cold or painful, the meditator has to note 
        these sensations as they arise. When he bends or stretches his arms or 
        legs, these movements should also be noted. As he rises from the sitting 
        position, the change of posture should be accompanied by heedful noting. 
        While walking, every motion involved in each step has to be noted as<b> </b>&quot;rising, 
        stepping forward, dropping.&quot; If possible, all physical activities, 
        even the opening and shutting of the eyelids, should come under close 
        observation. When there is nothing particular to take note of, the 
        meditator's attention should revert to the rising and falling movements 
        of the abdomen. This is a brief description of exercises involved in the 
        practice of <i>vipassanā</i> meditation.</p>
        <p>While thus occupied in taking note of rising, falling, sitting and 
        touching as they occur, the desire may arise in the meditator to change 
        postures in order to relieve the pain and sensations of heat which are 
        developing in his arms and legs. The meditator should take note of these 
        desires as they arise but should remain still, not immediately yielding 
        to the temptation to stretch the limbs. He should put up with the 
        discomfort as long as he can. If the desire to stretch arises once 
        again, he should take note of it as before without changing posture. 
        Only when the pain becomes unbearable should he slowly stretch out his 
        arms and legs, at the same time noting these actions carefully as 
        &quot;stretching, stretching.&quot;</p>
        <p>During each session of meditation, frequent change of posture becomes 
        necessary due to the discomfort of aches and pains. With this repeated 
        adjusting of posture, the oppressive nature of the physical body becomes 
        apparent. Despite the meditator's inclination to remain still, quietly 
        seated, without changing position for one or two hours, it becomes 
        evident that he cannot do so. Then realization comes that the body with 
        its constant oppression is not self, soul or living entity, but mere 
        physical phenomena occurring in accordance with conditions. This 
        realization is knowledge of contemplation of not-self.</p>
        <p>One cannot remain very long either seated, lying down or standing. 
        Thus realization comes too that the body never gives us what we want and 
        is unmanageable. Being uncontrollable, it is not self, but a mere 
        physical phenomenon that is faring in accordance with its own 
        conditions. This realization, too, is knowledge of contemplation of 
        not-self.</p>
        <p>Again, being repeatedly disturbed by having to answer the calls of 
        nature, it becomes apparent that the body is oppressive, unmanageable, 
        not amenable to one's will. Being unmanageable, it is not self. While 
        contem-plating on the behavior of the physical form, its true oppressive 
        nature is exposed when bodily filth such as nasal mucus, saliva, phlegm, 
        tears, and sweat ooze out of the body. One cannot maintain cleanliness 
        as one desires because of this uncontrollable nature of the body. It is, 
        therefore, obviously not self. In addition, the body oppresses by 
        inflicting hunger, thirst, old age and disease on us. These afflictions 
        are obvious truths even to a casual observer, but there is a likelihood 
        of the notion of self persisting in one who observes casually. It is 
        only through heedful noting that the body is exposed as mere physical 
        phenomena, not a self or living entity.</p>
        <p>Thus in the course of heedfully noting all bodily actions and 
        perceiving how the body afflicts, is unmanageable and ungovernable, the 
        realization arises through personal experience: &quot;Although the 
        physical form of my body appears to be self, since it oppresses me, it 
        is not my self nor my inner core; because it is not amenable to my will, 
        it is unmanageable, not self. I have been mistaken all along in taking 
        it to be my self.&quot; This is true knowledge of the contemplation of 
        nonself.</p>
