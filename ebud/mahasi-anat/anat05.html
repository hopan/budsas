        <p><font size="6">A</font>ll the physical and mental components of the 
        five aggregates are not self. That they are not self becomes evident 
        through their characteristics. The Commentary describes these 
        characteristics as follows: Not being amenable to one's will is a 
        characteristic of nonself. In this <i>Sutta</i> this characteristic is 
        expressed in the terms: &quot;It is not possible to say of form, 'Let my 
        body be thus.'&quot; Further in this <i>Sutta</i> we find the 
        expression, &quot; ... it tends to afflict...&quot; Affliction or 
        oppression should thus be taken as another characteristic of not-self. 
        There is a query in the <i>Sutta</i>, &quot;Is it fitting to consider as 
        a self that which is subject to change?&quot; Thus, constant change and 
        alteration is another characteristic of nonself. When these 
        characteristics are observed as they occur, the knowledge develops that 
        the corporeal and mental aggregates are not self but mere phenomena.</p>
        <p>Such knowledge is called <i>anattānupassanā ñāṇa</i>, knowledge 
        developed by contemplation on the characteristics of nonself.</p>
        <p>The name <i>Anattatakkhaṇa</i> is given to this <i>Sutta</i> since 
        it deals with the characteristics of non-self.</p>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">THE DIFFICULTY OF UNDERSTANDING NOT-SELF</font></b></p>
        <p>&quot;The characteristics of impermanence and suffering are easy to 
        understand, but the characteristic of nonself is hard to 
        comprehend,&quot; states the <i>Sammohavinodanī.</i> According to that 
        Commentary, such exclamations as &quot;Oh, impermanent, transient,&quot; 
        readily come to mind when a pot is accidentally dropped and broken. 
        Again, when afflicted with boils or sores or pricked by thorns, we 
        readily murmur, &quot;Oh what pain, what suffering.&quot; In this way 
        the characteristics of impermanence and unsatisfactoriness are clearly 
        visible and easily understood. But just as an object lying in the dark 
        is hard to explain to others, the characteristic of nonself is not 
        easily understood.</p>
        <p>The characteristics of impermanence and unsatisfac-toriness are well 
        known both inside and outside the Buddhist teaching, but the 
        characteristic of not-self is known only in the Buddhist Dispensation. 
        Wise hermits outside of the Dispensation, such as Sarabaṅga, could 
        teach only about the nature of impermanence and suffering; the doctrine 
        of not-self was beyond them. If they could only teach this doctrine, 
        their disciples would have attained the knowledge of the Path and 
        Fruition, but since they could not teach it, attainment of Path and 
        Fruition was impossible for them.</p>
        <p>It is the unique quality or attribute of the Exalted Enlightened Ones 
        to be able to teach and explain the doctrine of not-self. Teachers 
        outside of the Dispensation are not up to the subtlety and profundity of 
        this doctrine. The Commentary states that the doctrine of not-self is so 
        deep that even the Enlightened Ones had to employ either the 
        characteristics of impermanence or the characteristics of suffering, or 
        both, to facilitate its teaching.</p>
        <p>The Sub-Commentary further explains: &quot;In the above statement of 
        the Commentary, the <i>anicca</i> and <i>dukkha </i>known outside the 
        Dispensation are mere conventional terms, they cannot be used as means 
        for realizing not-self. Only the <i>anicca</i> and <i>dukkha</i> 
        realized in the absolute sense can be used in explaining the doctrine of 
        nonself.&quot; Making use of this Sub-Commentary comment, I have 
        described conventional and real concepts of <i>anicca </i>and <i>dukkha</i> 
        in my book on the <i>Sīlavanta Sutta</i>, reference to which may be 
        made for further information.</p>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">NOT-SELF EXPLAINED BY MEANS OF IMPERMANENCE</font></b></p>
        <p>In the <i>Chachakka Sutta</i> of the <i>Uparipaṇṇāsa</i> section 
        of the <i>Majjhima Nikāya</i> we find not-self explained by means of <i>anicca.</i> 
        According to this <i>Sutta</i>, the meditator should know the following 
        six classes of six:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>1. Six internal bases of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind</p>
          <p>2. Six external bases of sight, sound, odor, taste, touch and 
          mental impressions</p>
          <p>3. Six kinds of consciousnesses: eye-, ear-, nose- tongue-, body- 
          and mind-consciousness</p>
          <p>4. Six kinds of <i>phassa</i>, sense contact, through eye, ear, 
          nose, tongue, body and mind</p>
          <p>5. Six kinds of feeling through eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and 
          mind</p>
          <p>6. Six kinds of desire -- hunger for sights, sounds, odors, tastes, 
          touches and mental impressions</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Here &quot;should know&quot; means, according to the Commentary, 
        &quot;should know by means of <i>vipassanā</i> contemplation, by means 
        of knowledge of the Noble Path.&quot; Therefore, whenever anything is 
        seen, it should be mindfully noted so that the eye and its object of 
        sight, the eye consciousness, the contact and the feelings that arise on 
        seeing are all made apparent. And if liking or craving for the object 
        develop with seeing, that desire should also be noted as &quot;liking, 
        liking.&quot;</p>
        <p>Likewise, while hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, and thinking, 
        the six classes of six kinds of objects should be known. To the 
        meditator who is aware of these, the knowledge is gained personally that 
        eye, visible sight and eye consciousness arise and cease. The meditator 
        realizes, &quot;Previously, I thought that there is a permanent entity, 
        an enduring self. Now I see by actual observation that there is only the 
        natural phenomenon of incessant arising and vanishing.&quot; Perceiving 
        no self, no living entity, the meditator may even wonder for whom he is 
        engaged in meditation. Realization that there is no self is attained 
        through fully understanding the nature of impermanence. In corroboration 
        of this practical experience, the Blessed One continued in this <i>Chachakka 
        Sutta</i>:</p>
        <p>&quot;The sensitive material quality of the eye, which serves as the 
        base for eye consciousness, arises and vanishes on every occasion of 
        seeing; it is not, therefore, permanent, not the enduring, everlasting 
        entity, the self, it seems to be. If one says, ‘the eye is self,' it 
        is just like saying one's self is arising and passing away, not stable. 
        Therefore, it must be concluded that the unenduring material quality of 
        the eye is not self.&quot;</p>
        <p>Likewise, similar conclusions may be drawn with respect to visible 
        form, eye consciousness, eye contact, feelings resulting from eye 
        contact, and liking and desiring for sights: they are not self. This is 
        how the six phenomena which become prominent at the moment of seeing are 
        to be regarded as not self. In a similar manner, the six kinds of 
        phenomena which are apparent at the moments of hearing, smelling, 
        tasting, touching and thinking may also be regarded as not-self.</p>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">SEEING NOT-SELF THROUGH SEEING SUFFERING</font></b></p>
        <p>Not-self is explained in terms of <i>dukkha</i> in the <i>Anattalakkhaṇa 
        Sutta</i> itself. &quot;Form tends to afflict because it is not 
        self.&quot; That which is oppressing is fearful, a cause of suffering; 
        and it is very plain that a fearful source of suffering cannot be one's 
        self, one's inner entity.</p>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">NOT-SELF EXPLAINED IN TERMS OF BOTH 
        IMPERMANENCE AND SUFFERING</font></b></p>
        <p>To explain nonself in terms of both impermanence <i>(anicca)</i> and 
        suffering <i>(dukkha),</i> the Blessed One said,</p>
        <i>
        <p>&quot;The body is not permanent. What is not permanent is suffering. 
        What is suffering is not self. What is not self should be regarded with 
        proper wisdom according to reality thus: ‘This is not mine; this I am 
        not; this is not my self'.&quot;</p>
        </i>
        <p>In short, form is subject to change and suffering and is therefore 
        not self. It is not proper to regard as &quot;mine&quot; what is really 
        not self; it is not proper to think vainly of oneself as &quot;I am, I 
        can ...&quot;; it is not proper to regard it as &quot;my self.&quot; In 
        this manner should form be viewed and regarded in accordance with 
        reality.</p>
        <p>In a similar manner, feeling, perception, volitional formations and 
        consciousness are also shown to be not self by their characteristics of 
        impermanence and suffering. We shall find in the latter portions of the <i>Anattalakkhaṇa 
        Sutta</i>, the nature of nonself being described in terms of both <i>anicca</i> 
        and <i>dukkha</i>.</p>
        <p>The concepts of <i>anicca</i> and <i>dukkha</i> are known and 
        accepted widely, but the doctrine of nonself is hardly acceptable to 
        those outside of the Buddha's dispensation. At the time of the Buddha, a 
        certain wandering recluse by the name of Saccaka came to the Blessed One 
        and disputed with him on this subject.</p>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">DEBATE WITH THE WANDERER SACCAKA</font></b></p>
        <p>Saccaka was a teacher of the princes of Vesālī. He asked Assaji, 
        the youngest of the Group of Five monks, &quot;How does the Recluse 
        Gotama teach his disciples? What are his chief instructions?&quot; 
        Assaji replied, &quot;‘Form, feeling, perception, volitional 
        formations and consciousness are impermanent, not self.' That is how the 
        Master teaches us; these are his chief instructions.&quot;</p>
        <p>Upon this, Saccaka, the wandering recluse said, &quot;Friend, we hear 
        an utterance which is evil, unpropitious. We have heard that Recluse 
        Gotama has been teaching this doctrine of not-self, to hear which is 
        evil, unpropitious for us. One of these days I may have an opportunity 
        to meet with Recluse Gotama and rid him of this wicked, odious doctrine 
        of his, the wrong view of nonself.&quot;</p>
        <p>This is an example of how believers in self look down upon the 
        doctrine of not-self. To hear the Blessed One's teaching of nonself is 
        utterly baneful for them. The wandering recluse even talked about 
        ridding the Blessed One of his &quot;wrong view.&quot; Dogmatists are 
        always of this frame of mind; they run down others, holding fast to 
        their own views. Even those who are teaching in accordance with the <i>Pāli 
        </i>Canons are disparaged. Such people who are reviling others are 
        usually found to be deficient in their knowledge of the texts and to 
        have little practical experience of meditation.</p>
        <p>Saccaka had not yet made sufficient study of the Buddha's teaching 
        and had no practical knowledge of the <i>Dhamma</i>. Yet he held a poor 
        opinion of it and felt himself very much above it. Therefore, he 
        attempted to go to the Blessed One and engage him in debate. He was sure 
        he would come out the winner and he wanted people to witness his 
        victory, so he went to the Licchavis of Vesālī and invited them to 
        accompany him, making a vain boast that he would &quot;whirl the Blessed 
        One round in the matter of doctrines, just like a powerful man, catching 
        hold of a kid by his fleece, would whirl it around and around.&quot;</p>
        <p>When they reached the presence of the Blessed One, the wanderer asked 
        permission from the Blessed One to pose his questions. He then asked, 
        &quot;Venerable Gotama, how are your disciples instructed? What are the 
        main points in your instructions?&quot; The Blessed One's reply was 
        exactly the same as that given by the Venerable Assaji: &quot;Form, 
        feeling, perception, volitional formations and consciousness are 
        impermanent, not self. In this way I instruct my disciples. These are 
        the main points of my teaching.&quot;</p>
        <p>The wanderer then began to give illustrations: &quot;Venerable 
        Gotama, the seed and the shoot have to rely on the earth, they depend on 
        the earth for their growth into plants and trees; likewise, every action 
        that is done with vigor and strength needs the earth for its support; in 
        a similar manner, a person having material form as substantial self, <i>attā</i>, 
        depends on it for both wholesome and unwholesome deeds. Likewise one 
        depends on feeling, perception, volitional formations and consciousness 
        as substantial self and depends on feeling, perception, volitional 
        formations and consciousness for both wholesome and unwholesome 
        deeds.&quot;</p>
        <p>What this assertion means is that seeds and trees have to depend on 
        the support of the earth for their growth; so also all kinds of 
        activities require strength and vigor. Trees need the firm support of 
        the earth; similarly, wholesome and unwholesome deeds are performed by 
        individuals having form, feeling, perception, volitional formations and 
        consciousness as self; it is dependent on these &quot;selves&quot; that 
        deeds are carried out. Also, it is the self that reaps the fruits (good 
        or bad) of these deeds. Were material form not self, where would be the 
        support for the performance of wholesome and unwholesome deeds, and who 
        would reap their fruits? It was beyond the intellectual scope of the 
        disciples to solve this doctrinal matter of self likened to the earth. 
        Only the Blessed One could handle the problem. So says the Commentary. 
        Accordingly, the Blessed One, intending to tackle the problem 
        personally, asked of the wanderer, &quot;Saccaka, do you hold that 
        material form is self, feeling is self, perception is self, volitional 
        formations are self, consciousness is self?&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Yes, Venerable Gotama, I hold that view and these people here 
        also hold the same view.&quot; The Blessed One urged him, &quot;Saccaka, 
        leave aside other people's views; let us hear what you hold as your 
        own.&quot;</p>
        <p>It was Saccaka's intention to share the blame with the others present 
        if his view of self happened to be blameworthy, but the Blessed One 
        urged him to confine his reply to himself. He was thus forced to admit 
        that he held that &quot;material form is self, feeling is self, 
        perception is self, volitional formations are self, consciousness is 
        self.&quot;</p>
        <p>Then the Blessed One asked him,</p>
        <p>&quot;Saccaka, rulers like King Pasenadi and King Ajātasattu hold 
        sovereign powers in their own dominions; they execute those who should 
        be executed, punish those who should be punished, and banish those who 
        should be banished. They rule over their countries as they will; is this 
        not a fact, Saccaka?&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Sovereign kings indeed have such authority over their 
        countries: even the Licchavis, elected by popular vote, hold such powers 
        to execute, punish or banish in their own countries,&quot; replied 
        Saccaka, going beyond the bounds of the question, not foreseeing the 
        repercussions it would have on his beliefs.</p>
        <p>Thereupon, the Blessed One said, &quot;Saccaka, you said form is 
        self, ‘my self': could you exercise control over that self, saying, 
        ‘Let this self of mine be thus; let this self be not thus'?&quot;</p>
        <p>Now Saccaka found himself caught in a dilemma. The doctrine of self 
        holds that one can exercise control as one wills. The <i>sāmi attā</i> 
        clinging, which we have repeatedly mentioned, holds that self can be 
        managed at will. At this juncture, Saccaka had admitted that sovereign 
        kings had complete control over their kingdoms; it appeared that he 
        would have to admit that the body, which he regarded as self, would be 
        amenable to management. If he did that, there would come the further 
        question whether he could exercise control over his body so as to keep 
        it youthful like the bodies of the Licchavi princes. If he replied that 
        it could not be managed, then that would amount to admitting that there 
        could be no control over the body and therefore it could not be self. 
        Finding himself in this dilemma, Saccaka kept silent and gave no answer.</p>
        <p>The Blessed One repeated the question for the second time, but 
        Saccaka remained silent. Before asking him for the third time, the 
        Blessed One gave him this warning: &quot;Aggivessana (Saccaka clan's 
        name), you'd better answer my question. It is not the time to remain 
        silent. When questioned by a <i>Tathāgata </i>for a third time, one has 
        to come up with an answer or else one's head will be split into seven 
        pieces.&quot;</p>
        <p>At that time a celestial ogre, armed with a thunderbolt, was said to 
        be hovering above Saccaka's head, poised to split it open. The ogre was 
        visible only to the Blessed One and Saccaka, not to others. It is 
        somewhat like the ghost manifestations of the present day, which are 
        visible to some, invisible to others. Saccaka was terrified by the sight 
        of the ogre; but when he saw the rest of the audience undisturbed in any 
        way, he realized that the ogre was not visible to them. He could not, 
        therefore, claim that he was forced to answer the way he did, being 
        threatened by the ogre. He knew also that he had no other refuge but the 
        Blessed One to whom, therefore, he submitted: &quot;May it please the 
        Blessed One to put the question; I am ready to answer.&quot;</p>
        <p>Thereupon, the Blessed One asked; &quot;Aggivessana, what do you 
        think of this? You said material form is self; could you say of that 
        self, ‘Let this body be thus, let this body be not thus,' as you 
        wish?&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;No, Lord, there is no control over it,&quot; replied Saccaka, 
        thereby contradicting himself. He had said that material form is self; 
        if material form were self, it should be amenable to control. Now he was 
        saying that there was no control over material form, thus, in effect, 
        admitting that material form is not self.</p>
        <p>When the Blessed One heard him contradicting himself, he cautioned 
        Saccaka: &quot;Aggivessana, take heed, be careful with what you say. 
        What you<b> </b>said later is not in accord with what you have said 
        earlier. What you have said earlier is not in accord with what you said 
        later. Now, Aggivessana, what do you think? You said feeling is self; 
        could you say of that self, ‘Let this feeling be thus, let this 
        feeling be not thus' and obtain as you wish?&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;No, Lord, there is no control over it.&quot;</p>
        <p>Similar questions were asked concerning perception, volitional 
        formations and consciousness, prefaced by the same caution to take heed 
        so as not to be contradicting himself. Saccaka provided similar answers, 
        saying there was no control over each of them.</p>
        <p>Then the Blessed One asked him whether material form is permanent or 
        impermanent. He answered, &quot;Impermanent, Sir.&quot; &quot;What is 
        not permanent, is that suffering or happiness?&quot; &quot;Suffering, 
        Sir,&quot; answered Saccaka. &quot;Then, what is impermanent, suffering 
        and subject to change, is it proper to regard it as ‘this is mine, 
        this I am, this is my self'?&quot; &quot;No, Lord,&quot; he replied. The 
        same questions were repeated with regard to feeling, perception, 
        volitional formations and consciousness, and Saccaka gave similar 
        replies.</p>
        <p>Then the Buddha questioned him further: &quot;Aggivessana, what do 
        you think of this? A certain person holds fast to these aggregates of 
        suffering, clinging to them, attached to them, clasping them firmly, 
        believing of them, ‘this is mine, this I am, this is my self', is 
        there a possibility of this person understanding suffering truly and 
        well, and ending this suffering?&quot;</p>
        <p>This question is profound: would one who takes delight in the 
        corporeal and mental aggregates which manifest at the six doors during 
        sense contact<b>,</b> and thinks of them, &quot;this I am, this is mine, 
        this is my self,&quot; know that these corporeal and mental aggregates 
        are suffering? Would it be possible for him to end suffering, to be rid 
        of suffering? Saccaka provided the answers according to the questions 
        asked: &quot;Venerable Gotama, how could it be possible for him to know 
        the truth of suffering or to end suffering? Impossible, Lord 
        Gotama.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;In that case,&quot; the Blessed One asked, &quot;are you not a 
        person who holds fast to these aggregates of suffering, clinging to 
        them, attached to them, clasping them firmly, a person who believes of 
        them ‘this is mine, this I am, this is my self'?&quot; Saccaka 
        replied, &quot;Lord I am verily that person, Sir, how could I be 
        otherwise?&quot;</p>
        <p>The wanderer Saccaka had thought very highly of his own belief in 
        self. He was very vain and boastful about it, but when examined by the 
        Blessed One he was forced to admit the error of his views. His belief in 
        self, <i>attavāda</i>, was thoroughly annihilated. To give a final blow 
        to his bloated ego, pride and vanity, the Blessed One gave this 
        illustration:</p>
        <p>&quot;Aggivessana, suppose there is a man who goes into the forest 
        wanting some heartwood. Seeing a plantain tree and expecting to find 
        heartwood inside it, he fells the tree. Then he cuts off the top part of 
        the tree and begins to peel off the outer skin. He finds in the plantain 
        trunk not even any outer wood fibre, not to mention inner heartwood.</p>
        <p>&quot;Just so, when I examine your doctrine of self, I find it to be 
        void of essential inner substance. Did you not make the boast amidst the 
        crowd in the city of Vesālī: ‘There is no one who can withstand me 
        in debate without trembling or sweating; I have not yet come across any 
        recluse or Brahmin, nor anyone who has claimed to be an all-enlightened <i>Arahat</i>, 
        who can withstand me without trembling or sweating. Even a lifeless 
        wooden post, endowed with neither mind nor mental concomitants, when 
        challenged by me in debate, would tremble and fall down, not to say a 
        human being.' Did you not make such boasts, Aggivessana? As it happens, 
        some of the sweat from your brow has soaked through your upper robe and 
        is dropping onto the ground. As for me, I have no sweat on my 
        body.&quot; So saying, the Blessed One exposed a portion of his body so 
        as to let people see for themselves, and indeed there was no sweat on 
        him.</p>
        <p>The wanderer Saccaka, having nothing to say in reply, remained 
        silent, embarrassed and crestfallen, with slumping shoulders and lowered 
        head. Then one of his followers, a Licchavi prince by the name of 
        Dummukha, rose and asked permission from the Blessed One to give an 
        illustration. On being permitted by the Blessed One, Dummukha, the 
        Licchavi Prince, said,</p>
        <p>&quot;Lord, there was a tank not far from the town, and there was a 
        crab living in the tank. The young children came out from the town and, 
        arriving at the tank, caught hold of the crab and placed it on land. The 
        crab clumsily raised its claws and legs and waved them about. Every time 
        the crab raised a claw or leg, the children would smash it off with 
        sticks or broken pieces of pottery. With its limbs thus crushed, the 
        crab could not make its way back to the tank.</p>
        <p>In a similar manner, the Lord has destroyed all the thorns and spikes 
        of Saccaka's wrong view, his pastures of wrong views, and the movements 
        of his wrong views. There are now no more grounds for Saccaka to 
        approach the Lord in debate.&quot;</p>
        <p>While Dummukha the Licchavi prince was addressing the Blessed One, 
        other Licchavi princes were anxiously awaiting their turn to denounce 
        Saccaka with more illustrative stories. Seeing a situation developing in 
        which the Licchavi princes would be one by one heaping disgrace on him, 
        Saccaka decided to stop Dummukha from making further remarks: &quot;Hold 
        on Dummukha, we are having a discussion with the Venerable Gotama, not 
        with you.&quot; Then he addressed the Blessed One, &quot;Venerable 
        Gotama, let it be, what I have said and what others have said. I wish to 
        bring them to a close. There has been such random talk.&quot;</p>
        <p>Then he asked the Blessed One how one had to go about practicing in 
        the Buddha's Dispensation to reach the stage where skeptical doubts are 
        overcome and courage of conviction attained. The Blessed One taught him 
        that one has to undertake meditation practice until one attains the 
        stage when one can see, with insight and knowledge of the Path, that the 
        five aggregates of form, feeling, perception, volitional formations and 
        consciousness, which are liable to be misconceived as &quot;mine,&quot; 
        &quot;I,&quot; &quot;my self,&quot; are in reality &quot;not mine,&quot; 
        &quot;not I,&quot; &quot;not my self.&quot;</p>
        <p>Saccaka wanted to know also how to practice to become an <i>Arahat</i>. 
        The Buddha told him that, after realization that the physical and mental 
        aggregates are &quot;not mine,&quot; &quot;not I,&quot; &quot;not my 
        self&quot; one has to continue practicing until one is free of clinging 
        and attachments.</p>
        <p>What comes out of this debate between Saccaka and the Blessed One is 
        that there is a type of wrong belief which holds that all the five 
        aggregates are self and that those who cling to self always think 
        disparagingly of those who believe in the doctrine of not-self. There is 
        another type of wrong belief which holds only one of the aggregates to 
        be self. This is evident from the self clinging of Sāti described in 
        Chapter IV and also from <i>vedaka attā </i>clinging and <i>kāraka 
        attā</i> clinging.</p>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">REFUTING THE INDEPENDENT SELF</font></b></p>
        <p>There has appeared in modern times still another type of self belief. 
        As described in books on Indian Philosophy, this new type of self 
        clinging has no reference to the five aggregates, it postulates a self 
        existing apart from them. This must be rejected as just an opinion, for 
        in the absence of the five aggregates there can be no self. Consider for 
        a moment: if self has no form, it cannot be experienced in any form or 
        substance. If mental properties still exist, there can be self clinging 
        to them similar to the attachment of the common worldling <i>(puthujjana-</i>-unenlightened 
        being) to the formless realm. But without mental properties, then there 
        is nothing to be attached to as one's self. If there is no feeling, 
        there can be no clinging to feelings, pleasant or unpleasant. In the 
        absence of perception, no attachment can arise to recognition or memory. 
        Having no consciousness, nothing can be known; and since there are no 
        volitional formations such as intention, that self cannot do anything. 
        Therefore such a self could exist only in name; it would be of no 
        practical use and could not even be described. Thus, although they 
        assert that their self is apart from the five aggregates, it is obvious 
        that their self clinging is on one, many or all of the five aggregates. 
        It is an impossibility to have any clinging as self apart from or 
        outside of the five aggregates.</p>
        <p>Thus, in the <i>Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta</i>, we find the words, 
        &quot;form is not self; feeling is not self; perception is not self; 
        volitional formations are not self; consciousness is not self,&quot; 
        thus removing and refuting all types of clinging to a self, either apart 
        from the five aggregates, or within one, two, three, four or all five 
        kinds of aggregates.</p>
        <p>If material form is clung to as self, then the remaining four 
        aggregates form part of that self, are its attribute and support, and 
        are also clung to. If one of the other aggregates, such as feeling, is 
        clung to as self, then the remaining four are also clung to as part of 
        that self, as its attribute and its support. All these types of self 
        clinging are refuted by the statement &quot;material form is not 
        self.&quot;</p>
        <p>The Blessed One had now explained fully about notself, but in order 
        to explain it further in terms of the characteristics of impermanence 
        and suffering, he continued:</p>

        <p>&quot;Monks, what do you think? Is material form permanent or 
        impermanent?&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Not permanent, Lord.&quot;</p>
        </i>
        <p>The Blessed One asked them whether material form is permanent or not. 
        The Group of Five replied, &quot;Not permanent,&quot; an answer which 
        may have been given from knowledge gained by ordinary hearsay, but the 
        Blessed One wanted an answer based on their own knowledge, and the Group 
        of Five monks, having all become Stream Enterers, had seen the truth. 
        Their answers were thus based on their own knowledge, in accordance with 
        the wishes of the Blessed One.</p>
        <p>Meditators at this centre can also answer from their own knowledge. 
        When the meditator takes note of the action of rising, he perceives the 
        phenomena of extension, pressure and motion in the abdomen quite 
        vividly. The phenomena of extension, pressure and motion are the 
        manifestations of the <i>vāyo</i> element. They were nonexistent 
        before; they become manifest just as the abdomen begins to rise. This is 
        then the arising of the phenomenon, its becoming. The beginning of the 
        phenomenon is the rising of the abdomen, which comes under observation 
        and is duly noted. When the rising comes to an end, there are no more 
        extension, pressure and motion in the abdomen. They are said to 
        terminate, disappear, cease, pass away. Thus while the rising of the 
        abdomen is being noted, the meditator also perceives the rising to pass 
        away, to disappear. This dissolution following on the heel of arising 
        and becoming is the sure characteristic of impermanence. Realizing this 
        characteristic of impermanence in the course of noting the rising and 
        falling of the abdomen is true insight into the nature of impermanence, <i>aniccā-nupassanā 
        ñāṇa</i>. The knowledge of impermanence accruing from noting the 
        beginning and end of each arising constitutes <i>sammasana ñāṇa</i>, 
        the first step in the series of ten <i>ñāṇas</i> developed through <i>Vipassanā</i> 
        meditation. <i>Sammasana ñāṇa</i> sees through only the beginning 
        and end of corporeal and mental phenomena; the fine details of what 
        happens in between are not yet perceived. It is just the knowledge of 
        impermanence which accrues from perceiving the becoming and dissolution 
        of the continuing processes as they happen.</p>
        <p>When noting the rising of the abdomen, the beginning of the rise is 
        perceived as well as its end. To know the beginning of the rise is to 
        know the becoming; to know the end of the rise is to know its 
        dissolution. Seeing the becoming and the dissolution of each arising, 
        there can be no misconception of it as permanent.</p>
        <p>When noting the falling of the abdomen, the contracting motion of the 
        abdomen is distinctly seen. This is the <i>vāyo</i> element in motion. 
        In seeing the beginning of the falling motion of the stomach and its 
        end, the <i>vāyo</i> element is being seen. The falling material form 
        was not in existence at the time of extension; it is only when the 
        rising motion comes to an end that the falling material form comes into 
        being. Then finally the falling material form vanishes, so it is also 
        impermanent.</p>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">CHARACTERISTICS OF IMPERMANENCE</font></b></p>
        <i>
        <p>Anicca khayaṭṭhena:</i> a condition is impermanent because of its 
        nature of coming to an end. In accordance with this definition, the 
        falling of the abdomen, manifested by the contracting motion, comes to 
        an end, it ceases. Hence it is impermanent.</p>
        <p>Another Commentary definition is <i>hutvā abhāvato anicca:</i> 
        previously nonexistent, it comes into being and then dissolves, thus it 
        is impermanent.</p>
        <p>While noting, &quot;falling, falling&quot; the beginning and end of 
        the falling is perceived, and the meditator realizes its impermanent 
        nature. This is true understanding of the nature of impermanence <i>(aniccānupassanā 
        ñāṇa)</i> on the level of <i>sammasana ñāṇa</i>, seeing the 
        becoming and dissolution of the continuous processes as they occur. At 
        the level of <i>udayabbaya ñāṇa</i>, three, four, or five distinct 
        moments of beginning and ending of the phenomenon can be discerned 
        during the interval of one cycle of rising and falling of the abdomen. 
        When the meditator progresses to the <i>bhaṅga</i> stage, numerous 
        moments of dissolution will be seen to flit by during the interval of 
        one cycle of rising and falling. The material body of rising and 
        falling, being subjected to incessant dissolution, is indeed 
        impermanent.</p>
        <p>When the motions of bending or stretching the limbs are heedfully 
        noted, as &quot;bending, bending,&quot; or &quot;stretching, 
        stretching,&quot; the beginning and end of each bending or stretching is 
        distinctly seen. It is seen thus because the respective motions are 
        being carefully noted. One who doesn't note may not be aware of the 
        bending or stretching of his limbs. Even if he is aware of these 
        motions, he will not perceive the beginning of the motions separately 
        from their ends. He will be under the impression that the hand which was 
        there before bending or stretching still remains there after the motion. 
        When bending or stretching, it will be seen that there is a slow motion 
        of the limbs gradually passing from one moment to another. In every 
        instance of bending or stretching, the beginning of the extending and 
        moving is the coming into being (becoming) of the <i>vāyo</i> element; 
        the end of the extending and moving is the dissolution of the <i>vāyo</i> 
        element. When noting bending, to know the beginning and ending of each 
        act of bending is to know the arising and dissolution of <i>vāyo</i> 
        element. Similarly, when noting stretching, to know the beginning and 
        end of each act of stretching is to know the arising and dissolution of <i>vāyo</i> 
        element. During the time taken by one single act of bending and 
        stretching, knowing the separate slow motions of the limbs gradually 
        passing from one moment to another is also knowing the arising and 
        dissolution of the <i>vāyo </i>element, whose characteristics are 
        extension and movement. The gradual slow motion of the limbs clearly 
        brings out the nature of impermanence. This cannot, however, be realized 
        without heedful noting of each action.</p>
        <p>While walking, the meditator who is taking note as &quot;right step, 
        left step,&quot; knows the beginning and end of each step. This is 
        knowing the arising and dissolution of the <i>vāyo</i> element, which 
        is responsible for extension and movement of the legs. Similarly, the 
        meditator who takes note of the movements of the legs in raising, 
        stepping out, and dropping down knows separately the beginning and end 
        of those movements. This is also knowing the arising and dissolution of 
        the <i>vāyo</i> element. Knowing the separate slow motions of the legs 
        involved in each act of moving is also knowing the coming into being and 
        dissolution of the <i>vāyo</i> element. Thus the <i>vāyo</i> element, 
        responsible for the movement of each step, is arising and passing away 
        with each step and is, therefore, impermanent.</p>
        <p>When noting the feeling of touch anywhere on the body, knowing the 
        arising of the sensation of touch and its disappearance is knowing the 
        arising and dissolution of the material quality involved in touch 
        sensation. The meditator knows the arising and passing of both the 
        sensitive material quality of his own body and the tactile body it 
        touches. He realizes that freshly arising material bodies are not 
        stable, but impermanent, because he has seen their incessant arising and 
        passing away by actual noting.</p>
        <p>When noting hearing as &quot;hearing, hearing,&quot; the meditator 
        notices the sound freshly arising and disappearing. This is knowing the 
        arising and dissolution of sound. Thus any sound which arises is 
        impermanent. Along with this material quality of the sound, the material 
        quality of the ear on which sound makes its impression also arises 
        afresh and disappears with the sound. So it may be said that once the 
        arising and dissolution of sound is perceived, the arising and 
        dissolution of the material quality of ear is also known. Thus the 
        meditator knows the impermanent nature of the material quality of the 
        ear as well. The whistle from the rice mill or the howling of dogs are 
        generally regarded to be heard at one continuous stretch, but to the 
        meditator whose <i>vipassanā</i> insight has grown strong, those sounds 
        appear in minute portions, section by section, one after another. The 
        meditator, therefore, realizes that the material quality of sound is 
        also arising and perishing at a very fast pace.</p>
        <p>Likewise the meditator who is noting &quot;seeing&quot; knows, when 
        his <i>vipassanā ñāṇa</i> gets highly developed, that eye 
        consciousness and seeing are quickly appearing and disappearing. The 
        visible forms, also, which arise and perish are not permanent. The 
        material quality of eye which arises and perishes simultaneously with 
        the visible form is also impermanent.</p>
        <p>While eating, the meditator notes the taste and knows when the taste 
        disappears. The taste which appears afresh and disappears is, therefore, 
        impermanent. The impermanent nature of taste is very plain. However 
        pleasant the taste is, it remains on the tongue only for a short while 
        before it disappears. As with the taste, the material quality of the 
        tongue on which the taste manifests disappears simultaneously. Thus when 
        the taste is seen to be impermanent, the material quality of the tongue 
        is seen also to be impermanent.</p>
        <p>The meditator who keeps note of smell knows that a smell keeps on 
        appearing and disappearing, all the time renewing itself. Smell, which 
        comes into being and dissolves instantly, is therefore impermanent, as 
        is the material quality of the nose which arises and vanishes with it. 
        When thinking occurs while noting the rise and fall of the abdomen, it 
        has to be carefully noted. It will be observed that the thinking 
        disappears even while it is being noted. Every time thinking disappears, 
        the material quality on which it is based disappears also. This material 
        base which arises and vanishes with every act of thinking is 
        non-enduring, impermanent. The above concerns material qualities which 
        the meditator realizes personally as impermanent by constantly noting 
        the phenomena of the aggregates. These material qualities relate to the 
        whole of the body; they arise and dissolve, renewing themselves at every 
        moment of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching and thinking. 
        Like the material qualities inside one's own body, the material 
        qualities from the bodies of other people are also simultaneously 
        arising and vanishing. For instance, noting sound as &quot;hearing, 
        hearing,&quot; the material quality of sound is perishing, as are other 
        material qualities in one's body, as are those in the outside world.</p>
        <p>Thus the Blessed One asked, &quot;Is material form permanent or 
        impermanent?&quot; The Group of Five, who had personal knowledge of 
        their impermanent nature, replied, &quot;Impermanent, Lord.&quot;</p>
        <p>These are questions concerning the characteristics of impermanence. 
        When one knows the characteristics of impermanence thoroughly, it is 
        easy to understand the characteristics of suffering and not-self. The 
        characteristic of impermanence is that it does not endure. The 
        Commentary defines it as <i>hutvā abhāvato</i> <i>anicca:</i> not 
        being in existence, it comes into being and then ceases. These are the 
        characteristics of impermanence. Every-one has seen lightning. At first 
        it does not exist, then it comes into being in a flash. It does not last 
        long, it disappears instantly. The phenomenon of lightning provides all 
        the characteristics of impermanence. Whatever arises afresh to soon 
        disappear is said to have the characteristic of impermanence.</p>
        <p>The meditator who continues to observe the process of sense awareness 
        sees things arising and ceasing. Only when he has acquired this personal 
        knowledge of the characteristic of impermanence is the true knowledge of 
        <i>aniccānupassanā ñāṇa</i> (insight into impermanence) 
        develop-ed. Seeing dissolution, the meditator knows that it is 
        impermanent. This knowledge is <i>aniccānupassanā ñāṇa</i>. In 
        order to help develop this <i>ñāṇa</i>, the Blessed One asked, 
        &quot;Is material form permanent or impermanent?&quot;</p>
        <p>I have fully dealt with the question of imperma-nence, now I shall go 
        on with the characteristics of suffering.</p>
        <i>
        <p>&quot;That which is impermanent, is it unsatisfactory or 
        satisfactory?&quot;</i> asked the Blessed One. The five monks answered, <i>&quot;Unsatisfactory, 
        Lord.&quot;</p>
        </i>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">TWO KINDS OF DUKKHA</font></b></p>

        suffering, the kind that is <i>dukkha </i>because it is oppressive or 
        repulsive. The impermanence of incessant arising and vanishing is not 
        the painful kind of suffering, it belongs to the second kind, in 
        accordance with the Commentary definition: &quot;It is suffering because 
        it is fearsome.&quot; The phenomenon of incessant arising and ceasing is 
        terrible, fearsome, or to use the Burmese words, &quot;not good.&quot; 
        The question, &quot;That which is impermanent, is it suffering or 
        happiness, <i>dukkha</i> or <i>sukha ?&quot;</i> is the same as &quot;Is 
        it bad or good?&quot; The Group of Five answered, &quot;It is <i>dukkha,&quot;</i> 
        or in Burmese idiom, &quot;It is not good.&quot;</p>
        <p>The reason it is <i>dukkha</i>, not good, is that it is ever arising 
        and perishing, and so it is fearsome. People imagine things to be <i>sukha, 
        </i>good, because they appear to be enduring and stable. When they 
        realize that things do not endure even for a second and are constantly 
        dissolving, they can no longer see any <i>sukha</i> or goodness in them.</p>
        <p>We depend for our existence on the aggregates which are in 
        dissolution all the time. If at any moment the aggregates are not 
        renewed, we die, which is a terrible thing to know. It is just like 
        living in an old, dilapidated building, liable to collapse at any time. 
        In the case of the building, there is the possibility that it may last 
        for days, months, or even years before coming down, whereas the mental 
        and physical aggregates inside the body cannot endure even for a second. 
        They are undergoing dissolution all the time and are thus more terrible. 
        Hence it is said to be suffering, <i>dukkha</i>.</p>
        <p>What are the characteristics of <i>dukkha?</i></p>
        <p>According to the Commentary, <i>abhiṇha sampaṭipīḷanakara 
        dukkha lakkhaṇaṁ </i>: Incessant, unceasing oppression is the sign 
        of <i>dukkha</i>. Here, unceasing oppression refers to the incessant 
        arising and passing away of mental and physical aggregates. Thus all 
        mental and physical aggregates are regarded as <i>dukkha</i>, things 
        which are &quot;not good.&quot; Seeing the sign of <i>dukkha</i> by 
        personal experience and realizing things to be fearsome, suffering, 
        &quot;not good,&quot; not dependable, is true <i>dukkhānupassanā ñāṇa</i> 
        (insight into suffering).</p>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">DEVELOPMENT OF DUKKHĀNUPASSANĀ ÑĀṆA</font></b></p>
        <p>While the meditator is noting the phenomena of mental and physical 
        properties, he sees the incessant origination and dissolution taking 
        place in the rising and falling of the abdomen, in bending, stretching, 
        lifting, stepping, and dropping. He sees also the origination and 
        dissolution taking place in noting every instance of touching, hearing, 
        seeing, and tasting. He begins to see the corporeal and mental 
        aggregates oppressed by processes of origination and dissolution. There 
        is the possibility of death at any moment, hence the oppression is seen 
        as fearsome. This is true <i>dukkhānupassanā ñāṇa</i>.</p>
        <p>In order to help develop this <i>ñāṇa</i>, the Blessed One 
        asked,&quot;That which is impermanent, is it <i>dukkha</i> or <i>sukha 
        ?&quot;</i> In the paragraph stating, &quot;Body is not self&quot; it is 
        clearly stated, &quot;Since body is not self, it tends to 
        affliction.&quot; Therefore it is very plain that the body is suffering, 
        and the five monks answered accordingly, <i>&quot;Dukkha</i>, 
        Lord.&quot;</p>
        <p>Having shown in this way that form is impermanent and suffering, the 
        Blessed One went on to urge the monks not to regard the body as 
        &quot;mine&quot;, &quot;me&quot;, &quot;my self &quot;. &quot;That which 
        is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, is it fitting or 
        proper to regard it as ‘this is mine, this I am, this is my 
        self'?&quot; The five monks answered,&quot;Not proper, Lord.&quot;</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>CLINGING WITH CRAVING, &quot;THIS IS 
        MINE&quot;</b></font></p>
        <p>Of the three forms of grasping, &quot;this is mine&quot; is clinging 
        with craving, &quot;this I am&quot; is clinging with conceit, and 
        &quot;this is my self' is clinging with wrong view. When one has taken 
        delight in an object with craving, even if the object does not belong to 
        one, it is grasped as if it does. Thus, seeing delightful objects in the 
        market, we take delight in them as if we already owned them. We take a 
        fancy to jackets and skirts, we put them on in our imagination; shoes 
        too, we wear in our imagination, as if they were already our own. We 
        grasp everything, if we fancy it, animate or inanimate, as if it was our 
        own. Therefore, the Blessed One asked whether it was wise to grasp 
        things that are impermanent, suffering and subject to change and delight 
        in them as &quot;mine&quot;; in other words, whether it is proper to 
        delight in suffering.</p>
        <p>The physical properties in one's person are constantly originating 
        and dissolving; if one sees this as it really is, it is frightening, 
        just like having to live in a dilapidated building. One may feel quite 
        well for the present, but a change for the worse may take place at any 
        time, depending on conditions and circumstances. Once it is realized 
        that the body does not endure even for a moment, that it is always 
        changing, and therefore a source of suffering, how could one take 
        delight in it? Would anyone willingly choose as one's life partner 
        someone who is going to become an invalid within hours or days, or who 
        is about to die? No one who really knew what was about to happen would 
        take delight in such a course of action.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the meditator who sees the unceasing process of 
        origination and dissolution of the aggregates finds only terrible 
        suffering in them. Finding them as such, he has no desire to grasp the 
        body as his own. The Group of Five monks, therefore, answered that it is 
        not proper to regard the body with the thought &quot;this is mine.&quot;</p>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">CLINGING WITH CONCEIT, &quot;THIS I AM&quot;</font></b></p>
        <p>To consider material form as &quot;this I am&quot; is to cling to it 
        with conceit. When one has good eyes and ears and can see and hear well 
        one begins to take pride in them: &quot;I have good eyes, good ears, I 
        look beautiful, I have a pleasant voice, I am well, I am strong.&quot; 
        Is it proper to cling to the body in this manner?</p>
        <p>Conceit is developed when there is the misconception that one's 
        possessions are enduring and permanent. When the material qualities of 
        eyes, ears, and visible forms are wrongly held to be permanent, vanity 
        is built round them. It is like a man who has a cache of gold and silver 
        hidden in a certain place: he may be full of pride over his wealth, but 
        if he finds out that his cache has been robbed and he no longer owns any 
        riches, the bubble of his conceit gets burst.</p>
        <p>Likewise, when there is clinging to the material qualities which 
        become manifest at the moment of seeing and hearing, and they are 
        thought to be still in existence, conceit is developed over them. The 
        ardent meditator knows that they all arise only to vanish and finds no 
        reason for proud thoughts such as &quot;I have good eyes, I am 
        beautiful.&quot; Thus, when the monks were asked, &quot;Is it proper to 
        regard the body as ‘This I am'?&quot; their reply was, &quot;Not 
        proper, Lord.&quot; The Blessed One let it be known by means of this 
        question and answer that there is conceit when things are conceived as 
        permanent and there is no conceit when they are known to be impermanent.</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>CLINGING WITH WRONG VIEW, &quot;THIS IS MY 
        SELF&quot;</b></font></p>
        <p>Holding on to the belief &quot;This is my self&quot; is clinging with 
        wrong view. This wrong view is conceived when there is belief that the 
        physical properties in one's person are everlasting and amenable to 
        one's control. When knowledge arises that they are unstable, constantly 
        arising and vanishing, and suffering because they are unenduring and 
        subject to change, there are no more grounds for clinging to the body as 
        &quot;self,&quot; as a living entity. When the meditator knows that the 
        body cannot be controlled -- &quot;Let everything be pleasant, good; let 
        nothing unpleasant or bad happen; let all good physical properties 
        remain permanent&quot; -- there is nothing for him to cling to as self. 
        Thus to the question, &quot;Is it fitting to regard the body as 
        self?&quot; the five monks replied, &quot;No, Lord.&quot; With this 
        question, the Blessed One made it clear that when it is not known that 
        material properties are changing every instant, they are clung to as 
        self. When their impermanence is known, there is no more clinging. 
        According to this, &quot;changeableness at every instant,&quot; should 
        also be taken as a characteristic of nonself.</p>
        <p>We have dealt with the characteristics of impermanence in the first 
        part of today's lecture; in the latter portion of the discourse, we have 
        gone over all the three characteristics mentioned in the <i>Anattalakkhaṇa 
        Sutta</i> in the form of questions and answers. The exposition on the 
        aggregate of form is fairly complete.</p>
