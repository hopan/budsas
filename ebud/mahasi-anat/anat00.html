        <p><font size="6">T</font>o Buddhist meditators the name of Mahasi 
        Sayadaw needs no introduction. His meditation techniques and teachings 
        have received recognition and acceptance all over the world. Now the 
        Buddhadhamma Foundation is honored to present the Great Discourse on 
        Not-self as the first in a series of teachings by this renowned teacher.</p>
        <p>The original translation by U Ko Lay, first published by the Buddha 
        Sasana Nuggaha Foundation in Rangoon, Myanmar, has been further edited 
        in this edition. Some repetition has been deleted and many of the Pāli 
        terms have been translated. The teachings remain very detailed and 
        repetitive, however: they were primarily given as instructions for 
        people undergoing an intensive course of meditation.</p>
        <p>It is our hope that the publication of these books will help to 
        further interest in the practice of meditation and Buddhist teachings in 
        the West.</p>

        <p align="left"><font size="6">W</font>ithin the personality of every 
        worldling, or <i>puthujjana</i>, moral defilements <i>(kilesa),</i> such 
        as greed and attachment, proliferate. These <i>kilesa</i> fix onto the 
        objects arising through the six sense-doors, such as beautiful sights. 
        While attachment occurs in respect of all things that are pleasant and 
        agreeable, attachment to</font><i><font face="CN-Times"> attā</font></i><font face="CN-Times">, 
        (the concept of) a &quot;living entity,&quot; or &quot;self,&quot; is 
        not only fundamental but also most difficult to dispel.</p>
        <i>
        <p align="left">Paccekabuddhas </i>(&quot;Silent Buddhas&quot;) are 
        capable of eradicating their attachment to the concept of self unaided, 
        through their own efforts and wisdom. However, they do not have the 
        ability to eradicate this attachment in others. Only a person with the 
        exceptional ability to convince others of the truth and virtue of the 
        Four Noble Truths can, by so doing, wipe out these feelings of 
        attachment in the hearts of others. <i>Paccekabuddhas </i>have no such 
        knowledge or ability, that is why they become <i>Paccekabuddhas. A 
        Paccekabuddha </i>enters </font><i><font face="CN-Times">Nibbāna</font></i><font face="CN-Times"> 
        alone. He is not omniscient and does not teach the Dhamma to others.</p>
        <p align="left">Supreme Buddhas, the Omniscient Ones, are endowed with 
        greater intellectual capacity than <i>Pacceka-buddhas. </i>Like the <i>Paccekabuddhas, 
        </i>the Supreme Buddhas truly realize the Four Noble Truths on their own 
        initiative, but they can also teach those truths to others. That is why 
        they are Supreme Buddhas, Fully Enlightened Ones.</p>
        <p align="left">The Lord Buddha delivered the First Sermon, concerning 
        the Four Noble Truths, to the five ascetics. That sermon is called the <i>Dhammacakkappavattana 
        Sutta</i>, the Great Discourse on the Setting in Motion of the Wheel of 
        Dhamma, or Righteousness. This Great Discourse was the first teaching 
        given by the Blessed One, and was delivered on the eve of Saturday, the 
        full moon of July, exactly two months after His attainment of Supreme 
        Enlightenment.</p>
        <p align="left">At the close of this First Sermon, Koṇdañña, the 
        leader of the five ascetics, became a Stream Enterer </font><i><font face="CN-Times">(Sotāpanna)</font></i><font face="CN-Times">. 
        By attaining the stage of Stream Entry he removed all doubts about the 
        truth of the Dhamma and the misconception of </font><i><font face="CN-Times">sakkāya, 
        </font></i><font face="CN-Times">&quot;self&quot; or living entity. 
        Nevertheless, self-pride </font><i><font face="CN-Times">(māna)</font></i><font face="CN-Times"> 
        still lingered in his mind. The remaining four ascetics had not yet 
        realized the special Dhamma, &quot;the awakening of higher 
        consciousness.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">As self-pride or personal ego still had its grip on 
        Koṇdañña, and as Vappa and the other three of the Group of Five <i>bhikkhus</i> 
        had not yet obtained the &quot;pure and spotless Dhamma Eye,&quot; the 
        Blessed One went on teaching and urged them to contemplate and note 
        along the lines of </font><i><font face="CN-Times">vipassanā </font></i><font face="CN-Times">(insight 
        meditation). After diligent meditation they all eventually reached the 
        stage of Stream Enterer, thereby removing their attachment to self-view. 
        Venerable Vappa gained progressive insight on the first waning day of 
        July, Bhaddiya on the second day, Mahānāma on the third day, and 
        Assaji on the fourth day.</p>
        <p align="left">The Lord Buddha then summoned the whole Group of Five <i>bhikkhus</i> 
        and taught them His second sermon, setting forth the famous </font><i><font face="CN-Times">anattā</font></i><font face="CN-Times"> 
        (not-self) doctrine. It was on Thursday, the 5th waning day of July. On 
        hearing the <i>Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta</i>, all five attained Arahatship, 
        by virtue of which they were entirely free from all human passions, 
        including </font><i><font face="CN-Times">māna</font></i><font face="CN-Times">, 
        conceit. The <i>Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta</i>, as its name implies, clearly 
        expounded the doctrine of &quot;not-self' as opposed to the false view 
        of &quot;self&quot;.</p>
        <p align="left">The <i>Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta</i> is not a lengthy 
        piece. In the original book published by the Sixth Buddhist Council, it 
        covered only one page. In the <i>Sutta</i>, there is no mention of 
        meditation methods or techniques for contemplation. The teaching was 
        more concerned with natural truth than practical methods. Hence it would 
        be difficult for those unacquainted with the methods of </font><i><font face="CN-Times">vipassanā</font></i><font face="CN-Times"> 
        meditation to appreciate the reality of not-self described in this <i>Sutta</i>. 
        It was possible for the five ascetics only because the sermon was 
        delivered by the Lord Buddha himself, and because they -- the listening 
        audience -- happened to be of keen intellect. These five had not only 
        been endowed with mature experience since hearing the <i>Dhammacakka 
        Sutta</i>, but had also reached the stage of Stream Enterer. Thus their 
        speedy attainment of Arahatship.</p>
        <p align="left">During the lifetime of Lord Buddha, people with keen 
        intellect and mature perfections <i>(parami</i></font><i><font face="CN-Times">tā)</font></i><font face="CN-Times">, 
        like the Group of Five, achieved Path and Fruit <i>(magga-phala)</i> 
        while listening to sermons by the Blessed One. Of course, these 
        attainments were not gained without diligently practicing </font><i><font face="CN-Times">vipassanā</font></i><font face="CN-Times"> 
        meditation. The Special Dhamma was attained only because they had been 
        able to devote themselves to ardent meditation, deep concentration and 
        keen contemplation, and it was only those few with good knowledge or 
        adequate past perfections who were capable of doing so. Many could not 
        possibly contemplate and note with such great speed.</p>
        <p align="left">Despite this fact, there are idlers who will knowingly 
        say: &quot;If one understand the nature of not-self through the 
        teachings, it is not necessary to practice. One can achieve Path and 
        Fruit merely by listening to the teaching.&quot; With this kind of 
        wishful thinking they place themselves on the plane of the Noble Ones. 
        Such concepts being entertained by a class of lazy-bones, the number of 
        people who have so become self-made Noble Ones through simply listening 
        to sermons would not be few. The kind of knowledge of not-self gleaned 
        from listening to sermons without practicing <i>vipassan</i></font><i><font face="CN-Times">ā</font></i><font face="CN-Times"> 
        meditation is not a true, personal realization, but mere book-knowledge. 
        If Path and Fruit insight knowledge <i>(magga-phala-ñāṇa)</i> could 
        be realized in this manner, almost every Buddhist who knows the doctrine 
        of not-self could be considered an Arahat. However, as such people do 
        not have the virtues of Arahats, it is obvious that they are not really 
        Arahats. Bearing in mind such improper notions, the Venerable Mahasi 
        Sayadaw has given precise and clear instructions in this great <i>Anattalakkhaṇa 
        Sutta</i> to put people on the right path.</p>
        <p align="left">The <i>Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta</i> itself describes the 
        nature and characteristics of not-self, but does not describe the 
        meditation methods or techniques for contemplation and noting. This 
        book, however, contains a full exposition of the methods of 
        contemplation and explains in detail how not-self is reflected on, 
        leading to the attainment of </font><i><font face="CN-Times">Nibbāna</font></i><font face="CN-Times">. 
        The discourses were not taught willfully, without reference to the 
        scriptural texts. Neither were they given without a foundation of 
        personal experience in practical v</font><i><font face="CN-Times">ipassanā</font></i><font face="CN-Times"> 
        meditation. They were expounded after acquiring personal experience and 
        knowledge in meditation practice under the methodical instructions of a 
        competent teacher, and after consultation with relevant Pāli Scriptures 
        and Commentaries.</p>
        <p align="left">In his sermons, the Venerable Sayadaw, with his deep 
        compassion, elaborated fully on the brief account of the <i>Anattalakkhaṇa 
        Sutta</i> given by the Lord Buddha. When the sermons were produced in 
        typewritten copy, transcribed in full from the original tape recordings 
        by U Thein Han, a retired judge, the manuscript was a lengthy piece 
        comprising 420 pages.</p>
        <p align="left">U Thein Han presented that typewritten copy to the 
        Venerable Sayadaw to seek permission for printing and publication. The 
        Sayadaw gave his kind permission to print and publish it only after 
        summarizing it into a compendium of 152 pages, instead of the original 
        420, lest the book should become too bulky in view of the shortage of 
        printing paper.</p>
        <p align="left">Indeed, the Venerable Sayadaw is an adept at amplifying 
        what is concise and shortening what is lengthy. He has not only 
        abbreviated the lengthy version of the <i>Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta</i> and 
        the &quot;Method of </font><i><font face="CN-Times">Vipassanā</font></i><font face="CN-Times"> 
        Meditation&quot;, but also his teaching on the <i>Dhammacakka Sutta</i>. 
        In doing so, he has made them comprehensible to all who might prefer to 
        read or hear the Dhamma in a concise form, thus serving as a boon to 
        all.</p>
        <p align="left">Whenever he taught or wrote, the Venerable Sayadaw laid 
        more emphasis on the true meaning rather than the principles of grammar. 
        While the more literal translation of </font><i><font face="CN-Times">&quot;Bārāṇasiyaṁ&quot;</font></i><font face="CN-Times">, 
        as, &quot;At Benares,&quot; is not incorrect, the Venerable Mahasi 
        Sayadaw has translated it as &quot;in the neighborhood of Benares&quot;, 
        inasmuch as the Buddha resided temporarily in the Deer Park near the 
        City of Benares (or rather in the province of Benares), in order to fall 
        in line with the factual truth.</p>
        <p align="left">Although he gave more importance to the inherent 
        meaning, the Venerable Sayadaw did not adhere to it at the expense of 
        grammar, the importance of which he never failed to observe. In other 
        words, he gave grammar the attention it<b> </b>deserved, but paramount 
        importance was given to the actual meaning. Hence, his interpretations 
        do not strictly follow the traditional method. After due consideration, 
        he would stick to the truth of the meaning as he found it and express 
        his candid opinion in writing.</p>
        <p align="left">The teaching of impermanence, suffering and not-self <i>(anicca, 
        dukkha</i> and </font><i><font face="CN-Times">anattā)</font></i><font face="CN-Times"> 
        is very familiar to all Buddhists, and the words are never far from 
        their lips. Whenever an accident happens, the words are casually 
        muttered, quickly invoking mindfulness of the Dhamma. Such being the 
        case, the teaching might be regarded as generally known and understood. 
        It is undoubtedly known through hearsay or book knowledge, but in 
        reality it is a difficult teaching to fully understand, despite its 
        apparent simplicity. Of the three characteristics, the teaching on <i>&quot;anatt</i></font><i><font face="CN-Times">ā,&quot;</font></i><font face="CN-Times"> 
        not-self, is the most difficult and profound. It is for this reason that 
        the Blessed One had to face serious opposition from such persons as 
        Saccaka the Wanderer and Baka the Brahma, who entertained the opposite 
        view of &quot;self&quot;.</p>
        <p align="left">Prior to the Buddha's teachings, it was considered that 
        self was inherently interwoven with </font><i><font face="CN-Times">rūpa</font></i><font face="CN-Times"> 
        (corporeality) and </font><i><font face="CN-Times">nāma</font></i><font face="CN-Times"> 
        (mentality). In opposition to this wrong belief, the Lord Buddha stated 
        that corporeality and mentality are not self. It is most difficult to 
        convincingly show &quot;not-self&quot; as it is in reality, since the 
        concept of self has been firmly rooted in people through countless 
        rounds of existence. If the teaching of not-self could be easily known, 
        there would be no need for the appearance of a Buddha. Nor would it be 
        necessary for the Buddha's disciples, like the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw, 
        to expound on and write commentaries on the <i>Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta</i> 
        at such great pains. The untiring efforts needed to elucidate this 
        teaching stand witness to its profundity. Even among non-Buddhists, very 
        few really understand what &quot;self' or </font><i><font face="CN-Times">&quot;attā&quot;</font></i><font face="CN-Times"> 
        is, far less the teaching of &quot;not-self.&quot; The worthy Venerable 
        Mahasi Sayadaw has lucidly explained the doctrine in this <i>Anattalakkhaṇa 
        Sutta</i> to bring those who hold wrong conceptions back to the right 
        path.</p>
        <p align="left">Once, when I first arrived at Wetlet Masoyein Monastery, 
        the Venerable Sayadaw had gone to Wetlet town to deliver a sermon. While 
        conversing with Sayadaw, I happened to ask him:<i> </i>&quot;Might<i> 
        uccheda, </i>the doctrine of extinction after death, and </font><i><font face="CN-Times">Nibbāna</font></i><font face="CN-Times">, 
        which has a special feature, be construed as being the same?&quot;. To 
        this, the Sayadaw replied, &quot;Of course there is a difference. </font><i><font face="CN-Times">Nibbāna 
        </font></i><font face="CN-Times">has its own quality and attribute. How 
        could it not be special?&quot; As the conversation ended abruptly, I had 
        no chance to follow up with the question: &quot;What is its special 
        quality?&quot; The Sayadaw might have forgotten this insignificant 
        episode. However, when I was reading through this manuscript, I happened 
        to recollect that conversation as I came upon the special explanation 
        relating to </font><i><font face="CN-Times">uccheda and Nibbāna. </font></i><font face="CN-Times">On 
        page 35 of this present text, a clarification is made of the difference 
        between <i>ucchedadiṭṭhi, </i>the wrong belief that after death the 
        existence of a being is completely annihilated, and </font><i><font face="CN-Times">Nibbāna</font></i><font face="CN-Times">. 
        The believers of<i> </i>this false belief have erroneously thought that 
        the annihilation of existence and </font><i><font face="CN-Times">Nibbāna</font></i><font face="CN-Times"> 
        are the same, but this is entirely wrong. The two are, in fact, entirely 
        different.</p>
        <p align="left">Regarding <i>ucchedadiṭṭhi,</i> about the year 1971, 
        I managed to convene a congregation for hearing sermons on the </font><i><font face="CN-Times">Satipaṭṭhāna 
        Sutta</font></i><font face="CN-Times"> (the teaching on the Four 
        Foundations of Mindfulness). I invited the Mahasi Dhammakatthikas U 
        Samvara and U Zawtika to give my relatives and friends in my own native 
        village the opportunity to hear some teachings. I had arranged for 
        teachings to be given at Inchaung village, where many of my relatives 
        were then residing. At this congregation, one Maung Kyi was present 
        among the audience. This man, being a leader of the Red Flag Communist 
        Party, was a staunch believer in the doctrine of no new life after the 
        present one. It seemed that he had come over to join the congregation 
        out of sheer courtesy, as he happened to be one of my relatives. U 
        Samvara and the other teacher gave their sermons with his mental 
        attitude in mind. Since the teachings had some sort of bearing on him, 
        the audience of village folks was greatly interested.</p>
        <p align="left">As this man was asked to assume the role of attendant at 
        the time of delivering the Dhamma, it was no wonder that people were 
        interested, knowing him well as a person who held the wrong belief in 
        &quot;No Future Existence.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">The next day, early in the morning, Maung Kyi appeared 
        at a house where I had been invited for a meal offered by a donor. On 
        that occasion, Maung Kyi told me &quot;Sir, I accept the point of Dhamma 
        touched upon by U Samvara last night, but please do not mistake it that 
        I have become a convert, a believer in the doctrine of </font><i><font face="CN-Times">nāma</font></i><font face="CN-Times"> 
        (mind). Since you Buddhists believe in a next existence, your 
        meritorious deeds are all performed out of your craving for existence. 
        On our part, not having entertained with such a belief, we have no 
        craving whatsoever for existence. We have extinguish all such clinging 
        and attachment to existence&quot;. To this I remarked, &quot;This would 
        depend on one's view. According to Buddhism, desire and clinging to 
        existence will only cease or be rooted out when one becomes an Arahat. 
        Without being actually free of instinctive craving for existence, if one 
        believes that existence is completely annihilated after death, one will 
        go down to <i>Niriya</i>, the Nether World, in the next existence. With 
        the false belief of <i>uccheda</i> stuck in ones mind on the eve of 
        death, one would die with this consciousness. This is exactly in 
        accordance with what the Lord Buddha has taught.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">Although Maung Kyi had severed his ties with his 
        &quot;life existence&quot;, his wife, not being able to do so, started 
        making preparations for ordaining her grown-up children as novices <i>(s</i></font><i><font face="CN-Times">āmaṇera).</font></i><font face="CN-Times"> 
        Plunged in his bigotry, Maung Kyi said to his wife, &quot;You need not 
        do anything in my favor for my next existence. If you prefer to perform 
        the ceremony of ordaining the children into priesthood, you may do so on 
        your own. But when the </font><i><font face="CN-Times">sāmaṇera</font></i><font face="CN-Times">-to-be 
        are escorted to the monastery, I cannot possibly take the role of 
        benefactor by carrying the big begging bowl and the fan.&quot; In 
        retaliation to this statement, his wife said, &quot;Without a 
        benefactor, I cannot lead the would-be-</font><i><font face="CN-Times">sāmanera</font></i><font face="CN-Times">. 
        If you cannot act as a benefactor, I will have to hire someone to act as 
        benefactor and carry on with the performance of the necessary religious 
        rites&quot;. Having heard this, Maung Kyi, the great believer of <i>Uccheda</i> 
        Doctrine, became very perturbed and fidgety, and not being able to 
        tolerate or accept the presence of a hired benefactor in his place, was 
        said to have been put in a dilemma. I heard of this incident from the 
        lay devotees of the village.</p>
        <p align="left">I am fully confident that this great teaching on the <i>Anattalakkhaṇa 
        Sutta</i>, will, like the other teachings given by the illustrious 
        Mahasi Sayadaw, enhance the treasure of faith and bring about much 
        benefit to all the reading public.</p>
