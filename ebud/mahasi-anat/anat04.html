        <p>&quot;Monks, consciousness is not self ...&quot;.</p>
        </blockquote>
        </i>
        <p><font size="6">B</font>y consciousness is meant eye-consciousness, 
        ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, 
        touch-consciousness and mind-consciousness. These six kinds of 
        consciousness are held to be self, a living entity: &quot;It is I who 
        sees; I see.&quot; &quot;It is I who hears; I hear.&quot; In this way, 
        all six kinds of sense consciousness are attributed to one single self. 
        This kind of clinging is easy to understand: objects which are devoid of 
        cognition, such as logs of wood, lumps of earth, or stones, are regarded 
        as inanimate; only those objects invested with faculties of cognition 
        are regarded as animate, as living entities. It is not surprising that 
        eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness and so on are taken to be self, but 
        in fact they are not self, they are not living entities. The Blessed One 
        declared that consciousness is not self, and explained why as follows:</p>
        <i>
        <p>&quot;If consciousness were self, the inner substance, it would not 
        tend to afflict; it is not usual for self to oppress self. It should 
        also be possible to manage so as to have always wholesome states of mind 
        and not to have unwholesome ones. But in fact consciousness tends to 
        afflict and is not amenable to management and control. Thus it is not 
        self, not inner substance.</p>
        <p>&quot;Monks, in reality, consciousness is not self. Thus, it tends to 
        afflict and it is not possible to say of consciousness, 'Let my 
        consciousness be thus (always wholesome), let my consciousness be not 
        thus (unwholesome).&quot;'</p>
        </i>
        <p>Between mind <i>(citta)</i> and the fifty-two kinds of mental 
        concomitants <i>(cetasika),</i> most people are acquainted with mind.</p>
        <p>Burmese people talk about <i>citta</i>, mind, but they rarely speak 
        of the concomitants such as <i>phassa</i> (sense contact) that always 
        appear in conjunction with mind. Furthermore, they are attached to that 
        mind as &quot;I&quot;, self. &quot;It is I who sees, I see&quot;; 
        &quot;It is I who hears, I hear.&quot; Not only human beings but even <i>Devas</i> 
        and other creatures cling to the belief that consciousness is self. 
        However, conscious-ness is assuredly not self; not being self, it has a 
        tendency to oppress.</p>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">HOW CONCIOUSNESS OPPRESSES</font></b></p>
        <p>Consciousness oppresses when seeing what is repulsive and horrible, 
        when hearing unpleasant sound, unpleasant speech, when smelling foul, 
        offensive odors, when tasting bad food, when feeling uncomfortable 
        sensations of touch, when thinking of depressing, sad or fearful mental 
        objects.</p>
        <p>All beings like to dwell on pleasant sights, but they are forced to 
        face horrible and repulsive sights as circumstances dictate. For 
        unfortunate people, the majority of what is seen is made up of 
        undesirable objects. This is how eye consciousness tends to oppress. In 
        spite of their wishing to hear sweet sounds and sweet words, 
        circumstances may compel them to listen to unpleasant sounds. Stricken 
        with misfortune, they may be subjected to fearful noises, threats, and 
        abuse. This is the way ear-consciousness is oppressing. Again, all 
        beings like to enjoy nice, clean smells, but they have to also put up 
        with foul, fetid odors. This is how nose-consciousness oppresses.</p>
        <p>The oppressions by eye, ear and nose consciousness are not very 
        apparent in the human world, whereas in the animal world, the world of <i>petas</i> 
        and the hell realms, the oppressive nature of these kinds of 
        consciousness is very vivid. Creatures in the animal world are almost 
        constantly seeing horrible objects or hearing dreadful sounds, and those 
        existing in filth have to smell putrid, foul odors all the time. It goes 
        without saying that <i>petas</i> and beings in the Hell realms will fare 
        worse than animals. They are constantly submerged in distress, seeing 
        bad sights, hearing bad sounds, and smelling bad odors. In some Hell 
        realms, everything seen, heard, smelt, tasted, touched and thought about 
        is unpleasant; there exists nothing pleasant at all. Beings in such 
        realms are subjected to oppression all the time by the six kinds of 
        consciousness.</p>
        <p>All people like to enjoy good tastes, but unfortunate people have to 
        exist on bad food. This is how tongue consciousness oppresses. In this 
        respect, too, the oppression is more apparent in the four nether worlds. 
        Human beings like to feel only pleasant sensations; but when 
        circumstances do not allow, they have to put up with undesirable 
        experiences, say, for instance, when they are suffering from an illness. 
        At such times their suffering may be so oppressive that they yearn for 
        instant death to get release from it. It is far worse, of course, in the 
        four nether worlds.</p>
        <p>Human beings would like to have lives that are always carefree, but 
        circumstances do not let them live that way. Instead, there are many who 
        are gripped with depression, disappointment, sorrow and lamentation. 
        Some of them never get out of the trough of miseries and unhappiness 
        throughout their lives. They are victims of oppression by mind 
        consciousness.</p>
        <p>Consciousness is not subject to one's will. Arising as determined by 
        circumstances, it is unmanageable and uncontrollable. Although one may 
        wish for a pleasant sight, in the absence of pleasant objects one cannot 
        see one. On the contrary, when there are unpleasant objects around, and 
        when the eyes are kept open, it is unpleasant sights which are seen. 
        This is an example of how eye-consciousness, not being subjected to 
        one's will, arises of itself, dependent on conditions.</p>
        <p>Likewise, although one may wish to hear only pleasant sounds, in the 
        absence of pleasant objects of sound they cannot be heard. Hence the 
        necessity to keep oneself provided with a radio or a cassette recorder 
        to produce pleasant sound and voices when desired. Reluctant as we are 
        to hear undesirable sounds, when there are such sounds, inevitably they 
        will come to our ears. Ear-consciousness is thus unmanageable, arising 
        of itself, depending on conditions.</p>
        <p>In a similar manner, although we like to enjoy sweet aromas, if such 
        smells are not present, our wishes will not be fulfilled. Hence people 
        provide themselves with scents, perfumes and flowers. However unwilling 
        we may be to breathe in bad smells, when foul smells exist around us, we 
        have to suffer from them. They may even cause physical illnesses, such 
        as headache. This is how nose-consciousness is not amenable to will, 
        arising of itself in accordance with causes and conditions.</p>
        <p>Although we wish to enjoy good tastes, pleasant taste-consciousness 
        cannot arise in the absence of good food. It arises only when good food 
        is taken. Hence this wild pursuit after food, day in and day out. When 
        taken ill, one seeks relief and cure by taking bitter medicine, which we 
        do not, of course, relish. This is how tongue-consciousness arises, 
        uncontrollably and unmanageably.</p>
        <p>Touch consciousness can be pleasant only when there are pleasant 
        objects such as fine clothing, comfortable bedding and good seating. 
        Constant effort has to be made to acquire inanimate and animate objects 
        for delightful sensations of touch. When it is extremely hot or cold, or 
        when we are pricked by thorns, or injured by fire or weapons, or when we 
        are taken with severe illness, we have to suffer, however reluctantly, 
        from the effects of undesirable touch-consciousness. Thus 
        touch-consciousness is obviously uncontrollable, arising on its own in 
        accordance with causes and conditions.</p>
        <p>Everyone wants a happy, joyous, and contented life, but it can come 
        about only when we are provided with sufficient wealth and means. Hence 
        the necessity to constantly endeavor to maintain such a way of life. 
        While thus seeking our means of a comfortable, joyous life-style, 
        thoughts about difficulties in everyday life, about loved ones, husbands 
        and children who have died, about financial and business problems, about 
        old age and debility, may arise to mar our happiness. This is how mind 
        consciousness arises unmanageably and uncontrollably.</p>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">CAUSAL ARISING</font></b></p>
        <p>We have used the expression &quot;in accordance with causes and 
        conditions.&quot; The phrase refers to how circumstantial and 
        conditional causes produce certain results; it means also that good 
        causes will give good results, bad causes will end up in bad results. No 
        results can be brought about merely by desire. A given result will arise 
        from a given set of causes, whether one likes it or not. Results are 
        produced from respective causes and they are uncontrollable and 
        unmanageable. It is obvious, therefore, that they are not self, not 
        one's inner substance. The Blessed One therefore stated that mind 
        consciousness is not self, because it is not amenable to one's will.</p>
        <p>The Blessed One taught this way to enable us to get rid of the <i>sāmi 
        attā</i> clinging, which holds that there is a self inside one's person 
        which can be controlled and managed at will. When <i>sāmi attā</i> 
        clinging is removed, <i>nivāsī attā</i> clinging, the belief in a 
        permanent self residing in one's person, is simultaneously banished. 
        When it is realized that consciousness results only from conditioning 
        causes and that it soon disappears, it becomes obvious that there is no 
        such thing as a permanently enduring self. For example, 
        eye-consciousness arises only when there is eye and object of sight. 
        Likewise, ear consciousness can arise only when there are ear and sound; 
        smell-consciousness can only arise when there are nose and odor; 
        tongue-consciousness can arise only when there are tongue and taste; 
        body-consciousness only when there are body and tactile object; and 
        mental consciousness, only when there are mind and mental object. When 
        these conditional causes for their respective results are known, the 
        notion of a permanent entity, <i>nivāsī attā</i> clinging, is 
        discarded.</p>
        <p>The meditator who is taking note of corporeal and mental phenomena as 
        they occur will perceive clearly that consciousness is constantly 
        arising and vanishing, depending on conditions. Thus the meditator 
        clearly understands that there is no self or living entity which brings 
        about the act of seeing. He realizes that there is only 
        eye-consciousness which arises when the right conditions prevail. In 
        this way, the meditator abandons the <i>kāraka</i> <i>attā</i> 
        clinging, the belief that all actions, physical, vocal and mental, are 
        being done by a self.</p>
        <p>For those who cannot perceive the true nature of consciousness as it 
        really is, consciousness is held fast in the form of the notions of <i>sāmi 
        attā, nivāsī attā, or kāraka attā</i>. It appears that the 
        aggregate of consciousness is more firmly attached to than the other 
        aggregates. These days we call it soul or living entity. In everyday 
        language, consciousness is more commonly talked about as self than 
        feeling, perception and volitional formations, even though they are 
        mental concomitants. People talk as if it is the mind that feels 
        sensations, that recognizes things or causes actions.</p>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">THE STORY OF THE BHIKKHU SĀTI</font></b></p>
        <p>At the time of the Blessed One there was a disciple named Sāti who 
        mistook consciousness to be self, and clung to the wrong view of self. 
        The monk Sāti declared that he had understood and grasped what the 
        Buddha had taught thus:</p>
        <i>
        <p>Tadevidaṁ viññāṇaṁ sandhavati saṁsārāti anaññaṁ.</p>
        </i>
        <p>&quot;It is this same consciousness that has been transmigrating and 
        wandering about from existence to existence, no other.&quot;</p>
        <p>This was his understanding of the Buddha's teaching. He based his 
        views on the <i>Jātaka</i> stories such as King Vessantara, Chaddan the 
        elephant king, and Bhūridatta the Nāga king, who were said to be some 
        of the Buddha's previous existences. In his last existence as Buddha, 
        there were no material aggregates of King Vessantara, nor of the 
        elephant king or the Nāga king, but Sāti believed that the 
        consciousness of the last existence as Buddha was the same that had 
        existed previously as King Vessantara, the elephant king and the Nāga 
        king; it had remained undestroyed, enduring, and stable throughout the 
        rounds of existence. This was how he understood and transmitted the 
        Buddha's teaching. His belief was simply <i>nivāsī attā</i>, clinging 
        to consciousness as a continuous self.</p>
        <p>The learned disciples of the Buddha tried to explain to him that his 
        view was wrong, but Sāti remained adamant, believing that he knew the <i>Dhamma</i> 
        better than the other monks. It is not easy to point out the true <i>Dhamma</i> 
        to those holding wrong views. They are apt to look down on their 
        well-wishers as antiquated and behind the times, unlike their leader who 
        innovates a new interpretation. As a<b> </b>matter of fact, anyone 
        claiming to be of Buddhist faith should ponder well to see whether his 
        or her views are in accordance with the teaching of the Buddha. If we 
        hold onto views which do not accord with the Buddha's teaching, we are 
        then outside the dispensation.</p>
        <p>Having failed to persuade Sāti to abandon his wrong views, some of 
        the monks went and reported the matter to the Blessed One, who then sent 
        for Sāti. When asked by the Blessed One, Sāti repeated his views: 
        &quot;Based on the <i>Jātaka </i>stories as recounted by the Blessed 
        One, I see that the present consciousness is the same as that one which 
        had existed in previous lives. That consciousness has not reached 
        destruction but passed on from existence to existence. This is how I 
        understand.&quot;</p>
        <p>The Buddha asked him what he meant by consciousness.</p>
        <p>He replied, &quot;Lord, consciousness is that which expresses, which 
        feels, which experiences the fruits of good and bad deeds (now here, now 
        there) in this existence, in that existence.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;To whomever, you stupid one, have you heard me expounding the 
        doctrine in this manner?&quot; remonstrated the Blessed One. &quot;I 
        have explained consciousness as arising out of conditions; that there is 
        no arising of consciousness without conditions. In spite of that you 
        have wrongly interpreted my teaching and attribute that wrong view to 
        me. You have caused the arising of many bad deeds; your holding this 
        wrong interpretation of my teaching and so talking about it will cause 
        distress and suffering to you for a long time to come.&quot;</p>
        <p>Sāti, however, refused to give up that view. Dogmatic views are 
        frightening. Sāti was a monk, a disciple of the Buddha. He followed the 
        Buddha's teaching and claimed to have understood it. Yet we find him 
        obstinately refusing to give up his wrong views even when exhorted by 
        the Buddha himself, which of course amounted to not having faith in the 
        Buddha. Nowadays, too, there are some &quot;religious teachers&quot; 
        teaching that there is no need to keep the five precepts or to practice 
        meditation. They say it is enough just to understand the teaching. When 
        wellintentioned learned people try to point out the true teaching to 
        such &quot;teachers,&quot; they are said to have replied scornfully that 
        they would not abandon their views even if the Buddha himself came to 
        teach them.</p>
        <p>There are many instances where <i>non-Dhamma</i> is being handed 
        around as <i>Dhamma</i>. It is essential to scrutinize any such teaching 
        so as to weed out what is not the teaching, a<b> </b>concise statement 
        of which is given below:</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>SUMMARY OF THE TRUE DHAMMA</b></font></p>
        <i>
        <p>1. Sabba pāpassa akāraṇaṁ</i> -- To abstain from all evil 
        deeds. Physical misdeeds such as killing, stealing, and maltreating 
        should be avoided. Vocal evils of lying, slandering, and using offensive 
        language should also be avoided. Thinking evil thoughts should also be 
        abandoned. Evil thoughts can only be removed by engaging in the practice 
        of concentration and <i>vipassanā </i>meditation.</p>
        <p>Avoidance of all evil deeds, physical, vocal and mental, constitutes 
        the First Teaching of the Buddha.</p>
        <i>
        <p>2. Kusalassa upasampadā</i> -- To develop all forms of meritorious 
        deeds, such as giving alms, keeping precepts and practicing meditation. 
        Morality may be fulfilled to a certain extent by avoidance of evil deeds 
        in pursuance of the first teaching, but one does not become established 
        in the morality of the Noble Path by mere practice of abstinence. That 
        is accomplished only through the practice of <i>vipassanā</i> 
        meditation till the stage of access concentration or absorption 
        concentration.</p>
        <p>Some people talk disparagingly of concentration meditation. The 
        Blessed One himself, however, recom-mended cultivation of concentration 
        meditation. The concentration of <i>jhāna</i> is an ideal basis for the 
        development of <i>vipassanā</i> meditation. If even access 
        concentration is not attainable, one has to work for the momentary 
        concentration of <i>vipassanā meditation</i>. Once it is attained, the <i>vipassanā</i> 
        insights will become developed in their own sequence till the Noble Path 
        is accomplished.</p>
        <p>In the Buddha's dispensation, the most essential task is to acquire 
        the wholesome merits of <i>vipassanā</i> concentration and <i>vipassanā</i> 
        insight, since Noble Path and Fruition is unattainable without them. 
        Thus, in order to become equipped with the merits of the Noble Path and 
        Fruition, the good deeds of<i> vipassanā</i> meditation must be 
        developed. We cannot afford to ignore any form of meritorious deeds, as 
        the second teaching of the Buddha enjoins fulfillment of all the three 
        types of good deeds.</p>
        <p>We hear of &quot;new teachings&quot; which go against these first and 
        second teachings of the Buddha. The proponents of such teachings say, 
        &quot;The unwholesome defilements <i>(akusala kilesa) </i>do not exist 
        permanently; consequently, no effort is needed to dispel them. Likewise 
        no effort is needed to perform good deeds, keep precepts or practice 
        concentration and insight meditation. All these efforts are futile and 
        only produce suffering.&quot; It must be understood that all these new 
        teachings are diametrically opposed to the true teaching of the Buddha.</p>
        <i>
        <p>3. Sacitta pariyodapanaṁ </i>-- To keep one's mind pure. The Path 
        must be developed through practice of <i>vipassanā</i>. With the Path 
        developed thus, and Fruition attained, the mind is completely free of 
        defilements and hence absolutely pure. According to the Commentary, the 
        degree of purity to be attained is no less than that of an Arahat. This 
        statement is in full agreement with the Pāli texts. Nevertheless, there 
        are those who are doing harm to the dispensation by discouraging the 
        practice of keeping precepts, developing concentration and <i>vipassanā</i> 
        meditation, saying they are futile actions which will land one only in 
        suffering. &quot;Keep the mind rested, not engaged in any activity. 
        Place it in a blank spot in one's person where no unwholesome activities 
        are developing. In this way the mind will remain pure.&quot; This is a 
        teaching which is entirely devoid of reason, foundation and support. To 
        discourage the practice of <i>sīla</i>, <i>samādhi</i>, and <i>bhāvanā</i> 
        (morality, concentration, and wisdom cultivation) is to despoil the 
        Buddha's dispensation. It is impossible to keep one's mind pure without 
        the practice of concentration and insight meditation. Consciousness is 
        by nature insubstantial, uncontrollable and unmanageable. To assert that 
        mind can be kept as one wishes without the help of meditation is to 
        refute the <i>Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta</i>, which states that it is not 
        possible to say of consciousness, &quot;Let consciousness be thus, let 
        it not be thus.&quot; This is worth thinking about.</p>
        <p>The last sentence in this concise statement of the Teaching says: <i>Etaṁ 
        Buddhāna sāsanaṁ</i>. &quot;These three --namely, avoidance of 
        evils, promotion of all that is good, keeping the mind pure are the 
        Teachings of all the Buddhas.&quot; The Buddhist Dispensation 
        essentially constitutes these three factors. For the Dispensation to 
        endure, to prosper, one must avoid all evil deeds as far as possible and 
        others should be taught as far as possible to avoid evil deeds. One must 
        perform as far as possible meritorious deeds and teach others to do the 
        same. If someone is found teaching the <i>non-Dhamma</i>, &quot;Don't 
        avoid evil deeds; don't do good deeds,&quot; one must do the utmost to 
        prevent him from teaching such wrong views. One should purify one's mind 
        by practicing meditation and exhort others to do likewise. It is thus 
        for the purpose of safeguarding the teaching and promoting its 
        prosperity that we have to point out the wrong teaching and explain to 
        people how they have deviated from the right one.</p>
        <p>We have digressed somewhat from Sāti's story by mentioning the 
        dangers to the Dispensation from wrong teachings. To continue with the 
        story: When Sāti adamantly held to his wrong views, the Blessed One 
        addressed the monks:</p>
        <p>&quot;Have you ever heard me expounding the <i>Dhamma</i> in the way 
        Sāti expressed?&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;No, Lord. We have heard only that consciousness arises from 
        conditions, and that there is no arising of consciousness without 
        conditions.&quot;</p>
        <p>Then the Blessed One explained further:</p>
        <i>
        <p>&quot;Each consciousness arises because of its own conditions and is 
        named according to the condition through which it arises. On account of 
        the eye and visible objects arises a consciousness and it is called 
        eye-consciousness; on account of the ear and sounds arises a 
        consciousness and it is called ear-consciousness; on account of the nose 
        and odors a consciousness arises and it is called nose consciousness; on 
        account of the tongue and tastes arises a consciousness called 
        tongue-consciousness; on account of the body and tactile objects</i> <i>arises 
        a consciousness called tactile (body) consciousness; on account of the 
        mind and mind objects arises a consciousness called mental 
        consciousness. just as a fire that burns on account of wood is called a 
        wood fire, and one that burns on account of bamboo splinter, grass, cow 
        dung, paddy husk, or refuse, is called a bamboo fire, a grass fire, a 
        cow dung fire, a paddy husk fire or a refuse fire, just so is 
        consciousness named according to how it is conditioned.&quot;</p>
        </i>
        <p>In the <i>Sutta</i> concerning Sāti's view, the Blessed One also 
        gave a comprehensive treatment of the Law of Dependent Origination, but 
        I have no time to go into it here. I shall confine myself to dealing 
        more fully with the simile of fire.</p>
        <p>A forest fire might originate from burning of refuse or dried leaves. 
        If there is constant fuel supply and no one to extinguish the fire, it 
        will rage on for miles around. It might seem that the same fire 
        continues burning all the time, but careful observation will reveal that 
        the fire that burns the refuse is not the fire that burns the grass; 
        similarly grass fire is not a leaf fire. Among leaf fires, the fire that 
        burns one leaf is not the same as the one that burns another.</p>
        <p>In just the same way, eye consciousness and ear consciousness, which 
        normally appear to be one and the same consciousness, are seen by 
        careful observation to be distinct, separate consciousnesses arising 
        dependent on conditions. When we consider just one form of 
        consciousness, such as eye-consciousness, we will find different 
        consciousness arising from different colors, such as white and black. 
        Narrowing down to just one color, such as white, the vigilant meditator 
        who has advanced to the stage of <i>udayabbaya</i> <i>ñāṇa</i> and <i>bhaṅga 
        ñāṇa</i>, will see, in the seemingly continuous and single 
        consciousness of white color, preceding consciousness separate and 
        distinct from the succeeding ones.</p>
        <p>The distinction is more pronounced in the case of hearing than in 
        seeing; similarly, in smelling and tasting, each consciousness is noted 
        separately and distinctly. The most numerous note-taking and the most 
        pronounced distinction between each consciousness is involved in the 
        phenomenon of touching.</p>
        <p>When feeling pain, careful noting as &quot;pain, pain&quot; enables 
        one to distinctly see each consciousness of pain, moment by moment as it 
        arises. Similarly, mental consciousness of thought and ideas can be 
        noted separately as each consciousness arises.</p>
        <p>If any thought or idea intrudes while noting rising and falling of 
        the abdomen, it should be noted as it arises. Usually the intruding 
        thought or idea ceases as soon as its arising is noted, but if thoughts 
        persistently arise conditioned by the same mental objects, they should 
        be observed appearing turn by turn in sequence. When the attention moves 
        over to another mental object, the arising of separate consciousness is 
        very distinct.</p>
        <p>When the meditator can perceive the arising of each distinct 
        consciousness with each separate noting, he comes to realize personally 
        the impermanent nature of conscious-ness, its stressful nature due to 
        constant arising and vanishing, and its insubstantiality because of its 
        subjection to uncontrollable and unmanageable conditions. It is most 
        important to gain such personal realization.</p>
        <p>Having explained fully how the five aggregates are not self, I would 
        like to provide further illustrations on the subject. They are extracts 
        from the <i>Pheṇapiṇḍupama Sutta </i>of the<i> Khandhavagga, Saṁyutta 
        Nikāya:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Pheṇapiṇḍupamaṁ rūpaṁ vedanā pubbuḷūpamā<br>
          Marīcikūpamā saññā saṅkhārā kadalūpamā<br>
          Māyūpamañca viññāṇaṁ desitādiccabandhunā</i>.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>MATERIAL FORM LIKENED TO FROTH</b></font></p>
        <p>Material form, <i>rūpa</i>, is like the froth which we see floating 
        about in creeks and waterways, made up of air bubbles entrapped in 
        droplets of water. These bubbles congregate to form frothy scum, the 
        size of a human fist, a human head, the size of a man or even bigger. 
        Casually seen, a big mass of froth may appear to be of substance, but 
        when carefully observed, it turns out to be insubstantial, useless for 
        any purpose.</p>
        <p>Likewise, the human body, complete with head, trunk, hands and feet, 
        in male or female form, appears to be substantial. It seems permanent, 
        it looks beautiful, seemingly a living entity. But when subjected to 
        mental analysis, the body turns out to be just like a<b> </b>mass of 
        froth -- insubstantial, a mere conglomeration of thirty-two unclean 
        parts such as head-hair, body-hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, muscle, 
        and bone. On further detailed analysis, it is found to be a 
        conglomeration of minute subatomic particles, invisible to the naked 
        eye. It may be likened to a big pile of sand made up of minute 
        individual sand particles. Alternatively, we may take the example of 
        flour consisting of minute individual grains of rice or wheat powder. 
        When soaked with water it turns into dough, a substantial mass which can 
        be made quite big by using large amounts of flour. This substantial 
        dough may be shaped into a figure of a man of massive size but it is not 
        one solid mass, it is a conglomeration of fine grains of rice or wheat 
        powder. Similarly, the body is not one solid mass but made up of small 
        particles of matter massed together in one big heap -just like the mass 
        of froth, it is devoid of inner substance.</p>
        <p>There is no permanent core, no beautiful substance, no living entity 
        called &quot;self.&quot; The visible material qualities form a<b> </b>part 
        of the body. Remove those visible qualities and the body will become 
        devoid of shape and form. The earth element of extension <i>(paṭhavi)</i> 
        forms that part of the body which is manifested in the sense of touch as 
        rough, smooth, hard or soft. The elements of heat or cold and motion 
        form the other parts of the body. Remove these three elements and the 
        human body which can be touched and felt will no longer exist. The 
        material quality of odor also forms a constituent part of the body. The 
        human body can therefore be sensed by its odor; remove that too and 
        nothing remains by which the human body may be recognized or identified.</p>
        <p>We see things because we have the sensory organ of eye; without it 
        the body cannot see anything, it is blind. We also have<b> </b>the 
        sensory organ of ear which enables us to hear; the sensory organ of nose 
        which enables us to recognize smell; the sensory organ of tongue which 
        enables us to recognize taste; and the nervous system of the body with 
        which we receive the sensation of touch. All these small but useful 
        constituent material qualities congregate to assume the form and shape 
        of a human body, and all contribute to its utility. Without them, the 
        human body would have no utilitarian value. As a matter of fact, without 
        these constituent parts the human form as such cannot exist.</p>
        <p>As stated above, if these constituent parts are pulverized or 
        disintegrated, the human body will no longer exist. All that remains 
        would be fine particles of matter. Furthermore, these sensitive material 
        qualities, such as eye and visual objects, do not exist permanently, 
        they are always arising and vanishing, the new replacing the old. Thus 
        this body is like a lump or mass of froth, a conglomeration of 
        insubstantial material qualities.</p>
        <p>When examining and analyzing the body, one should start from where 
        phenomena most clearly manifest. When walking, the material qualities of 
        extension and<b> </b>motion are most prominent. Therefore, in accordance 
        with the <i>Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta</i> -- <i>gacchanto vā gacchāmīti 
        pajānāti</i> --&quot;When going, he knows 'I am going', -- the 
        meditator should take note, &quot;going, going&quot;, 
        &quot;raising&quot;, &quot;stepping out&quot;, &quot;dropping&quot;. 
        While standing, the meditator should note, &quot;standing, 
        standing&quot;, while sitting, &quot;sitting, sitting&quot; 
        &quot;touching, touching&quot;, &quot;rising&quot;, &quot;falling&quot;, 
        and so on. When the limbs are seen, it should be noted as &quot;seeing, 
        seeing,&quot; when body odors are smelt, &quot;smelling, smelling,&quot; 
        when limbs are moved and stretched, &quot;stretching, stretching&quot;, 
        &quot;moving&quot;, &quot;changing&quot;. Carefully noting in this way, 
        the<b> </b>concentration gets stronger and the meditator realizes that 
        an<b> </b>act of going consists of desire to go, followed by motion and 
        expansion. Acts of standing and sitting are made up of desire to stand 
        or sit followed by a series of motions and expansions. Likewise with 
        bending, stretching and changing postures. In an act of seeing, there is 
        eye consciousness and visual object; in smelling, nose consciousness and 
        odor. Each phenomenon is seen to arise for the moment, only to instantly 
        pass away. The limbs, hands and feet, the head and the shape of the body 
        are no longer felt and recognized as such. They appear merely as 
        recurrent physical processes, incessantly arising and passing away. At 
        that stage, the meditator comes to understand by himself how the body is 
        like a mass of froth.</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>FEELING LIKENED TO A BUBBLE</b></font></p>
        <p>Feeling is likened to an air bubble. When rain drops fall<b> </b>on 
        the water surface, little pockets of air become trapped in the 
        surrounding wall of water, forming minute bubbles. Children produce 
        similar bubbles in play, by blowing softly through a blow pipe. The 
        conglomeration of these minute bubbles forms a mass of froth.</p>
        <p>These bubbles are formed as rain drops fall on the surface of the 
        water only to vanish instantly. Feeling, the experience of sensations, 
        is likened to bubbles because of its nature of incessant arising and 
        perishing. This is in conformity with what meditators experience, but at 
        variance with what ordinary people assume. The ordinary person's view, 
        on looking long at a beautiful object, is that the pleasant sight 
        remains for a long time. When an unpleasant sight has been seen for some 
        time, they also see it as long lasting. Neutral objects, neither 
        pleasant nor unpleasant, are also thought to last long, to remain 
        permanently. In a similar manner, whatever is pleasant or unpleasant to 
        hear is believed to be enduring. Painful feelings, in particular, are 
        thought to remain for days, months or years. Thus, the ordinary person's 
        view of feeling is not quite what really happens. Feeling quickly 
        vanishes like a bubble. To personally realize this truth, one must 
        constantly observe the psycho-physical process happening inside the 
        body.</p>
        <p>While ardently observing the psycho-physical process, the meditator's 
        perception will progress to the stages of <i>udayabbaya</i> and <i>bhaṅga 
        ñāṇā</i>, seeing that whatever is pleasant or unpleasant to see, 
        hear, or smell vanishes instantly. The passing away of painful feeling 
        is especially vivid. When the painful feeling is observed as 
        &quot;painful, painful&quot;, it is seen to perish with each noting. At 
        the stage of <i>sammasana ñāṇa</i> painful feeling becomes more 
        vividly and more frequently noticed. At each noting, the pain from each 
        place of observation vanishes, now from one place, then from another, as 
        if instantly removed by hand.</p>
        <p>Thus for the meditator whose concentration is strong, a pleasant 
        sight vanishes as soon as it is noted. But since there is eye and visual 
        object, the sight is seen again. Every time it is seen, it is noted and 
        quickly vanishes. The same process takes place with unpleasant objects 
        and neither pleasant nor unpleasant objects. Disappearance of pleasant, 
        unpleasant and neither pleasant nor unpleasant sensations of sound with 
        each noting is more distinct. Sensations of smell also disappear when 
        noted. Taste sensations are specially vivid to the meditator: the 
        delicious taste he feels while chewing the food keeps on vanishing and 
        arising with each act of noting. Pleasant, unpleasant and neither 
        pleasant nor unpleasant sensations of touch, too, arise and vanish when 
        noted in this way.</p>
        <p>Similarly, feelings of unhappiness, sorrow, sadness, happiness and 
        gladness will be seen, when subjected to heedful noting, to vanish 
        quickly. Thus feelings are just like bubbles, ephemeral and 
        untrustworthy -- impermanent, suffering and not-self.</p>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">SENSE PERCEPTION LIKENED TO A MIRAGE</font></b></p>
        <p>Sense perception, the apprehension of sense-objects as reality, is 
        likened to a mirage. A mirage is an optical illusion caused by 
        atmospheric conditions. It commonly appears as images of sheets of water 
        or houses in the hot gases that rise from the earth in the midday sun of 
        the last month of the summer. Mirages are optical illusions. Wild beasts 
        such as deer roam about in the summer heat in search of water. Seeing 
        what appears to be a body of water in the distance, they run towards it 
        only to find a dry tract: they have been misled by a mirage and put to a 
        great deal of trouble.</p>
        <p>Just as a mirage gives the illusion of a body of water or of houses 
        where no such things exist, so also <i>saññā</i> (perception) 
        deceives people into thinking that whatever is seen, heard, touched or 
        known is a human being, a man or a woman. With their illusory 
        perceptions of what is seen, heard, touched or known, people become 
        involved in multiple activities concerning them, just like the deer of 
        the wild forests who go after a distant mirage, taking it to be a mass 
        of water.</p>
        <p>To realize that perception is illusory and to save oneself from the 
        sufferings of pursuing after nonexistent objects, one must take heedful 
        note of all material and mental phenomena as they occur. As 
        concentration improves, it is seen that in every phenomenon there are 
        only the material object known and the mind knowing it; later it becomes 
        known that each phenomenon is a related event of cause and effect. 
        Finally it is personally experienced that the knowing mind, as well as 
        the object to be known, keep on perishing while they are being noted.</p>
        <p>Thus what was formerly held by <i>saññā</i> to be enduring, 
        permanent, an individual, a being, a man, a woman, or a self, is now 
        seen as a deception, an optical illusion, like a mirage. The meditator 
        realizes that in reality it is merely a process of incessant arising and 
        vanishing, impermanent, suffering and not-self.</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>SANKHĀRA LIKENED TO A PLANTAIN TREE</b></font></p>
        <p>Volitional formations are likened to a plantain trunk. A plantain 
        trunk looks like an ordinary tree, with a solid, hard core, but when cut 
        up and examined, it is found to be made up of layers of fibrous material 
        with no substantial, inner core. Volitional formations are like the 
        plantain trunk, void of inner substance. They consist of fifty kinds of 
        mental concomitants, headed by <i>cetanā</i>, volition. The outstanding 
        members of this group are sense-contact <i>(phassa)</i>, attention <i>(manasikāra)</i>, 
        one-pointedness of mind <i>(ekaggatā)</i>, initial application of mind <i>(vitakka), 
        </i>sustained application of mind <i>(vicāra),</i> effort <i>(viriya)</i>, 
        greed <i>(lobha),</i> hatred <i>(dosa)</i>, delusion <i>(moha)</i> 
        conceit <i>(māna),</i> wrong view <i>(diṭṭhi)</i>, doubts <i>(vicikicchā),</i> 
        non-greed, non-hatred, non-delusion, faith <i>(saddhā),</i> mindfulness 
        <i>(sati),</i> loving kindness <i>(mettā)</i>, compassion <i>(karuṇā)</i>, 
        and sympathetic joy <i>(muditā):</i> all are mental concomitants 
        forming <i>saṅkhāra</i>. <i>Cetanā</i>, responsible for all 
        volitional activities (physical, vocal and mental), is its leading 
        member. There are many volitional formations and, being involved in all 
        activities, they are very prominent. Thus volitional formations are 
        mainly responsible for the <i>attā</i> clinging to the notion of self 
        as an active agent.</p>
        <p>Volitional formations appear to possess a hard core or inner 
        substance, but in reality they are devoid of such inner substance. The 
        meditator can see this reality by constantly taking note of corporeal 
        and mental phenomena. While walking, for instance, the meditator notes 
        &quot;walking, walking&quot;, and &quot;raising&quot;, 
        &quot;stepping&quot;, &quot;dropping&quot;. As concentration becomes 
        stronger he comes to notice the arising of the desire to walk or take a 
        step. This desire is also observed to arise and vanish. Although desire 
        to go is usually described as &quot;having a mind to go, &quot; it is 
        actually volitional formations under the guidance of <i>cetanā </i>that 
        motivates the action of going. Urged on by <i>cetanā</i>, the act of 
        walking, involving raising, stepping and dropping, is accomplished.</p>
        <p>Before such knowledge is gained, there was the notion that it is 
        &quot;I&quot; who wants to go -- &quot;I go because I want to go&quot; 
        -- which is clinging to self. Now that the desire to go is seen to be 
        impermanent, the knowledge appears that there is no self, only 
        phenomena. The desires to bend, to stretch, to move, or to change 
        position are also seen in this true light. In addition, the efforts put 
        in to fulfil these desires are also momentary volitional formations. It 
        is realized that they are void of essence, not self, mere fleeting 
        phenomena.</p>
        <p>Further it is seen that when thinking, <i>vitakka,</i> investigation, 
        <i>vicāra</i>, and effort, <i>viriya</i>, are noted as they arise, they 
        vanish instantly. Thus they are also devoid of essence. As greed and 
        aversion make their appearance, they are noted as &quot;wanting&quot;, 
        &quot;liking&quot;, &quot;anger&quot;, and they soon disappear, 
        establishing the fact that they are also not self, having no essence or 
        hard core. When faith, loving- kindness and compassion arise they are 
        noted as they are. They vanish instantly and are therefore 
        insubstantial, void of essence, not self. This analytical knowledge 
        brings home the fact that volitional formations are like a plantain 
        trunk, which, when cut open and examined layer by layer, has no solid, 
        inner core.</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>CONSCIOUSNESS LIKENED TO A CONJURER'S TRICK</b></font></p>
        <p>Becoming conscious of something is like producing a conjuror's trick. 
        When seeing an object, a person ordinarily knows that he sees a man or a 
        woman; he also knows that &quot;I see; it is I who sees.&quot; When 
        hearing anything too, he knows, &quot;I hear a man's voice, I hear a 
        woman's voice.&quot; &quot;I hear, it is I who hears.&quot; Smelling an 
        odor, he knows. &quot;This is the smell of such and such a person,&quot; 
        &quot;I smell;&quot; when eating, he knows, &quot;This food is prepared 
        by such and such a person, it is I who eats.&quot; When touching he 
        knows, &quot;I have touched so and so, it is I who touches.&quot; In 
        thinking, too, he considers, &quot;I think, it is I who thinks.&quot; To 
        know, to become conscious of things in this manner is not knowing things 
        as they truly are. judged from the standpoint of the ultimate truth it 
        is knowing wrongly. Such wrong knowledge is not brought about by the 
        five <i>viññāṇas</i>, namely, eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, 
        nose-consciousness, tongue consciousness, and body consciousness. These 
        five <i>viññāṇa</i> cognize only what is ultimately true, namely 
        visible sight, sound, smell, taste and bodily feeling, not as the 
        misconceptions of man or woman. But misconceptions, such as of man or 
        woman, are liable to occur at the end of a full process of cognition <i>(citta 
        vithī), </i>when reflection takes place with the arising of mind 
        consciousness <i>(mano viññāṇa).</p>
        </i>
        <p>I shall briefly explain the process of cognition with respect to 
        seeing and the process of reflection. If the eye has caught sight of 
        visible form, the flow of <i>bhavaṅga </i>is interrupted, to be 
        followed immediately by <i>pañca-dvāravajjana</i> (advertence through 
        one of the five senses; in this case <i>cakkhudvārāvajjana</i>: 
        apprehension through the eye door), the consciousness that turns to and 
        considers the sensation. Immediately afterwards the pure eye 
        consciousness arises <i>(cakkhuviññāṇa),</i> the first cognition of 
        the sensation of sight. As yet there is no reflection about it in 
        conventional terms such as man or woman. As that consciousness ceases, 
        it is followed by recipient consciousness, <i>sampaṭicchana,</i> a 
        moment of reception of the object seen. After its cessation comes the 
        investigating consciousness, <i>santīrana</i>, the momentary 
        examination of the object so received. After this comes the stage of 
        determining whether the object seen is pleasant or not with the 
        determining consciousness, known as <i>voṭṭhāpana</i>. When this 
        consciousness ceases, there arises the impulsive or active consciousness 
        called <i>javana</i>, seven times in rapid succession. With the 
        cessation of the last <i>javana</i>, comes the registering 
        consciousness, <i>tadālambana</i>, which is repeated twice on the 
        object of attention. At the expiration of this registering 
        consciousness, the process of cognition is complete and there follows a 
        series of <i>bhavaṅga</i>, passive states of mind like that in deep 
        sleep.</p>
        <p>To recapitulate: the consciousness that arises from the <i>bhavaṅga</i> 
        state is the mind door consciousness <i>(āvajjana);</i> it is followed 
        by eye consciousness and recipient consciousness <i>(sampaṭicchana)</i>. 
        Then comes the investigat-ing consciousness <i>(santīraṇa),</i> 
        followed by the determining consciousness <i>(voṭṭhāpana)</i>. Then 
        follows the impulsions <i>(javana</i> consciousness) seven times in 
        rapid succession; then the registering consciousness <i>(tadālambana)</i> 
        appears twice in succession. Thus, every time a sight is seen, from the 
        appearance of the sense-door consciousness to the cessation of the last <i>tadālambana</i>, 
        there are altogether fourteen thought moments in a normal process of 
        cognition. If the impression of the object is not very strong, it 
        survives only as far as the consciousness in its <i>javana</i> stage. 
        When a person is very enfeebled, near death's door, <i>javana</i> 
        consciousness occurs only five or six times. When the impression of the 
        object is very obscure, the process of cognition runs up to the stage of 
        <i>voṭṭhāpana</i>, after two or three thought moments of which the 
        process of cognition comes to an end. When <i>vipassanā</i> is very 
        strong, the process does not advance till the <i>javana</i> stage, it 
        abruptly ends after two or three thought moments of <i>voṭṭhāpana </i>and 
        sinks back to the <i>bhavaṅga</i> level. This is in accordance with 
        the meditation instructions given to the Venerable Pothila by the young 
        novice [*], who instructed that the process of cognition with respect to 
        five sense doors should not proceed to <i>javana</i> state.</p>
        <p>[* Reference is to a story in the <i>Dhammapada </i>Commentary. It 
        tells of a senior learned <i>bhikkhu</i> who takes teaching from a 
        young, enlightened novice. The novice gives the analogy of a man 
        catching a lizard that has gone into a termite mound with five holes in 
        it. In order to catch the lizard, the man must close off five of the 
        holes and wait at the only remaining hole to catch the lizard. In the 
        same way, the meditator &quot;closes off' (that is, restrains) the five 
        senses and puts all his attention on the mind door.]</p>
        <p>As stated above, in the process of cognition through the eye door, 
        the object is only the ultimate visible sight, not the conceptual form 
        of a man or a woman. After running the complete process, the mind sinks 
        down to the <i>bhavaṅga</i>, which runs its course for some moments. 
        Then the process of cognition through the mind door, <i>manodvāravithī</i>, 
        arises through reflection on whatever has been seen. Arising from <i>bhavaṅga, 
        </i>the mind door apprehending consciousness, <i>manodvārāvajjana</i>, 
        appears, followed by the <i>javana</i> process which runs for seven 
        moments and the <i>tadālambana</i> consciousness which lasts for two 
        moments. The whole course, therefore, runs for ten thought moments after 
        which it sinks down to <i>bhavaṅga </i>level again. In this thought 
        process, the (mental) object is just a reflection on the sight that has 
        been seen, it is not yet based on any wrong concept of previous 
        experiences.</p>
        <p>When the reflective process of cognition takes place for the second 
        time, it is the concept of form and appearance that have become its 
        object -- the form and appearance of a man or a woman, say. When the 
        process is repeated for the third time, it is the concept of name (of 
        man and woman) that has become the object. From then onwards, every time 
        there is a reflection on what has been experienced previously, the 
        object is always simply a concept: &quot;I see a man&quot;. &quot;I see 
        a woman&quot;. This is how consciousness plays conjuring<b> </b>tricks 
        and substitutes concepts for realities.</p>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">SUMMARY</font></b></p>
        <p>1<b>. </b>In the first process of cognition of sight, consciousness 
        registers only the ultimate reality of visual object.</p>
        <p>2. In the first round of reflection on the visual object, there is 
        still consciousness of what has actually been seen, namely the sight. No 
        misconception has appeared yet. If heedful noting is done at this stage, 
        wrong concepts cannot arise and cognition will rest only on the ultimate 
        object.</p>
        <p>3. In the second round of reflection, the concepts of form and shape 
        (features) of visual object begin to appear.</p>
        <p>4. In the third round of reflection, the concept of identity of 
        visual object has appeared. Likewise in the process of cognition of 
        sound, odor, taste and touch, the same sequence<b> </b>of transition 
        from consciousness of reality to consciousness of concept takes place.</p>
        <p>When consciousness of sight and sound arises, or when the first round 
        of reflection on what has been seen or heard takes place, if careful 
        noting (as &quot;seeing,&quot; &quot;hearing,&quot; 
        &quot;smelling,&quot; &quot;tasting,&quot; &quot;touching&quot; or 
        &quot;thinking&quot;) is done instantly, wrong concepts cannot arise. 
        The consciousness will rest on the reality of what is actually cognized. 
        Keeping consciousness with reality is the <i>raison d'Åtre</i> for 
        taking note of sensory awareness at the instant it arises. If note is 
        taken as &quot;seeing, seeing&quot; while an object is being seen, the 
        process of cognition will cease just with the fact of seeing, and the 
        subsequent process of cognition of concepts acquired through reflection 
        cannot take place. In accordance with the teaching <i>diṭṭhe</i> <i>diṭṭhamattaṁ 
        bhavissati, </i>&quot;just seeing at the time of seeing&quot; 
        consciousness of seeing ends its course there.</p>
        <p>There follows the analytical knowledge of the unknowing matter, such 
        as eyes and sounds, of the body and the knowing mind which is 
        consciousness of the objects. There is also knowledge that seeing and 
        noting recurrently arise and vanish. Realization comes that there is 
        only impermanence, suffering and not-self.</p>
        <p>Similarly with what is heard, smelt, tasted, touched or thought 
        about: constant noting of these phenomena will reveal the difference 
        between physical and mental properties, and their impermanent, stressful 
        and not-self nature. Realization comes to the meditator: 
        &quot;Previously, because there was no taking note of the phenomena, 
        wrong concepts were believed to be reality; the conjuring tricks were 
        accepted as reality. Now that the phenomena are noted as they are, there 
        is no perception of any self, there is only incessant arising and 
        ceasing.&quot;</p>
        <p>When seeing an object, the eye consciousness vanishes immediately 
        after it has arisen, there is no such thing as seeing for a long time. 
        There is only fresh arising of eye consciousness with each act of seeing 
        and its instant ceasing. Likewise with hearing, touching, and thinking. 
        There is no substantial hearing. With each act of hearing, the ear 
        consciousness arises and instantly vanishes. There is no sustained 
        touching: at each act of touching, the touch consciousness arises and 
        instantly vanishes. There is no sustained thinking; with each act of 
        thinking, the mind consciousness arises and instantly vanishes.</p>
        <p>Therefore everything is impermanent. Arising is always followed by 
        cessation; there is nothing reliable, trustworthy, only terror and 
        suffering. Everything happens as conditioned by causes and conditions, 
        not as one wishes: all things are not self. It is obvious from this <i>Pheṇapiṇḍupama 
        Sutta</i> that the five aggregates are void of permanent substance, or 
        any wholesome, pleasant inner core which is subservient to one's will. 
        They are not self, they are insubstantial.</p>
        <p>I have amplified these points sufficiently, and shall end the 
        discourse here today.</p>
