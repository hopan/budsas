        <p><font size="6">T</font>his is the exhortation to contemplate feeling 
        analytically under eleven headings, so as to bring out its impermanent, 
        suffering and not self characteristics. Here, past feeling means the 
        sensations experienced in previous existences as well as those 
        experienced days, months or years ago in this very life. There are also 
        those experienced in the earlier part of today. Of these, it is obvious 
        that the feelings of past existences have all ceased to exist, but to 
        those with strong attachment to self, this will not be so obvious: they 
        hold to the view that the self that experienced the sensations of 
        previous existences continues to experience them now. In their view, all 
        the sensations of earlier times in the present existence have not 
        perished and ceased. They believe that the self that had enjoyed 
        sensations before is still enjoying them now.</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>FEELING IN THE THREE PERIODS OF TIME</b></font></p>
        <p>If unpleasant feelings such as stiffness, heat, or pain appear while 
        contemplating the rising and falling of the abdomen, the meditator takes 
        note of them. When thus noted, the unbearable feeling gets less and less 
        painful and then vanishes.</p>
        <p>When the concentration is specially strong, it will be seen that each 
        pain passes away with each noting. Perceiving thus, the meditator 
        realizes for himself that feelings are not everlasting, they do not 
        endure even for a second, but are incessantly arising and vanishing. It 
        is not only feelings of previous existences that are no longer present, 
        but also earlier feelings of the present existence. The feelings which 
        manifested only a moment ago are also no longer in existence. All these 
        are realized by the observing meditator, who sees also that the 
        pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral feelings, which are being experienced 
        at the present moment are constantly arising and vanishing. Hence it can 
        be surmised that feelings which will arise in the future will also 
        vanish at the moment of arising. During meditation practice, the 
        contemplation is carried out thus:</p>
        <p>1. Feelings of stiffness, heat, pain and discomfort which were 
        experienced a moment ago did not reach the present moment of comfortable 
        feeling. They passed away at the moment of feeling stiff, hot, painful 
        and uncomfort-able. As they passed away in this manner, they are 
        impermanent. And because they are impermanent and unbearable, they are 
        fearsome, a source of suffering. The comfortable feelings of a moment 
        ago did not reach the present moment of intense discomfort, they passed 
        away at that very moment of comfortable feeling, and are therefore 
        impermanent. Since they are impermanent, they are fearsome and a source 
        of suffering. All feelings, pleasant or unpleasant, are not self, 
        without essence.</p>
        <p>2. The pleasant or unpleasant feelings of the present repeatedly 
        cease and vanish even while they are being noted and are, therefore, 
        impermanent, suffering and not self.</p>
        <p>3. The pleasant or unpleasant feelings of the future too will cease 
        and vanish at the moment of their arising. They are, therefore, 
        impermanent, suffering and not self.</p>
        <p>This is how feelings of the past, present and future are considered 
        as they are being noted. There is also a method of reflecting on the 
        feelings of the past and the future by inference from the feelings of 
        the present:</p>
        <p>&quot;Just as there are now impermanent feelings, pleasant, 
        unpleasant and neutral, which cease even as they are being noted, there 
        have been similar feelings before, perishing at the moment of their 
        arising. They are therefore impermanent, suffering and not self. The 
        feelings which will come into being in the future will also pass away at 
        the moment of arising and are thus impermanent, suffering and not 
        self.&quot;</p>
        <p>Having perceived for ourselves how our feelings pass away, there 
        remains the task of considering by inference the feelings in other 
        people, and the feelings in the whole world:</p>
        <p>&quot;Just as the feelings in myself cease and vanish while they are 
        being noted, the feelings in other people, indeed the feelings in the 
        whole world, will also cease and vanish. They too, are impermanent, 
        suffering and not self.&quot;</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FEELINGS</b></font></p>
        <p>&quot;Just as material form is considered in two aspects, internal 
        and external, the internal material form not becoming external material 
        form and vice versa, so also feeling should be considered in two 
        aspects, internal and external,&quot; states the <i>Visuddhimagga</i>. 
        The feeling from inside does not reach outside; the feeling from outside 
        does not reach inside. This is how it should be contemplated. The 
        question arises: Does this mean feelings from inside us not reaching the 
        body of another person and other people's feelings not reaching our 
        body? Nobody believes that feelings go from one person to another, so 
        this manner of contemplation is not meant here. What is meant here is 
        change of object, from internal to external and vice versa.</p>
        <p>When feeling that has arisen dependent on an internal object is 
        replaced by feeling that has arisen dependent on an external object, 
        people ordinarily think that the internal feeling has become an external 
        one. Conversely when pleasant or unpleasant feelings conditioned by an 
        external object are replaced by pleasant or unpleasant feelings 
        dependent on an internal object, people think that the external feeling 
        has become an internal one. Similarly, when feelings arising from an 
        object far away change to feelings dependent on a near object, people 
        think that feeling has moved from a far distance to nearby and vice 
        versa. What is meant here, therefore, is change of objects, external and 
        internal, far and near, dependent on which feelings arise.</p>
        <p>The meditator who is noting the corporeal and mental phenomena as 
        they occur takes note of the pain when an unpleasant feeling arises in 
        the body. While doing so, if the mind passes on to an external object 
        and feelings of happiness or sorrow subsequently arise, these feelings 
        should be noted as happiness or sorrow. Thus, during this time of 
        careful noting, the original feeling of unpleasant-ness does not reach 
        outside, it ceases internally. Then attention is switched on to an 
        external object which causes the arising of new feeling. The meditator 
        thus understands these phenomena.</p>
        <p>He fully understands also when the reverse process takes place; that 
        is, the original feeling of happiness, for example, arising from an 
        external object, ceases, and new feeling of pain is experienced 
        internally. Internal feeling does not reach outside; external feeling 
        does not reach inside. Feelings arise and cease at the respective 
        moments of becoming and are thus impermanent, suffering and not-self.</p>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">COARSE AND FINE FEELINGS</font></b></p>
        <p>If we begin to feel subtle painful feelings while experiencing gross 
        sensations of pain, we tend to believe that the gross sensations have 
        changed into subtle ones. From experiencing subtle pains, when the 
        feeling becomes very grossly painful, the belief is that the subtle 
        pains have grown into gross pains. The watchful meditator, however, sees 
        with every noting that painful sensations perish, part by part, section 
        by section, and therefore knows that the subtle pains have not changed 
        into gross ones, nor the gross ones into subtle ones. The old feelings 
        perish and are replaced by new ones arising in their place. This is 
        impermanence. The meditator realizes all this through his own knowledge.</p>
        <p>Gross pains do not become subtle pains and vice versa. They perish at<b> 
        </b>their respective moments of arising. Thus, feeling is impermanent, 
        suffering and not self.</p>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">INFERIOR AND SUPERIOR FEELINGS</font></b></p>
        <p>Painful sensations in the body are regarded as inferior forms of 
        feeling whereas fine, pleasant sensations are regarded as superior 
        kinds. Likewise, unhappiness, sorrow, dejection, and sadness are 
        inferior feelings, while happiness and gladness are of the superior 
        kind. In other words, feeling angry, depressed and unhappy is inferior 
        feeling; feeling happy is superior feeling. But here again, happiness 
        from delighting in sensual objects is inferior to happiness from 
        devotional piety towards an object of worship, such as the Buddha. As 
        the experiences of feeling change from one type to another, people 
        usually think that the inferior feeling has become a superior one, or 
        the superior feeling has changed into one of inferior type. But the 
        meditator perceives that the feelings cease even as they are being 
        noted, and therefore knows that superior feeling does not become 
        inferior, nor does inferior feeling become superior. They perish at the 
        moment of their arising and are, therefore, impermanent.</p>
        <p>The pain of inferior feeling does not become the happiness of 
        superior feeling. Nor does the superior feeling become inferior feeling. 
        They cease at the moment of their arising and are impermanent, suffering 
        and not-self.</p>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">FAR AND NEAR FEELINGS</font></b></p>
        <p>We have already dealt with considerations of feelings far and near: 
        feelings arising from distant objects do not become feelings dependent 
        on near objects; feelings with regard to near objects do not become 
        feelings concerned with distant objects. They cease at the moment of 
        experiencing them and so they are impermanent, suffering and not-self.</p>

        <p>The Blessed One said:</p>
        <b><i>
        <p>Ya kāci saññā, atītānāgatapaccuppannā ajjhattā vā bahiddhā 
        vā oḷārikā vā sukhumā vā hīnā vā paṇītā vā yā</i></b> <b><i>dūre

        <p>&quot;All perceptions, whether past, future or present, internal or 
        external, gross or fine, inferior or superior, far or near should be 
        seen with one's own knowledge, as they truly are, thus: ‘This is not 
        mine, this I am not, this is not my self'.&quot;</p>
        </i>
        <p>This is the exhortation to analyze perception under eleven headings 
        -- past, future, present, internal, external, gross, fine, inferior, 
        superior, far or near-so as to bring out its impermanent, suffering and 
        not-self nature. Here, past perception means the perceptions experienced 
        in previous existences as well as those experienced previously in this 
        life time. Of these past perceptions, it is obvious that perceptions of 
        previous existences have long ceased to exist. However, to those with 
        strong attachment to self, this may not be so obvious because of their 
        view that the same self that recognized and remembered things in 
        previous existences continues to recognize and remember things now; that 
        all acts of recognizing have been done and are being done by the one 
        self, the same self; that in this lifetime too, what was recognized in 
        younger days or very recently is always the work of one and the same 
        self.</p>
        <p>The meditator who is ever watchful of the rising and falling of the 
        abdomen and the phenomena that arise at the moment of sensory 
        impingement finds that the perception of sound disappears at once when 
        noted as &quot;hearing, hearing;&quot; the perception of sight vanishes 
        when noted as &quot;seeing, seeing;&quot; so also the perceptions of 
        thoughts and ideas disappear as soon as they are noted as thoughts or 
        ideas. Observing thus, realization comes through personal knowledge that 
        perception is not everlasting; it does not last even one second and has 
        the nature of incessantly ceasing. Let alone perceptions perceived in 
        previous existences, even in the present life, perceptions experienced 
        in past moments are no longer existent, they have all ceased and 
        vanished. This the meditator can see for himself. Even the perceptions 
        that occurred only a moment ago have passed away. So also have the 
        perceptions based on the acts of seeing, hearing and touching in the 
        present moment. They are repeatedly arising and vanishing. Thus it can 
        be concluded that perceptions arising in the future will also disappear 
        at the moment of their becoming.</p>
        <p>During meditation practice, the nature of perception is analyzed as 
        follows:</p>
        <p>1. The perceptions which recognized sense objects a moment ago do not 
        reach the present moment; they disappeared even while recognizing. 
        Therefore they are impermanent, suffering and not-self.</p>
        <p>2. The perceptions which are recognizing and remembering things now 
        also perish while actually recognizing. Therefore, they are impermanent, 
        suffering and not-self.</p>
        <p>3. The perceptions which will recognize things in the future will 
        also vanish at the time of recognizing and they are therefore 
        impermanent, suffering and not self. Perceptions of the past and the 
        future and of the whole world can be inferred from the knowledge of the 
        perceptions which manifest at the time of noting. just as the 
        perceptions are ceasing as they are being noted in the present, so also 
        the perceptions of the past vanished as they occurred and are therefore 
        impermanent, suffering and not self. Likewise the perceptions arising in 
        the future will also disappear at their respective moments of occurrence 
        and are therefore impermanent, suffering and not self. The perceptions 
        in one's person, in other people, and in the whole world also vanish at 
        the moments of their arising and are all impermanent, suffering, not 
        self.</p>
        <p>That the perceptions (which recognize and remember things) are 
        impermanent is quite obvious if we just reflect on how easily we forget 
        things we have studied or once memorized.</p>
        <p>Perceptions with regard to one's own body do not reach the moment of 
        perceiving external objects; perceptions on outside bodies do not last 
        till internal objects are perceived -- they perish at the respective 
        moments of their arising and are therefore impermanent, suffering and 
        not self.</p>
        <p>Perceptions with regard to desire and craving, anger and 
        transgression, conceit, wrong view, doubts and misgivings, are all 
        unwholesome, they are perceptions of the gross type. Perceptions with 
        regard to devotional piety towards the Blessed One, a <i>Dhamma</i> 
        discourse, good advice and instructions from teachers and parents are 
        fine, subtle types of perception, they are perceptions of the superior 
        type. The gross types belong to the inferior class of perceptions. In 
        other words, recognition of prominent, coarse objects is<b> </b>coarse 
        perception; recognition of fine objects is subtle perception.</p>
        <p>Coarse perceptions do not reach the moment of occurrence of fine 
        perceptions; fine perceptions do not reach the moment of occurrence of 
        coarse perceptions. They vanish at the respective moment of occurrence 
        and are impermanent, suffering and not-self.</p>
        <p>Inferior perceptions do not reach the moment of occurrence of 
        superior perceptions; so also superior perceptions do not reach the 
        moment of occurrence of inferior perceptions. They vanish at the 
        respective moments of occurrence and are impermanent, suffering and 
        not-self.</p>
        <p>Recognizing and remembering distant, fine objects is called 
        perception of the far distance; recognizing coarse, near objects, 
        objects in one's person, is called near perception. A distant perception 
        does not reach the moment of occurrence of a near perception; a near 
        perception does not reach the moment of occurrence of a distant 
        perception. They vanish at the moment of arising and are impermanent, 
        suffering and not-self.</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>ELEVENFOLD ANALYSIS OF VOLITIONAL FORMATIONS</b></font></p>
        <p>The Blessed One stated:</p>
        <b><i>
        <p>Ye keci saṅkhārā atītānāgatapaccuppañña ajjhattā vā 
        bahiddhā vā oḷārikā vā sukhumā vā hīnā vā paṇītā vā ye

        </i></b><i>
        <p>&quot;All volitional formations, whether past, future or present, 
        internal or external, gross or fine, inferior or superior, far or near, 
        should be seen with one's own knowledge, as they truly are, thus: ‘This 
        is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self'.&quot;</p>
        </i>
        <p>This is the instruction to contemplate volitional formations 
        analytically under eleven headings so as to bring out their impermanent, 
        suffering and not-self nature.</p>
        <p>Here it should be noted that there are many <i>dhammas</i> classified 
        under <i>saṅkhārakkhandha</i>. We have already stated that apart from 
        feeling and perception, the remaining fifty kinds of mental concomitants 
        come under the classification of <i>saṅkhārakkhandha</i>. In brief, <i>saṅkhāra</i> 
        are the motivating forces behind physical, vocal and mental activities. 
        They are responsible for the changes between the four bodily positions 
        of walking, standing, sitting and lying down. <i>Saṅkhāra</i> give 
        the commands: &quot;Now go, now stand, now sit down.&quot; They also 
        initiate actions such as bending, stretching, moving and smiling. It is 
        also these <i>saṅkhāra</i> which cause vocal actions, just as if they 
        were ordering, &quot;now say this.&quot; They are also responsible for 
        acts of thinking, seeing and hearing.</p>
        <p>Thus, <i>saṅkhāra</i> of past existences -- the wish to go, stand 
        or speak -- could not come over to the present existence, could they? 
        Did they not all perish and pass away, then and there? It is obvious 
        that the desires to do, take or think in previous existences have now 
        entirely vanished. But those who cling firmly to the belief, &quot;It is 
        I who is doing all actions; all actions are being done by me,&quot; are 
        attached to the idea of a single self. &quot;It is I who has done all 
        the actions in the previous existence; the doer in the present existence 
        is also I&quot;. For them, I the doer is everlasting.</p>
        <p>To the meditator who is constantly watching the rise and fall of the 
        abdomen, when an itchy feeling is felt, he notes &quot;itching, 
        itching&quot;. While noting thus, if the desire to scratch the itchy 
        spot arises, he immediately notes, &quot;desire to scratch, desire to 
        scratch.&quot; The <i>saṅkhāra</i>, namely the desire to scratch, is 
        seen to disappear every time it is noted. Also while noting, 
        &quot;stiff, stiff&quot; because of a feeling of stiffness, if the 
        desire to bend or stretch appears, it has to be noted. Thus the <i>saṅkhāra</i>, 
        namely the desire to bend, to stretch or change posture, perishes when 
        noted, and keeps on perishing.</p>
        <p>In this manner, the volitional formations of wishing to change, to 
        talk or to think are seen to be constantly ceasing.</p>
        <p>For the meditator, not only volitional formations of past existences, 
        but presently forming volitional formations are seen to be constantly 
        perishing. Thus he knows that volitional formations of past existences 
        have not come over to the present, that present volitional formations 
        will not go over to the future, and that future volitional formations 
        will not move over to a later time; they vanish at the moment of 
        arising. He realizes with his own knowledge that volitional formations 
        are impermanent, suffering and not self.</p>
        <p>In meditation practice, volitional formations are contemplated as 
        follows:</p>
        <p>1. The intention to step out with the right foot of a moment ago does 
        not reach the moment of intending to step out with the left foot; the 
        intention to step out with the left foot of a moment ago does not reach 
        the moment of intending to step out with the right foot: they perish and 
        vanish at the respective moments of arising, and are, therefore, 
        impermanent, suffering and not-self. Similarly, the volitional 
        formations of the past do not reach the present moment. They perish at 
        the moment of their arising and are impermanent, suffering and not-self.</p>
        <p>2. The presently forming volitional formations of desiring to do or 
        of careful noting do not reach the next moment. They are always 
        dissolving as they are formed and are impermanent, suffering and 
        not-self.</p>
        <p>3. The volitional formations which will arise in the future 
        concerning the desire to do and careful noting will also cease without 
        reaching a later future time. They are consequently impermanent, 
        suffering and not-self</p>
        <p>With the knowledge of the volitional formations which occur at the 
        time of noting, the volitional formations of the past, the future and of 
        the whole world can be inferred in the same manner.</p>
        <p>Just as the impermanent volitional formations of wishing to do and 
        noting are perishing even while being noted, so also did the volitional 
        formations of the past vanish at the time of occurrence. They are, 
        therefore, impermanent, suffering and not-self. Likewise, the 
        voli-tional formations of the future will also disappear at the 
        respective moments of occurrence and are, therefore, impermanent, 
        suffering and not self. The volitional formations of one's own person or 
        in other people, and indeed the whole world, also perish and vanish, 
        just like the volitional formations which are being noted at the present 
        moment. They are all impermanent, suffering and not-self.</p>
        <p>The differentiation between internal and external volitional 
        formations is the same as the one we have described for feelings and 
        perceptions: volitional formations on an internal object are internal; 
        those developed concerning an external object, that is, thoughts of 
        acquiring or destroying external objects, animate or inanimate, are 
        external.</p>
        <p>Volitional formations concerning an internal action cease before 
        reaching the moment of thinking of an external action. Therefore they 
        are impermanent, suffering and not-self. Similarly with respect to 
        volitional formations concerning external actions.</p>
        <p>Thinking of doing a rough action is a coarse type of volitional 
        formation; contemplating doing fine, subtle deeds is a fine type of 
        volitional formation.</p>
        <p>Volitional formations of the coarse type do not become volitional 
        formations of the fine type, and vice versa. They perish at the moments 
        of arising and are impermanent, suffering and not-self.</p>
        <p>All kinds of thinking about and performing bad deeds are inferior 
        volitional formations. Thinking of and doing meritorious deeds are 
        superior volitional formations. Among meritorious deeds, the act of 
        keeping precepts is superior to acts of charity, meditation is superior 
        to keeping precepts, and insight meditation is superior to concentration 
        meditation.</p>
        <p>Inferior volitional formations do not reach the moment of arising of 
        superior volitional formations; superior volitional formation too, do 
        not reach the moment of arising of inferior volitional formation. They 
        perish at the respective moments of their arising and are therefore 
        impermanent, suffering and not-self.</p>
        <p>The volitional formations of charitable deeds do not reach the moment 
        of arising of the volitional formations of keeping precepts, and vice 
        versa. The volitional formations of keeping precepts do not reach the 
        moment of arising of volitional formations of meditation, and vice 
        versa. The volitional formations of the development of concentration 
        meditation do not reach the moment of arising of volitional formations 
        of insight meditation, and vice versa. They all vanish at the moment of 
        their arising and are therefore impermanent, suffering and not-self.</p>
        <p>Contemplation on the volitional formations of unwholesome and 
        wholesome deeds is very subtle, but the ardent meditator can see from 
        his own personal experience how these volitional formations keep on 
        vanishing at their respective moments of arising. For instance, while 
        noting the rise and fall of the abdomen, if desirous thoughts arise, the 
        meditator notes that phenomenon as &quot;wanting, desiring.&quot; When 
        noted thus, the desirous thoughts vanish before reaching the moment of 
        the wholesome deed of noting. The meditator who has advanced to the 
        stage of<i> bhaṅga ñāṇa</i> knows this phenomenon clearly as it 
        is. When the meditator feels glad over an act of charity, he should 
        note, &quot;glad, glad&quot;. When noted in this way, the meditator who 
        has reached the stage of <i>bhañga ñāṇa</i> sees clearly the 
        volitional formations of the wholesome deed of contemplating on charity 
        vanish before reaching the moment of noting. In addition, when random 
        thought arises while noting the rise and fall of the abdomen, it should 
        be noted. When thus noted, the volitional formation of noting, the rise 
        and fall vanishes without reaching thc moment of arising of the random 
        thought; the volitional formation of random thought also vanishes 
        without reaching the moment of reaching it as a random thought. In this 
        manner, the meditator perceives each and every volitional formation 
        perishing before it reaches the moment of arising of another volitional 
        formation. If the meditator does not perceive the phenomena in the way 
        described, it must be said that he has not yet reached the stage of 
        development of that type of <i>ñāṇa.</p>
        </i>
        <p>Volitional formations of thoughts arising from distant objects do not 
        reach the moment of thoughts on near objects, and vice versa. They all 
        vanish at the respective moments of their arising and are, therefore, 
        impermanent, suffering and not-self.</p>

        <p>&quot;All consciousness, whether past, future or present, internal or 
        external, gross or fine, inferior or superior, far or near, should be 
        seen with one's own knowledge, as it truly is, thus: ‘This is not 
        mine, this I am not, this is not my self'.&quot;</p>
        </i>
        <p>This is the instruction to analyze consciousness under eleven heads 
        so as to clarify its impermanent, suffering and not-self nature.</p>
        <p>In Chapter VI it was explained that contemplating on impermanence is 
        the same as contemplating on &quot;this I am not,&quot; contemplating on 
        suffering is the same as contemplating on &quot;this is not mine&quot; 
        and contemplating on not-self is the same as contemplating on &quot;this 
        is not myself.&quot;</p>
        <p>Of the four mental aggregates, <i>viññāna</i>, conscious-ness or 
        mind, is the most prominent. Mental concomitants, such as desire and 
        hatred, are described as &quot;mind&quot; in everyday language: 
        &quot;desiring mind,&quot; &quot;liking mind,&quot; &quot;hating 
        mind.&quot; In the Commentaries, too, expositions are given first in 
        mind, then only are they followed by the mental concomitants. Here also 
        we propose to elaborate on mind to a considerable extent.</p>
        <p>Past consciousness may be the mind of previous lives; it may also be 
        the mind which occurred during younger days or which happened in all the 
        intervening days, months or years since then. Even today, there was the 
        mind which arose prior to the present moment. Amongst all these possible 
        types of past consciousness, it should be very obvious that the mind of 
        the past existences has not come over to the present life, that it 
        ceased in those existences. But for those with strong attachments to 
        self, it is not easy for such knowledge and understanding to arise, 
        because they hold to the view that <i>viññāṇa</i>, consciousness, 
        is a soul or self, a living entity. According to them, when the old body 
        of past existences breaks up and perishes, the <i>viññāṇa</i> 
        leaves it and transmigrates to a new body, where it remains from 
        conception in the mother's womb till the time of death, when it again 
        leaves to a fresh body in a new existence. This belief has been fully 
        described in the story of Sāti in Chapter IV.</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>THE REBIRTH PROCESS</b></font></p>
        <p>As meditators experience for themselves, mind does not last even for 
        a second; it is incessantly arising and vanishing. How it arises and 
        vanishes has also been described in the discussion on the processes of 
        cognition. As explained there, for each existence, at the approach of 
        death, <i>maraṇasaññā vithī</i> consciousness (the mental process 
        at death) arises , with <i>kamma</i>, kamma-sign <i>(kamma-nimitta)</i> 
        or destination-sign <i>(gati-nimitta)</i> as object. This is how it 
        arises: from the life continuum consciousness <i>(bhavaṅga)</i> arises 
        the sense door consciousness, the <i>āvajjana citta, </i>which 
        apprehends sensations. This <i>citta</i> reflects on a good or bad 
        action performed during one's lifetime <i>(kamma),</i> or a sign or 
        symbol associated with that action <i>(kamma-nimitta)</i>, or a symbol 
        of the place in which one is destined to be reborn <i>(gati-nimitta)</i>. 
        After this <i>citta </i>has ceased, the active consciousness, <i>javana</i>, 
        holding on to that object, arises five times. At the cessation of <i>javana</i> 
        consciousness, holding on to the same object, the registering 
        consciousness of <i>tadālambana</i> happens for two thought moments, at 
        the end of which <i>bhavaṅga</i> consciousness appears, lasting for 
        one or two thought moments. After that, the consciousness or mind comes 
        to termination for that particular existence and the last <i>bhavaṅga 
        citta </i>is known as <i>cuti citta, </i>death consciousness.</p>
        <p>As soon as the <i>cuti citta </i>ceases, depending on the wholesome 
        or unwholesome <i>kamma</i> which manifested at death's door, and the 
        objects that appeared just prior to death, the new consciousness arises 
        in a new existence. This consciousness is called the re-linking 
        consciousness <i>(paṭisandhi citta), </i>because it forms a link with 
        the past existence. As this <i>paṭisandhi citta </i>ceases, a series 
        of <i>bhavaṅga citta </i>arises. When sense objects such as sights and 
        sounds present themselves at the sense doors, the series of <i>bhavaṅga 
        citta </i>ceases and sense door consciousness followed by sense 
        consciousness, such as eye consciousness or ear consciousness, arises. 
        This is actually what is happening when you see or hear. According to 
        this process, mind appears one by one in a continuous series, each fresh 
        mind<i> (citta)</i> arising then vanishing. The <i>cuti</i> <i>citta </i>of 
        the last existence ceased then and there. The consciousness of the 
        present life is a new one, arisen afresh, conditioned by previous <i>kamma</i>. 
        Every <i>citta</i> is a fresh arising, not a renewal of the old one. 
        Thus the meditator who watches the phenomena of rise and fall takes note 
        of a thought as it appears. When thus noted, the thought or the thinking 
        mind at once disappears. Perceiving this phenomenon, the meditator 
        concludes that death means the termination of the continuity of mind 
        after the last <i>cuti citta </i>has ceased. Similarly, new becoming 
        means the first arising of a fresh series of <i>cittas </i>in a new 
        place in a new existence, <b>j</b>ust as the present mind arises afresh 
        all the time. <i>Bhavaṅga citta </i>is the continuous arising, 
        depending on <i>kammic</i> force, of similar fresh mind, starting with 
        the very first mind at the moment of conception. The mind which knows 
        the phenomenon of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching and 
        thinking arises afresh from the life continuum consciousness. In this 
        way the meditator knows how mind arises and perishes and from this 
        personal experience he can infer about the death consciousness, <i>cuti 
        citta, </i>and re-tinking consciousness, <i>paṭisandhi citta.</p>
        </i>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>THE LAW OF DEPENDENT ORIGINATION</b></font></p>
        <p>To know that fresh mind arises conditioned by <i>kamma</i> is to know 
        the Law of Dependent Origination through the knowledge of rounds of <i>kamma</i> 
        and <i>kamma</i> <i>result</i>. Thus we find in the <i>Visuddhimagga</i>: 
        &quot;Having discerned the conditions of corporeal and mental properties 
        in this way (that there is no doer, nor one who reaps the deed's 
        results, just phenomena proceeding according to cause and effect) by 
        means of the rounds of <i>kamma</i> and <i>kamma result</i>, and having 
        abandoned uncertainty (‘Is there soul, self?' ‘Why has self 
        arisen?', etc.) about the three periods of time, then all past, future 
        and present <i>dhammas</i> are understood by him in accordance with 
        knowledge of death and the rebirth linking processes.&quot;</p>
        <p>Here, in this manner of discernment, &quot;by means of the round of <i>kamma</i>&quot;<i> 
        </i>includes causes such as ignorance <i>(avijjā),</i> craving <i>(taṇhā),</i> 
        clinging <i>(upādāna)</i> and volitional formations <i>(saṅkhāra).</i> 
        In addition, by discerning the first rebirth linking consciousness and 
        the last death consciousness, all the consciousnesses that have arisen 
        in between in the course of one existence become known. Also, by knowing 
        all the consciousnesses with respect to the present life, the 
        consciousnesses with respect to the past and future existences can also 
        be discerned. Knowing the mind is knowing the mental concomitants that 
        accompany the mind and also the material base on which mind is 
        dependent. Therefore the <i>Visuddhimagga</i> says, &quot;all past, 
        future and present <i>dhammas</i> are<b> </b>understood by him&quot;.</p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE THREE TIME PERIODS</b></font></p>
        <p>As the meditator knows in this way that starting from rebirth 
        consciousness a continuous series of mind (moments) arises and vanishes, 
        it is clear to him that the mind of previous existences ceased then and 
        there and does not reach this existence. It is clear also that the minds 
        of the present existence cease at the respective moments of their 
        becoming. Therefore the meditator is in a position to discern all past, 
        future and present minds with his personal knowledge.</p>
        <p>To the meditator, if thoughts arise while noting the rise and fall<b> 
        </b>of the abdomen, he notes the fact thus, &quot;thinking, 
        thinking.&quot; In this way the thoughts vanish. When he hears, he 
        notes, &quot;hearing, hearing&quot; and the ear consciousness instantly 
        disappears. He does not think, as ordinary people do, that he keeps on 
        hearing for a long time. He finds that he hears intermittently -- 
        hearing, disappearing, hearing, disappearing -- the ear consciousness 
        vanishing in successive instants.</p>
        <p>Likewise when noting touch consciousness, it is seen to quickly<b> </b>disappear. 
        When concentration is specially strong, the eye consciousness can be 
        seen arising and vanishing in quick succession. Nose consciousness and 
        taste consciousness should be considered in the same way. The noting 
        mind is also perceived to be alternately noting and disappearing. In 
        short, with every noting, both the object noted and the knowing mind are 
        seen arising and vanishing. To the meditator who is seeing clearly in 
        this way, eye consciousness does not reach the moment of noting, 
        thinking or hearing, it vanishes at the instant of seeing. He realizes 
        it is impermanent. Similarly, noting mind, thinking mind, and hearing 
        mind do not reach the moments of seeing, they disappear at the 
        respective moments of noting, thinking and hearing. Hence, the meditator 
        realizes they are impermanent:</p>
        <p>1. The eye consciousness, ear consciousness, touch consciousness and 
        thinking mind which appeared moments ago do not reach the present 
        moments of seeing, hearing, touching and thinking. They passed away and 
        are therefore impermanent, suffering and not-self.</p>
        <p>2. The eye consciousness, ear consciousness, touch consciousness and 
        thought consciousness which are presently arising do not reach the next 
        moment of seeing, hearing, touching and thinking. They cease now and are 
        therefore impermanent, suffering and not-self.</p>
        <p>3. The eye consciousness, ear consciousness, touch consciousness and 
        thought consciousness which will arise in the future will not reach the 
        moment next to that future instant. They will perish and are therefore 
        impermanent, suffering and not-self.</p>
        <p>Knowing personally in this way how consciousness arises and vanishes 
        in one's body, it can be inferred that, just like the consciousness 
        which has been noted, all the consciousnesses which remain to be noted, 
        consciousnesses in other people and in the whole world, are arising and 
        vanishing.</p>
        <p>We have considered all types of consciousness, but there remains 
        consideration of consciousness from other aspects, such as internally 
        and externally.</p>
        <p>The consciousness which already has an internal object does not reach 
        an external object; the consciousness which has external object does not 
        reach an internal object. While being fixed on the respective objects, 
        consciousness ceases and is therefore impermanent, suffering and 
        not-self.</p>
        <p>Angry mind is coarse; other types of mind are fine in comparison. 
        Among angry minds, those which are violent enough to cause murder, 
        torture, destruction to other's properties, or abusive, threatening 
        language are coarse; ordinary irritated mind is fine, subtle. Greedy 
        mind is soft compared to angry mind, but the greedy mind which is 
        intense enough to cause stealing or wrong acts, or low, vulgar language 
        is coarse. Ordinary desire or wish is fine. Deluded mind is mild 
        compared to the greedy mind or the angry mind, but the deluded mind 
        which finds fault with and shows disrespect to the true <i>Buddha, 
        Dhamma</i> and <i>Saṅgha</i> is coarse. Ordinary doubting mind and 
        scattered mind are subtle. More subtle than all these unwholesome minds 
        are the wholesome minds, and amongst the wholesome minds, gladness and 
        rapture are coarse, while the mind which is unmoving and concentrated is 
        fine.</p>
        <p>The meditator who is engaged in constant noting perceives the arising 
        and vanishing of coarse as well as fine minds-that the coarse mind does 
        not reach the moment of arising of a fine mind, and the fine mind does 
        not reach the moment of arising of the coarse mind. They vanish at the 
        respective moments of their arising.</p>
        <p><b><font color="#000080">CONTEMPLATION ON MIND ACCORDING TO THE 
        SATIPAṬṬHĀNA SUTTA</font></b></p>
        <p>While the meditator is contemplating the rise and fall of the 
        abdomen, if the mind arises with lust, he notes it as mind with lust. 
        This is knowing the mind with lust as it truly is -- <i>sa rāgaṁ vā 
        cittaṁ sa rāgaṁ cittanti pajānāti</i> -- in accordance with the <i>Satipaṭṭhāna 
        Sutta</i>. When noted thus, the mind with lust ceases and is followed by 
        a continuous stream of mind made up of the <i>kusala</i> (wholesome) <i>citta</i> 
        of noting and the active <i>(kiriyā),</i> resultant <i>(vipāka) </i>and 
        skillful impulse <i>(kusala javana) </i>minds <i>(citta)</i> which are 
        concerned with mundane acts of seeing, hearing and so on. These 
        wholesome, active and resultant minds are noted as they arise in seeing, 
        hearing, touching and knowing. This is knowing the mind without lust, 
        wholesome, active, resultant and neutral <i>cittas</i>, as it truly is, 
        in accordance with the <i>vītarāgaṁ vā cittaṁ vītarāgaṁ 
        cittanti pajānāti</i> of the <i>Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta</i>. Noting 
        and knowing the mind with lust as well as the mind without lust in this 
        manner is contemplation of the mind with mindfulness.</p>
        <p>I would like to touch upon the exposition given in the Commentary. 
        The Commentary defines the mind with lust as eight kinds of 
        consciousness accompanied by greed. This is the enumeration of lustful 
        minds. Thus if the mind is lustful, it must be one of the eight kinds of 
        consciousness rooted in attachment. However, just to consider that the 
        occurrence of eight kinds of consciousness rooted in attachment is known 
        as <i>sarāga</i>, mind with lust, does not amount to the contemplation 
        on mind with mindfulness.</p>
        <p>Further, <i>vītarāga</i>, mind without lust, is defined as mundane 
        wholesome mind, and neutral mind. The Commentary states that because 
        supramundane <i>citta</i> is the object for consideration by insight 
        knowledge <i>(vipassanā</i> <i>ñāṇa),</i> it is not classified as <i>vītarāgaṁ</i>, 
        mind without lust, <i>vītadosa</i>, mind without ill-will or <i>vītamoha</i>, 
        mind without delusion.</p>
        <p>Likewise, neither of the two kinds of consciousness rooted in 
        ill-will and the two rooted in delusion is classified as mind without 
        lust.</p>
        <p>At one time, before I had any knowledge of meditation, I was assailed 
        by doubt as to why the consciousness rooted in ill-will and that rooted 
        in delusion were not classified as mind without lust. Only when I had 
        acquired knowledge through meditation practice did I understand just how 
        natural and right the Commentary exposition was. When the mind with lust 
        is noted, it at once ceases and in its place arise only wholesome, 
        active, resultant and neutral <i>cittas; </i>it is not usual for 
        ill-will and delusion to arise then. Therefore at that time only the 
        wholesome <i>citta</i> which is involved in noting or the neutral 
        resultant <i>(vipāka abyākata), </i>neutral averting <i>(āvajjana 
        abyākata) cittas </i>involved in acts of sense awareness and the 
        skilful impulse <i>citta</i> are contemplated.</p>
        <p>Thus the definition of <i>vītarāga</i>, mind without lust, as 
        neutral wholesome <i>(kusala abyākata) citta </i>is very natural and is 
        in keeping with what meditators find in their personal experience.</p>
        <p>When ill-will arises in the course of noting the rise and fall of the 
        abdomen, it has to be noted. The ill-will vanishes at once and in its 
        place there arises the wholesome <i>citta </i>of the act of noting the 
        neutral and wholesome impulse <i>cittas </i>of the acts of seeing and so 
        on. The meditator knows this mind without ill-will by noting it too. 
        When the mind with delusion, that is, doubtful or distracted mind, 
        appears, they are noted as usual and they disappear. In their place 
        arise the wholesome <i>citta</i> of the act of noting, and the neutral 
        and wholesome impulse <i>cittas </i>of the acts of seeing. The meditator 
        knows this mind without delusion, <i>vītamoha</i>, by noting.</p>
        <p>Further, when sloth and torpor arise during noting the rise and fall 
        of the abdomen, these have to be noted as &quot;sloth,&quot; 
        &quot;torpor.&quot; They vanish at once and mindfulness arises in<b> </b>their 
        place. This is noted by the meditator before he reverts to noting the 
        rise and fall of the abdomen.</p>
        <p>Again, while noting the rise and fall of the abdomen, if distraction 
        and restlessness appear, they are noted as &quot;distraction,&quot; 
        &quot;restlessness.&quot; When noted thus, restlessness disappears, the 
        mind remains still and tranquil. This state of mind is also to be noted.</p>
        <p>When the concentration is good, and the mind rests on the object 
        under contemplation, this quiet mind is also known automatically. When 
        restlessness appears, it is then noted and the mind becomes still again. 
        All these changes in the state of mind are heedfully noted. A mind which 
        is noted and contemplated on is said to be <i>vimutta</i>, free of 
        defilements. A mind which remains to be noted and contemplated upon is <i>avimutta</i>, 
        not free of defilements. The meditator takes note of all these states of 
        mind.</p>
        <p>This is how mind is contemplated as taught by the Blessed One in the <i>Satipaṭṭhāna 
        Sutta</i>. According to this practice, minds with lust and desire, 
        ill-will, distraction, and restlessness are all of the coarse variety. 
        When free of those coarse minds, there arise in their place wholesome 
        and neutral <i>cittas</i>, which are fine minds. Therefore, the 
        meditator engaged in watching phenomena as they take place perceives 
        that the coarse mind does not reach the moment of fine mind and so on. 
        They vanish at the respective moments of their arising and are 
        impermanent, suffering and not-self.</p>
        <p>The classification of mind according to inferior and superior status 
        is similar to the classification of inferior and superior volitional 
        formations. The inferior unwholesome <i>citta</i> does not reach the 
        moment of arising of wholesome neutral <i>citta; </i>the superior 
        wholesome mind also does not reach the moment of arising of the inferior 
        unwholesome <i>citta</i>. They cease at the moments of their respective 
        arising and are, therefore, impermanent, suffering and not-self. The 
        wholesome <i>citta </i>of generosity does not reach the moment of 
        arising of wholesome <i>citta</i> of moral precepts or of meditation. 
        The wholesome <i>citta </i>of moral precepts does not reach the moment 
        of arising of wholesome <i>citta</i> of meditation, and vice versa. The 
        concentration meditation <i>citta</i> does not reach the moment of 
        insight meditation; the insight meditation <i>citta</i> does not reach 
        the moment of concentration meditation. They all cease and pass away at 
        the respective moments of their arising.</p>
        <p>The ordinary person not used to noting the phenomena of sensory 
        awareness thinks that when he looks from a distant object to a near one, 
        the mind which sees the distant object comes closer to him. When he 
        looks from a near object to a distant one, he thinks the mind has gone 
        away to a distance.</p>
        <p>Similarly when hearing a nearby sound while listening to a distant 
        sound, it is presumed that the mind which listened to the distant sound 
        has moved nearer; when hearing a distant sound while listening to a 
        nearby sound, it is presumed that the mind which hears the nearby sound 
        has moved away to a distance. When, while smelling a distant smell, an 
        internal odor is smelt, it is thought that the mind from afar has come 
        nearer. When, while smelling the odor of one's body, an odor from 
        outside is smelt, the mind which is nearby appears to have gone afar.</p>
        <p>While tactile sensation is being felt at a distance, for instance, on 
        the feet, and another tactile sensation is felt on one's breast, the 
        distant sensation appears to have moved closer, and vice versa. While 
        thinking of a distant object, one thinks of a nearby object and it 
        appears that the distant mind has come nearer, and vice versa. In short, 
        it is the general belief that there is only one permanent mind which 
        knows everything near and far.</p>
        <p>The meditator who notes every phenomenon of seeing, hearing, 
        smelling, tasting, touching and thinking knows with his own knowledge 
        that the mind from afar does not come nearer; the near mind does not go 
        afar. At respective moments of arising, they cease and pass away.</p>
