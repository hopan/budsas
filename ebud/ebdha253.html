      Venerable Ananda, the Buddha's personal attendant, spent twenty- five 
      years with the Buddha serving him. The Buddha asked him several times to 
      strive hard and attain enlightenment. He had known all the Dhamma and 
      theories of meditation. However, as he enjoyed serving the Buddha and 
      other fellow bhikkhus, he neglected his own attainment of enlightenment 
      until finally a great pressure came from the 499 Arahants assembled to 
      hold the first Buddhist council. They insisted that he should attain 
      enlightenment before the designated date for the council planned for the 
      third month after the Buddha's passing away.</FONT>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Buddha had already said:<I> &quot;Monks, 
      meditate. Don't be heedless. Don't let your mind be filled with 
      defilements. Don't weep and wail saying: This life is full of trouble, 
      full of misery, full of pain, full of agony.&quot;</I> The mind not developed 
      through the practice of mindfulness meditation creates tension, anxiety 
      and worry. Don't keep crying and repeating the same mistakes. You cannot 
      run away from reality. Life is not rosy. It has ups-and-downs and bumps 
      all over. These are facts we face every day.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The practice of mindfulness meditation is 
      similar to a the shock absorbers in a car. If the shock absorbers are not 
      good, you will see how difficult it will be when you drive. This vehicle 
      of ours - the body and mind, this combination - is full of such difficult 
      moments. There is no place to run away from them. Even if you go to the 
      moon (not an impossibility these days), still you will go with your body 
      and mind filled with all kinds of impediments still existing in the mind. 
      You cannot leave them here and go over there. They follow persistently and 
      doggedly wherever you go, and they keep bothering you, day and night. Most 
      people experiment with three solutions.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">They perceive the problem is &quot;over there, 
      in the world.&quot; Therefore, they think that by correcting the world, trying 
      to solve society's ills, they can solve their problems. They wish to make 
      the environment &quot;proper, beautiful&quot; and free from problems. Only then can 
      they live happily. So they get engrossed and, sometimes, even obsessed, in 
      trying to straighten out society. Of course, the desire to improve 
      society's ills, itself, is commendable. They see suffering and become 
      compassionate and then act. They may keep themselves fully occupied trying 
      to correct the society's ills. They might think that they keep themselves 
      out of trouble without realizing that they actually are forgetting their 
      own nagging problems. They continue to have their own pains and suffering 
      unattended primarily because they do not have time for themselves. These 
      people are very compassionate, understanding, ready to render their 
      service to the society selflessly or without any reward from the society. 
      We read many wonderful accounts of many such noble persons who at the 
      expense of their own attainment of enlightenment dedicate their lives to 
      the society. External activities might hinder solving one's own problems.</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Although we live in society with people, 
      each one of us has a little world of our own, views about the world, our 
      own perception and understanding of the world. Each follows his or her 
      perceptions, and views of the world. We may sometimes think that all the 
      problems we experience are generated from the outer world. Therefore, we 
      turn our energies to the world believing involvement in doing something to 
      correct society will solve our problems.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The second line of thinking which people 
      pursue to solve their problems is to think that there is no problem at 
      all. They believe that everything is imaginary. They think: &quot;I exist by 
      myself, I am most important, and I am all alone, and nothing else matters 
      to me.&quot; The third way to solve personal problems is to run away from our 
      problems.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We may receive temporary solace, temporary 
      comfort thinking either the problem exists over there in the external 
      world or it does not exist, or diverting our attention to something, 
      ignoring that there is a problem, or running away from the problem.</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The real solution lies in none of these 
      methods. The real solution, according to the Buddha's teaching, is to 
      discover a way to purify the instrument, the agent, which makes the world 
      happy or unhappy, peaceful or miserable, pleasant or painful. That which 
      creates problems and suffering for everybody. This instrument is our mind. 
      Purification of this mind is one of the purposes of mindfulness 
      meditation.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As we all know, all our thoughts, words 
      and deeds originate in the mind. Mind is the forerunner. All conditions 
      which we experience are mind-made. They are created in the mind, directed 
      and led by the mind. Mind puts them into action. <I>&quot;All actions are all 
      led by the mind: mind is their master, mind is their maker. Act or speak 
      with a defiled state of mind, then suffering follows like the cart-wheel 
      that follows the foot of the ox. All actions are all led by the mind; mind 
      is their master, mind is their maker. Act or speak with a pure state of 
      mind, then happiness follows like a shadow that remains behind without 
      departing.&quot; (Dhammapada 1-2)</I></FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The analogy of the ox pulling the cart is 
      most appropriate to illustrate our problems. The ox pulling the cart does 
      not enjoy pulling the cart. He is not happy with this burden; it is not a 
      pleasure. This poor bull pulling the cart has a terrible time. The whole 
      burden of the cart is on his shoulders, and he will be in pain. The bull 
      would have done better if he had not been born a bull. The condition of 
      the bull is compared to the condition of ignorance, and stupidity - not 
      seeing the truth as is. An unenlightened life is full of ignorance and 
      given to defilements of all kinds. Therefore, an unenlightened person 
      committing thoughts, words, and deeds with impure minds suffers very much 
      like the bull who always suffers by pulling this heavy cart. On the other 
      hand, when we speak or do something with a pure mind we feel happy, and 
      have no regrets, no pain, no suffering following us.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Our purpose in life is to improve 
      ourselves everyday and become happy. We do many things to gain happiness. 
      However, most of the things we do to gain happiness may generate 
      unhappiness, pain, suffering and trouble because our minds are not pure. 
      It is the pure mind that can generate happiness, not the impure mind. 
      Therefore, the first purpose of practicing meditation is to purify our 
      mind; that generates peace and happiness.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The second purpose of meditation is to 
      overcome sorrow and lamentation. When a meditator begins to see the truth 
      he or she can bear and conquer sorrow and lamentation caused by 
      impermanence.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The third purpose is to overcome suffering 
      and disappointment caused by greed and hatred.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The fourth purpose of meditation is to 
      tread the wise path, the correct path which leads to liberation from 
      grief, sorrow, disappointment, pain and lamentation. This is the path of 
      mindfulness - the only path that liberate us from suffering.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The fifth purpose of meditation is to 
      liberate ourselves completely and totally from mental pain and defilements 
      and to free our minds from greed, hatred and delusion.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">These five purposes are very noble 
      purposes. All other purposes of meditation may be overlooked because none 
      of them is capable of generating these results making us really peaceful 
      and happy by eliminating our problems. We don't try to ignore or avoid 
      them but mindfully we face and tackle them as they arise in our minds.</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Certain people simply want to meditate 
      without having any background knowledge of meditation. They think 
      knowledge of the theory of meditation is an impediment. This attitude can 
      be compared to the attitude of a traveler who wishes to go to a definite 
      destination - let us say Washington DC. The traveler has great confidence 
      in his ability and believes his confidence alone is sufficient to get him 
      there. This person may have a vehicle - a car. Then, getting into the car, 
      sitting behind the steering wheel, he starts to drive. However, there has 
      been no preparation for the journey. There is no knowledge of the roads or 
      the conditions of the roads or of the weather. He hasn't even consulted a 
      map. All he has is a car and confidence and some experience in driving. 
      The car may carry a sufficient quantity of gas, oil, and other items, so, 
      the traveler gets into the car and starts driving. He may be on the road 
      for a long time spending a good deal of money on gas, time and energy. 
      Indeed, driving will lead him somewhere, but not necessarily to his 
      destination. A wise driver, on the other hand, studies the map in detail, 
      determines the detours, and may ask others who are more experienced.</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If the driver wishes to go to Washington 
      DC and if there is a place called Washington DC, the driver will find it. 
      Similarly, we need to have a goal in meditation. We want to reach this 
      goal and realize our purpose. And we do need some guidelines. We do not 
      necessarily need a great deal of philosophical and speculative theory. The 
      guidelines are road signs to follow so that we will know (not guess) if we 
      are heading in the right direction. Certainly confidence is necessary, but 
      in itself, is not sufficient. In addition, we need understanding and 
      knowledge of the theory.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Then what is meditation? How do we reach 
      this goal of purifying the mind, overcoming grief and lamentation, 
      overcoming pain and disappointment, treading the path leading to 
      liberation from pain, suffering and samsara - this world of birth and 
      death?</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There is a way to attain it. When we refer 
      to &quot;the Way&quot; it may turn many people off. They might think the speaker is 
      trying to sell something and trying to deprecate everything in the world, 
      and say &quot;If this is the only way, we are not prepared to buy it.&quot; Now, 
      when you wish to go to Washington DC, there are a number of ways to get 
      there. Flying is the quickest way these days, of course. In other times, 
      we would use a car or boat, or only our two feet. Whatever the means of 
      transportation, we have to cover a specific distance to arrive in 
      Washington DC. What is essential is that we get there - whether by slow or 
      fast means. Therefore, &quot;the Way&quot; means &quot;The Way of Mindfulness&quot; that 
      transverses a certain distance or area to realize our destination.</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This way of Mindfulness does not, however, 
      lie in a geographical area or in space. It is in our own mind. We have to 
      do certain things. That doing is also &quot;the Way&quot; -- the way to cultivate 
      our minds to accomplish this journey. Cultivating the mind means 
      practicing mindfulness. When no mindfulness is present, when we are 
      unmindful all the time, we are entrapped by &quot;red herrings.&quot; We are caught 
      in all kinds of confusion. We don't understand things as they really are. 
      To enable us to get to our destination, we need a clear understanding of 
      where we are. Clear understanding is born from mindfulness. No matter what 
      else we do or other practices we engage in they have their own purposes 
      and goals. We learn that they do not purify the mind.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The very word meditation means 
      cultivation. We know what we mean when we say, &quot;We cultivate a land.&quot; We 
      know that there has to be a land and some means of cultivating it. We have 
      to do certain things, such as cutting down the trees to clear the land, 
      remove weeds and other things, and till it over and over and fertilize it. 
      Then we can plant seeds and nourish it and grow certain crops. Similarly 
      in the practice of meditation, we need to mentally cultivate the mind. We 
      do not need to sit in one place just waiting for something to happen. We 
      may wait indefinitely, or for a very long time, without anything 
      happening. We might say that we have spent so much time in meditation. 
      Sitting in one place doing nothing is not meditation. And also simply 
      watching our breath all the time is inadequate and insufficient. Of 
      course, mindfulness of breath is an important part of meditation. Simply 
      watching the breath without any mindfulness may be called the practice of 
      tranquillity meditation, however, it is not Right Concentration without 
      mindfulness. We begin, however, with watching our breath. This meditation 
      which is totally distinct to Buddhism is called Vipassana meditation or 
      Insight meditation. There are guidelines for the practice of Insight or 
      Vipassana meditation. These guidelines are given in the Sutta called the 
      Four Foundations of Mindfulness.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">These Four Foundations of Mindfulness are: 
      Mindfulness of the Body, Mindfulness of Feeling, Mindfulness of the mind 
      and Mindfulness of Mental Objects. We will explain them in turn.</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Let me take the first part - Mindfulness 
      of the Body. Mindfulness of the body is divided into six sections. The 
      first of them is Mindfulness of breathing. Now, why is the breath included 
      in the mindfulness of the body? The breath is a part of our body. This 
      body, as we know it, is made up of four basic elements: the element of 
      extension (solid parts), the element of cohesion (the liquid part), the 
      element of heat (radiation) and the element of air (oscillation or 
      movement). Therefore, when we try to practice mindfulness of the body we 
      begin with the mindfulness of the breath which is the element of air.</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In this meditation, we do not dwell upon 
      some imaginative fairy land. We are not trying to induce self hypnosis. We 
      are not trying to discover the hidden, mystical elements of the universe. 
      We are not trying to become absorbed in the whole universe. We are not 
      trying to become &quot;One&quot; with the whole universe. All these are interesting 
      words. We are trying to use this personality of ours: our own body and 
      mind. We watch mindfully this body and mind and their activities, we 
      investigate them because they are what we carry with us wherever we go. 
      This body and mind is our laboratory. All we have to work with is there -- 
      the raw material, chemical substance, gases, heat, air, water, extension 
      -- all are there. It is in this body, in this personality that we find all 
      this. My laboratory is my body and mind. I always try to watch them within 
      me. I cannot work in your laboratory. You have to work in your own 
      laboratory. Most of us forget our own laboratories and try to get into 
      somebody else's laboratory. We try to see what so-and-so is eating, what 
      so-and-so is doing, whom so-and-so is associating with, where so-and-so is 
      going, what so-and-so is reading, how much money so-and-so has, etc. We 
      always forget our own laboratories. We may never know what is in this 
      laboratory within ourselves. We, in this practice of Insight meditation, 
      become introspective, mindful and careful to watch what is happening here 
      in this mind and body in the present moment. That is what Vipassana 
      meditation is all about; methodical investigation in the laboratory within 
      ourselves.</FONT> </P>
