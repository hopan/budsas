        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">TO TALK OF BUDDHISM we must
        first talk about its origins. I have said that the origin of religion
        was the fear of danger, but the origin of Buddhism is no longer the fear
        of danger, but the fear of suffering. Please note this distinction. In
        the section dealing with religion we talked about danger, but when
        dealing with Buddhism we will be talking about suffering, which carries
        a much broader meaning. Specifically, the fear of danger has its object
        in external factors, such as floods, earthquakes, and so on, but
        suffering includes all the problems experienced in life, including those
        within the mind.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">What is suffering?
        Suffering is the condition of stress and conflict, in short, the human
        predicament. We could put it very simply and say that suffering (dukkha)
        is difficulty (panha), because difficulty is what causes stress and
        frustration.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Other religions looked for
        the source of danger. As far as man could see, whenever something
        occurred in human society, there had to be someone to cause or direct
        it. In society, man was the controller, but the natural world was beyond
        man's control. Still, man thought there must have been someone directing
        things, so he searched for this 'someone' and came up with a director, a
        deity or deities, a supernatural force, the source of all these natural
        dangers. These were the forces that brought the clouds, the storms, the
        floods, the fire and so on. This is the emergence of religions.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Ancient man looked at the
        situation in terms of reward and punishment. It seemed that freedom from
        danger had to be sought from its source. Observing that in human society
        there are leaders who wield power, they applied this model to the forces
        behind nature and came up with the gods. This is why some contemporary
        psychologists have said that mankind created God in his own image,
        reversing the Christian teaching that God created man in his own image.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So mankind, seeing these
        deities as the source of danger, reasoned that it was necessary to
        please the deities, just as for an earthly leader. This resulted in
        numerous techniques and ceremonies for showing respect and paying
        homage, sacrifices, praying and so forth.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The essential factor in
        determining events in the world, according to these ancient religions,
        was the will of the deity (or deities).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The factor which tied
        humanity to these deities or supernatural power was faith. This faith in
        a deity or deities was demonstrated through sacrifices, prayers,
        ceremonies and so on.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So we have an overall
        picture here of a director of events - the will of God; we have the
        human connection - faith; and we have the method of interaction -
        sacrifices, prayers and so on. This is the general picture of the role
        of faith in most religions.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now, let's see how these
        factors relate when it comes to Buddhism. As I have mentioned, Buddhism
        is based on the desire to be free of suffering. What is the appropriate
        method of practice in respect to suffering? To be free of suffering you
        must have a method of doing so. To know this, you have to look at where
        suffering arises from. Where is the source of suffering? Whereas other
        religions taught that the source of danger was in supernatural forces,
        Buddhism says that the source of suffering is a natural process which
        must be understood.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Suffering has an origin
        which functions according to the natural processes, namely the process
        of cause and effect. Not knowing or understanding this natural cause and
        effect process is the cause of suffering. Buddhism delves into the
        origin of suffering by looking into this ignorance of cause and effect,
        or ignorance of the Law of Nature.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">At this point we have
        arrived at the heart of Buddhism. Just now I said that the origin of
        other religions was the awareness of danger, the origin of danger in
        turn being the will of superior beings or forces; but the source of
        Buddhism is the awareness of suffering, the origin of which is ignorance
        of the natural process of suffering, or ignorance of the Law of Nature.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now we come to redressing
        the problem. How do we redress the problem? When ignorance of the Law of
        Nature is the cause, the remedy is its exact opposite, and that is
        knowledge and understanding of these things, which we call wisdom.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Previously, religions had
        relied on faith as the connection between human beings and the source of
        danger. Buddhism changed the human connection to wisdom. At this stage
        the emphasis has shifted from faith to wisdom, and this is a prime
        difference of Buddhism. According to Buddhism, human beings must know
        and understand the process of cause and effect, and then to treat the
        problem accordingly.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Finally (x) the work of
        correcting the factors involved in the creation of suffering is a human
        responsibility, and it is within human potential to do so. Therefore
        emphasis for solving the problem has shifted from the will of a
        supernatural force to human endeavour.</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <i>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">(x) The allusion here,
          and in the previous four paragraphs, is to the Four Noble Truths :
          Suffering, its cessation, and the way leading to that cessation, which
          is the heart of the Buddhist teaching</font></p>
          </blockquote>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These three points are
        highly significant.</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. Most religions concern
          themselves with the source of danger, which is said to be deities
          (heavenly), but Buddhism concerns itself with the source of suffering,
          which is said to be ignorance.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">2. The tie to this source
          in most religions is faith, but in Buddhism it is wisdom.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">3. The director of
          results in most religions is a divine or supernatural power, but in
          Buddhism this responsibility has been placed back into human hands,
          with the emphasis on human action.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The emphasis in Buddhism
        shifts from faith to wisdom, and this is a revolutionary change. Such
        wisdom begins with the desire to know, or the desire for knowledge -
        before there can be wisdom, there must be an aspiration for it. But this
        aspiration for knowledge differs from that of science, as I will be
        pointing out presently.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Another important shift in
        emphasis in Buddhism is from the directives of a deity to human
        endeavour. This is one of Buddhism's cornerstones. No matter where
        Buddhism spreads to, or how distorted the teaching becomes, this
        principle of emphasis on human endeavour never varies. If this one
        principle is changed, then we can confidently say that it is no longer
        Buddhism.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The principle of human
        endeavour is expressed in Buddhist circles as the Law of Kamma. People
        may misunderstand kamma, there may be many misconceptions about it, even
        within the Buddhist world, but no matter how it may vary, kamma always
        deals with human endeavour.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism's combination of
        adherence to the Law of Nature, proclaiming man's independence, and
        putting wisdom to the fore instead of faith, is a very unique event in
        the history of religion. It even makes some Western analysts feel that
        Buddhism isn't a religion at all. Western books on Buddhism often state
        that Buddhism is not a religion, meaning that it isn't a religion as is
        understood in Westem cultures.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore we have these
        three important principles: 1) a Law of Nature; 2) proclaiming man's
        independence; 3) replacing faith with wisdom.</font></p>

        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now in order to clarify
        matters here, I would like to take up a little of your time by speaking
        about some of the basic characteristics of Buddhism. Firstly I would
        like to present some of the teachings from the Buddha himself, expanding
        on them to see how they relate to science.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. Adherence to the Law of
        Nature</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">: truth is the Law of
        Nature, something which naturally exists. The Buddha was the one who
        discovered this truth. You may have heard the monks chanting the
        Dhammaniyama Sutta at funerals, but most people don't know the meaning
        of what's being chanted, which is that the truth of nature exists as a
        normal condition. Whether the Buddha arises or not, the truth is still
        there.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">What is this Dhammaniyama,
        or Law of Nature? The monks chant uppadavabhikkhave tathagatanam,
        anuppadavatathagatanam: &quot;Whether Buddhas arise or not, it is a
        natural, unchanging truth that all compounded things are unenduring,
        unstable, and not-self.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Unenduring (anicca) means
        that compounded things are constantly being born and dying, arising and
        passing away.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Unstable (dukkha) means
        that they are constantly being conditioned by conflicting and opposing
        forces, they are unable to maintain any constancy.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Not self (anatta) means
        that they are not a self or intrinsic entity, they merely follow
        supporting factors. Any form they take is entirely at the direction of
        supporting factors. This is the principle of conditioned arising, the
        most basic level of truth.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha was enlightened
        to these truths, after which He declared and explained them. This is how
        the chant goes. This first principle is a very important one, the most
        basic principle of Buddhism. Buddhism regards these natural laws as
        fundamental truths.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">2. The interrelation and
        interdependence of all things:</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">
        Buddhism teaches the Law of Dependent Origination. In brief, the essence
        of this law is :</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <i>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Imasmim sati idam hoti<br>
          Imasmim asati idam na hoti<br>
          Imassuppada idam uppadjati<br>
          Imassa nirodha idam nirujjhati.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This translates as:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <i>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When there is this, this
          is;<br>
          when this is not, neither is this.<br>
          Because this arises, so does this;<br>
          because this ceases,so does this.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This is a truth, a natural
        law, which is expanded on in detail in practical applications. Simply
        speaking, this is the natural law of cause and effect on its most basic
        level.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is worth noting that
        Buddhism prefers to use the words 'causes and conditions' rather than
        cause and effect'. Cause and effect refers to a specific and linear
        relationship. In Buddhism it is believed that results do not arise
        simply from a cause alone, but also from numerous supporting factors.
        When the conditions are ready, then the result follows.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">For example: suppose we
        plant a mango seed and a mango tree sprouts. The mango tree is the fruit
        (effect), but what is the cause of that mango tree? You might say the
        seed is the cause, but if there were only this seed, the tree couldn't
        grow. Many other factors are needed, such as earth, water, oxygen,
        suitable temperature, fertilizer and so on. Only when factors are right
        can the result arise. This principle explains why some people, even when
        they feel that they have created the causes, do not receive the results
        they expected. They must ask themselves whether they have also created
        the conditions.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Please note that this
        causal relationship does not necessarily proceed in a linear direction.
        We tend to think of these things as following on one from the other -
        one thing arises first, and then the result arises afterwards. But it
        doesn't necessarily have to function in that way.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Suppose we had a blackboard
        and I took some chalk and wrote on it the letters A, B, and C. The
        letters that appear are a result. Now what is the cause for these
        letters appearing on the blackboard? Normally we might answer 'a
        person'. If we talk in relation to the white marks on the board we might
        say 'chalk'. But no matter which factor we take to be the cause, with
        only one cause, the result cannot arise. To achieve a letter 'A' on this
        blackboard there must be a confluence of many factors - a writer, chalk,
        a blackboard of suitable colour - just having a blackboard is not yet
        enough, the board must be a colour that contrasts with the colour of the
        chalk - there must be a suitable temperature, a suitable moisture
        content, the surface must be free of excess moisture ... so many things
        have to be just right, and these are all factors in the generation of
        the result.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now, in the appearance of
        that letter 'A', it isn't necessary for all the factors involved to have
        occurred one after the other, is it? We can see that some of those
        factors must be there at the same time, being factors which are
        interdependent in various ways, not necessarily following each other in
        a linear fashion. This is the Buddhist teaching of cause and condition.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">3. The principle of faith</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">:
        just now I said that Buddhism shifted the emphasis in religion from
        faith to wisdom, so why should we be speaking about faith again? In
        regard to this we should understand that faith still plays a very
        important role in Buddhism, but the emphasis is changed.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Before anything else, let
        us take a look at how faith is connected in Buddhism to verification
        through actual experience. The teaching that is most quoted in this
        respect is the Kalama Sutta, which contains the passage:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Here, Kalamas,<br>
          Do not believe simply because you have heard it.<br>
          Do not believe simply because you have learnt it.<br>
          Do not believe simply because you have practiced it from ancient
          times.<br>
          Do not believe simply because it's rumoured.<br>
          Do not believe simply because it's in the scriptures.<br>
          Do not believe simply on logic.<br>
          Do not believe simply through guesswork.<br>
          Do not believe simply through reasoning.<br>
          Do not believe simply because it conforms to your theory.<br>
          Do not believe simply because it seems credible.<br>
          Do not believe simply out of faith in your teacher.&quot;</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This teaching amazed people
        in the West when they first heard about it, it was one of Buddhism's
        most popular teachings, because at that time Western culture was just
        getting into science. This idea of not believing anything too easily,
        but only through a verifiable truth, was very popular. The Kalama Sutta
        is fairly well known to Western people familiar with Buddhism, but the
        Thai people have hardly heard of it.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha went on to say
        in the Kalama Sutta that one must know and understand through experience
        which things are skilful and which unskilful. Knowing that something is
        unskilful and harmful, conducive not to benefit but to suffering, it
        should be given up. Knowing that something is skilful, is useful and
        conducive to happiness, it should be acted upon. This is a matter of
        clear knowledge, of direct realization, of personal experience. This is
        the shift from faith to wisdom.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In addition to this, the
        Buddha also gave some clear principles for examining one's personal
        experience. He said, &quot;independent of faith, independent of
        agreement, independent of learning, independent of reasoned thinking,
        independent of conformity with one's own theory, one knows clearly for
        oneself when there is greed in the mind, when there is not greed in the
        mind; when there is hatred in the mind and when there is not hatred in
        the mind; when there is delusion in the mind and when there is not
        delusion in the mind, in the present moment.&quot; This is true personal
        experience, the state of our own mind, which can be known clearly for
        ourselves in the present moment. This is the principle of verifying
        through personal experience</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">4. Proclaiming the
        independence of mankind:</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">
        Buddhism arose among the Brahmanical beliefs, which held that Brahma was
        the creator of the world. Brahma (God) was the appointer of all events,
        and mankind had to perform sacrifices and ceremonies of prayer, of which
        people at that time had devised many, to keep the God happy. Their
        ceremonies were lavish, all attuned to gaining the favour of the gods
        and to receiving rewards. The Brahman Vedas stated that Maha Brahma had
        divided human beings into four castes. Whichever caste a person was born
        into, so was that person bound for life. There was no way to change the
        situation, it was all tied up by the directives of God.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When the Buddha-to-be was
        born, as the Prince Siddhattha Gotama, the first thing attributed to him
        was his proclamation of human independence. You may have read in the
        Buddha's biography, how, when the Prince was born, he performed the
        symbolic gesture of walking seven steps and proclaiming, &quot;I am the
        greatest in the world, I am the foremost in the world, I am the grandest
        in the world.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This statement can be
        easily misinterpreted. One may wonder, &quot;Why was Prince Siddhattha
        being so arrogant?&quot; But this statement should be understood as the
        Buddha's proclamation of human independence. The principles expounded by
        the Buddha in his later life all point to the potential of human beings
        to develop the highest good. A fully developed human being is the finest
        being in the world. The Buddha was our example and our representative in
        this. His attainment of Buddhahood was a realization of human potential.
        With such potential, it is no longer necessary for human beings to be
        pleading for help from external sources. Instead they can turn around
        and better themselves, they can rely on themselves. If a human being
        becomes a Buddha, even the angels and gods revere him.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There are many examples of
        this kind of teaching in Buddhism. Consider, for example, the
        oft-quoted:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <i>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Manussabhutam sambuddham<br>
          attadantam samahitam ...<br>
          deva'pi namassan'ti</font></p>
          </blockquote>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This translates as,
        &quot;The Buddha, although a human being, is one who has trained and
        perfected himself. Even the gods revere him.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">With this principle, the
        human position changes. The attitude of looking externally, taking
        refuge in gods and deities, has been firmly retracted, and people are
        told to turn around and look at themselves, to see that within
        themselves lies a potential that can be developed into the finest
        achievement. No longer is it necessary to throw their fates to the gods.
        If they realize this potential, even those gods will recognize their
        excellence and pay reverence.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This principle entails a
        belief, or faith, in the potential of human beings to be developed to
        the highest level. The Buddha is our example of a fully developed human
        being.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This principle is well
        illustrated in one of the teachings of the Dhammapada. The stanza
        begins, &quot;<i>Babum ve saranam yanti ...</i> &quot; &quot;Humanity,
        being threatened by danger ...&quot; This refers to how human beings
        existed before Buddhism, in much the same way as has been already
        mentioned about the arising of religions. The stanza goes ...</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Human beings, finding
          themselves threatened by danger, take refuge in spirits, shrines, and
          sacred trees. But these are not a true refuge. Turning to such things
          as a refuge, there is no true safety.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Those who go for refuge to
        the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha, who understand the Four Noble Truths,
        seeing difficulty, the cause of difficulty, freedom from difficulty and
        the way leading to the freedom from difficulty, are able to transcend
        all danger.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This is a turning point,
        shifting the emphasis from pleading with deities to responsible action.
        Even many Buddhists, unaware of this principle, mistakenly revere the
        Triple Gem as something holy, as in other religions.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Triple Gem begins with
        the Buddha, our example of a perfected human being. This is a reminder
        to humanity of their potential, and as such encourages us to reflect on
        our responsibility to develop it. Taking the Buddha for refuge is a
        reminder. As soon as we think of the Triple Gem and the Buddha, we
        reflect on our responsibility to use wisdom to address the problems of
        life and develop ourselves.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When we think of the
        Dhamma, we are reminded that this development of potential must be done
        through means which conform to the Law of Nature and function according
        to causes and conditions.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When we reflect on the
        Sangha, we think of those who have used the Dhamma (teaching) skilfully,
        truly developing and realizing their potential. These people are living
        examples of the actual attainment of the truth, of which, through
        developing ourselves in right practice, we should secure membership.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These are the Three
        Refuges. If we believe or have faith in these refuges, then we must
        strive to solve problems like wise human beings. This tenet forces us to
        use wisdom. The way to solve problems through wisdom is:</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. <b>Dukkha </b>(suffering):
        We begin with the problem, recognizing that there is one.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">6. Teaching only those
        truths which are of benefit</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">.
        There are many different kinds of knowledge, many different kinds of
        truth, but some of them are not useful, having no concern with solving
        the problems of life. The Buddha did not teach such truths and was not
        interested in finding out about them. He concentrated on teaching only
        those truths which would be of practical benefit. This principle is
        illustrated in the simile of the leaves, which the Buddha gave while he
        was staying in the Sisapa forest.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">At that time, the Buddha
        was staying with a company of monks. One day he picked up a handful of
        leaves from the forest floor and asked the monks, &quot;Which is the
        greater number, the leaves in my hand, or the leaves on the trees?&quot;
        An easy question, and the monks answered immediately. The leaves in the
        Buddha's hand were very few, while the leaves in the forest were of far
        greater number.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha replied,
        &quot;It is the same with the things that I teach you. There are many
        truths that I know, but most of them I do not teach. They are like the
        leaves in the forest. The truths that I do teach you are like the leaves
        here in my hand. Why do I not teach those other truths? Because they are
        not conducive to ultimate wisdom, to understanding of the way things
        are, or to the rectification of problems and the transcendence of
        suffering. They do not lead to the attainment of the goal, which is
        Nibbana. &quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha said that he
        taught the things he did because they were useful, they led to the
        solving of problems, and were conducive to a good life. In short, they
        led to the transcendence of suffering.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Another important simile,
        given on another occasion, was in answer to the questions of higher
        philosophy. These questions are among the questions with which science
        is currently wrestling, such as: Is the Universe finite or infinite?
        Does it have a beginning? The scriptures mention ten stock philosophical
        questions which had been in existence from before the time of the
        Buddha. One monk who was interested in such questions went to ask the
        Buddha about them. The Buddha refused to answer his questions, but
        instead gave the following simile:</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A man was shot by a
        poisoned arrow. With the arrowhead still embedded within him, his
        relatives raced to find a doctor. As the doctor was preparing to cut out
        the arrowhead, the man said, &quot;Wait! I will not let you take out
        this arrowhead until you tell me the name of the man who shot me. Where
        did he live? What caste was he? What kind of arrow did he use? Did he
        use a bow or a cross-bow? What was the arrow made of? Of what was the
        bow made? Of what was the bow-string made? What kind of feather was
        attached to the end of the arrow? Until I find out the answers to these
        questions, I will not let you take this arrow out.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Obviously, if that man were
        to wait for the answers to all those questions he would surely die
        beforehand. Not only would he not find out the information he wanted,
        but he would die needlessly. What would be the proper course of action
        here? Before anything else, he would have to have that arrowhead taken
        out. Then, if he still wanted to know the answers to those questions, he
        could go about finding out.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the same way, what the
        Buddha teaches is human suffering and the way to relieve it.
        Philosophical questions are not at all relevant. Even if the Buddha
        answered them, his answers could not be verified. The Buddha taught to
        quickly do what must be done, not to waste time in vain pursuits and
        debates. This is why the Buddha did not answer such questions, and only
        taught those truths which are of benefit.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These are some of the
        general characteristics of Buddhism. Having listened to this much,
        please do not come to any hasty conclusions about Buddhism's similarity
        or otherwise from science. There may be some points which sound quite
        similar, but within those similarities there are differences.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><a name="_Toc528760838"><font face="Times New Roman">Good
        and evil</font></a></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">I have already said that
        most religions saw the events of the world as the work of deities or
        supernatural forces. If mankind did not want any unpleasant events to
        befall him, or if he aspired to some reward, he would have to let the
        deities see some display of worship and obeisance.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This applied not only to
        external natural events. Even people's personal lives were under the
        control of the deities. The deity, God, was the creator of the Universe,
        together with all of its happiness and suffering. He was constantly
        monitoring mankind's behaviour to ascertain whether it was pleasing to
        Him or not, and so people were constantly on their guard to avoid any
        actions which might displease the deity.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">According to this standard,
        all of humanity's behaviour could be classified into two categories.
        Firstly, those actions which were pleasing to the deity, which were
        rewarded, and which were known as 'good'; and those actions which were
        displeasing to the deity, which he punished, and which were known as
        'evil'. Sometimes these qualities were seen as being the directives of
        the deity. Whatever the deity approved of was 'good', whatever the deity
        forbade was 'evil'. The priests or representatives of the religion were
        the mediators who informed mankind which actions were good and which
        were evil, according to the standard as laid down by the deity. These
        standards for defining good and evil became known as 'ethics' or
        'morals'.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Morality, or ethics, is a
        very important part of religion. You could almost say it was the essence
        of religion. Westem morality evolved and developed much as I have
        described it here.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As for science, from the
        time it parted with religion it interested itself solely with the
        extemal physical world and completely ignored the abstract side of
        things. Science took no interest at all in moral or ethical issues,
        seeing them as concerns of the deity, unfounded on facts, and turned its
        back on these things altogether. The populations of the Westem
        countries, or of the countries we know as technologically developed,
        were captivated by the advances of science. In comparison, religion's
        teachings of deities and supematural forces seemed ill founded. And so
        they tumed their backs on religion. At that time morals and ethics lost
        their meaning. When God was no longer important, morals or ethics, God's
        set of laws, were no longer important. Many people today, including
        those in scientific circles, view ethics as merely the arbitrary
        dictates of certain groups of people, such as priests or religious
        representatives, at best established to maintain order in society, apart
        from which they do not have any intrinsic truth.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Those branches of science
        which study the development of human civilization, especially sociology,
        and some branches of anthropology, seeing the success of the physical
        sciences, tried to afford their branches of learning a similar standing,
        by using principles and methods much the same as the physical sciences.
        The social sciences tended to see ethics or morals as values which did
        not have any scientific foundation. They have tended to avoid the
        subject of ethics in order to show that they, too, are pure sciences
        void of value systems. Even when they do make studies about ethical
        matters, they look on them only as measurable quantities of social
        behaviour.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The physical sciences, the
        social sciences, and people in the modern age in general, look on ethics
        as purely conventional creations. They are incapable of distinguishing
        ethics from their conventional manifestations, which is a step in the
        wrong direction - in trying to avoid falsehood, they have ended up
        straying further from truth.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now let us come back to the
        subject of Buddhism. In regard to ethics, both science and Buddhism
        differ from the main gamut of religions. But while science has cut
        itself off from them, completely disregarding any consideration of
        ethics or values, Buddhism turns around and studies and teaches the role
        of ethics within the natural process.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">While most religions look
        at the events of nature, both outside of man and within him, as being
        the directives of a deity, Buddhism looks at these events as being the
        normal and natural process of causes and conditions. In regard to human
        beings and abstract conditions, or values, the same laws apply as to the
        physical workings of nature. They are part of the stream of causes and
        conditions, functioning entirely at the directives of the natural laws.
        The difference in quality is determined by variations within the factors
        of the stream.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In order to facilitate our
        understanding of these processes, Buddhism divides the laws of nature
        into five kinds, called niyama (laws). They are:</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. <b>Utuniyama</b>
        (physical laws): The natural laws dealing with the events in the natural
        world or physical environment.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">2. <b>Blianiyama</b>
        (biological laws): The natural laws dealing with animals and plants, in
        particular heredity.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">3. <b>Cittaniyama </b>(psychic
        laws): The natural laws dealing with the workings of the mind and
        thinking.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">4. <b>Kammaniyama </b>(karmic
        or moral laws): The natural law dealing with human behaviour,
        specifically intention and the actions resulting from it.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">5. <b>Dhammaniyama</b> (the
        general law of cause and effect): The natural law dealing with the
        relationship and interdependence of all things, known simply as the way
        of things.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In terms of these five
        divisions of natural law, we can see that science has complete
        confidence in the dhammaniyama (the general law of cause and effect),
        while limiting its field of research to utuniyama (physical laws) and
        bijaniyama (biological laws). As for Buddhism, practically speaking it
        emphasises kammaniyama (the law of moral action), although one stream of
        Buddhism, the Abhidhamma (x), stresses the study of the cittaniyama
        (psychic laws), in relation to kammaniyama and dhammaniyama.</font></p>

        reality is impossible if there is no understanding of all the laws of
        nature, their interrelation and unity. This includes, in particular, the
        human element, the mental factors and the values therein, of those who
        are studying those laws. Scientists may study the physical laws, but as
        long as they are ignorant of themselves, the ones who are studying those
        laws, they will never be able to see the truth even of the physical
        sciences.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">On the basic level, human
        beings live in this physical world on a material plane, but within that
        physical world is the mental world. As far as the mind goes, human
        beings are living in a human world, and this human world is of vital
        importance, wielding an influence over our lives that is far clearer
        than the influence of the physical environment.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Our daily lives, our
        thoughts, behaviour and deeds, our communications, and our traditions
        and social institutions are entirely products of human intentional
        action, which is known in Buddhism as kamma. Intention is that unique
        faculty which has enabled human beings to progress to where we have.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The human world is thus the
        world of intention and follows the directives of intention. In Buddhism
        it is said: kammuna vattati- loko - the world is directed by kamma. In
        order to understand the human world, or the human situation, it is
        necessary to understand the natural law known as the Law of Kamma.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Be it intention, kamma,
        behaviour, ethics, abstract qualities, values, internal nature, or the
        human mind - these are all entirely natural. They exist in accordance
        with the Laws of Nature, not at the directives of deity. Nor are they
        accidental. They are processes which are within our human capacity to
        understand and develop.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Please note that Buddhism
        differentiates between the Law of Kamma and psychic laws. This indicates
        that the mind and intention are not the same thing, and can be studied
        as separate truths. However, these two truths are extremely closely
        linked. The simple analogy is that of a man driving a motor boat. The
        mind is like the boat and its engine, while intention is the driver of
        the boat, who decides where the boat will go and what it will do.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A similar kind of natural
        event may arise from different laws in different situations, while some
        events are a product of more than one of these natural laws functioning
        in unison. A man with tears in his eyes may be suffering from the
        effects of smoke (physical law), or from extremely happy or sad
        emotional states (psychic law), or it may be the result of anxiety over
        past deeds (law of kamma). A headache might be caused by illness
        (biological law), a stuffy or over-heated room (physical law) or it
        could be from depression and worry (law of kamma).</font></p>

        question of free will</font></a></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When people from the West
        start studying the subject of kamma, or intention, they are often
        confused by the problem of free will. Is there free will? In actual fact
        there is no free will, in the sense of being 'absolutely free', because
        intention is just one of the myriad interrelated cause and effect
        processes.However, will can be considered free in a relative way. We
        might say it is 'relatively free', because it is in fact one of the
        factors within the overall natural process. In Buddhism this is called
        purisakara. Each person has the ability to initiate thinking and
        intention, and as such become the instigating factor in a cause and
        effect process, or kamma, for which we say each individual must accept
        responsibility.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Misunderstandings, or lack
        of understanding, in relation to this matter of free will, arise from a
        number of more deeply rooted misconceptions, in particular, the
        misconception of self. This concept causes a lot of confusion when
        people try to look at reality as an actual condition, but are still
        trapped in their habitual thinking, which clings fast to concepts. The
        two perspectives clash. The perception is of a doer and a receiver of
        results. While in reality there is only a feeling, the perception is of
        'one who feels'. (In the texts it is said: There is the experience of
        feeling, but no one who feels.) The reason for this confusion is
        ignorance of the characteristic of anatta, not self.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism doesn't stop
        simply at free will, but strives to the stage of being 'free of will',
        transcending the power of will, which can only be achieved through the
        complete development of human potential through wisdom.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Also note that within this
        process of human development, the areas of the mind and of wisdom are
        distinguished from each other. Wisdom that is fully developed will
        liberate the mind. So we have the mind with intention, and the mind with
        wisdom. However, this is a practical concern, a vast subject which must
        be reserved for a later time.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">My intention here has been
        simply to show that the attainment of perfect knowledge, or reality,
        must arise from an understanding of human beings and their place in the
        natural order, including those abstract conditions and values which
        exist within them.</font></p>
