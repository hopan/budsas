        role of faith</font></a></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">NOW LET US TAKE a
        comparative look at some of the qualities related to Buddhism, science
        and other religions, beginning with faith.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Most religions use emotion
        as the energy for attaining their respective goals. Emotion is the
        inspiration which arouses belief and obedience to the teachings, and
        emotions, particularly those which produce faith, are a necessary part
        of most religions. Emotions are also that which preserves faith, for
        which reason it is quite important to ensure that these emotional states
        are sustained. To put it another way, because faith is so crucial to
        these religions, emotion is encouraged.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">While faith is the most
        important force in most religions, Buddhism stresses wisdom, giving
        faith a place of importance only in the initial stages. Even then, faith
        is only used very carefully, as wisdom is considered to be the prime
        factor in attaining to the goal of Buddhism.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Even so, faith does have a
        place in the Buddhist teachings, but in a different role, with a
        different emphasis. There are also elements of faith in scientific
        research, where it has had a decisive role in science's advances in
        research and enquiry.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In order to clearly
        understand faith, it will be helpful to analyse it into different kinds.
        Generally speaking, faith can be divided into two main kinds:</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The first kind of faith is
        that which obstructs wisdom. It relies on inciting, or even enforcing,
        belief, and such belief must be complete and unquestioning. To doubt the
        teaching is forbidden. Only un- questioning obedience is allowed. This
        first kind of faith does not allow any room for wisdom to develop.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Faith in most religions is
        of this variety. There must be belief and there must be obedience.
        Whatever the religion says must go, no questions asked. This feature of
        religion is known as dogma, the doctrine that is unquestionable,
        characterized by adherence in the face of reason. Buddhism, however, is
        a religion free of dogma.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The second kind of faith is
        a chanel for wisdom. This kind of faith stimulates curiosity; it is the
        incentive to begin learning. In this world there are so many things to
        leam about. Without faith we have no starting point or direction to set
        our learning, but when faith arises in a certain person, subject or
        teaching, it gives us a starting point. Faith awakens our interest and
        encourages us to approach the object of that interest. Faith in a
        person, in particular, leads to approaching and questioning that person.
        Having faith in the order of monks, for example, encourages us to
        approach them and learn from them, to gain a clearer understanding of
        the teachings.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">An example of this kind of
        faith can be seen in the life story of Sariputta(x). He became
        interested in the teaching of the Buddha through seeing the monk Assaji
        walking on alms round. He was impressed by the monk's bearing, which
        suggested some special quality, some special knowledge or spiritual
        attainment. Wanting to find out what this special quality was, he
        approached Assaji and asked for a teaching. This is a good example of
        this second kind of faith.</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <i>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">(x) Venerable Sariputta,
          one of the Buddha's foremost disciples, met Assaji going on alms round
          and was inspired enough by his appearance to approach him and ask for
          teaching. The short teaching he received was enough to put Sariputta's
          mind beyond doubts about the authenticity of the Buddha's teaching and
          to become a bhikkhu, a Buddhist monk.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So this kind of faith or
        inspiration is a positive influence, an incentive for learning. It also
        gives a point of focus for our learning. Whatever direction faith leans
        to, our energies are motivated accordingly. A scientist, for example,
        having the faith that a particular hypothesis might be true, will direct
        his enquiry specifically in that direction, not being distracted by
        irrelevant data.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These two kinds of faith
        must be clearly distinguished. The faith that functions in Buddhism is
        the faith which leads to wisdom, and as such is secondary to wisdom.
        Such faith is found in both Buddhism and science.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This kind of faith has
        three important functions in relation to wisdom. They are:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. It gives rise to an
          interest and incentive to begin the process of learning.<br>
          2. It provides the energy needed in the pursuit of that learning.<br>
          3. It gives direction or focus for that energy.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Apart from these functions,
        well-directed faith has a number of further characteristics, which is
        shown in the following consideration of the Buddhist system of practice:</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">What is the goal of
        Buddhism? The goal of Buddhism is liberation, transcendence, or, to put
        it in contemporary terms, freedom. Buddhism wants human beings to be
        free, to transcend defilements and suffering.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">How is this freedom
        attained? It must be attained through wisdom, understanding of the
        truth, or the law of nature. This truth is as equally attainable by the
        disciples as it was by the Teacher, and their knowledge is independent
        of him. The Buddha once asked Sariputta, &quot;Do you believe what I
        have been explaining to you?&quot; Sariputta answered, &quot;Yes, I see
        that that is so. &quot; The Buddha asked him, &quot;Are you saying this
        just out of faith in me?&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sariputta answered,
        &quot;No, I answered in agreement not because of faith in the Blessed
        One, but because I clearly see for myself that this is the case.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This is another of
        Buddhism's principles. The Buddha did not want people to simply believe
        him or attach to him. He pointed out the fault of faith even in another
        person, because he wanted people to be free. This liberation, or
        freedom, the goal of Buddhism, is attained through wisdom, through
        knowledge of reality.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">But how is that wisdom to
        arise? For those people who know how to think, who have what we call
        yoniso-manasikara (x), it isn't necessary to rely on faith, but most
        people must use faith as a stepping stone or starting point.</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <i>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">(x) Systematic attention,
          wise consideration, critical reflection.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These conditions are
        connected like links in a chain. In order to attain liberation, it is
        necessary to develop wisdom. Wisdom, as the condition for realizing the
        goal, is in turn dependent on faith. This gives us three stages:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Faith - Wisdom -
          Liberation</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Faith is the initiator of
        the path to truth. It in turn leads to wisdom, which in turn leads to
        liberation. This model of conditions is the defining constraint on faith
        in Buddhism. Because faith is related to both wisdom and liberation, it
        has two characteristics:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. It leads to wisdom<br>
          2. It is coupled with, and leads to liberation.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Faith in Buddhism does not
        forbid questions or doubts, nor demand belief or unquestioning committal
        in any way. Both Buddhism and science possess this kind of faith; they
        both use faith as a stepping stone on the path to realizing the truth.
        Now the question arises, what kind of faith is it which leads to wisdom?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the context of today's
        discussion, we could say that the faith that leads to wisdom is the
        belief that this universe, or the world of nature, functions according
        to constant and invariable laws. This is faith in the Law of Nature, or
        the belief that nature has laws that are accessible to man's
        understanding.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This faith is the impetus
        which leads to the search for truth, but because faith in itself is
        incapable of leading directly to the truth, it must be used to further
        develop wisdom. At this stage the faith of Buddhism and the faith of
        science look very similar. Both have a belief in the laws of nature, and
        both strive to know the truth of these laws through wisdom. However, the
        similarity ends right here. From this point on, the faith of Buddhism
        and the faith of science part their ways.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><a name="_Toc528760843"><font face="Times New Roman">The
        difference between faith in Buddhism and science</font></a></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We have said that the
        source of both religion and science was the awareness of problems in
        life, the dangers in the natural world. In search of a remedy for this
        problem, human beings looked on the natural environment with trepidation
        and wonder. These two kinds of feeling led to both the desire for a way
        out of danger, and the desire to know the truth of nature. From this
        common origin, religion and science part their ways.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">But apart from their
        differences, both science and most religions have one important
        similarity, and that is their tendency to look outwards, as has been
        explained in Chapter Two. In this respect, we find that science, in
        particular, confines its research exclusively to external, physical
        phenomena. Science does not include mankind in its picture of the
        universe. In other words, science does not consider the universe as
        including mankind, and does not look at mankind as encompassing the
        whole of the universe.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Looking at nature in this
        way, science has only one object for its faith, and that is the physical
        universe - the faith that nature has fixed laws. In brief we could call
        this 'faith in nature'.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">But the objective of
        Buddhism is to solve the problem of human suffering, which arises from
        both internal and external conditions, with an emphasis on the world of
        human behaviour. At the same time, Buddhism sees this process as a
        natural one. For this reason, Buddhism, like science, has faith in
        nature, but this belief or faith also includes human beings, both in the
        sense that human beings are a part of nature, and in the sense that
        human beings encompass the whole of nature within themselves, in that
        they are subject to the laws of nature.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The faith of science has
        only one object, but the faith of Buddhism has two objects, and they
        are:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. Nature<br>
          2. Mankind</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In one sense, these two
        kinds of faith are one and the same thing, because they are both beliefs
        in nature, the first kind more obviously so. But the first kind of faith
        does not cover the whole picture, it includes only the external
        environment. In Buddhism, mankind is recognized as a part of nature. The
        physical human organism is as natural as the external environment.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Moreover, human beings
        possess a special quality which differs from the external manifestations
        of nature, and distinguishes mankind from the world around him. This is
        a quality peculiar to human beings. You could even say it is their
        'humanness'. This peculiar quality is mankind's mental side, the subject
        of values.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In Buddhism we believe that
        this abstract quality of human beings is also a natural phenomenon, and
        is also subject to the natural laws of cause and effect, and as such is
        included in natural truth. In order to know and understand nature, both
        the physical and the mental sides of nature should be thoroughly
        understood.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Bearing in mind that human
        beings want to know and understand nature, it follows that in order to
        do so, they must understand the ones who are studying. These mental
        qualities, such as faith and desire to know, are all abstract qualities;
        they are what I call 'values'. They all come into the human abstract
        realm, and as such must come into our field of research and
        understanding.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Moreover, on the ultimate
        level, the attainment of truth is also the attainment of the highest
        good. In the end, the truth and the most excellent kind of life, or the
        highest truth and the highest good, are one and the same thing. If human
        qualities are not studied, any knowledge or understanding of nature is
        bound to be distorted and incomplete. It will be incapable of leading to
        true understanding of reality.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Although science does have
        faith in nature, and strives to know the truths of nature, it doesn't
        look at nature in its entirety. Science ignores human values and as a
        result has an incomplete or faulty view of nature. Science's search for
        knowledge is inadequate and cannot reach completion, because one side of
        nature, the internal nature of man, is ignored.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is noteworthy that the
        faith of science, like Buddhism, also has a suggestion of being
        divisible into two aspects. That is, there is both faith in nature, and
        faith in human potential. Let us look at the faith of science, which,
        strictly speaking, is the conviction that nature has immutable laws, the
        truth of which is accessible to human intelligence.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The faith of science can be
        divided into two aspects, and has two objects, the same as the faith of
        Buddhism. That is, firstly there is belief in the laws of nature, and
        secondly, belief in the ability of human intelligence to realize those
        laws, which is simply faith in human potential. However, this second
        aspect of faith is not clearly stated in science, it is more an
        assumption. Science does not mention this second kind of faith, and pays
        little attention to the development of the human being. It concentrates
        on serving only the first kind of faith.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In this respect, science
        differs from Buddhism, which holds the faith in human potential to be of
        prime importance, and has expanded this subject into practical forms
        which have been systematized into the larger part of Buddhism's
        teachings. Throughout the Buddhist teachings, faith is always connected
        between three points. That is, there is conviction in the human
        potential to develop wisdom and realise the truth of the laws of nature,
        this conviction being supported by the deeper-rooted conviction that
        nature functions according to fixed laws; and there is the conviction
        that the realization of these laws of nature will enable human beings to
        realize the highest good, which is liberation from suffering.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This kind of faith creates
        a significant distinction between Buddhism and science. In Buddhism
        there is a search for truth in conjunction with a training to realize
        human potential. This development of human potential is also what
        determines the way knowledge is used. This being the case, the
        probability of using the knowledge gained from studying the laws of
        nature to serve the destructive influences of greed, hatred and delusion
        is minimized. Instead, knowledge gained will be used in a constructive
        way.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As for science, this
        one-sided faith in the laws of nature is liable to cause the search for
        knowledge to be aimless and undisciplined. There is no development of
        the human being, and there is no guarantee that the knowledge gained
        will be used in ways that are beneficial to humanity. Science's search
        for the truths of nature does not, therefore, help anybody, even the
        scientists, to attain contentment, to relieve suffering, to ease tension
        or to have calmer and clearer minds. At the same time, science opens
        wide the way for undesirable values to direct scientific development,
        leading it in the direction of greed, hatred and delusion. Examples of
        these undesirable values are the desire to conquer nature and
        materialism, which have controlled scientific development in the last
        century or more, causing exploitation of and destruction to the
        environment. If scientific development continues this trend, it will be
        unsustainable.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It should be stressed that
        human beings are intelligent beings, or to put it more directly, they
        are beings which have intention. They are beings which make kamma, and
        all kinds of kamma must rely on volition. For that reason, human beings
        have a sense of values. Given that they have faith in the laws of nature
        and a desire to understand those laws, they must also have a sense of
        values, be it conscious or otherwise. This quality will condition the
        style and direction of their methods for finding the truth, as well as
        the context and way in which that truth is seen.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If mankind's awareness of
        values does not penetrate to this basic quality of unity within his
        mind, in other words, he does not develop the highest good in
        conjunction with his search for truth of nature, his searching, in
        addition to being incapable of being fully successful (because it
        ignores one side of reality), will be overwhelmed by inferior values,
        and the search for knowledge will be uncontrolled and misdirected.
        Inferior values will influence the search for knowledge, distorting any
        truths that are discovered.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Simply speaking, the
        knowledge of scientists is not independent of values. A simple example
        of one of these secondary values is the pleasure obtained from, and
        which lies behind, the search for knowledge and the discoveries it
        yields. Even the pure kind of search for knowledge, which is a finer
        value, if analysed deeply, is likely to have other sets of values hidden
        within it, such as the desire to feed some personal need, even some
        pleasant feelings, within the researcher.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">I would like to summarize
        at this point that we have been talking about two levels of values,
        which are the highest value, together with those intermediate values
        which are compatible with it. The highest value is a truth which must be
        attained to, it is not something which can be artificially set up in the
        mind. Scientists have faith in nature already. Such conviction is
        already a value within them from the outset, but this faith must be
        expanded on to include the whole of nature and humanity, which entails
        faith in the highest good, simply by bearing in mind that the laws of
        nature are connected to the highest good.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When there is the correct
        value of faith, secondary values which are related to it will also
        arise; or these may be further underscored by intentional inducement in
        oneself. This will serve to prevent values from straying into
        undesirable areas, or from being taken over by inferior values.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Faith, which is our
        fundamental value, conditions the values which are secondary to it, in
        particular the aspiration to know. From faith in the truth of nature
        arises the aspiration to know the truth of nature, or the truth of all
        things. Such an aspiration is important in both science and Buddhism.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">From faith in the existence
        of the highest good and in human potential arises the aspiration to
        attain the state of freedom from suffering, to remedy all problems and
        pursue personal development.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The first kind of
        aspiration is the desire to know the truth of nature. The second
        aspiration is the desire to attain the state of freedom. When these two
        aspirations are integrated, the desire for knowledge is more clearly
        defined and directed. It becomes the desire to know the truth of nature
        in order to solve problems and lead human beings to freedom. This is the
        consummation of Buddhism. When these two kinds of aspiration merge, we
        have a cycle, a balance, a sufficiency. There is a clear limit to our
        aspiration for knowledge, our knowledge being used for the express
        purpose of creating a quality of life for the human race. In short, our
        aspiration for knowledge is firmly related to the human being, and this
        defines the way our knowledge is to be used.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As for science, originally
        there was merely the aspiration for knowledge. When the aspiration for
        knowledge is aimless and undirected, what results is a random collection
        of data, an attempt to know the truth behind nature by looking further
        and further outward - truth for its own sake. The scientific search for
        truth lacks direction. But human beings are driven by values. Because
        this aspiration for knowledge is without clear definition, it throws
        open the chance for other aspirations, or lesser values, to fill the
        vacuum. Some of these ulterior aims I have already mentioned, such as
        the desire to conquer nature, and later on, the desire to produce an
        abundance of material wealth. These two aspirations have created a
        different kind of cycle.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">I would like to reiterate
        the meaning of this cycle: it is the aspiration to know the truths of
        nature in order to exploit it for the production of material goods. This
        cycle has been the cause of innumerable problems in recent times:
        mental, social, and in particular, as we are seeing at present,
        environmental.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This is because the
        thinking of the industrial age has caught science by its loophole, an
        undefined aspiration for knowledge, which is human action done without
        consideration for the human being. At the present time we are
        experiencing the ill effects of this loophole: problems with the
        environment and elsewhere, arising from the belief in man's dominion
        over nature and the adherence to materialism.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This kind of thinking has
        caused a tendency to excess in human undertakings. There are no limits
        placed on the search for happiness. The search for happiness is endless,
        the destruction of nature is endless. Problems are bound to arise. This
        is one point at which Buddhism and science part their ways.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If we analyse further, we
        will see that the reason science has this loophole of being undirected
        is because it looks for truth exclusively in the external, material
        world. It does not search for knowledge within the human individual.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Science is not interested
        in, and in fact is ignorant of, human nature, and as a result has become
        an instrument of industry and its selfish advances on the environment.
        This ignorance of human nature is ignorance of the fact that pandering
        to the five senses is incapable of making mankind happy or contented.
        This kind of desire has no end, and so the search for material wealth
        has no end. Because this abundance of material goods is obtained through
        exploitation of nature, it follows that the manipulation of nature is
        also without end and without check. Ultimately, nature will not have
        enough to satisfy human desires. Even if human beings completely destroy
        nature, it won't be enough to satisfy human desire. It would probably be
        more correct to say that this exploitation of nature in itself gives man
        more misery than happiness.</font></p>

        versus self centred</font></a></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Just now I mentioned some
        important common ground in Buddhism and science, both in the areas of
        faith and of aspiration to knowledge. Now I would like to take a look at
        the object of this faith and aspiration to knowledge. The object is
        reality or truth. Our aspiration and our faith are rooted in the desire
        for truth or knowledge. When we have reached the essence of the matter,
        which is knowledge or truth, our aspiration is fulfilled. This means
        that humanity must understand the truth of the laws of nature.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">I would like to stress one
        more time that in Buddhism our goal is to use the knowledge of truth to
        improve on human life and solve problems, to attain a life that is
        perfectly free. On the other hand, science has as its goal the
        utilization of its knowledge for the conquest of nature, in order to
        provide a wealth of material goods. This is perhaps illustrated most
        clearly in the words of Rene Descartes, whose importance in the
        development of Western science and philosophy is well known. He wrote of
        the purpose of science as part of the struggle to &quot;render ourselves
        the masters and possessors of nature.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">With different goals, the
        object of knowledge must also be different. What is the object of
        knowledge in Buddhism? The prime object of our enquiry is the nature of
        the human being. Human beings are the object of knowledge, and from
        there our study spreads out to incorporate all the things with which we
        must deal externally. Mankind is always the object, the centre from
        which we study the truth of nature.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In science, on the other
        hand, the object of research is the external, physical environment. Even
        though science occasionally looks into the human being, it is usually
        only as another physical organism within the material universe. Mankind
        as such is not studied. That is, science may study human life, but only
        in a biological sense, not in relation to 'being human' or 'humanness'.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So the field of the
        Buddhist search for knowledge is the human being, while that of science
        is the external world. Taking this point as our reference, let us take a
        look at the respective extents of the nature that science seeks to know,
        and the nature that Buddhism seeks to know.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism believes that
        human beings are the highest evolution of nature. For that reason,
        mankind must encompass the entire spectrum of reality within himself.
        That is, the human organism contains nature on both the physical and
        mental planes. On the physical plane we have the body, made up of the
        elements and connected to the external physical world. However, the
        physical world does not include the world of values, or the mind. For
        that reason, through studying mankind it is possible to know the truth
        of all aspects of nature, both the physical and the abstract.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Science studies nature only
        on the material plane, in the world of matter and energy, and is not
        interested, and does not recognize, the factor of mind, consciousness or
        spirit. Science searches from the outside inwards. Having reached the
        human organism, science studies only 'life', but doesn't study the human
        being. Science knows only the facts of the physical world, but does not
        know the nature of the human being, or human nature.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">I have been talking so far
        about basic principles. Now I would like to make a few general
        observations.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Just now I stated that
        Buddhism puts mankind at the centre, it is anthropocentric. Its express
        aim is to understand and to develop the human being. Science, on the
        other hand, is interested only in the external world. It seeks to know
        the truths of things outside of the human being.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Over the years, as science
        incorporated the intention to conquer nature into its values, science
        once again put man at the centre of the picture, but in quite a
        different way from the way Buddhism does. Buddhism gives human beings
        the central position in the sense of recognizing their responsibilities.
        It emphasizes mankind's duty toward nature. Buddhism puts mankind in the
        centre insofar as he must develop himself, to remedy problems. This is
        what is of real benefit, enabling human beings to attain the
        transcendence of suffering, freedom and the highest good.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Science, in incorporating
        the view of the desirability of conquering nature into its aspirations,
        placed mankind in the centre of the picture once more, but only as the
        exploiter of nature. Man says &quot;I want this,&quot; from where he
        proceeds to manipulate nature, to mould it to his desires. Simply
        speaking, science's placing of man in the centre is from the perspective
        of feeding his selfishness.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In relation to the object
        of study, Buddhism places mankind in the centre. Man becomes the truth
        which must be studied, and that in order to be able to effectively
        develop human potential. But science, at the outset, in terms of truth
        to be studied, directs its attention solely towards the material world.
        Then it puts mankind in the centre as the agent who will make use of
        these material objects to feed his desires. Buddhism and science are
        thus both anthropocentric, with the distinction that while Buddhism is
        man-centred, science is self-centred.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The second observation I
        would like to make is in relation to Pure Science. Is science pure or
        impure?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The term'Pure Science', so
        named because it is reputed to be 'science and only science', that is,
        pure knowledge without any concern for practical application, is used to
        distinguish it from Applied Science or technology. But nowadays science
        is not so pure. Granted, in the sense that it has a relatively pure
        drive to study the laws of nature, it can be said to be pure, but when
        these other values infiltrate into scientific research it becomes
        impure.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><a name="_Toc528760845"><font face="Times New Roman">A
        similarity of methods with a difference of emphasis</font></a></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Having looked at the aim of
        enquiry, let us now consider the means for attaining that aim. What is
        the method used to find this knowledge? In Buddhism, the method for
        finding the truth is threefold.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Firstly, awareness of
        experience must be direct and impartial. Impartial awareness of
        experience is awareness of things as they are. Buddhism stresses the
        value of seeing the truth right from the very first awareness: when eye
        sees sights, ear hears sounds, and so on.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">For most human beings, this
        is already a problem. Awareness is usually in accordance with the way
        people would like things to be, or as they think they are, not as they
        really are. They cannot see things the way they are because of mistakes,
        distortions, biases, and misconceptions.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Secondly, there must be
        ordered thinking, or thinking that is sytematic. In addition to a method
        for cognizing data in an accurate way, there must also be an accurate
        way of thinking.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Thirdly, our method for
        verifying the truth, or researching knowledge, is through direct
        experience.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">How to ensure that the
        cognition of experience will be unbiased? In general, whenever human
        beings cognize experience, there are certain values which are
        immediately involved. Right here, at the very first arising of
        awareness, there is already the problem of whether the experiencer is
        free of these values or not.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">What are these values? The
        events which enter into our field of awareness will possess different
        qualities, causing either pleasant or unpleasant feelings. All of our
        experiences will be like this. If it's pleasant, we call it happiness,
        while if it is unpleasant, we call it suffering.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When awareness arises, and
        we experience a pleasant feeling, the workings of the mind will
        immediately proceed to liking or disliking. We call it 'delight and
        aversion', or love and hate. Cognition of sensations therefore has
        characteristics of affinity or antipathy and delight and aversion
        incorporated into it. People build these reactions into habits from the
        day they are born, making them extremely fluent. As soon as an
        experience is cognized, these values of comfort, discomfort or
        indifference, immediately follow, and from there to love or hate,
        delight or aversion.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">After the arising of
        delight, aversion, like, dislike, or love or hate, there is thinking in
        accordance with and under the influence of these feelings. If there is
        attraction, thinking will take on one form; if there is repulsion,
        thinking will take another form. Because if this, experience is
        distorted, swayed or biased. Awareness is false, there is proliferation
        and choice in the collection of data. Only some perspectives are seen,
        not others, and so the knowledge that arises as a result is not clear or
        comprehensive. In short, awareness is not of things as they really are.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">For that reason, in
        Buddhism we say that we must establish ourselves correctly from the
        beginning. There must be awareness of things as they are, awareness with
        sati (recollection, or mindfulness), neither delighting nor being
        averse. Experiences must be perceived with an aware mind, the mind of a
        student, let's say, or the mind of an observer, not with a mind that is
        loving and hating.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">How do we cognize with a
        mind that is learning? In brief, there are two ways to cognize with a
        learning mind:</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. Cognizing by seeing the
        truth</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">: that is, to be aware of
        things as they are, not being swayed and distorted by the powers of
        delight and aversion, love or hate. This is a pure kind of awareness,
        bare perception of experience without the addition of any
        value-judgements. This is referred to in the scriptures as
        &quot;perceiving just enough for the development of wisdom (nana)&quot;,
        that is, just enough to know and understand the experience as it is, and
        for the presence of recollection ( sati), that is, in order to collect
        data. Specifically, this is to see things according to their causes and
        conditions.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">2. Cognizing in a
        beneficial way</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">: that is,
        cognizing in conjunction with a skilful value, one that will be truly
        useful, rather than in order to cater for, pander to or frustrate the
        senses. This is to perceive experiences in such a way as to be able to
        make use of them all, both the liked and the disliked.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This second kind of knowing
        can be enlarged on thus: experience is a natural function of life, and
        life is involved with the natural environment in order to benefit from
        it. But in order for life to benefit from experiences, we must perceive
        them correctly. That is, there must be a conscious attempt to perceive
        in such a way as to see only the perspective that will be of benefit in
        solving problems and leading to development in life. Otherwise,
        awareness will be merely a tool for satisfying the sense-desires, or, if
        not, then a cause for frustrating the sense-desires, and any benefit
        will be lost. This kind of awareness perceives experiences in such a way
        as to make use of them. No matter whether experiences are good, evil,
        comfortable or not, they can all be used in a beneficial way. It all
        depends on whether we learn how to perceive them properly or not.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In this case, where our aim
        is to find out the truth, we must emphasize the first kind of awareness.
        In this awareness, if the wrong channels are avoided, the effects of
        delight and aversion do not occur, and awareness will be of the learning
        variety.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This kind of awareness is
        very important in studying or learning. We must begin our learning right
        at the first moment of awareness. In Buddhism this point is greatly
        stressed cognizing in order to learn, not in order to indulge in like or
        dislike, or to feed sense desires. Science may not speak about this in
        so many words, or emphasize it, but if the aim is to perceive the truth,
        this method is essential.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The second factor in
        attaining knowledge is right thinking. This means thinking that is
        structured, reasoned and in harmony with causes and conditions. In
        Buddhist scriptures many ways of thinking are mentioned, collectively
        known as yoniso-manasikara, or skilful reflection. Skilful reflection is
        an important factor in the development of Right View, understanding or
        vision in accordance with reality. This is to see things according to
        their causes and conditions, or to understand the principle of causes
        and conditions.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some of the kinds of
        skilful reflection explained in the texts are:</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. Searching for causes and
        conditions:</font></b><font face="Times New Roman"> This kind of
        thinking was of prime importance in the Buddha's enlightenment. For
        example, the Buddha investigated vedana, the experience of pleasure and
        pain, by asking &quot;On what do these feelings of pleasure and pain
        depend? What is their condition?&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Reflecting in this way, the
        Buddha saw that phassa, sense contact, is the condition for feeling.
        &quot;Now what is the condition for phassa?&quot; The Buddha saw that
        the six sense bases are the condition for phassa ... and so on. This is
        an example of thinking according to causes and conditions.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">2. Thinking by way of
        analysis</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">: Life as a human
        organism can be analysed into two main constituents, body and mind. Body
        and mind can both be further analysed. Mind, for example, can be
        analysed into vedana (feeling), sanna (perception), sankhara (volitional
        activities), and vinnana (consciousness) (x), and each of these
        categories can be further divided down into even smaller constituents.
        Feeling, for example, can be divided into three kinds, five kinds, six
        kinds and more. This is called 'thinking by analysing constituents',
        which is a way of breaking up the overall picture or system so that the
        causes and conditions involved can be more easily seen.</font></p>

        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">3. Thinking in terms of
        benefit and harm</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">: This is to
        look at things in the light of their quality, seeing the ways in which
        they benefit or harm us, not looking exclusively at their benefit or
        their harm. Most people tend to see only the benefits of things that
        they like, and only the faults of the things they don't like. But

        the benefit and the harm in them.</font></p>

        thinking, about ten are mentioned in the scriptures, are known as yoniso

        thinking also includes the way we perceive things, and so it includes
        the level of initial awareness, and, like those forms of awareness, can
        also be divided into two main groups - that is, thinking in order to see
        the truth, and thinking in a way that is beneficial. However I will not
        expand on the subject at this point as it would take up too much time.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Continuing on, the third
        method for attaining the truth in Buddhism is that of verifying through
        personal experience. One of the important principles of Buddhism is that
        the truth can be known and verified through observation as a direct
        experience (sanditthiko, paccattam veditabbo vinnuki). See, for example,
        the Kalamasutta mentioned earlier, in which the Buddha advises the
        Kalamas not to simply believe in things, summarizing that &quot;when you
        have seen for yourself which conditions are skilful and which unskilful,
        then strive to develop the skilful ones and to give up the
        unskilful.&quot; This teaching clearly illustrates the practice that is
        based on personal experience.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Looking at the story of the
        Buddha, we can see that he was using this method throughout his
        practice. When he first left his palace in search of enlightenment, he
        practiced according to the practices and methods which were practiced at
        that time ... asceticism, yoga, trances and the rest. Even when he went
        to live in the forest, the practices he undertook were all ways of
        experimenting. For example, the Buddha told of how he went to live alone
        in wild jungles, so that he could experiment with fear. In the deep
        hours of the night, a branch would crack and fear would arise. The
        Buddha would always look for the causes of the fear. No matter what
        posture he happened to be in, if fear arose, he would maintain that
        posture until he had overcome it. Most people would have run for their
        lives! The Buddha didn't run, he stayed still until he had overcome the
        problem. Another example of the Buddha's experimentation was with good
        and bad thoughts. The Buddha experimented with his thinking until he was
        able to make unskilful thoughts subside.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha used the method
        of personal experience throughout his practice. And when he was teaching
        his disciples, he taught them to assess the teacher closely before
        believing him, because faith must always be a vehicle for the
        development of wisdom. The Buddha taught to closely assess teachers,
        even the Buddha himself, both from the perspective of whether he was
        teaching the truth, and also in the sense of the purity of the teacher's
        intentions.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Testing the teacher's
        knowledge can be done through considering the plausibility of the
        teaching. Testing the teacher's intentions can be done by considering
        the teacher's intentions in teaching. Does this teacher give his
        teaching out of desire for a personal reward? Does he want any gift or
        personal gain, other than the benefit of the listener, for his teaching?
        If, after assessing the teacher, one still has confidence in him, then
        one can receive the teachings. This assessment and evaluation proceeds
        through all the levels of the teacher-disciple relationship.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We could also look into the
        teaching of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, which emphasizes
        insight meditation. When we are practicing insight meditation, we must
        always consider and reflect on the experiences that come into our
        awareness, as they arise. Whether a pleasant feeling or unpleasant
        feeling arises, whether the mind is depressed or elated, the Buddha
        taught to look into it and note its arising, its faring and its passing
        away.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Even in the highest stages
        of practice, when assessing to see whether one is enlightened or not, we
        are told to look directly into our own hearts, seeing whether there is
        still greed, hatred and delusion or not, rather than looking for special
        or miraculous signs.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Because the emphasis and
        field of research in Buddhism and science differ in terms of
        observation, experiment and verification, results in the two fields will
        differ. Science strives to observe events solely in the physical
        universe, using the five senses, with the objective of manipulating the
        external physical world. In the language of Buddhism we might say that
        science is expert in the fields of utuniyama (physical laws) and
        bijaniyama (biological laws).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism, on the other
        hand, emphasizes the study of the human organism, accepting experiences
        through all of the senses, including the sixth sense, mind. The
        objective of Buddhist practice is to attain the highest good and an
        understanding of the truth of nature. Even before the objective is
        reached, there is redressing of problems and advances in human
        development. For that reason, Buddhism has many teachings and methods
        dealing with observation, experimentation and verification of mental
        phenomena and in relation to human behaviour. In Buddhist terminology we
        would say that Buddhism has its strength in the fields of kammaniyama
        (moral laws) and cittaniyama (psychic laws).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If it were possible to
        incorporate the respective fields of expertise of both science and
        Buddhism, bringing the fruits of their labours together, we might arrive
        at a balanced way for leading human development to a higher level</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><a name="_Toc528760846"><font face="Times New Roman">Differences
        in methods</font></a></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">While on the subject of the
        three methods for finding knowledge, I would like to look at the
        differences between these methods in Buddhism and in science.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Firstly, science uses the
        technique of amassing knowledge in order to find truth. This amassing of
        knowledge is completely divorced from concerns of lifestyle, whereas in
        Buddhism, the method of attaining knowledge is part of the way of life.
        Science has no concern with lifestyle, it looks for truth for its own
        sake, but in Buddhism, method is part of the way of life - in fact it is
        the way of life - having a positive effect on life in the present
        moment. .Consider, for example, the effect of clear awareness, without
        the interference of delight and loathing, on the quality of life. The
        Buddhist search for knowledge has great worth in itself, regardless of
        whether or not the goal is attained.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Science takes its data
        exclusively from the experiences arising through the five senses, while
        Buddhism includes the experiences of the sixth sense, the mind, which
        science does not acknowledge. Buddhism states that the sixth sense is a
        verifiable truth. However, verification can only really be done through
        the respective senses from which that data arose. For instance, to
        verify a taste we must use the tongue; to verify volume of sound we must
        use the ear, not the eye. If we want to verify colours, we don't use our
        ears. The sense base which verifies sense data must be compatible with
        the kind of data that is being verified.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If the sixth sense is not
        recognized, we will be deprived of an immense amount of sense data,
        because there is much experience which arises exclusively in the mind.
        There are, for example, many experiences within the mind which can be
        immediately experienced and verified, such as love, hate, anger, fear.
        These things cannot be verified or experienced through other sense
        organs. If we experience love in the mind, we ourselves know our own
        mind, we can verify it for ourselves. When there is fear, or a feeling
        of anger, or feelings of comfort, peace, or contentnent, we can know
        them directly in our own minds.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore, in Buddhism we
        give this sixth sense, the mind and its thinking, a prominent role in
        the search for knowledge or truth. But science, which does not
        acknowledge this sixth sense, must resort to instruments designed for
        the other five senses, mainly the eyes and ears, such as the
        encephalogram, to study the thinking process.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Scientists tell us that in
        the future they'll be able to tell what people are thinking simply by
        using a machine, or by analysing the chemicals secreted by the brain.
        These things do have a factual basis, but the truth that these things
        will reveal will probably be like Sir Arthur Eddington's &quot;shadow
        world of symbols&quot;. It is not really the truth, but a shadow of the
        truth.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This indicates that
        scientific truth, like the scientific method, is faulty, because it
        breaches one of the rules of observation. The instruments do not
        correspond with the data. As long as this is the case, science will have
        to continue observing shadows of reality for a long time to come.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now this sixth sense, the
        mind, is also very important in science. Science itself has developed
        through this sixth sense, from the very beginnings right up to and
        including the experimental and summary levels. On the first level,
        before any other senses can be used, the scientist must utilize
        thinking. He must organize a plan, a method of verification, and he must
        establish an hypothesis. All of these activities are mental processes,
        which are dependent on the sixth sense, the mind. Even in practical
        application there must be the mind following events with awareness,
        taking notes. And the mind is the arbitrator, the judge of whether or
        not to accept the various data that arise during the experiment.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The final stages of
        scientific enquiry, the assessment and conclusions of the experiment,
        the formulation of a theory and so on, are all thought processes. We can
        confidently say that the theories of science are all results of
        thinking, they are fruits of the sixth sense, which is the headquarters
        of all the other senses. Buddhism acknowledges the importance of the
        sixth sense as a channel through which events can be directly
        experienced.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The important point is that
        awareness must be received through the appropriate sense organ.
        Something which must be cognized by the eye must be cognized by the eye.
        Something which must be cognized by the tongue must be cognized by the
        tongue. By the same token, something which must be cognized through the
        mind cannot be cognized with eyes, ears or any sense organ other than
        the mind.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The truth of the mind is a
        verifiable cause and effect process. It is subject to the laws of
        nature. Even though it may seem very intricate and difficult to follow,
        Buddhism teaches that the mind conforms to the stream of causes and
        conditions, just like any other natural phenomenon.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the material world, or
        the world of physics, it is recognized that all things exist according
        to causes and conditions, but in cases where the conditions are
        extremely intricate, it is very difficult to predict or follow these
        events. A simple example is weather prediction, which is recognized as a
        very difficult task, because there are so many inconstants. The sequence
        of causes and conditions within the mind is even more complex than the
        factors involved in the weather, making prediction of results even more
        difficult.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Human beings are a part of
        nature which contain the whole of nature within them. If people were
        able to open their eyes and look, they would be able to attain the truth
        of nature as a direct experience. Using scientific instruments,
        extensions of the five senses, is a roundabout way of proceeding. It can
        only verify truth on some levels, just enough to conquer nature and the
        external world (to an extent), but it cannot lead man to the total truth
        of reality.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So far we have covered the
        differences and similarities in scope and object of Buddhism and
        science, the types of knowledge that are being looked for, the methods
        used for finding that knowledge, and the utilization of the knowledge
        gained, or the overall objective of this knowledge. Even though the
        methods for finding the truth have some similarities, they entail a
        difference of scope and emphasis, because the truths that are being
        searched for are different.</font></p>
