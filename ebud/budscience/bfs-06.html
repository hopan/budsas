        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">NOW THAT WE ARE almost
        finished, I would like to offer some suggestions on how science could be
        improved upon.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The first point which I
        would like to go over is the point already mentioned some time ago,
        regarding 'insufficiency'. Science is not sufficient to remedy the
        problems in the modern day world. I would like to use the example of the
        environment, because the problem of conservation is one of the major
        issues of our time, and science must play a leading role in helping to
        solve this problem, especially in terms of research and proposals for
        solutions.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Scientific knowledge is
        invaluable. It can warn us of the dangers that exist, their causes, and
        the ways in which we have to deal with them. Technology, which has
        originated from science, is an essential tool in this work. But even
        though we have such valuable tools, they alone are not enough to solve
        the problem. Moreover, when we consider the causes for these problems,
        we find that they have arisen from science and technology.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Science and technology are
        not able to correct their own handiwork. Even though we have the
        necessary knowledge at our disposal, we do not use it. In spite of
        having the technical capability to solve problems, we continue to use
        the kind of technology which aggravates them. To put it simply,
        scientific knowledge is incapable of changing human behaviour, in spite
        of the fact that if the right technology was used we could solve the
        problems facing us. Attempts to solve these problems are always stuck on
        indecision. In the immediate future science may have to content itself
        with working in conjunction with other disciplines, providing data for
        them in a collective effort to address these problems.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now what can be used to
        solve the problems of mankind in addition to science and technology?
        From a Buddhist perspective, solving human problems, regardless of type,
        must always be done with a three-pronged approach, because the causes of
        human problems arise on many different levels.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the environmental issue,
        for example, there are three levels which must be integrated, namely:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. The level of behaviour<br>
          2. The level of the mind<br>
          3. The level of understanding</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These three levels must be
        integrated in the process of problem solving, thus:</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. <b>On the level of
        behaviour</b>, there must be social constraint, that is, restraint on
        the outward manifestations of bodily and verbal behaviour.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There are two ways to
        constrain behaviour in society:</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Firstly, restraint from
        without, through regulations and laws, including punishment for
        lawbreakers and so on. In Buddhism this is called 'vinaya'.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The second way is restraint
        from within the individual, through intention. In most cases such
        intention arises from religious faith. If, for example, there is belief
        or confidence in religion, there is a readiness and willingness to
        restrain behaviour. This way is called in Buddhism sila.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In short, the first way is
        vinaya- regulations and standards for constraining destructive actions,
        and the second way is sila - the conscious intention to be restrained
        within the restrictions thus imposed.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Both of these ways are
        related in that they are concerned with the control and training of
        behaviour. On a social level it is necessary to establish regulations,
        but these are not yet enough. We must also use sila, restraint from
        within, until moral conduct is fluent and regular.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">2. Because <b>the mind</b>
        is one of the factors involved in causing problems, solving them by
        control of behaviour alone is not yet enough. We must also deal with the
        mind.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the example I am using
        here, our aim is to conserve nature. If we want everyone to help out in
        the conservation of nature, we must first instill the desire to do so
        into people's hearts. So from &quot;conservation of nature&quot; we
        arrive at &quot;wanting to conserve nature.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">From where does the desire
        to conserve nature arise? It arises from a love of nature. If there is
        an appreciation of nature, the desire to conserve it will naturally
        follow. But that's not the end - people will only appreciate nature when
        they can live happily with nature.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It seems that most people
        have realized the importance of appreciating nature, but if that is all
        they see they are short-sighted. They are not seeing the whole chain of
        conditions. As long as they fail to see all the factors involved, any
        attempts to address the problem will fail. We must search further down
        to find the beginning of the chain, to see what needs to be done to
        encourage people to appreciate nature.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A love of nature will arise
        with difficulty if people are not happy living with nature. People must
        have minds that are at ease living with nature before they can love
        nature, from where they can develop the desire to conserve nature, which
        in turn will lead to the actual work of conservation.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Even though there may be
        other factors or discrepancies in our chain of conditions, this much is
        enough to convey the general idea. It seems, though, that so far science
        has had an important role in obstructing this process from functioning.
        That is, the desire to seek happiness from the exploitation of nature
        has caused people to feel, deeply within, that human beings can only be
        happy through technology, and that nature is an obstacle to this
        happiness.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Many children in the
        present day feel that their happiness lies with technology, they do not
        feel at all comfortable being with nature. They may even go so far as to
        see nature as an enemy, an obstacle to their happiness. Nature must be
        conquered in order to enjoy the happiness of technology. Take a look at
        the minds of people in the present age. You will see that most people in
        society feel this way. This results from the influence of science in the
        recent Industrial Age.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The beliefs in conquering
        nature and seeking happiness in material goods, which are represented
        and advocated by technology, have held sway over the minds of human
        beings for such a long time that people have developed the feeling that
        nature is an enemy, an obstruction to human progress. As long as this
        kind of thinking prevails, it will be very difficult for human beings to
        love nature, because they will be unable to find happiness within it.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">For this reason, I say that
        our ways of thinking must be changed. If we are to continue living in a
        natural world we must find a point of balance, and in order to do that
        we must develop an appreciation of nature, at least to see that nature
        can provide us with happiness. There is much beauty in nature, and
        technology can be used to enhance our appreciation of it.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In order to be more
        effective, constraint of behaviour needs to be supported by mental
        conviction. If there is appreciation of skilful action and a sense of
        satisfaction in such behaviour, or there is sufficient drive to make us
        voluntarily begin to organize our behaviour in a constructive manner,
        then selftraining need not be a forced or difficult operation.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">3. <b>The level of wisdom</b>
        refers to an understanding of the process of cause and effect, or causes
        and conditions, in nature. This is of prime importance. In order to
        understand the pros and cons of the issue of conservation we must have
        some understanding of nature. In this respect Pure Science can be of
        immense benefit, providing the data which will enable us to see the
        relevant factors involved in the deterioration of the environment, in
        what ways the environment has deteriorated, and what effects are to be
        expected from this deterioration.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Understanding of the
        situation opens people's minds and makes them receptive. If there is
        understanding that a certain action causes damage to the environment,
        which will in turn have a detrimental effect on human beings, we will
        have the incentive to change our behaviour.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes, however, in
        spite of understanding the ill effects of something, we cannot change
        our behaviour, because the mind does not accept the truth on a deep
        enough level. That is why it is important for the mind to have both an
        understanding of the situation on an intellectual level, and also an
        emotional feeling, an appreciation, an ability to be happy with nature.
        Scientific knowledge alone is not enough to induce people to change
        their ways, because of attachment to habits, personal gains, social
        preferences and so on. With enjoyment of nature as a base, any
        intellectual understanding, such as an understanding of the ecological
        system, will serve to deepen or fortify all qualities on the emotional
        level.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In order to really address
        the situation we must have a comprehensive solution. The methods of
        Buddhism are a comprehensive solution to the problem at all levels.
        There are three prongs or divisions of the Buddhist path. In Buddhism we
        call the first level sila, the constraint or control of moral behaviour
        within vinaya, laws and regulations. Restraint of action is achieved
        through intention, which is the essence of sIla. Both these levels,
        regulations and moral intention, are included under the general heading
        of sila, training in moral conduct.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The second level concerns
        the mind, training the feelings, qualities and habits of the mind to be
        virtuous and skilful. This is the division known as samadhi, the
        training of the mind.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The third level is wisdom,
        panna, or knowledge and understanding. Wisdom is the quality which
        monitors the activities of the first and second levels, examining them
        and keeping them on the right track throughout. On its own, wisdom tends
        to be inactive, and so must be supported by training in moral conduct
        and meditation.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Wisdom not only supervises
        the practice of moral restraint and meditation, but also examines the
        negative side of things, seeing, for example, the harmful effects of any
        unskilful behaviour pattern, even in cases where such behaviour is
        enjoyable or profitable in some way. If such pleasure is seen to be in
        any way harmful, wisdom is the voice which tells us that such behaviour
        should be given up or corrected, and in which ways it can be done.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These three divisions work
        together and are interdependent. Initially we train our actions,
        cultivating skilful behaviour and giving up the unskilful. At the same
        time we train the mind, instilling in it skilful drives and a feeling of
        joy or satisfaction in the practice, and develop understanding of
        reality and the reasons for practice, seeing the benefit and harm of our
        actions as they are.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As we train and the
        practice becomes more and more consistent, the mind will take delight in
        the practice, which causes faith to increase. When faith arises, the
        mind is keen to contemplate and understand our actions. When wisdom or
        understanding arises, seeing the benefit in practising and the harm of
        not practising, faith is enhanced once again. When faith is increased,
        we are more able to control and adapt our behaviour and make it more in
        accordance with the right path.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><a name="_Toc528760856"><font face="Times New Roman">Too
        late</font></a></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now we come to the quality
        of 'too late'. I would like to give an illustration of what I mean by
        this statement to show what it has to do with science. As an example I
        would like to compare the attitudes of Buddhism with the attitudes of
        science, which have some strong similarities.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In science we have
        scientific knowledge on one hand, and scientific attitude on the other.
        In many cases the scientific attitude is more important than scientific
        knowledge. Why is this? Because the data or knowledge obtained by
        science has sometimes proven to be wrong and had to be corrected. This
        tends to be an ongoing process. This scientific attitude or objective is
        a constant principle, one which has been of immense benefit to human
        beings. Whether individual pieces of knowledge can actually be used or
        not is not a sure thing, but this attitude is a condition that can be
        used immediately and is of immediate benefit. However, the attitudes of
        science and Buddhism have some slight discrepancies.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Firstly, let us define our
        terms. What are the attitudes of Buddhism and science? The attitude of
        both Buddhism and science have the same objectives, and that is to see
        all things according to cause and effect, or causes and conditions. On
        encountering any situation, both the Buddhist attitude and the
        scientific attitude will try to look at it according to its causes and
        conditions, to try to see it as it really is.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">For example: You see your
        friend walking towards you with a sour look on his face. For most of us,
        seeing a sour expression on our friend's face would normally be an
        unpleasant sight. We would think our friend was angry with us, and we
        would react in negative ways. An awareness of unpleasant experience has
        taken place, and a reaction of dislike arises, thinking, &quot;He can
        get angry, well so can I&quot;. And so we wear a sour expression in
        response.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">But with a Buddhist or
        scientific attitude, when we see our friend walking towards us with a
        sour expression, we do not look on it with an aggravated state of mind,
        through liking or disliking, but with the objective of finding out the
        truth. This is the attitude of looking at things according to causes and
        conditions ... &quot;Hmm, he's looking angry. I wonder why my friend is
        looking angry today. I wonder if something's bothering him. Maybe
        somebody said something to upset him at home, or maybe he's got no
        money, or maybe ... &quot; That is, we look for the real causes for his
        expression. This is what I call the Buddhist attitude, which is applied
        to mental phenomena, and which correlates with the scientific attitude,
        which applies to the material plane. It is an attitude of learning, of
        looking at things according to causes and conditions.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If we look at the situation
        in this way no problem arises. Such an attitude will instead lead to the
        relief of problems and the development of wisdom. Searching for the
        causes and conditions for our friend's sour expression, we might ask him
        the cause or act in some other intelligent way, initiating a response
        which is attuned to solving the problem.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This is an example of an
        attitude which is common to both Buddhism and science. But how do their
        attitudes differ? The scientific attitude is one that is used only to
        gain knowledge, but the Buddhist attitude is considered to be part and
        parcel of life itself. That is, this attitude is part of the skilful
        life, it is a way of living harmoniously in society. In short, it is
        ethics.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The scientific attitude is
        one clear example of how science avoids the subject of ethics or values
        while in fact containing them. That is, the scientific attitude is in
        itself an ethic, but because science does not clearly recognize this, it
        fails to fully capitalize on this ethic. More importantly, science fails
        to see ethics as an essential factor within the process of realizing the
        truth of nature.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism does not use
        attitude simply for the acquisition of knowledge, but incorporates it
        into daily life, in the actuality of the present moment. When we
        incorporate daily life into the picture we come to the quality I call
        'too late'. Because the scientific attitude is an attitude and means
        simply of finding knowledge, any practical application must wait until
        science finds out all the answers. As long as we don't know the answers
        our hands are tied. If we don't yet know what something is, we don't
        know how we should behave towards it.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">But in this world there are
        so many things that science does not yet have the answers for, and
        there's no telling when science will have the answers. At the same time,
        mankind, both as an individual and as a society, must conduct life in
        the present moment. To put it simply, the conduct of life for human
        beings in a skilful and proper way, within the space of one individual
        life-span or one society, in real time, cannot wait for these answers
        from the scientific world.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddhist attitude is to
        search for knowledge in conjunction with living life, holding that to
        look at things according to cause and effect is part and parcel of the
        process of living a good life, not simply a tool to find knowledge.
        Therefore, with the Buddhist attitude, whenever we meet something that
        is not yet known clearly to us, or has not yet been verified, we have an
        outlook which enables us to practise skilfully towards it. We do not
        lose our standard in life.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The scientific attitude
        seeks knowledge only, but does not give an outlook for living life.
        Buddhism teaches both levels, giving a path of practice in relation to
        things in present day life. I will give an illustration, one which has
        troubled mankind throughout the ages and toward which even we, as
        Buddhists, fail to use a proper Buddhist outlook. I refer to the subject
        of heavenly beings (Devas).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The subject of heavenly
        beings is one that can be looked at in terms of its relation to
        verifiable truth, or it can be looked at in relation to human society,
        in the light of every day life. Looking at the subject with the
        scientific attitude, we think of it in terms of its verifiable truth,
        that is, whether these things actually exist or not. Then we have to
        find a means to verify the matter. The subject would eventually become
        one of those truths 'waiting to be verified', or perhaps 'unverifiable'.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">But regardless of whether
        it is waiting to be verified, or it is considered unverifiable, the
        matter gets stuck right here, and mankind has no practical course to
        follow. As long as it remains unverified, it becomes simply a matter of
        belief. One group believes these things do exist, one group believes
        they don't. Each side has its own ideas. Take note that those who
        believe that there are no such things are not beyond the level of belief
        - they are still stuck on the belief that such things do not exist. Both
        of these groups of people are living in the one society. As long as they
        hold these differing and unresolvable beliefs, there is going to be a
        state of tension.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In this instance, science
        has no recommen-dations to offer, but in Buddhism there are ways of
        practice given in graded steps. On the first level, looking for truth by
        experimentation, regardless of who wants to prove the matter one way or
        the other, there is no problem. Those who are looking for the facts are
        free to continue their search, either in support of the existence of
        heavenly beings or against it.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">On the second level,
        finding a right attitude for the conduct of everyday life, what should
        we do? In Buddhism there is a way of practice which does not contradict
        the case either for or against the existence of heavenly beings . Our
        lives have a standard which is clear and can be applied immediately. We
        are always ready to accept the truth, whether it is eventually proven
        that heavenly beings do exist or they do not, and our way of life will
        be in no way affected by such a discovery.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Most people are easily
        swayed or put on the defensive because of doubts about issues such as
        this, which tends to make them lean towards either one of two extreme
        views either that heavenly beings do exist or that they don't. If you
        believe that heavenly beings do exist, then you have to make
        supplications and perform ritual ceremonies to placate them. If you
        believe that there aren't any heavenly beings, then you must argue with
        those who do.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">But in Buddhism we
        distinguish clearly between the search for facts, which proceeds as
        normal, and the conduct of everyday life. Our life does not depend on
        the heavenly beings. If there are heavenly beings, then they are beings
        in this universe just like us, subject to birth, subject to aging,
        subject to sickness and subject to death. We Buddhists have a teaching
        which encourages us to develop kind thoughts to all beings in the
        Universe. If there are heavenly beings, then we must have kind thoughts
        toward those heavenly beings.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The essence of Buddhism is
        the teaching of self-development and self-reliance. The objective is
        freedom. If we are practicing in accordance with the principle of
        self-reliance, we know what our responsibility is. Our responsibility is
        to train ourselves, to better ourselves. And the responsibility of the
        heavenly beings is to better themselves. So we both have the same
        responsibility, to better ourselves. We can co-exist with the heavenly
        beings with kind thoughts. At the same time, whether heavenly beings
        exist or not is no concern of ours. It's like the hippos and the jungle
        cats - each can exist peacefully in the world without problems. In this
        way, Buddhism has a clear outlook on the matter, and Buddhists do not
        have to worry about such things.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Without this attitude, we
        get caught in the problem of whether these things do exist or not. If
        they do exist, how should we conduct ourselves? We might start to create
        ceremonies and sacrifices, which is not the duty of a Buddhist. The
        Buddhist responsibility is to practice to better oneself. If a human
        being succeeds in fully bettering himself, then he becomes the most
        excellent of all beings - even the heavenly beings revere him.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This is an example of
        Buddhist attitude, which in essence is very similar to the attitude
        described in the simile of the man wounded by the poisoned arrow. If you
        have been pierced by an arrow, your first duty is to remove the arrow
        before the poison spreads throughout the body and kills you. As for
        searching for data in relation to that incident, whoever feels so
        inclined can do so, but first it is necessary to take out that arrow.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now this is very similar to
        the thinking of Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington. He had a similar idea,
        although he did not put it in Buddhist terms. He wrote:</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Verily, it is easier
        for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a scientific
        man to pass through a door. And whether the door be barn door or church
        door it might be wiser that he should consent to be an ordinary man and
        walk in rather than wait till all the difficulties involved in a really
        scientific ingress are resolved.</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In Christian texts it is
        said that it would be easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a
        needle than for a rich man to go to heaven. Eddington rephrased this a
        little, saying that it would be easier for a camel to pass through the
        eye of a needle than for a scientific man to go through a door and into
        a room. What did he mean by this?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">I stress here that
        Eddington is talking about a scientific man, not a scientist. The reason
        it would be so hard for a scientific man to enter a room is that a
        scientific man would have to first stand in front of the door and
        wonder, &quot;... Hmm, I wonder if I should go through this door?&quot;
        He would have to consider all the physical laws. He might try to figure
        for example, how many pounds of air pressure per square inch would be on
        his body if he walked through the door, how fast the earth would be
        spinning at the time, how this would effect his walking into the room
        ... he would be thinking for ever. In the end the scientific man would
        find it impossible to go through the door, because he would never finish
        his scientific calculations. That is why Eddington said it would be even
        easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a
        scientific man to pass through a door.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Eddington concluded that
        scientists should behave as normal. Whether it be the door of a church,
        the door of a farm or of anything else, then just to go through it. As
        for verification, that can continue. This seems to fit in nicely with
        the Buddhist position, so I have included it here.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If things continue as they
        are, science is in danger of becoming another kind of 'higher
        philosophy'. That is, one of those 'truths' which are impossible to use
        in the situations of everyday life, because they are forever waiting to
        be verified.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><a name="_Toc528760857"><font face="Times New Roman">The
        problem of development can only be addressed when values are truly
        understood</font></a></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Pure Science maintains that
        it is void of values, but it is well known how important the role of
        science has been in the development of society in recent times, even
        though this development has been the activity of human beings, imbued as
        they are with values. When we look closely at history we find that
        values have been exerting a subtle influence over the birth and
        development of science, beginning with faith and the aspiration to know
        the truths of nature, up until the most destructive value, the desire to
        conquer nature and produce an abundance of material goods.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The solution to the problem
        of values in science is not to try to get rid of them. It is not
        necessary for science to try to evade values. It is more a matter of
        trying to clarify the values that science does, or should, have.
        Otherwise, science may unknowingly become the victim of other values,
        values which obstruct the truth, and cause science to become a negative
        influence, one that could even threaten the complete destruction of the
        human race.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the preceding parts of
        this lecture I have tried to show the connection of science to values on
        two levels, the highest value and the provisional value. This highest
        value is one that science must adhere to in order to be able to attain
        to the highest truth, because the highest value is in itself the truth
        and thus an indispensable factor in the attainment of ultimate truth.
        However, this highest value, the highest good, or freedom, is an ideal,
        it is an objective, and as such will not exert a major influence on the
        quality of science in general.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The value which will have
        the most immediate influence over science is the secondary value, of
        which there are two kinds: that which is derived from, and harmonious
        with, the highest value; and the phony value which has infiltrated into
        science as a result of a lack of reflection on values.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">While scientists have no
        understanding of values, and fail to see the relationship between them
        and the truth they are seeking, science will, in addition to limiting
        the scope of knowledge to which it aspires and rendering the search for
        highest knowledge fruitless, be taken over by the lesser and more
        counter-productive values, some inherited from previous generations, and
        some fed by desire and the search for happiness within the minds of
        present-day scientists themselves. When these inferior values exert an
        influence over the mind, not only do they throw the search for true
        knowledge off course, but they lead to destructive influences, causing
        problems either in the immediate present, or if not, then at some time
        in the future.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Conversely, if scientists,
        or those seeking truth, realize the connection between abstract values
        and the physical world, they will also realize that to search for and
        understand natural truth is to understand the nature of man; that for
        man to understand himself is to understand the nature around him. When
        there is this kind of realization, the secondary value which is derived
        from the highest value will arise of itself. It will automatically be
        fulfilled. When there is right understanding, the result will be
        two-fold, namely:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. The search for
          knowledge will not be limited or misdirected, but will be set straight
          on the course for the highest kind of knowledge.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">2. The correct kind of
          secondary value will automatically arise and human development will
          proceed in conjunction with the search for knowledge.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If research is based on
        this right understanding, the right kind of value will automatically be
        present.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The highest kind of value
        is a condition that will be attained on the realization of truth. It is
        not necessary to strive to attain this value in itself, simply to bear
        it in mind. When this is realized, a balanced kind of secondary value,
        which is congruous with the highest value, will arise.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Even though in the path
        that is directed toward, and harmonious with, the truth, the assurance
        of values is not necessary, being already included in the awareness of
        truth, in practical terms, such as when scientific knowledge is
        transferred into technology, it may be necessary to emphasize some
        values in order to clarify the direction of research and to prevent the
        infiltration of inferior and destructive values. Examples of some of
        these positive values might be: the search for knowledge in order to
        attain freedom from human imperfection, or to search for knowledge in
        order to solve problems and further the development of mankind ... even
        including lesser values, such as to strive to do everything as
        circumspectly as possible, with minimal harmful results.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">At the very least, the
        realization of the importance of values will enable scientists to be
        aware of and to understand the way to relate to the values with which
        they have to deal in their search for knowledge, such as greed, anger,
        hurt, jealousy, envy and so on, such as in the case of Newton. More
        importantly, they will see the benefit of a correct set of values and
        know how to use them effectively, even in the advancement of the search
        for knowledge. At the very least, scientists will have a sense of morals
        and not become the mere servants of industry.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One value which is of prime
        importance to humanity and its activities is happiness, or the qualities
        of happiness and suffering. The value of happiness lies deeply and
        subconsciously behind all human activities and is thus an essential part
        of ethics. One's conception of happiness will naturally influence all
        one's undertakings. For example, the values of the Industrial Age saw
        that happiness lay in the subjugation of nature, after which nature
        could be used as humanity wished. This has led to the developments which
        are presently causing so many problems in the world.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In order to address the
        problems successfully we must see the truth of happiness and suffering
        as they really are. Conversely, if we do not correct our values in
        regard to happiness and suffering, we will have no way of addressing the
        problems of human development.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To correct our definition
        of happiness means, in brief, to change our social values, no longer
        trying to find happiness in the destruction of nature, but instead
        finding happiness in harmony with nature. In this way we can limit the
        manipulation of nature to what is necessary to relieve human suffering,
        rather than to feed pleasure-seeking.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Mankind must realize that
        if he continues to seek happiness from the destruction of nature, he
        will not find the happiness he is looking for, even if nature is
        completely destroyed. Conversely, if mankind is able to live happily
        with nature, he will experience happiness even while developing the
        freedom from suffering.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Roughly speaking, there are
        three main values with which scientists will inevitably have to deal.
        They are:</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. Mundane values, which
        scientists, as ordinary people, have in common with everybody else. This
        includes incentives or motivations, both good and bad, occurring in
        everyday life, and also in the search for and use of knowledge. Such
        values include selfishness, the desire for wealth, gains, fame or
        eminence, or, on the other hand, altruistic values, such as kindness and
        compassion.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">2. Values which are adhered
        to as principles, and which guide the direction of learning, such as the
        idea of subjugating nature, or industrial values, the belief that
        happiness can be obtained through a wealth of material goods, or
        conversely, the principle of addressing problems and improving the
        quality of life.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">3. The highest value, which
        scientists should adhere to as members of the human race; that is, the
        value which is the ideal of the human race as a whole, which, as I have
        said, has so far been neglected by the world of science. Science is
        still only half way, with an aspiration to know the truths of nature
        solely on an outward level. Such an aspiration does not include the
        matter of 'being human' or the highest good.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Science has still some
        unfinished business to do in regard to these three values.</font></p>

        constructive technology</font></a></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">On the level of everyday
        life, or satisfying the everyday needs of humanity, science plays the
        vital role of paving the way for technological development and
        encouraging the production, development and consumption of lop-sided
        technology. On the other hand, social preferences for a particular kind
        of technology encourage scientific research aimed at producing,
        developing and consuming that technology.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">From what we have seen,
        science, supported by the beliefs in the efficacy of conquering nature
        and producing an abundance of material goods, has spurred the production
        and development of technology along a path resulting in serious
        problems. Science and technology may have actually done more harm than
        good.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The kind of production,
        development and consumption of technology which has caused these
        problems is one geared to feeding greed (selfishly and wastefully
        catering to desires on the sensual plane), hatred (causing exploitation,
        destruction, power mongering), and delusion (encouraging heedlessness,
        time-wasting activities, and the blind consumption and use of
        technology).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the development of
        science on the technological level, it will be necessary to change some
        of the basic assumptions it is based on, by encouraging the development
        of constructive technology, which is free of harmful effects, within the
        constraints of these three principles:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. Technology which is
          moderate.<br>
          2. Technology which is used for creating benefit.<br>
          3. Technology which serves to develop understanding and improve the
          human being.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">I would like to expand on
        this a little.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. We must acknowledge the
        needs of the ordinary human being. Ordinary people want to be able to
        satisfy their desires for pleasure in regard to the senses. We do not
        want to suppress or deny these sense pleasures. The important point is
        to encourage the constraint of behaviour to a degree which is not
        destructive or extravagant, by encouraging restraint on the mind,
        keeping it within moderate limitations. That is, a limitation in which
        self-created sense desires are balanced by an awareness of what is of
        real benefit to and truly necessary in life. This is expressed in the
        words 'know moderation'. This is closely related to the development of
        wisdom through human development. In particular, there should be some
        principles governing the production, development and consumption of
        material goods wherein they are directed towards real benefit, aimed at
        bettering the quality of life rather than satisfying inferior values. In
        short, we can call this, 'technology which is moderate', or technology
        which puts a limitation on greed.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">2. In addition to
        selfishness and greed, mankind has a tendency to covet power over
        others, and to destroy those who oppose his desires. The human potential
        for hatred has found expression in many ways, causing the production,
        development and consumption of technology which facilitates mutual
        destruction more than mutual cooperation. Mankind must turn around and
        change this direction of development, by establishing a clear objective
        and creating a firm and decisive plan to encourage the production,
        development and consumption of goods which are constructive and
        beneficial to human society. This technology for benefit will help to do
        away with or diminish the production of technology which caters to
        hatred.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">3. So far, the production,
        development and consumption of technology has mostly been of a kind
        which leads people to heedlessness, intoxication and dullness,
        especially in the present time, when many parts of the world have
        stepped into the Information Age. If mankind practices wrongly in regard
        to this information technology, rather than serving an educational
        function, it will become an instrument for promoting heedlessness.
        Witness, for example, the gambling machines and video games which abound
        in the cities of the world, completely void of any purpose other than to
        waste time and money. Witness also the ignorant use of technology,
        without any awareness of its benefits and dangers, leading to
        environmental damage. These things not only degrade the environment,
        they also debase human dignity.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">For this reason we need to
        effectuate a conscious change of direction - to stress production,
        development and consumption of technology which will promote
        intelligence and development of the human being, using it as a tool for
        the communication of knowledge that is useful, and which encourages
        people to use their time constructively. There must also be conscious
        use of technology, with an awareness of the benefits and dangers
        involved in it. In this way, technology will be an instrument for
        enhancing the quality of life and protecting the environment. Society
        will become an environment which supports and encourages mental
        development. This third kind of technology can be called, 'technology
        which enhances intelligence and human development', which is directly
        opposite to the technology which encourages delusion.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If production, development
        and consumption of technology can be channelled in this way, and if
        science opens the way to this kind of technology, then sustainable
        development will surely become a reality.</font></p>
