        <p align="LEFT"><a name="_Toc528760848"><font face="Times New Roman">The
        limitations of scientific knowledge</font></a></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">NOW I WOULD LIKE to speak
        about the limitations of science's exploration and knowledge. Going back
        just a little, I said that there are differences in the nature and scope
        of our object of knowledge, which prompts a number of observations. I
        have said that Buddhism conducts its research within the human being,
        and asserts that to thoroughly know the truth of a human being is to
        know the whole universe, while science studies only the external
        material world, the knowledge of which leads only to an understanding of
        the physical world. At the most it can lead only to the frontiers of the
        mind, as it influences the material world (and vice versa), which is of
        limited scope.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">I have also mentioned that
        science, and in particular, physics, has made such great advances that
        it can almost be said to have reached the limits of its field of
        knowledge. Previously, science believed that it could obtain an
        understanding of the whole universe simply by knowing the external
        physical world, through scientific observation based on the five senses.
        Science took the view that all phenomena relating to the mind were
        rooted in matter. By understanding matter completely, the mind would
        also be understood. Nowadays only few scientists still believe this,
        because the enormous amount of knowledge amassed about matter has not
        shed any light at all on the mind.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">At the present time,
        concepts about the reality of matter and mind fall into two main
        categories, or models:</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. That the world of matter
        and the world of mind are like two sides of one coin. That is, they are
        separate, but they interact with each other. This first group believes
        that these two realities are on opposite sides, and each side must be
        independently studied and then integrated into one body of knowledge.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">2. That the world of matter
        and the world of mind are like two rings in the same circle. This second
        group sees the borders of knowledge as being a big circle, having an
        inner ring and an outer ring. The inner ring is limited to its own
        circumference, while the outer ring covers both its own area and that of
        the smaller ring. That is, one ring surrounds the other. If the larger
        ring is understood, then all is understood, but if only the smaller ring
        is understood, such knowledge is still incomplete, because the outer
        ring is still not known.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now if, in this model, the
        knowledge of matter is the smaller ring, even if our knowledge covers
        the entire world of matter, still it is only the smaller ring that is
        understood. The outer ring, which includes the mind, is still not known.
        If, on the other hand, the outer ring is matter, then to know the truth
        of matter will automatically be to know everything. Now which model is
        more correct? I will not attempt to give an answer here, but leave it to
        those concerned to figure it out.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In any case, many eminent
        physicists have said that the knowledge of science is only partial, and
        is only a beginning. In terms of the model of the rings, it would seem
        that the knowledge of matter is only the inner ring of the circle,
        because it is limited to the five senses, ignoring the sixth. Beyond
        these senses we arrive at the world of symbols, mathematical proofs, in
        relation to which we have Sir Arthur Eddington's words:</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;We have learnt that
        the exploration of the external world by the methods of the physical
        sciences leads not to a concrete reality but to a shadow world of
        symbols.&quot;</font></b></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Another eminent physicist
        is Mr. Max Planck, who won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1918, and is
        regarded as the father of modern Quantum Theory. Planck was known to
        have stated that no sooner was one of science's mysteries solved than
        another would arise in its place. He conceded the limitations of
        scientific truth in even clearer words:</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; ... Science cannot
        solve the ultimate mystery of nature. And that is because, in the last
        analysis, we ourselves are part of nature, and, therefore, part of the
        mystery that we are trying to solve.&quot;</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One scientist went so far
        as to write:</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; ...the most
        outstanding achievement of twentieth century physics is not the theory
        of relativity with its welding together of space and time, or the theory
        of quanta with its present apparent negation of the laws of causation,
        or the dissection of the atom with the resultant discovery that things
        are not what they seem; it is the general recognition that we are not
        yet in contact with ultimate reality.&quot;</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So it has reached this
        stage! This is the most significant advance of science: the realization
        that it is incapable of reaching the truth. All it can lead to is a
        shadow world of symbols. If science accepts this situation then it must
        be time to choose a new path: either to redefine its scope, or to expand
        its field of research in order to attain the complete truth of nature.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If science is content to
        limit itself to its original scope, it will become just another
        specialized field, incapable of seeing the overall picture of the way
        things are. If, on the other hand, science really wants to lead mankind
        to a true understanding of nature, it must extend its field of thought,
        redefining its fundamental meaning and stepping out of its present
        limitations.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><a name="_Toc528760849"><font face="Times New Roman">The
        material world: science's unfinished work</font></a></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the present time, even
        in the world of matter, in which, as we said, science specializes, the
        fundamental truth is still beyond the powers of science to explain.
        There are still many things that science cannot explain, or were once
        thought to be understood but which now are no longer on sure ground.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One example is the 'quark'.
        The quark is the basic or smallest constituent of matter, but it is not
        yet certain whether it really is the fundamental particle or not. It is
        still a matter of doubt. At the moment, it is believed to be the
        fundamental particle, but some are not so sure whether it really is, or
        whether another more fundamental particle will be discovered, or even
        whether this particle exists at all!</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The quanta are in a similar
        position. Quanta are fundamental units of energy, but once again these
        are not irrefutably known to exist, they are still only understood or
        believed to exist.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We are still not sure that
        matter and energy are like two faces of the same thing. If that's the
        case, then how can they be interchanged? Even light, which scientists
        have been studying for so long, is still not clearly defined. What is
        the fundamental nature of light? This is still considered to be one of
        the deeper mysteries of science. Light is an energy force that is at
        once a wave and a particle. How can this be so? And how can it be a
        fixed velocity when, in the Theory of Relativity, even time can be
        stretched and shrunk?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The electro-magnetic field
        is another mystery, another energy source which is not yet clearly
        defined as a wave or a particle. Where do cosmic rays come from? We
        don't know. Even gravitation is still not completely understood. How
        does it work? We know that it's a law, and we can use it, but how does
        it work? We don't know. And the Theory of Relativity tells us that the
        space-time mass can be warped. How is that? It is very difficult for
        ordinary people to understand these things.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">All in all, science still
        does not clearly know how the universe and life came about. The ultimate
        point of research in science is the origin of the universe and the birth
        of life. At the present time, the Big Bang Theory is in fashion. But how
        did the Big Bang occur? Where did the original atom come from? The
        questions roll on endlessly. Even the question, &quot;What is
        life?&quot; is a mystery.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In short, we can say that
        the nature of reality on the fundamental level is still beyond the scope
        of research. Some scientists even say that there is no way that science
        will ever directly know these things.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It might be said that it's
        only natural that if we confine our research to the material world, we
        cannot attain to the fundamental truth. Even the most fundamental truth
        of the physical universe cannot be understood by searching on only one
        side, the material world, because in fact all things in the universe are
        inter-connected. Being inter-connected, looking at only one side will
        not lead to a final answer. Truth from the other side must also be
        incorporated, because the remaining fragment of the mystery might exist
        on the other side of reality, the side that is being ignored.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When science reaches this
        point in its research, it will be forced to take an interest in
        answering the problems of mind. At the present time we can see many
        scientists and physicists beginning to turn around and look at the mind
        and how it works.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some people say that even
        the Theory of Relativity is simply a philosophical system, a product of
        thought, a concept. Space and time depend on consciousness, the mind.
        The mundane perception of human beings of form and size of matter are
        not merely the workings of the sense organs, but must also rely on
        thinking. They are a judgement of the mind, not just an impression
        through the five senses. Eye sees form, but it doesn't know size or
        shape. The apprehension of size and shape are functions of the mind.
        Therefore knowledge from the five senses is not the end of the matter.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">What is it that knows
        science? The mind. But science does not yet know the nature of this
        mind. If science wants to know the ultimate truth, it must know the
        mind. In recent times the problem of the observer and the observed has
        emerged. Are they two different things or are they one and the same?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some scientists are
        beginning to puzzle over the nature of mind, trying to ascertain what it
        actually is. Is the mind merely an event that arises within the workings
        of matter, like a computer? Then we get the questions on whether a
        computer can have a mind. Numerous books have been written on this
        subject. I have seen the one by Penrose, which was a national
        best-seller. His conclusion is that the computer cannot possibly have a
        mind.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In any case, it seems that
        doubt will not be dispelled until science takes on the field of 'mind'
        as well. Soon there will be the problem of whether mind and matter are
        one and the same thing or separate. This problem has existed since the
        time of the Buddha, and is related in the Abyakata panha (the questions
        the Buddha wouldn't answer), which consisted of questions such as:
        &quot;Are the life force and the body one thing, or are they
        different?&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the present time,
        leaders in the field of science seem to be divided into four main groups
        of theories or approaches to the nature of reality.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The first group, known to
        the others as the orthodox group, stands by their conviction that
        science can eventually answer all questions, and that science is the
        only way to really attain an understanding of reality.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The second group, a group
        of 'new' scientists, concedes that science is not able to explain the
        reality of the mind, but they feel that both sides should be allowed to
        continue their work independently. This group does not agree with the
        group who believes only in physics, nor with the 'new' physicists, with
        their attempts to integrate physics with Eastern religions.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The third group is another
        group of new physicists who believe that physics is compatible with the
        Eastern religions. They believe that the Eastern religions help to
        explain the nature of reality, and point the direction for physics to
        grow in the future. An example of this group is Fritjof Capra, although
        Capra's ideas are not accepted by the mainstream of the physics world.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The fourth group is another
        group of new physicists, but this group maintains that the material
        world is one level of reality which is contained within the realm of the
        mind. This is the model I mentioned earlier, of the circle with the
        smaller ring inside it.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">All this is a matter for
        science to sort out for itself. I don't wish to evaluate it here, but
        instead would like to start on a new topic. I would like now to proceed
        into the world of the mind, and in particular, values, the area science
        has yet to research. In this limited time I will have to limit myself to
        one example, and here I will talk about ethics.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><a name="_Toc528760850"><font face="Times New Roman">Ethics:
        a truth awaiting verification</font></a></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Ethics is one of those
        things I call 'values', that is, it is related to good and evil. Good
        and evil are values or principles. Ethics is a very broad and important
        subject, one which is normally considered a religious matter, but here
        we will consider it in relation to science.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some people go so far as to
        say that good and evil are merely social conventions, a matter of
        preference. They believe that good and evil can be defined any way one
        pleases. Such an idea seems to contain some measure of truth, when we
        consider how in some societies certain actions are deemed good, but in
        other societies those very same actions are deemed evil.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">However, th is kind of
        perception arises from confusion of the factors involved. It stems from:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. A failure to
          differentiate between ethics and conventions.<br>
          2. A failure to see the relationship that connects ethics with
          reality.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">From this we get three
        points for consideration: reality, ethics and convention. We must
        understand the difference and the relationship between these three
        levels. The chain of factors involved has connections throughout,
        ranging from the qualities of good and evil, which are true conditions
        in reality, and spreading outwards to become good and evil actions and
        speech, which are ethics, and from there connecting outwards once more
        to become the laws and conventions of society, these being conventions.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This system of reality,
        ethics and regulations is very similar to the scientific system. The
        basis of science, which is Pure Science, is reality. Resting on this
        base we have the Applied Sciences and technology. If Pure Science is
        faulty, then Applied Sciences and technology suffer. From the Applied
        Sciences and technology we reach the third level, which is the forms
        technology takes. These will be many and varied. One of the reasons for
        this is that technology seeks to work with the laws of nature in the
        most efficient way. The forms of technology will vary in efficiency
        because they are more or less consistent with the laws of nature. Those
        forms of technology which are most consistent with the laws of nature,
        acting as channels for the optimal functioning of those laws concerned,
        will be the most efficient, and vice versa.</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Reality can be compared
          to Pure Science.<br>
          Ethics can be compared to Applied Science and technology.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Regulations or conventions
        can be compared to the forms that technology takes.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Societies determine
        conventions or regulations to regulate themselves. This is convention,
        which can be determined according to preference. For example, in
        Thailand the regulation is that cars drive on the left hand side of the
        road, while in America cars drive on the right hand side. Different
        countries have determined different regulations. Now, which is good and
        which is evil? Can Thailand say that the Americans are bad because they
        drive on the right hand side of the road, or can America say the
        opposite? Of course not. These regulations are the standard for each
        country, and each country is free to make its own standards. This is
        convention.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">However, convention is not
        simply a matter of preference, there are reasons behind it. Even in very
        simple matters, such as deciding which side of the road cars must drive,
        there is an objective in mind. What is that objective? The objective is
        order and harmony on the road, and wellbeing for people in a social
        context. This is what both countries want, and this is a concern of
        ethics. American society wants this quality, and so does the Thai
        society. Even though their conventions differ, the ethical quality
        desired by both societies is the same. In this instance we can see that
        there is a difference in the regulations made, but in essence, in the
        ethical sense, there is consistency.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now the problem arises,
        which regulation gives better results? This is the crucial point. It may
        be asked which is the more conducive to order and harmony between the
        regulations of keeping to the right in America and keeping to the left
        in Thailand. There may be some difference of opinion in regard to the
        regulations themselves, but this does not mean that societies merely
        determine these regulations out of preference.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This is the relationship
        between ethics and convention, or regulation. Regulations are made to
        provide an ethical result. In Buddhist monastic terms, the monks put it
        very simply by saying &quot;vinaya is for developing sila&quot; ...
        Vinaya refers to the rules and regulations of society, but the objective
        of these is sila, which is ethics.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There is an exception in
        cases where regulations have indeed been made out of partiality, for the
        benefit or advantage of a select few. For example, there are times when
        we suspect that certain laws have been made to protect the interests of
        a select group. In this case we say that corruption has arisen within
        the regulating process, which will in turn cause a degeneration of
        ethics. When the root of the legal structure is rotten, it will be very
        unlikely to produce a good result. Even so, societies do determine many
        rules and regulations out of a pure intention to create an ethical
        result.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Because there is this
        common objective, ethics, but the forms of the regulations which result
        differ, we must learn how to distinguish clearly between ethics and
        conventions. We can see a lot of these differences in the conventions,
        customs and traditions of different societies - family customs, for
        example. In one society, a woman is allowed so many husbands, a man is
        allowed so many wives, while in other societies, the customs will
        differ. Nevertheless, overall, what is the objective here? The objective
        is order and harmony within the family. This is their objective, and
        this is ethics.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">However, in the determining
        of regulations for society, people have varying levels of intelligence
        and wisdom, and different intentions, sometimes honest, sometimes not.
        Societies have different environments, different histories. With so many
        varying factors, the result in terms of ethics also differs, being more
        or less efficacious as the case may be. From time to time these
        regulations must be reevaluated. Conventions are thus tied to specific
        situations and considerations of time and place. The consideration of
        time and place is a concern of conventions, but the ethical objectives
        are universal.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore, by looking at
        the situation in the right manner, even though there may be some
        discrepancies in the form regulations take, we can see that they are in
        fact the results of humanity's efforts to create a harmonious society.
        That is, conventions are not the end result, but rather the means
        devised by mankind to attain an ethical standard, more or less
        effective, depending on the intelligence and honesty of the people
        determining them.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Bearing this in mind, we
        can avoid the mistaken belief that good and evil are merely social
        conventions, or are determined by preference. We must look on these
        regulations as mankind's attempts to find ethics, to attain true
        goodness. No matter how useful or ineffective regulations may be, our
        objective remains an ethical one.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The success of regulations
        is very much tied to the presence of an ethical standard within the
        people who are determining them, and whether or not they have made their
        decisions intelligently.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now for the problem of
        whether ethics is a real condition or not, we must refer to the
        principle that ethics is based on reality or truth. That is, ethics must
        be in conformity with the process of cause and effect, or causes and
        conditions. In the field of convention, whenever a regulation is created
        which brings about an ethically satisfactory result, we say that it has
        been useful. For example, if we regulate that cars must run on the left'
        or right-hand side of the road, and this regulation is conducive to
        order and harmony, then we say that that regulation has fulfilled its
        purpose.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Reality (saccadhamma),
        ethics (cariyadhamma) and convention (pannattidhamma) are abstract
        qualities. Because ethics is tied to reality, it follows that it is one
        factor in the whole stream of causes and conditions. The causes and
        conditions involved in human behaviour are so complex, much harder to
        predict than the weather!</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If we do not understand or
        see the relationship and connection between reality, ethics and
        convention, we will not be able to enter into a thorough consideration
        of values, which are mental properties, and see their proper place
        within the laws of nature, functioning according to causes and
        conditions.</font></p>

        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now let us make one more
        comparison between science and Buddhism. I have already mentioned that
        science does not include the human condition in its research, because it
        has veered away from it into the direction of material things.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism learns the laws of
        nature, and then applies them back to an ethical perspective. When
        people practise in accordance with ethics, they receive the results in
        accordance with the natural law of cause and effect, and attain a good
        life, which is their objective. This gives us a cycle with three stages:
        1) Knowing or realizing the truth; 2) Practising in an ethical way; 3)
        Attaining a good life.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Science knows the truths of
        nature, but only on the material side, and then sends the knowledge
        gained to technology, attaining the life of abundance in accordance with
        its objectives.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One path leads to a healthy
        life, while the other path leads to abundance; one way deals with the
        nature of man, the other way deals with the nature of material things.
        Science does not connect the truth to ethics, but instead, because it
        deals only with the material world, connects it to technology.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is generally understood
        that science concerns itself exclusively with the question &quot;What
        is,&quot; shrugging off any concern with &quot;What should be?&quot; as
        a concern of values or ethics, which lies beyond its scope. Science does
        not see that ethics is based on reality because it fails to see the
        connection between &quot;What is?&quot; and &quot;What should be?&quot;.
        On the material plane, however, science does address the question of
        &quot;What should be?&quot;, albeit unknowingly, but the question is
        handed over to technology.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">For example, Pure Science
        tells us that water will freeze when the temperature drops to zero
        degrees Celsius. Technology then steps in and considers what is to be
        done to get ice, which is to develop some way of making the temperature
        drop to zero degrees Celsius. The principle and the means must be in
        conformity like this. This is why I said that Pure Science looks for the
        truths of nature, while technology and Applied Science put that
        knowledge into effect.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Science applies itself to
        problems on the material plane, but on ethical questions it is silent.
        Suppose we saw a huge pit, full of fire, with a temperature of thousands
        of degrees. We tell someone, &quot;The human body is only able to endure
        up to a certain temperature. If it enters into that fire it will be
        burnt to a crisp.&quot; This is the truth. Now suppose we further say,
        &quot;If you don't want to be burnt to a crisp, don't go into that
        pit.&quot; In this case, the level of science tells us that the hole is
        of such and such a temperature, and that the human body cannot withstand
        such a temperature. Ethics is the code of practice which says, &quot;If
        you don't want to be burnt to a crisp, don't go into that fire.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the same way that
        technology must be based on the truths of Pure Science, ethics must be
        based on reality. And just as any technology which is not founded on
        scientific truth will be unworkable, so too will any ethic not founded
        on natural truth be a false ethic. The subject of ethics covers both
        &quot;What should be?&quot; and &quot;What is?&quot;, in that it deals
        with the truth of human nature, which is that aspect of natural truth
        overlooked by science. For that reason, a true understanding of reality,
        which includes an understanding of human nature, is impossible without a
        clear understanding of genuine ethics. The question is, what kind of
        reality, and how much of it, and in what degree, is sufficient to bring
        about an understanding of genuine ethics?</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><a name="_Toc528760852"><font face="Times New Roman">True
        religion is the foundation of science</font></a></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The domain of science stops
        at the material world, it doesn't include the human being. For this
        reason, science does not have any advice on how human beings are to live
        or behave, it doesn't venture into the field of ethics. But then, it is
        because of the mind that science has emerged and progressed to where it
        has. The origin and inspiration for the birth and growth of science has
        been this desire to know the truth, together with the conviction in the
        laws of nature, which are mental qualities. Even the values which were
        incorporated into this aspiration at a later date, such as the
        aspiration to conquer nature, are all mental processes.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Not only the aspiration for
        knowledge and the conviction just mentioned, but even the great
        discoveries of science have been products of the mind. Some scientists
        possessed a quality we could call 'intuition', and could envisage the
        truths that they discovered in their mind's eye before they actually
        verified them in the physical world. Before many of the major
        breakthroughs in science, there tended to be some degree of intuition
        involved ... the scientist would see something 'in his mind's eye',
        which would become the initiative to conduct research into the matter.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Without this quality of
        intuition and foresight, science might have become just another baseless
        branch of knowledge, or largely a matter of guesswork. It would have
        lacked direction or goal. Intuition and foresight have played a vital
        role in the history of science. For many eminent scientists this
        intuition was involved in the process of making their most important
        discoveries. An inkling of some train of thought or research, never
        before thought of, would arise in the scientist's mind, initiating the
        systematic reasoning, the formulation of a hypothesis and the
        experimentation, resulting eventually in a new theory.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">All the advances of science
        made so far have arisen through faith, conviction, aspiration to know,
        intuition and so on. In the minds of the most eminent scientists, those
        who made the most far-reaching breakthroughs, these qualities could be
        found in abundance.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Even observation begins
        with a thought, which establishes a path of investigation, and
        constrains observation to the relevant framework. For example, Newton
        saw the apple fall and understood the Law of Gravity. According to the
        story, he saw the apple fall and immediately had a realization, but in
        fact Newton had been pondering the nature of motion for months at that
        time. It was a mental process in his mind, which culminated as a
        realization on seeing the apple fall.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes this happens to
        us. We may be thinking of some particular problem to no avail for quite
        a long time, and then, while we happen to be just sitting quietly, the
        answer suddenly flashes into the mind. These answers don't just arise
        randomly or by accident. In fact, the mind has been functioning on a
        subtle level. The realization is the result of a cause and effect
        process.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Mind, through faith and
        motivation, is the origin of science; through intuition and foresight it
        is the force through which science has been able to progress; and
        through the goals and objectives which are envisioned and aspired to in
        the mind, it is the direction for science's future advancement. The
        search for basic truths is possible because the mind conceives that such
        truths do exist.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Having reached this point,
        I will tell you the name of the eminent scientist who gave me the ideas
        for the title of this talk. He is none other than Albert Einstein. He
        didn't, however, say the exact words I have used. I have paraphrased
        him.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">What Einstein did say was:</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; ... in this
        materialistic age of ours the serious scientific workers are the only
        profoundly religious people ...'</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Einstein felt that in this
        age it is hard to find people with religion. Only the scientists who
        study science with a pure heart have true religion. Following that, he
        says,</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; ...<b> but science
        can only be created by those who are thoroughly imbued with the
        aspiration toward truth and understanding ... those individuals to whom
        we owe the great creative achievements of science were all of them
        imbued with the truly religious conviction that this universe of ours is
        something perfect and susceptible to the rational striving for knowledge
        </b>...''</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The desire to know the
        truth, and the faith that behind nature there are laws which are
        constant truths throughout the entire universe - this is what Einstein
        calls religious feeling, or more specifically, 'cosmic religious
        feeling'. Then he goes on to say,</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; ... cosmic religious
        feeling is the strongest and noblest motive for scientific
        research&quot;</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">And again:</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; ... Buddhism, as we
        have learned especially from the wonderful writings of Schopenhauer,
        contains a much stronger element of this ...&quot;</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Einstein says that Buddhism
        has a high degree of this cosmic religious feeling, and this cosmic
        religious feeling is the origin or seed of scientific research. So you
        can decide for yourselves whether the title I have used for this talk is
        suitable or not.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">I have mentioned this to
        show in what manner it can be said that Buddhism is the foundation of
        science, but please don't attach too much importance to this idea,
        because I don't completely agree with Einstein's view. My disagreement
        is not with what he said, but that he said too little. What Einstein
        called this 'cosmic religious feeling' is only part of what religious
        feeling is, because religion should always come back to the human being,
        to the nature of being human, including how human beings should behave
        towards nature, both internally and externally. I cannot see that
        Einstein's words clearly include self-knowledge and benefit to the human
        being. However that may be, from Einstein's words, we can see that he
        felt that science had its roots in the human desire for knowledge, and
        conviction in the order of nature.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">But now, having reached
        this point, I did say that I don't want you to be too concerned over
        whether Buddhism really is the foundation of science or not. In fact it
        might be better to change the title of this talk, to something like ...
        &quot;What would the science which has Buddhism as its foundation be
        like?&quot; This may give us some new perspectives to think about.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The statement
        &quot;Buddhism is the foundation of science&quot;, is just an opinion,
        and some may say it is a conceited one at that. And that would get us
        nowhere. But if we say &quot;How should science be in order to be
        founded on Buddhism?&quot;, this will be much more constructive, giving
        us some practical and concrete points to consider.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This is a very important
        question, one which demands some reflection. I can offer an answer, and
        I will try to keep it to within the context of the points already
        covered during this talk, so that it serves as a kind of summary.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Firstly, we must expand the
        meaning of the word 'religion' or 'religious feeling' in order to
        correspond to Buddhism:</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A) The words 'cosmic
        religious feeling' must cover both the external natural world and the
        natural world within the human being, or both the physical universe and
        the abstract, or mental, which includes values.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">B) The definition of
        science as originating from the aspiration to know the truth must be
        complemented by a desire to attain the highest good, which Buddhism
        calls 'freedom from human imperfection'.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In point A, we are
        extending the definition of that nature which is to be realized. In
        point B, we are reiterating those values which are in conformity with
        the highest good, ensuring that the aspiration for truth is pure and
        clear, and closing off the chance for lesser values to corrupt our
        aspiration.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">With these two points in
        mind, we can now answer, &quot;The science which accords with Buddhism
        is the science which aspires to understand natural truth, in conjunction
        with the development of the human being and the attainment of the
        highest good&quot;. Or we could say: &quot;The science which is founded
        on Buddhism arises from an aspiration for knowledge of nature, together
        with a desire to attain the highest good, which is the foundation for
        constructive human development.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This kind of definition may
        seem to be bordering onto Applied Science, but it isn't really. From one
        perspective, the natural sciences of the last age were influenced by the
        selfish motives already mentioned, which were not very good. For that
        reason we offer these alternative incentives, to prevent those previous
        ones from arising, replacing the desire to conquer nature and produce an
        abundance of material wealth with the aspiration for freedom from
        suffering.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To rephrase the above
        definition, we could say &quot;The science which attains a true and
        comprehensive knowledge of reality will be the integration of the
        physical sciences, the social sciences and the humanities. All sciences
        will be connected and as one.&quot; Or to put it another way, &quot;Once
        science extends the limits of its fundamental definition and improves
        its techniques for research and study, the truths of the social sciences
        and humanities will be attainable through the study of science.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This statement is not said
        in jest or in carelessness. In the present day, the advances of the
        sciences and human society within the global environment have
        necessitated some cohesiveness in the search for knowledge. You could
        say the time is ripe. If we don't deal with it in the proper way, that
        ripeness may become rotten, like an over-ripe fruit. The question is,
        &quot;Will science take on the responsibility of leading mankind to this
        unification of learning?&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">On the second level, that
        is, the principle of commitment to knowledge that is useful, knowledge
        of truth should be divided into two categories:</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A) Knowledge that is
        necessary, or truth that is useful, that is, knowledge that is necessary
        to a good life, and is possible for a human being to attain within the
        limits of one lifetime.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">B) Other kinds of knowledge
        which are not necessary, or truth which is not useful. Those things
        which have not yet been verified can be looked into until they are
        verified, but a good life should not be dependent on them, nor have to
        wait for an answer from them.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The human life-span is
        limited and soon comes to an end. Quality of life, or the highest good,
        are things which should be attainable for a human being within this
        limited life-span. Scientific knowledge tends to say, &quot;Wait until
        I've verified this first, and then you will know what to do.&quot; This
        attitude should be changed, clearly distinguishing between the different
        kinds of knowledge mentioned above. If science is to be a truly
        comprehensive body of learning, it must relate correctly to these two
        kinds of truth.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">On the other hand, if
        science is to continue its present course, it might seek completion
        through cooperation by referring to Buddhism for the answer to those
        questions which demand immediate answers, so that the attainment of the
        highest good in this very life is possible, while science can seek
        answers to those questions which, even if not answered, do not affect
        our ability to live in peace and well-being.</font></p>

        clarify intermediate aims is that if Pure Science does not determine its
        own set of values, it will not be able to escape the influence of other
        interests. Outside parties with personal interests have determined
        science's values in the past, values which have led to the destruction
        of nature in the search for material wealth. This has led to science
        being called a 'servant of industry'. A servant of industry is not a
        servant of humanity. These days some say that industry is destroying
        mankind, a point that bears consideration. If scientists do not
        establish their own values, someone else will.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Human heings are beings
        possessing intention. This is one of mankind's unique qualities. This
        means the search for knowledge cannot be totally without values. Because
        human beings are the highest kind of being, capable of attaining a
        realization of the truth and the highest good, they should aspire to
        realize this potential.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As long as Science lacks
        clarity on its position in relation to values, and yet exists within a
        world of values, it will have its direction determined by other
        interests. As a result, scientists will feel cheated and frustrated in
        the pursuit of their research. As long as industry is society's 'star
        player', it can exert a powertul influence over science, through
        government channels, with its influence over government policies, and
        through financial institutions, with grants for scientific research. For
        cxample, if a scientific institute submits a proposal for research in a
        particular field, but such research is not in the interests of industry,
        the industrial sector has the power to withhold support, thus pressuring
        the government to do likewise. When this happens the scientists may get
        discouraged and end up like Sir Isaac Newton.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Newton was very heavily
        influenced by values in his research. Newton discovered the Law of
        Gravity when he was only about 24 years old. However, some of his ideas
        clashed with the establishment of the time. The old school of scientists
        ridiculed him. Newton was a very moody fellow, and easily hurt. He
        didn't like to associate with other people. As soon as people started to
        criticize his work, he got upset and abandoned it. He gave up science
        completely, and wouldn't go anywhere near it for twenty-two years.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now Edmond Halley, the
        scientist who predicted the cycles of the comet named after him, saw the
        value of Newton's work, and so he went to Newton and comforted and
        encouraged him, until Newton began to feel more heartened, and started
        to work on the momentous book, Philosophiae Naturalis Principia
        Mathematica.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">But then, when he had only
        finished two thirds of the manuscript, another scientist, who, during
        the twenty-two years that Newton had refused to put his ideas to print,
        had come to an understanding of the Law of Gravity and calculus, claimed
        that he had discovered all this before Newton.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">When Newton heard this he
        went off into another sulk. He wasn't going to write the book after all.
        He had only written two thirds of it, when he gave up once more. Halley
        had to go to him again and give him another pep talk to coax him into
        continuing his work, after which he finally completed it.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This is a good example of
        how values can completely overwhelm a scientist, with repercussions for
        the whole scientific world. If Newton, who was a genius, had had a
        strong heart, not giving in to feelings of hurt and indignation, he may
        have been able to give the scientific world so much more than he did,
        but because of his moods he threw science away for over twenty years.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the present time, when
        the industrial and financial sectors are all-powerful, science must have
        the strength of its own values to prevent external values from
        overwhelming it. In this age of environmental ruin, some of the truths
        being discovered by science may not be in the interests of some of the
        industrial and financial sectors.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We hear statements in the
        USA by certain research teams that the greenhouse scare is unfounded;
        that the world isn't going to heat up, they have results from their
        research to prove it. Then, at a later time, another group of
        researchers tells us that the first group was influenced by financial
        considerations from certain industrial sectors in the assessment of its
        results. The situation is very complicated. Personal advantage begins to
        play a role in scientific research, and subjects it even more to the
        influence of values. Even the knowledge and research being conducted in
        the present time concerning the environmental situation is a concern of
        values; that is, it is dedicated to realizing specific needs, but in
        this case they are positive or constructive values.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">At the very least, ethics
        teaches scientists to have a pure aspiration for knowledge. This is the
        most powerful force the progress of science can have. At the present
        moment we are surrounded by a world which is teeming with values, mostly
        negative. In the past, science and industry worked together, like
        husband and wife. There were great advances. Industry spurred science
        on, and science helped industry to grow. But in the coming age, because
        some of the interests of industry are becoming a problem in the natural
        environment, and because science is being questioned about this, the
        answers to some of these questions are going to embarrass the industrial
        sector. It may be necessary for science and industry to part their ways,
        or at least to experience some tension in their relationship. Science
        may be forced to find a new friend, one who will help and encourage it
        to find knowledge that is useful to the human race.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As science approaches the
        frontiers of the mind, the question arises, &quot;Will science recognize
        the sixth sense and the data which are experienced there? Or will
        scientists continue to try to verify moods and thoughts by looking at
        the chemicals secreted by the brain, or measuring the brain's waves on a
        machine, and thereby looking at mere shadows of the truth?&quot; This
        would be like trying to study a stone from the 'plops' it makes in the
        water, or from the ripples that arise on the water's surface. They might
        measure the waves that correspond to stones of different sizes - if
        there is such a sound that means the stone must be of such a size - they
        might turn it into a mathematical equation, predicting the size of
        stones, corresponding to the various 'plops!' in the water, or
        estimating the mass of the stone that's fallen into the water by
        measuring the ripples extending from it.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Has this been the approach
        of science's study of nature? The fact is, they never actually pick up a
        stone! If this is the case, science may have to take a look at some of
        the ways of observing and experimenting used in other traditions, such
        as Buddhism, which maintains that observation and experiment carried out
        from direct experience in the mind is a valid way of observing the laws
        of nature.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">.<b>..... It is not
