        <blockquote>
        </font></b><i>
        </blockquote>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Today the Science Faculty
        of the University of Chiang Mai has kindly honoured me with an
        invitation to address you all on this important occasion. I have heard
        that many of you were surprised to hear that a Buddhist monk would be
        invited to talk about science. Although it may seem incongruous, I feel
        that such a reaction is unwarranted. We may have to come to some
        understandings with each other before the lecture is begun in order to
        get into the right frame of mind.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This perception of a monk
        as a religious expert talking about scientific matters may be a result
        of modern tendencies. Our age is an age of specialists. We tend to put
        people into pigeonholes, such as religious, scientist, economist,
        political scientist and so on, each specializing in his or her own
        particular field. But I don't feel that I am a religious expert, and I
        don't want to be called one. I am simply a Buddhist monk.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhist monks and
        religious experts are not the same. To be a Buddhist monk is to live a
        way of life. To use the current trend we could say that it is a
        'specialized' way of life. Religion, on the other hand, is a specialized
        branch of knowledge. One who has a specialized life style has a role to
        play, defined by the constraints of that life style, one which, in this
        case, is designed to allow him to live as skilfully as possible on both
        the personal and social levels. Specialized sciences result from
        dividing knowledge up into categories. In this sub-dividing there is no
        consideration of life-style, it is a purely academic concern. In this
        light it would probably be inaccurate to call a Buddhist monk a
        religious expert.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So the organizing of this
        lecture, &quot;Buddhism as the Foundation of Science&quot;, should not
        be looked on as a meeting between two disparate academic disciplines.
        This kind of attitude leads to the impression that you are about to
        witness some kind of peculiar confrontation.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">By putting ourselves into
        the right frame of mind we will see that science is our subject of
        discussion. Science is our meeting ground. Scientists are the owners of
        this branch of knowledge, the ones most conversant with it, and now the
        scientists are giving an opportunity to an outsider to take a look at
        science and give some reflections. Understanding it in this way, I feel
        you will more easily be able to grasp the spirit of the lecture.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Bearing this in mind, it
        isn't necessary for the speaker, an outsider, to have such a vast
        knowledge of the subject of science. He may know some, of some he may be
        ignorant, he may speak rightly or wrongly, but even so there is
        something to be gained from the lecture, even if only an idea of how
        scientists are viewed by outsiders.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now what benefit is to be
        gained from such knowledge? Practically speaking, it is impossible to
        live or act completely alone. We must interact with other ways of
        thinking and with events around us. We must be able to work cohesively
        with other people and other branches of knowledge. If such inter action
        is successful, then the quality of our own work is enhanced. If we
        cannot interact successfully, our own activity or field of knowledge
        suffers accordingly. For that reason, inviting outsiders to take a look
        and give their reflections on science is useful. It will enable you to
        get a broader perspective, to interact with the outside world and with
        other branches of learning, which will in turn help your own work. The
        result is a more broad minded and flexible outlook.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So we are agreed that this
        lecture is about science through the eyes of an outsider, in this case a
        Buddhist monk. As to how a Buddhist monk views science, this will become
        clear a, the talk progresses.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A second point that I would
        like to clarify, before going on to the main body of the talk, is in
        relation to the title of the lecture. Not only is a religious person
        talking about science, but he is even claiming that Buddhism is the
        foundation of science! I won't go into the reasons for this title at
        present, but would simply like to state that it is inspired by the words
        of a scientist, and a very great one at that. He didn't use these exact
        words, but I don't think I have misrepresented him. In any case, I don't
        put too much weight on the matter, and as I will be explaining it a
        little later on, I don't think you need trouble yourselves over whether
        Buddhism really is the foundation of science or not. Any benefit you
        obtain from today's lecture, or whether Buddhism really is the
        foundation of science, are things that you can each decide for
        yourselves at your own discretion.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In addition to this I would
        like to clarify the meaning of two of the words that I will be using
        throughout this talk, and they are 'Buddhism' and 'Science'.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism in this context
        should be understood not as the institutional form of Buddhism, but to
        its essential teaching, which is an abstract quality.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As for Science, we may have
        a problem. Some scientists may feel that in this context, only Pure
        Science should be considered, not Applied Science or technology. But
        whenever the average person thinks of the word 'science', he thinks of
        the whole totality, not this narrow definition. I myself come as an
        ordinary person, being, like many others, an outsider. So I speak of
        science in a very general and indistinct sort of way, which takes in
        both the Applied and the Pure Sciences. There may occasionally be times
        where I distinguish between them, at which points I will make it known.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">... Science is essentially
        one with nature, but these days most people feel that what we call
