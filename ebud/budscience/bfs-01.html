        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">AT THE OUTSET we must
        acknowledge the innumerable blessings bestowed on us by science. Nobody
        will dispute the enormous value science has. In order to be able to give
        this lecture, I have travelled all the way from Bangkok to Chiang Mai in
        only one hour. Back in the days of King Rama I, you would have had to
        wait three months for me to get here, and for that matter I probably
        wouldn't have come at all. We must acknowledge science's contribution to
        travel, be it by plane, train or car.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Looking around at
        communications in the present day, we see radio, telephone, fax
        machines, television, video, satellites and so on, all of which have
        arisen from scientific and technological advances.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Other obvious areas of
        development are in the medical world, where so many contagious diseases
        have now been virtually eradicated. Cholera is now quite rare, in Asia
        it is almost extinct. Bubonic Plague no longer exists. Smallpox has all
        but vanished. We no longer have to fear these infectious diseases. In
        olden times a person could die with only an infected appendix, but
        nowadays an appendectomy is a relatively simple operation. Even brain
        operations are getting easier. Sophisticated tools for accurate
        examination and diagnosis are more and more accessible. X-Ray machines
        are being replaced with computer X-Ray machines, and now we have ultra
        sound and MRI. It's almost no longer necessary for the doctor to examine
        the patient, the machines do it for him. These are all examples of
        extremely valuable technological advances.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Then we have electricity
        and countless labour-saving devices. Printing and publishing have
        progressed astonishingly. Machines which were once thought to be quite
        complex, such as clocks, are now considered trifling. House clocks used
        to be very large, heavy and difficult to use. You had to rewind them or
        reset their weights every day. Now we have quartz clocks. They are
        simple, cheap, and much more accurate than the old clocks. Writing
        implements are so common and cheap: twenty years ago you would have to
        really look after your pen, but now they're so cheap you just use them
        and throw them away. Everything is so plentiful and convenient. Now
        human beings are going into space and developing computers, which are at
        the cutting edge of technology.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The field of biology has
        seen the development of genetic engineering, which may produce new or
        specially adapted species of plants and animals. It's almost impossible
        to list all the technological advances we have with us today.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">But on the other hand, when
        we really look into it, we find that science, and in particular
        technology, has created a great many problems for humanity as well. In
        the present time, particularly in the highly developed countries, there
        is even a fear that the human race, and indeed the whole world, may meet
        destruction at the hands of this technological progress. It might be a
        very instantaneous kind of destruction, at the flick of a switch, so to
        speak, or it could be a slow and gradual kind of destruction, as the
        gradual deterioration of the environment, a very critical problem at
        this point in time.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Even within the immediacy
        of our everyday lives, we are threatened by dangers. We can't be sure
        whether our food has been soaked in chemicals or not. Sometimes plants
        and animals, our food supply, are treated with hormones to boost their
        growth. Pigs are given special additives to make their meat turn a
        pretty red colour. Poisonous substances are sometimes used in foods as
        preservatives, flavour enhancers or dyes, not to mention the
        uncontrolled use of pesticides (x). Some of the people who sell these
        foods wouldn't dare eat them themselves!</font></p>

          alienation of science and nature</font></a></p>
          </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In this light, science
        seems to have intruded onto the natural world. Our perception is that
        science and nature are separate entities, in spite of the fact that
        science is the study of nature and has always existed alongside it.
        Science is essentially one with nature, but these days most people feel
        that what we call science is not natural. Products of technology are
        often called 'artificial': we have 'artificial lungs', 'artificial
        kidneys' and so on. Science seems to be an intruder on nature.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This 'manipulation of
        nature' implies that the world of nature may in due course become a
        world of science. When science has completely invaded the world of
        nature, we may be left with only a scientific, or 'artificial' world.
        Human beings are natural beings, living in a natural world, but in the
        future we may find ourselves living in an artificial world. If we want
        human beings to live harmoniously with this artificial world it may be
        necessary to adapt the human body, becoming artificial people living in
        an artificial world. At the present time this isn't the case, we are not
        compatible with our environment. When we are out of touch with nature,
        we are bound to experience problems.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In this light, scientific
        progress does not seem to have been very harmonious. Science, in its
        attempts to 'improve on' the human environment, seems to have turned it
        into a scientific world. Many new and exciting inventions have been
        made, but science has not been able to adjust people's lives to meet
        them. The progress of science has transformed the external physical
        environment into a scientific, or artificial, world.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">For human beings, possessed
        of both body and mind, that part which should correspond to the external
        physical world is the body. But what we find instead is that the mind
        has adapted. Science has transformed people's minds into artificial
        minds: minds which esteem science and aspire to artificial things, minds
        that are alienated from nature. There is conflict here, both internally
        and externally. Internally, the mind and the body are at odds with each
        other, while externally, this biological, physical body is at odds with
        the scientific world. While still a purely natural organism, which needs
        pure air, pure water and pure food, the body is experiencing problems
        with these very things. The air, water and food are not pure, they have
        been altered by science.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">At this juncture it may be
        necessary for humanity to decide on a course to take, whether for a
        natural humanity living in a natural world, or whether to attempt to
        make a 'scientific human' for the scientific world.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><a name="_Toc528760821"><font face="Times New Roman">Two
        kinds of technology</font></a></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">That application of science
        which effects the changes in the natural world, changing it into a
        so-called artificial world, is that which we call 'technology'. However,
        technology is dependent for its existence on the knowledge obtained
        through science. Technology is the tool, or channel, through which
        humanity has worked to manipulate nature in the pursuit of material
        comfort, but at the same time, the dangers which threaten humanity are
        also contingent on this technology. Technology is thus both an
        instrument for finding happiness and a catalyst for danger.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now in answer to all this,
        scientists can counter that the word 'science' refers to Pure Science.
        Pure Science seeks only to discover and tell the truth, it is concerned
        only with the search for knowledge. Whatever anybody wants to do with
        this knowledge is their business, it is no concern of science. Pure
        Science tends to shake off responsibility in this regard.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Science tends to accuse
        technology of using the knowledge gained by science for its own ends,
        but technology hasn't used this knowledge exclusively to its own ends.
        Technology was initially aimed at bringing benefit to humanity, but
        nowadays we have two kinds of technology. One is the technology which is
        used to create benefit, while the other is used to seek benefit. What we
        need is technology that is used to create benefit, but the problems of
        the present time exist because modern technology is of the kind that
        seeks benefit.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If we can constrain
        ourselves to creating benefit, the repercussions arising will be few and
        far between. But whenever technology is used to seek benefit, problems
        arise, as we can see in the present time. Therefore we must clearly
        distinguish between technology for the creation of benefit and that
        which is used to seek benefit.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><a name="_Toc528760822"><font face="Times New Roman">The
        place of ethics</font></a></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is a matter of
        utilization, be it the wrong utilization of scientific knowledge, the
        utilization of technology for seeking benefit, or even utilization in
        order to destroy the earth. The problems resulting from technology have
        arisen entirely as a result of its utilization by human beings. Because
        the problem arises at human beings, it boils down to a matter of ethics,
        or morality.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These problems can be
        simply and directly solved, in the most decisive way, only when people
        have morality. Only then will technology and science be used for
        constructive purposes. Even though there may be some harmful
        consequences, arising from lack of circumspection or ignorance, their
        prevention and rectification will be on the best possible level.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Mankind has looked to
        science and technology to bring benefit to human society, but science
        and technology hold no guarantees that they will bring only the benefit
        that humanity hopes for. These things are entirely at the disposal of
        the user, to create harm or benefit, depending on how they are used.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If we ignore morality or
        ethics, instead of creating benefit, the most likely result is that
        science and technology will bring problems, stressing as they do the
        unrestrained production and consumption of goods with which to gratify
        the senses, feeding desire and greed (raga and lobha); escalation of the
        power to destroy (dosa); and increasing the availability and intensity
        of those influences which lure people into delusion and carelessness
        (moha). In so doing, technology tarnishes the quality of life and
        pollutes the environment. Only true ethics can alleviate these
        destructive influences.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Without ethics,
        technological progress, even the beneficial kinds, tends to increase the
        propensity for destruction. The more science and technology advance, the
        more keenly does destruction seem to threaten mankind; the more they are
        developed, the more is ethics necessitated, and the more will the
        stability and well-being of humanity be dependent on it.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In any case, this subject
        of ethics, although a simple and straightforward one, is largely ignored
        in modern times. Most people want to live without problems, but they
        don't want to solve problems. As long as they do not want to solve
        problems or deal with ethics, they must be prepared to suffer problems.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><a name="_Toc528760823"><font face="Times New Roman">Science
        and technology cannot be separated</font></a></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Science and technology have
        always supported one another. It's not only Science that has fostered
        technology's growth - technology has also been a decisive factor in the
        development of science. What is it that has enabled science to progress
        to where it is now? The scientific method. An essential part of the
        scientific method is observation and experiment. The earliest forms of
        observation and experiment were carried out through the five senses -
        eye, ear, nose, tongue and body, particularly the eyes for looking, the
        ears for listening and the hands for touching.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">However, human sense organs
        are limited. We can see a limited number of stars and a limited portion
        of the universe with the naked eye. As technology developed, the
        telescope was invented. The invention of the telescope enabled science
        to make a Great Leap Forward. Microscopic organisms, invisible to the
        naked eye, were made visible through the invention of the microscope.
        Science once again made advances. Pure Science, we can see, has relied
        heavily on technology for its progress.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is obvious how these two
        disciplines have affected each other. The tools used for scientific
        research are products of technology. That is why science and technology
        have been inseparably connected along their path of development. In the
        present day, scientists are looking to the computer, the instrument of
        the future, to further their quest for truth. The computer is capable of
        collecting and collating vast amounts of information, much more than the
        ordinary human mind would be capable of. In the future, the computer
        will be indispensable in the testing of hypotheses and the formulation
        of theories.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">All in all, the benefits
        created by science appear to the mass of people through their
        technological manifestations. Humanity must, however, learn to choose
        between technology for creating benefit and technology for seeking
        benefit.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><a name="_Toc528760824"><font face="Times New Roman">Reaching
        the limits, finding no answer</font></a></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">At the present time, the
        advances of science have been so vast that it seems to be approaching
        the limits of the physical universe. Science has limited its
        investigations to the physical world, but as it approaches the limits of
        that world, it is turning to the psychic world. Quite a number of
        scientists are becoming interested in the mysteries of the mind. What is
        mind? How does it work? What is consciousness? Does it arise from a
        physical source? Or is it entirely separate from the physical world?
        These days computers have Artificial Intelligence. Will the development
        of Artificial Intelligence lead to computers with minds? This is a
        question some scientists are speculating about. This indicates that
        science is beginning to encroach on the boundaries of the mind.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Looking at modern methods
        of observation and verification, we see that they have transcended the
        limitations of the five senses. Previously, the five senses on their own
        had been sufficient instruments of observation - the naked eye, the ear
        and the hands. Later we relied on instruments to expand their limited
        capabilities. Whenever the senses became incapable of perceiving any
        further, we resorted to these technological instruments.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">But now, even with these
        instruments, we seem to have reached our limit. At this stage,
        scientific investigations are reduced to mathematical symbols. The
        language of mathematics is used to convey the meaning of scientific
        concepts, reducing the universe to a world of symbols.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As observation,
        experimentation and analysis enter the sphere of the psyche, science
        retains its basic attitude and method of experiment, and so is reduced
        to guesswork and belief. There is a lot of belief, or preconception, in
        this kind of observation. As it approaches the borders of the mind, it
        remains to be seen whether science can in fact enter into it, and by
        what means.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><a name="_Toc528760825"><font face="Times New Roman">Values
        and motivations</font></a></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Let us go back now and look
        at the birth of science and how it has developed to its present state.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Even though Pure Science
        would like to be distinguished from Applied Science and technology,
        nevertheless Pure Science shares some of the responsibility for the harm
        resulting from these things. In fact, in the last hundred years or so,
        Pure Science has not really been so pure. This is because there is a set
        of values implicit within Pure Science, one which the scientific
        fraternity is not aware of; and because it isn't aware of this set of
        values, science unknowingly becomes a subject of its influence.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">What is the source of
        science? All sciences, be they natural or social sciences, are in fact
        based on sets of values. Take economics for example. What is the origin
        of economics? What is its source? Want is the source of economics. What
        is want? Can it be observed with any of the five senses? No, it can't.
        It is a quality of mind, a value. The discipline known as science claims
        it is free of values, but in fact it can never be truly value-free.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now, where is the source of
        physical science? The source, or motivation, of science is the desire to
        know the truth of nature, or reality. This answer is acceptable to most
        scientists, and in fact it was given by a scientist. The desire to know
        nature's truths, together with the belief that nature does have constant
        laws, and functions according to cause and effect, are the two basic
        premises on which science bases its quest for the secrets of nature.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The foundation of science
        is within this human mind, at the desire to know, and at faith. Without
        these two mental qualities it would be impossible for science to grow
        and develop.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The motivation which drove
        the early developments of science, and which still exists to some
        extent, was the desire to know the truths of nature. This was a
        relatively pure kind of desire. In later times this desire to know was
        suppressed by the Church during the Dark Ages. The Christian Church
        established a court for appraising the extent of people's faith, known
        as the Inquisition. Those who doubted the word of the Bible, or who made
        statements which cast doubt on it, were brought before this court and
        put on trial, and if found guilty they were punished. Galileo was one of
        those brought on trial. He had said that the earth revolved around the
        sun, and was almost put to death by poisoning for this teaching. At the
        last moment he pleaded guilty and was absolved; he didn't die, but many
        others were burnt alive at the stake.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">At that time there was
        overt suppression of the search for truth. But the stronger the
        suppression, the stronger the reaction. So it came about that this
        suppression and constraint of the Dark Ages had the effect of
        intensifying the desire to know the truths of nature, and this desire
        became instilled into the thinking of Western cultures, where it has
        remained until the present day.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Even so, this drive can
        still be considered a relatively pure desire for knowledge. The science
        we have nowadays, however, is no longer so pure. The science that has
        developed in the present time has been influenced by two major value
        systems, or preconceptions, which have impregnated the progress of
        science and controlled the direction of its research and learning.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">What are these two values?
        They are:</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">l. The drive to conquer
        nature, or the understanding that the prosperity of mankind hinges on
        the subjugation of nature.</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This way of thinking stems
        from the Christian belief that God created mankind in his own image, to
        take control of the world and have dominion over nature. God created
        nature, and all of the things within it, for man's use. Mankind is the
        leader, the hub of the Universe, the master. Mankind learns the secrets
        of nature in order to manipulate it according to his desires. Nature
        exists for man's use.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One Western text states
        that this idea is responsible for Western scientific progress. The text
        states that in ancient times, the East, particularly China and India,
        were scientifically more advanced than the West, but owing to the
        influence of this idea of conquering nature, the West eventually
        overtook the East, and has remained ahead up to the present time.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So the first major value
        system is the belief in Man's right to conquer nature, which provided
        the incentive (and the justification) for such actions. Now we come to
        the second major influence:</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">2. The belief that
        well-being depends on an abundance of material goods.</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This line of thinking has
        also exerted a very powerful influence on the West's industrial
        expansion. Originally, industries in the West were created to address
        the problem of scarcity, which is found throughout Western history. Life
        in Western countries was beset by hostile elemental forces, such as
        freezing winters, which made farming impossible. People in such places
        had to live exceedingly arduous lives. Not only were they subject to
        freezing cold temperatures, but also food shortages. Life was a struggle
        for survival, and this struggle led to the development of industry.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now what is the opposite to
        scarcity? The opposite of scarcity is plenty. People in Western
        countries thought that when the problem of scarcity was solved, they
        would be happy. This, then, was the impulse behind the development of
        the Industrial Revolution - the awareness of scarcity and the desire to
        provide sufficiency, which in turn was based on the view that material
        abundance was the prerequisite for happiness.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This kind of thinking
        developed into materialism, which in turn became consumerism, to which a
        significant contribution was made by the industrialists, under the
        influence of the first line of thinking mentioned above. The first idea
        mentioned just now was the belief in man's dominion over nature. Coupled
        with the idea that happiness is dependent on an abundance of material
        goods, we have the belief that nature must be conquered in order to
        produce material goods with which to cater to man's desires. These two
        ways of thinking are interrelated and reinforce each other.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It seems as if the pure
        desire for knowledge mentioned earlier has been corrupted, coming under
        the influence of the desires to conquer nature and to produce an
        abundance of material goods, or materialism. When these two values enter
        into the picture, that pure and clean desire for knowledge becomes an
        instrument for satisfying the aims of these secondary values, giving
        rise to an exploitive relationship with nature.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The assumption is that by
        conquering nature, mankind will be able to create unlimited material
        goods with which to cater to his desires, resulting in perfect
        happiness. The search for methods to implement this assumption follows
        on from that. So much progress has taken place in recent times,
        especially since the Industrial Revolution. It has even been said that
        the science which has developed recently, in the Industrial Age, is the
        servant of industry.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We can probably all agree
        that the prosperity experienced in recent times is a prosperity of
        industry. At this time, however, while Thais are entering wholeheartedly
        into the Industrial Age, the West is outgrowing it. Thailand would like
        to call itself a NIC (New Industrialized Country), but the Westerners
        have passed through that stage now, into a Post' Industrial Age, the Age
        of Information. Science is the important factor in either case. Science
        may claim that it has paved the way for industry, but industry says,
        &quot;Science? That is my servant!&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Together with the
        development of industry we have observed the gradual appearance, in
        ever-increasing severity, of the harmful effects contingent on it. Now,
        with the danger that threatens us from the destruction of the
        environment, it is all too clear.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The cause for this is these
        two ideas: the desire to conquer nature, and materialism. Together they
        place mankind firmly on the path to manipulating, and as a result
        damaging nature on an ever increasing scale. In addition, these two
        impulses are the cause for mankind's internal struggles, the struggle
        among individuals to wrest as much material comfort for each other as
        they can. It might even be said that modern man has had to experience
        the harmful consequences of the past century of industrial development
        principally because of the influence of these two assumptions.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><a name="_Toc528760826"><font face="Times New Roman">Behind
        the prosperity ...</font></a></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These two assumptions are
        not the whole picture. There are also two major trends which have served
        to support them:</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. Specialization:</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">
        The Industrial Age has been the age of specialization. Branches of
        learning have been subdivided into specialized fields of expertise. Each
        of these branches of learning may be very proficient in its respective
        field, but overall the different fields do not integrate.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The original purpose of
        this specialization of learning was to obtain knowledge on a more
        detailed level, and then to bring together all these areas of knowledge
        into one integrated whole, but the specialists have become blinded by
        their knowledge, giving rise to an unbalanced kind of specialization, an
        extreme view. In the field of science there are those who feel that
        science alone will solve mankind's problems and answer all his
        questions, which gives them little inclination to integrate their
        learning with other fields of knowledge.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This kind of outlook has
        caused the belief that religion and ethics are also specialized fields
        of learning. Modern education reduces ethics to just another academic
        subject. When people think of ethics, they think, &quot;Oh,
        religion,&quot; and file it away in its little compartment. They aren't
        interested. But when it comes to solving the world's problems, they say,
        &quot;Oh, my field can do that!&quot; They don't think of trying to
        integrate it with other disciplines. If they really were capable of
        solving all problems, then they would have to be able to solve the
        ethical ones, too. But then they say that ethics is a concern of
        religion, of this or that field of expertise. This brings me to the
        second attitude I would like to mention:</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">2. The belief that ethical
        problems can be solved without the need for ethics.</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">
        Supporters of this idea believe that when material development has
        reached its peak, all ethical problems will disappear of their own
        accord. According to this view, it is not necessary to train human
        beings or develop the mind. This is a line of reasoning which has
        recently appeared in the field of economics. Some economists say that if
        the economy is healthy and material goods are in plentiful supply, there
        will no longer be any contention, and society will be harmonious. This
        is simply saying that ethical or moral problems can be solved through
        material means, without the need for ethics.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This is not entirely wrong.
        Economic situations do have a bearing on ethical problems, but it is a
        mistake to look at the matter too simplistically, believing that if the
        economy was healthy, ethical problems would somehow disappear of their
        own accord.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It could be said, if
        somewhat facetiously, that this line of reasoning is true in one sense,
        because without ethics it would be impossible for the economy to be
        healthy. It could be alternatively said that if ethical practice was
        good (for example, people were encouraged to be diligent, generous,
        prudent and to use their possessions in a way that is useful to
        society), then economic problems would disappear.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The statement that when the
        economy is good, ethical problems will not arise, is true in the sense
        that before the economy can be healthy, ethical problems must be
        addressed. Similarly, the statement that when ethical problems are all
        solved, the economy will be healthy, is true in the sense that before
        ethical problems can be solved, economic problems must also be
        addressed.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The phrase 'ethical
        problems' takes in a wide range of situations, including mental health
        and the pursuit of happiness. Thus, the solving of ethical problems
        through materialistic means must also entail dealing with moods and
        feelings, examples of which can be seen in the synthesization of
        tranquillizers to relieve stress, worry, depression and sorrow. But it
        would be a mistake to try to solve ethical problems through such means.
        This kind of relief is only temporary. It only soothes the problem, it
        does not solve it. We may come back to this point later on.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Many branches of learning
        would like to be recognized as definitive sciences, but the specialist
        perspective causes funnel vision, discord and in itself becomes an
        impediment to true science. The specialists are incapable of being true
        scientists. Even physics cannot be called true science, because it lacks
        completeness; its facts are piecemeal, its truth is partial. When truth
        is partial, it is not the real truth. With only some of the facts known,
        any deductions made are not in accordance with the total reality. The
        stream of cause and effect is not seen in its entirety, so the truth
        remains out of reach.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These two beliefs or
        attitudes (that is, specialization and the belief that ethical problems
        can be solved through material means) pervade the Age of
        Industrialization. Coupled with the two lines of reasoning previously
        mentioned, problems are intensified accordingly.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">I have here initiated a
        course of enquiry. There may be some of you who are wondering what all
        this has to do with religion. In answer I would like to say that at this
        point we are beginning to approach the domain of religion. Many of the
        points I have mentioned so far come within the domain of religion, but
        in order to see this more clearly, I would like to retrace my steps and
        get onto the subject of religion itself. I have been speaking about
        science, its origins and development, now let's take a look at the
        origin and development of religion and try to integrate the two in some
        way.</font></p>
