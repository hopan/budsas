        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">HOW DID RELIGION originate?
        We have all learned that religion arose from the fear of danger,
        particularly natural dangers, such as lightning, floods, earthquakes,
        volcanic eruptions, hurricanes and so on. These dangers have threatened
        human beings throughout the ages.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In ancient times men didn't
        understand the workings of nature and were ignorant of the causes of
        these phenomena. Terrified at the threat of these natural forces,
        mankind began to search for answers. This quest precipitated an interest
        in the nature that surrounded him, and a desire to find some way to deal
        with it. This is an important point, because this is the common origin
        of both religion and science. Religion was born from a desire to escape
        danger, whereas science, as we have already mentioned, was born from a
        desire to know the truth of nature.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the case of religion,
        the desire for security was the incentive. Danger exists in the natural
        world, so humanity turned to nature for a practical answer. At the same
        time, there was a sense of wonder at the marvels of nature, from which
        arose the desire to know its truths. This was no idle curiosity: human
        heings were forced into finding out about nature in order to address the
        dangers which threatened them.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">From the aspiration to be
        free of danger, which was based on fear, also arose the desire to know
        the truths of nature. At this point we can see a common source for
        science and religion: religion arose first, at the fear of danger, while
        the desire to know the truths of nature, which was science, followed.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As far as we know, the
        earliest forms of scientific research in fact arose from religion. The
        people who looked for scientific knowledge in Egypt, Mesopotamia and
        other ancient cultures were from religious circles. These were the first
        people to take an interest in studying nature and devoting time to
        finding solutions to the dangers that threatened them. This indicates
        that science and religion originated together.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This initial common origin
        of science and religion is also the point at which they parted. Why did
        they part? The answer to this lies within the nature of truth itself.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The natural dangers which
        threaten humanity are immediate concerns, matters of life and death. The
        threat is immediate, here, right in front of us. Do what you will, we
        must have an answer right now. And all people are faced equally with the
        same dangers. The answer must be relevant to the group, to the whole of
        society. In such a situation, it is necessary to come up with an answer
        that can be acted on immediately, something which puts an end to these
        urgent demands. When an answer appears that is acceptable, it is
        institutionalized as religion.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The practical answers thus
        provided may take forms, such as mystic ceremonies, which to the modern
        eye would seem absurd, but even so, they are something which can be
        acted upon immediately. For the mainstream of society, this is what
        becomes religion.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now there is another group,
        which might have arisen from the first group, but at a time when the
        immediate threat has passed and there is time to gradually collect the
        facts, to analyse and experiment. This group of people arrives at a
        different set of answers, answers which have resulted from observation
        and experiment. This is what became known as 'science', the knowledge
        that comes from gradual and systematic observation.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This is the point of
        divergence between religion and science. The answer which served as a
        remedy for an immediate need, for the masses, lacked systematic
        observation, and relied heavily on faith and belief. This was religion.
        Religion, then, is tied to faith.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Science, on the other hand,
        is a discipline of gradual and systematic investigation. It was not
        concerned with finding immediate answers, and was available only to the
        few who were so inclined, not for the whole of society. For this reason,
        there were individuals or groups who carried on this systematic
        observation, using methods that were verifiable, and this became known
        as 'science'.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">At this juncture we have
        one clear distinction between religion and science: religion is for the
        masses, for whole societies or groups, whereas science is for a more
        limited number of people. Now, the problem that arises here is, how does
        religion maintain uniformity in the letter and the practice of its
        teaching? This is achieved through faith. Religion has its roots in
        faith, and utilizes faith to preserve its essence, providing an
        unchanging belief system which must be adhered to and upheld, one that
        is unquestionable. In the West this is called dogma.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Science is limited to the
        people to whom it communicates, the thinkers. They preserve the essence
        of science through verifiable truths, using valid methods of
        experimentation. Science thus preserves and propagates its truths
        through wisdom, or, to be more specific, scientific method.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Religion seeks to convey an
        all-embracing, absolute truth, an answer which addresses an immediate
        need. It would probably be more accurate to say, rather than religion
        provides this answer, that the answer thus provided is what became known
        as religion. It's not that there is an institution called religion
        already existing, which comes up with these answers, but rather that
        these answers, proposed by humanity, have become institutionalized as
        religion. The answer is proposed by people, or a person, and as time
        goes on these people are joined by others and an institution forms,
        serving to preserve the teaching. Thus we have the institutional forms
        of religion such as mendicants, priests, monks and so on.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Looked at in one sense,
        religion seeks to provide one absolute answer, an answer to the
        fundamental questions of life, covering everything, from the highest to
        the lowest.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Science, on the other hand,
        attempts to observe truth from its individual manifestations, piece by
        piece. It is a collection of piecemeal, partial truths, which attempts
        to gradually work toward an overall picture.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Even though science, too,
        wants a general principle, its general principle is conditional,
        confined to specific situations and conditions, and is only part of the
        overall or fundamental truth. To use a teasing phrase, we could say that
        religion gives a total answer, science a piecemeal one.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">At this point I would like
        to add that, owing to the limitations of religion and science, there
        arose a third group who was dissatisfied with both of them. This group
        also wanted an answer to the fundamental questions of life and the
        universe, an absolute answer, but they were dissatisfied with religion
        because, although it gave such an answer, it was not one that appealed
        to reason. It appealed to faith. But when they turned around and looked
        at science, although it gave answers that were verifiable and appealed
        to reason, those answers were not absolute. Research had still not
        reached the fundamental level of reality.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This group did not want to
        wait for science's answers, so they attempted to find an answer to those
        fundamental questions through reasoned consideration, without the need
        for verification. This system of thought became another science, known
        as 'philosophy'.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">We could compare these
        three disciplines, with the fundamental questions of nature as a
        measuring stick, in this way:</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. Science:</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">
        Is still in the process of verification and observation and is yet to
        come up with an answer.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">2. Philosophy:</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">
        Attempts to give an answer in lieu of verification by using the tool of
        reasoned analysis.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">3. Religion:</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">
        Provides a total answer which needs no verification.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Both science and philosophy
        appeared after religion, and both attempt to give answers that are
        clearer than religion's. However, both of them fail to give answers that
        are satisfactory and fulfilling on an overall basis, which is why
        religion still exists and still provides an answer based on faith.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><a name="_Toc528760829"><font face="Times New Roman">Many
        religions, one science</font></a></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Having looked at some of
        the differences between religion and science, I would like to give some
        observations about this difference.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Because religion offers
        this comprehensive and immediate truth, an answer that is suitable for
        the masses, but which at the same time is not verifiable through any of
        the five senses, it must hinge on faith. Because these answers are
        unverified, they will be constantly growing. At one time one kind of
        answer is submitted. People don't know whether it is true or not,
        because it can't be verified. If they believe it they accept it. At a
        later time a new answer is given. Nobody knows whether this new answer
        is true or not, it can't be verified either. It boils down to
        preference. Some may prefer the older belief, some the newer one.
        Religions, built as they are on faith, vary in accordance with that
        faith. For this reason we can see at any one time many different
        religions.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Why is this? Because this
        is the nature of such answers. The all embracing, absolute answer must
        be like this. It cannot be verified, it rests on belief. When a new
        answer arises there will be some who believe that, but all the answers
        are equally unverifiable.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">On the other hand, science
        answers slowly and methodically, verifying each point as it goes. It
        solves problems intelligently. At any given time there is only one
        science. So we find people saying, &quot;There are many religions, but
        only one science.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">However, looking from a
        historical perspective, we find that there are many sciences, because
        science doesn't give a total view of truth. There may be many religions
        at the one time, but from a historical perspective, there are many
        sciences. Theories about the nature of the Universe vary from time to
        time. One set of scientific answers may seem correct at one time, but at
        a later time it is proven to be wrong. As time goes on, this new answer,
        at first thought to be right, is in its turn proven wrong. A new picture
        is constantly unfolding.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">At one time science
        followed the Ptolemaic System, which showed a universe as postulated by
        Ptolemy (geocentric). Then came the Copernican System (heliocentric
        solar system), following the model of Copernicus, then there were the
        Cartesian and Newtonian systerns, and now we have the universe of the
        new physics. Science's picture of reality has been constantly changing.
        Nature, or the Universe, according to the modern theories of physics,
        whether the quantum or relativity theories, is completely different from
        the universe in the time of Newton. So there have been many sciences
        throughout the ages.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Moreover, not only are
        there many sciences throughout the ages, it seems that in the present
        age we have many sciences existing together. There are even scientists
        who now say that the time has come for science to change some of its
        basic premises. These scientists reject some of the old scientific
        premises and talk of a 'new physics' and a 'new science', indicating
        that there is no longer only one science.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Just now I mentioned that
        science deals with the outside world, measurable by the five senses. In
        this connection religion has yet another special characteristic.
        Religion not only looks at the outside world, but also concerns itself
        with the human being, with the one who is observing. Science concerns
        itself solely with the objects of observation, but religion concems
        itself with the observer, the one who is using these five sense bases.
        Religion is thus not confined to the five senses, but is also directly
        related to the level of development of each individual. The way religion
        is perceived is directly related to the level of mental development of
        the perceiver, which gives it an added level of complexity.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In any case, as far as
        religion goes, even though it lays emphasis on the human being, it does
        so only insofar as the human being is experiencing a problem, and that
        problem needs to be dealt with. When looking for the causes and factors
        of that problem, however, most religions turn around and look for its
        source, like science, in the external physical world. In this respect,
        most religions do not differ from science: they look to the external
        natural world as the source of problems, the source of suffering.
        Religion's search for truth is in order to solve the human problem,
        while science's search for truth is in order to satisfy the thirst for
        knowledge.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">For most religions, which
        are compelled to have a ready answer, the cause of problems, whether
        internal or external, is seen as existing behind that natural world in
        the form of spirits, deities, gods or other supernatural forces. For
        external disturbances, such as lightning, earthquakes and so on,
        sacrifices and prayers to these forces are prescribed. For internal
        disturbances, be it sickness, mental disease or hysteria, mediums or
        spirit healers perform mystic ceremonies. Science, not being compelled
        to find any immediate answers, slowly and systematically goes about its
        search for data.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The natural religions,
        Buddhism in particular, although having a special interest in the human
        condition, do not see the source of problems as being entirely in the
        external, physical world. This kind of religion looks for the source of
        problems within the entire process of causes and conditions including
        those within the human being, such as wrong ways of livelihood - be they
        internal or external, material or immaterial, physical or mental.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Among ordinary religions,
        there are many that teach the treatment of problems by appropriate
        means, through morality or ethics, which seems to indicate an
        understanding of the internal factors contributing to problems, but this
        is not necessarily the case. In fact, such practice is often not done
        with real understanding of these factors, but out of obedience to some
        external supernatural force. The relationship is one between mankind and
        an external power. Ethical behaviour in these religions is usually done
        in order to avoid punishment, or to gain favours or blessings, rather
        than through awareness of the factors occurring in the natural
        processes.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Religions, many and varied
        at the one time, address the needs of different levels of people. At any
        one time society consists of many different levels of virtue and
        understanding, thus the need for many religions, answering many
        different levels of need.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the past the truth of
        science was verifiable through the five senses, but this is no longer
        the case. Initially observation was carried out with these five senses
        on their own - with the naked eye, the naked ear, directly by hand and
        so on. As time went on it became necessary to develop instruments, such
        as the telescope and the microscope, to extend the capabilities of these
        senses. Eventually even these instruments had reached their limits,
        making it necessary for scientists to develop even more complex
        instruments, until finally it has become necessary to test hypotheses
        with mathematics. Mathematical languages became the instrument of
        verification. In the present time this has been extended to include the
        use of computers.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Science's development of
        increasingly complex means of verification has given rise to another
        feature which distinguishes it from religion. The verification and
        observation of science has become a specialized field, accessible only
        to a select few. It has become impossible for the average man to observe
        the truths of science, because the instruments are not available to him.
        Science has become a highly select subject.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Religion belongs to the
        masses. It is available to the average man, who is free to accept or
        reject it without the need for proof. Although it is true that some
        religions, like science, reserve their truths for a select few, the
        priests or monks, and even reserve the right to spiritual attainments,
        this is more a result of manipulations of certain individuals. In the
        natural religions, such as Buddhism, there is no such distinction or
        exclusion, because nature is its own master. How could it be
        monopolized? It is each individual's right to understand and attain the
        truths of nature, depending on intelligence and discernment.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Note that there are two
        kinds of inability to verify truths. One is through an inability to
        access the instruments of verification, while the other is because such
        truths cannot be verified through the means being used. In the present
        time science is experiencing problems on both counts, especially when
        attempting to make a statement of ultimate truth, or delving into the
        realm of the mind.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If science does not broaden
        its outlook, it will arrive at a dead end. Science has a very strong
        aspiration to answer the fundamental and ultimate questions of the
        universe, but it never seems to get near them. Just as it seems to be
        getting on the verge of an answer, the truth seems to slip beyond its
        reach.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Nowadays we are beginning
        to see different kinds of science existing simultaneously. In addition
        to the new science and the classical science, or the new physics and the
        classical physics, we have one science for the specialists and one for
        the average man. This is because many of the concepts spoken of in
        science are completely beyond the ability of the average man to
        visualize. Not only can he not verify them for himself, he can't even
        grasp the concepts at all. And this applies not only to the average man:
        some of the concepts of science are even beyond the ability of most
        scientists to visualize! One can only take their word for it.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Let's take an example.
        According to science, light is at once a wave and a particle. Scientists
        were trying to define the nature of light itself: is it a wave or is it
        a particle? It's a component, a particle, right? One group said,
        &quot;Yes, that's right. It's a particle, a stream of protons.&quot; But
        another group said, &quot;No, light is a wave.&quot; In the end it seems
        that it is both ... Light is both a particle and a wave. Hmm. But what's
        that? It has to be proven with mathematics. This kind of thing is beyond
        the grasp of the ordinary human being.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Let's look at some more
        examples. Take the black holes, for instance: astronomers tell us that
        there are black holes scattered throughout the universe. These are stars
        from which even light cannot escape, they are absolutely dark. In fact,
        nothing at all can escape from their extremely high gravitational pulls.
        Even light cannot be emitted by them. Now what does the average man make
        of that? Something that even light cannot escape from?!</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now they say that in these
        black holes both matter and energy are compacted to terrific densities.
        There's nothing to compare with them on this earth of ours. To give some
        idea, they say that if all the empty space were somehow pressed out of a
        skyscraper, like the Empire State Building, 102 stories high, its mass
        and energy would be compacted into the size of a needle! A skyscraper!
        Take all the empty space out of it and all that's left is the size of
        one needle. Now what are the villagers going to make of that?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The scientists say that
        this is how a black hole is. In fact it's even stranger, because, apart
        from being the size of a needle, at the same time it would still weigh
        as much as the original Empire State Building. It's inconceivable - all
        we can do is believe them. We've trusted the scientists for so long, we
        give them the benefit of the doubt. But deep inside we're all wondering,
        &quot;Huh? Is that possible?&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Science is not yet able to
        provide an answer that explains the totality of life and the world, it
        is still engaged in the process of collecting and verifying pieces of
        data. Science is still unable to explain many of the basic questions of
        the universe, such as the nature of, or even existence of, the basic
        particle.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Science has gone beyond the
        point where it can be proven with the five senses. Hypotheses are proven
        through mathematics, which is then interpreted by physicists. The truth
        is reduced to algebraic equations, which are not in themselves the
        truth, and don't really clarify the truth in a convincing way. It has
        become a matter of belief in these mathematical symbols. These symbols
        are interpreted without a direct awareness of reality, which is very
        nearly the condition that Sir Arthur Eddington spoke of.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sir Arthur Eddington was an
        English scientist, credited with being the first person to fully
        understand Einstein's Theory of Relativity. He was also the first person
        to devise a way to prove the Theory of Relativity, on account of which
        he was knighted.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sir Arthur Eddington, a
        scientist who was foremost in his field, once said:</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Science is incapable
        of leading mankind directly to the truth, or reality as such, it can
        only lead him to a shadow world of symbols.&quot;</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These are his words -
        &quot;a shadow world of symbols&quot; - a world of symbols and signs.
        These are the words of one of the world's leading scientists.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Even observable phenomena
        are not a certainty. Scientists use the scientific method as a means of
        testing their observations. The main factors of this method are
        observation and experiment, which must be carried out until there is no
        longer room for doubt. But, even then, the matter is not closed, because
        of the limitations of the experimental method and the instruments used.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Let's take as an example
        Newton's Law of Gravitation. This was a universally accepted truth, a
        Law, but Einstein came along and said it was not entirely correct. On
        the subatomic level, the Law of Gravity no longer applies, but in
        Newton's time there weren't the instruments to observe the subatomic
        level. Mankind had to wait until the twentieth century and Einstein,
        using mathematical equations and reasoning, to arrive at this truth. So
        we must be careful. You cannot ultimately believe even experimentation.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">At this point I would like
        to insert a little story used to tease the scientists. It's the story of
        the chicken and Farmer Brown. Every morning that the chicken sees Farmer
        Brown, Farmer Brown is carrying some food for him. He sees this every
        single morning, so it follows that whenever he sees Farmer Brown the
        chicken gets fed. Chicken sees Farmer Brown = gets fed ... this is the
        equation. But there comes a morning when the chicken sees Farmer Brown
        and doesn't get fed, because Farmer Brown isn't carrying food in his
        hand, he's carrying a knife. The equation &quot;chicken sees Farmer
        Brown = gets fed&quot;, becomes &quot;Chicken sees Farmer Brown = gets
        throat cut&quot;. So it seems that even verification based on repeated
        observation cannot be completely trusted, it's still not a sure thing'</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">What I would like to point
        out here is that science has distanced itself more and more from the
        average person through the sophistication of its experimental methods.
        Scientists have become a very select group, an elite, one that is highly
        specialized, whereas religion is available to the masses. This is a
        major difference between the two disciplines.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><a name="_Toc528760831"><font face="Times New Roman">Towards
        a unity of science and religion</font></a></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Science is of little direct
        use to the masses. The function through which science should really help
        the people is in the field of understanding, but the role it in effect
        plays is by and large through technology, which does not improve
        understanding by any means.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In what direction does
        technology assist humanity? Mostly in consumption, often nourishing
        either greed (lobha), hatred (dosa), or delusion (moha). Television is
        invented, and so we watch television. But when people watch television,
        they don't look at things which are going to increase their
        understanding and intelligence, they look at things which make them even
        more indulgent and heedless. We have communications technology, but it
        is not used for developing wisdom and discernment, but too often to
        encourage delusion.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Science does not seem to
        take responsibility for these things, throwing off any such role and
        leaving technology to help the masses. Technology, however, doesn't
        always help; sometimes it is downright harmful. As I said, instead of
        becoming a tool to create benefit, it becomes a tool for seeking
        benefit. Thus, science leaves the people in the hands of religion. Who
        can you blame? One may ask, &quot;Why does religion make people so
        gullible and stupid?&quot;, but then it can be countered, &quot;Why does
        science abandon the people to religion?&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Science has become a
        subject which only very few people can approach. All people can do is
        believe it, they can't really know it. Nowadays science has become more
        and more a matter of belief, or faith, not of knowledge, which puts
        science on the same standing as most religions.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">At this time America still
        faces the problem of 'scientism', blind faith in science. Science is the
        direct opposite to credulity, it deals with knowledge, and the reasoned
        and systematic verification of truths, but nowadays people have become
        credulous of science. Scientists should be accepting some of the
        responsibility for this situation, because it is their duty to impart
        understanding to mankind, but nowadays people relate to science with
        credulity at times verging on foolishness. Without knowing or verifying
        the truths of science, they simply believe them.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Before moving on from this
        point, I would like to offer a reflection on the statement, &quot;There
        are many religions, but only one science.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Firstly, the presence of
        many religions but only one science at any one time is a natural
        phenomenon, arising naturally on account of human nature. This condition
        is therefore science. To put it another way, science, as the
        understanding and knowledge of the natural way of things, should also
        understand this situation.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Secondly, the existence of
        many religions side by side with science indicates that science is still
        unable to satisfy mankind's highest aspiration, to answer the
        fundamental questions of the universe, or to obtain a complete
        description of the nature of reality. Science is still not fully
        developed, for which reason religions are still required to fulfil a
        need, even if only provisionally, which is not fulfilled by science.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Thirdly, when science is
        finally able to arrive at the truth, to answer mankind's ultimate
        questions, it will be a perfect science. Many religions will no longer
        be sustainable. Conversely, any religion which is able to show the
        highest truth, to lead humanity to reality, will be in a position to
        unify with science, becoming one and the same body of knowledge. At that
        time science and religion will have reached another meeting point, their
        last one, where religion becomes science and science becomes religion,
        the division between the two gone forever.</font></p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="LEFT"><a name="_Toc528760832"><font face="Times New Roman">When
        faith in science is shaken, even the worshipping religions flourish</font></a></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">I would like to once again
        summarize at this point that the real life problems in society are in
        need of an immediate answer or remedy - now, in this present life. As
        individuals we are only on this earth for a limited time, we cannot
        wait. The situations threatening us give no time for procrastination.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Even though science is
        capable of providing many efficient ways of answering our problems, it
        is weakened by being 'too little, too late'.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">By science being 'too
        little', I mean that the knowledge of science is insufficient to solve
        the fundamental problems of life. It cannot make people good, it cannot
        make them happy, it cannot show them how to rectify bad habits, it
        cannot solve suffering, sadness, anger, sorrow, depression and so on. It
        can't even solve social problems.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In answer to this,
        scientists may counter that science has helped in many ways. People with
        insomnia, depression and mental problems are all helped by drugs.
        Science is of great benefit in these areas. Applied Science and
        technology in the medical fields have helped vast numbers of people. And
        this point must be conceded. People with severe mental problems are
        indeed helped to some degree by science.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Scientists may believe that
        in the future it will be possible to make people happy through the use
        of drugs. Whenever you feel unhappy, just pop a capsule and it's gone
        ... but this is no longer medicine, it is pleasure seeking. Scientists
        may conduct research into the nature of the brain, finding out which
        particular chemicals are secreted when certain emotions, such as
        happiness, are experienced. When they can isolate the chemical agent
        they will be able to synthesize it. Whenever there is a feeling of
        depression or sadness, people can take this drug and have immediate
        relief. It looks as if science is able to do anything, maybe even solve
        all the world's problems. If it can make people happy, then people will
        no longer have to fear depression and sadness. With chemicals like this
        as freely available as food, people will always be happy, and never have
        to experience depression.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">But then again, reflecting
        on the dangers of chemicals, we see that the world is enough of a mess
        already, with food additives and pesticides, without adding any more.
        However, this is not the most important point. Even more important is
        the perspective of values, or quality of life. The objective of religion
        is to lead people to freedom. Freedom here means the ability to be happy
        without the need for external agents, to be more and more independently
        happy and less and less dependent on externals, to develop a life free
        of enslavement to a mass of external trappings. But the use of drugs
        forces people to lay their happiness and their fate more and more into
        the hands of externals, making them less and less able to live with
        themselves.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If science causes people to
        depend increasingly on externals, it will be not unlike the ancient
        religions, which led people to invest their fate in the gods with
        sacrifices and supplications. In both cases, the happiness and suffering
        of human beings is offered up into the hands of external agents, one
        offering it up to material things, the other to a nominal quality, but
        in essence they equally destroy man's independence.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If things reach this stage
        we can give up pretending to be human beings. If this were the case we
        would no longer be natural human beings, but scientific or artificial
        beings, or some other kind of being which is unsustainable in a natural
        environment.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">What I have just mentioned
        is an example of what I mean by 'too little'. Science on its own is not
        capable of solving mankind's problems. To use Buddhist terminology, we
        could say that science and technology do not encourage people to have
        good behaviour (sila), do not encourage quality in the mind, or inner
        well-being (samadhi) and they suffer from 'funnel vision', in that they
        seek to a mass data, but they do not provide us with the knowledge of
        how to lead a happy life (panna) (x).</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <i>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">(x) Sila, samadhi and
          panna, or moral restraint, concentration and wisdom, are the
          three-fold foundation of Buddhist ethical practice.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The second objection we
        have with science is that it is 'too late', we cannot wait for it.
        Scientific truth is not whole or complete. It is not yet able to give us
        a definitive and final answer, and there is no indication of when it
        will be able to do so. Scientific knowledge is constantly changing. At
        one time the truth is one way, later on it is found to be otherwise.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The truth seems to be
        always changing. If we had to sit and wait for science to come up with a
        final answer to the nature of the Universe, we would all die first
        without ever finding out how to conduct our lives.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Scientists are always
        looking for a general principle, but any principle they arrive at is
        always a 'sub-principle', only a piece of the overall picture. In the
        meantime, while science is yet unable to give an explanation of
        fundamental truth, we are using it, through technology, to enhance our
        lives and pander to our desires. For the moment, what is helping mankind
        is technology, which at least can be used for something, rather than
        science itself. But technology cannot answer mankind's fundamental
        questions. For an answer to the truth (or non truth) of the natural
        world, mankind must first rely on religion, using science only for the
        convenience offered through technological progress. This is the
        situation at the present time.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Why do human beings still
        need religion? Why is religion still present in this world? Because
        mankind is still waiting for a complete and absolute answer, one that is
        right for the situation and which is immediately practicable. And
        because it cannot be verified, and because science cannot verify it for
        them, they must resort to belief.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Although science has made
        such great advances, all it has done is expand the perceivable limits of
        the material world, making it more and more complex and intricate. But
        in terms of answering mankind's fundamental questions, showing man's
        proper relationship and position in the world, it seems that science has
        been running on the spot and hasn't made any real progress.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is not only in the field
        of Pure Science that the problem of mistakes arises from time to time.
        Even within Applied Science and technology, mistakes are common. Often
        they are not wrongdoings as such, but mistakes that arise out of
        ignorance, oversight or lack of circumspection.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Take for example the drug
        chloramphenicol. At one time this drug was very widespread. It was a
        wonder drug, it seemed to cure everything. People were really sold on
        it, we all thought we were going to be free from illness ever after.
        Whenever you were sick, all you had to do was just go and buy some
        chloramphenicol, they sold it everywhere. Later on, after about ten
        years, it was discovered that this drug would gradually build up in the
        system, where it caused the bone marrow to cease production of blood
        corpuscles, and many had died of leukaemia.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Then there was the case of
        DDT. At that time it was thought that with DDT, our problems with the
        insect world were over - ants, mosquitoes ... all gone. We thought we
        could eradicate these creatures and no longer have to be bothered by
        them.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Many years later it was
        found that DDT was carcinogenic, an insidious substance which could
        prove fatal even to humans. What's more, while the humans were suffering
        ill effects from the drug, the insect population was becoming immune to
        it. In time it became useless as an insecticide, and was more likely to
        kill the human beings. Many countries have banned the use of DDT, but
        Thailand is still using it, even now.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Then there was the case of
        thalidomide. Thalidomide was a pain killer and tranquillizer which was
        highly praised by the medical profession. It was reputed to have passed
        the most stringent tests, and was trusted so highly that it was
        announced as an exceptionally safe drug. It was so lauded that even the
        developed countries, which are normally very cautious about drugs and
        medicines, allowed the drug to be bought without a prescription. It was
        sold for about five years, up until 1961, at which time it was found
        that this drug, when taken by pregnant women, caused deformed babies.
        Before this danger was known and the drug was recalled from the market,
        about 8000 deformed children were born.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Let's take one more
        example, the case of CFC's (chloro-fluoro-carbons). This group of
        chemicals is widely used in refrigerators, air conditioners and in
        'pressure-pack' spray cans. These chemicals have been used for a long
        time with complete confidence. Before we knew what was going on, it
        turned out that these chemicals had risen up into the upper levels of
        the atmosphere and caused gaps in the ozone layer. A lot of it has
        already been damaged and scientists are very concemed; world conferences
        are being held to find ways to solve the problem. And so a new piece of
        knowledge arises what we thought was a good thing turns out to be not so
        good after all.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Before leaving this part of
        the talk, I would like to insert another small observation. The
        emergence and development of science has undoubtedly helped to improve
        understanding and the human intellect, about this there is no argument.
        But at the same time, if we look closely we will see that it has also
        caused human intelligence and understanding to decline. How so? In
        previous ages, when science was just beginning to emerge and develop,
        people were very impressed with its achievements. People were excited at
        the discoveries and technological achievements of science. They put all
        their hopes for an answer to their problems into science and technology.
        All of nature's mysteries were going to be revealed, and science would
        lead humanity into an age of perfect happiness.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These people who
        wholeheartedly trusted science then turned around and began to doubt
        their religions and the answers provided by them. Many people lost faith
        and discarded religion.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Unfortunately, the truth
        dealt with by science is only a specialized or fractional truth. It
        deals only with the physical world. Science has no answers to the
        questions dealing with internal human problems, the answers for which
        mankind had previously turned to religion. The discarding of religion in
        modern times would not be such a big loss, if by religion we simply
        meant the institutional forms known as religion, but this discarding is
        also a discarding of that part of religion which dealt with solving
        internal human problems.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">With science taking no
        interest in these matters, and people discarding them, it gives rise to
        a huge gap. The answers which had previously been searched for and
        provided by religions have been ignored, causing a retardation of
        mankind's mental and spiritual growth. It is not only retarded, in some
        cases it has even gone into retrograde.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The nature of the world,
        life and human problems does not allow mankind to ignore the need for
        religion. Fundamental, immediate and practical answers are still as much
        in demand as ever before. When science is seen to be incapable of
        providing an answer to this need, and when human beings tire of their
        fascination with science, they come to their senses and remember this
        fundamental need within. Then they turn once more to religion for their
        answers. But because the stream of mental development has been
        interrupted, or set back, such searching is very unsteady. It might even
        be necessary to start all over again. Examples of this can be seen in
        some of the religious developments in highly developed countries, where,
        in spite of being surrounded by high scientific advancement, people have
        foolishly and gullibly fallen for charlatanry (x).</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <i>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">(x) The reference is to
          the proliferation of 'crank' religious cults in highly developed
          industrial countries.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">However that may be,
        science is not without its merits and blessings in leading to better
        understanding within religious circles. It is well known how religion,
        especially in its institutional forms, has on occasion taken an active
        role in suppressing the development of human intelligence. Some
        religions have clung blindly to absurd beliefs and practices, even in
        the face of their own fundamental principles.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The development of science,
        in particular its attitudes and methods, has had some measure of good
        influence on religions and religious attitudes in society. At the very
        least, it has given the opportunity, or acted as a catalyst, for
        religion to re-evaluate some of its teachings and attitudes. It also
        serves as a gauge with which to appraise the answers given by the
        different religions, and offers them a chance to better themselves.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">However, from the point of
        view of the masses, especially in countries which have received
        scientific influences in their outlooks and methods, science does not
        seem to have had a significantly beneficial effect on lifestyles and
        mental wellbeing. Science itself is not of much interest to most people.
        Even though most would look at science favourably, their belief in it is
        much the same as how they would believe in something magical or
        mystical. Their belief is naive, it is not based on knowledge. This is
        'scientism'. When most people think of science, they look straight past
        it at technology, which they look on as a means for gratifying their
        desires. For that reason, the development of science has had little
        positive influence on the knowledge, understanding, or attitudes of
        society.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">On the brighter side, at
        this point in time people seem to be getting over their excitement about
        science and are beginning to look at their needs in relation to
        religion. Numerous religions are addressing these needs on different
        levels. At the same time, some members of scientific circles are
        becoming aware of the limitations of orthodox science, expanding the
        horizons of their research to include religions, which suggests the
        possibility of a fully-developed science merging with a fully-developed
        religion, which together can lead humanity to reality, peace, and a life
        free of foolish attachments.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">On the other hand, science
        may be trying to prove something which religion has already predicted.
        While humanity cannot wait for an answer, we must provide one of some
        kind, and this answer has become religion. This answer is still not
        proven, but we must accept it for now, while science slowly and
        methodically tests it out. In this scenario, science is that effort on
        the part of humanity to prove the truths (or non-truths) of religion.
        Looking at it in this way, the two fields harmonize; having arisen from
        a common origin, they eventually merge once more.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As time goes on, the limits
        of the scientific method will once again be reached. Science will be
        unable to prove the truths presented by religion. A number of leading
        scientists are now beginning to realise this. They say that this final,
        ultimate truth spoken of by religion is beyond the reach of science at
        any stage in time.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Now we have talked about
        science and also religion, going through the origins and development of
        both. Now let us take a look at Buddhism and finally get into the
        subject proper of this talk.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">... Many people today view
        ethics as merely the arbitrary dictates of certain groups of people...
        but while science has cut itself off from any consideration of ethics or
        values, Buddhism studies and teaches the role of ethics within the
        natural process...</font></p>
