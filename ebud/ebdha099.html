  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we hear or read the word &#147;liberation&#148;
  (nibbana), we often get the idea that it is unattainable, otherworldly, reachable only by
  spiritual giants, and that it has very little to do with us. We do not have to look at it
  that way. Let us consider the three kinds of liberation: &#147;signless,&#148;
  &#147;wishless,&#148; and &#147;voidness&#148; liberation. Signless liberation is attained
  by completely penetrating impermanence (anicca), wishless liberation by completely
  penetrating unsatisfactoriness (dukkha), and voidness liberation by penetrating coreless
  substance (anatta).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We&#146;re all familiar with impermanence, but what is
  signless liberation? Suppose we are attached to or highly appreciative of a person, a
  situation, a belonging. Can we let go of clinging to it? We can try to let go of anything
  at all, no matter how small. We direct our attention to the fact that all we examine is
  totally fleeting. We fathom that truth in everything, in all living beings, and, having
  seen it, we let go of our belief in the solidity of things. We thereby let go of our
  attachment. If we can do that with anything or anyone, even for a moment, we have won a
  moment of signless liberation -- a moment of direct knowledge that nothing has any
  intrinsic value, that it&#146;s all a passing show. Having had that experience, even for
  one moment, gives us an inkling of what the Buddha meant when he spoke about freedom.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Freedom is often misunderstood as the ability to do
  anything we want. We have probably tried that already and found that it doesn&#146;t work.
  Even if we were to follow only our desires, we would soon be satiated and then feel
  unfulfilled.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Freedom means nonattachment, which is not indifference but
  rather the penetration of absolute truth. To see that clearly, we let go for one moment of
  anything that we call our own, anything that we like or consider important. We examine it
  until its fleeting nature has become quite apparent. Then the moment comes when we can
  say, &#147;I don&#146;t have to have that, I can do without it.&#148; That is a moment of
  truth. Having a moment of truth is always possible, but such moments don&#146;t come
  automatically. We have to inquire into our clinging and work at loosening it. Letting go
  sounds easy, and it is, but only after it has happened. Before that, it entails much
  self-examination.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A moment of signless liberation can be experienced in
  another way. Suppose, for instance, there is an unpleasant feeling in the body that
  creates a reaction of &#147;I don&#146;t want it. Go away now!&#148; When we really
  penetrate into the impermanence of that feeling -- when we see how it has no basic reality
  or significance and, for just a moment, let go of our rejection and say, &#147;It&#146;s
  all right, it is only a feeling&#148; -- we get a taste of signless liberation. When we
  see that there is nothing that really lasts, that all is fleeting, flowing, moving, and
  changing from one moment to the next, we have a moment of freedom. We can practice that
  with our thoughts, our feelings, or our physical sensations.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As a first step we can become aware of our attachment to
  the body. Usually, we are concerned whether the body looks good, is dressed appropriately,
  feels well, eats right, and is comfortable enough. But when we consider the body&#146;s
  fleeting nature, our attachment may wane. We may experience instead a feeling of
  equanimity. We have no preference whether this body of ours exists or not. This is a
  moment of real peace, but it doesn&#146;t happen by itself. We have to remember again and
  again that life is not guaranteed but merely supported by kamma-vipaka (the results of
  one&#146;s intentions) and that it may run out at any time. That&#146;s the reason why the
  Buddha recommended the daily recollection &#147;I am of the nature to die.&#148; We are of
  this nature all the time, which means right now, not twenty years from now or whenever we
  feel ready.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Everybody knows they are going to die -- there&#146;s
  nothing new about that. The Buddha did not teach anything inaccessible. He asked us to
  investigate the known in a new way, to get a deep-down feeling that this body cannot
  remain, no matter how hard we try to keep it. It&#146;s a foregone conclusion that we are
  fighting a losing battle. Of course this doesn&#146;t mean we shouldn&#146;t look after
  our bodies. The body has to be washed, fed, and given medicine. That&#146;s all we have to
  do. And if we can&#146;t keep it going indefinitely, that&#146;s all right.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One moment of real inner seeing is liberating. The
  experience of relief and release is totally convincing. It arouses a sense of urgency to
  practice to the end -- to be deterred no longer by the opinions of others or external
  situations. Liberation is not so difficult that an ordinary person cannot experience it.
  Were that so, the Buddha&#146;s teaching would be in vain.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To get a glimpse of wishless liberation, we can notice the
  dissatisfaction -- the dukkha -- that arises in the heart and mind whenever we want
  something. When we drop the wish, we experience relief. The dukkha does not necessarily
  arise because we can&#146;t fulfill our wish; most likely we can. It&#146;s an old axiom
  that if we want something badly enough, we will get it. The problem is that most people
  don&#146;t know what will bring them happiness. The dukkha, however, lies in the desire
  itself, which creates tension, a feeling of expectation tinged with worry.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The desire also creates a thought process that is no
  longer concerned with the here and now, but with the future, with the hope of gratifying
  the desire. A mind preoccupied with the future cannot attend to the present moment. It
  lives in the imaginary delusion of what might happen when its desires are fulfilled. Of
  course, the future hardly ever turns out the way we hope, but, since the real dukkha lies
  in the wishing itself and not in the outcome, freedom from this kind of wishing is called
  wishless liberation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we deliberately drop our wishes for things, the
  release and relief generate a feeling of strength. The mind obeys, abandons its old
  patterns, and a feeling of self-confidence ensues. The more often we drop our wishes, the
  more powerful the mind becomes. The word &#147;power&#148; has the connotation of power
  over other people, but here it means power over ourselves. It explains the sort of
  vibration that emanated from the Buddha and why people flocked to him. We could compare
  such potential to a powerhouse from which energy can be drawn.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is useful to aim for a moment of wishless liberation.
  Our wish could be related to eating, to entertaining ourselves, wanting to go somewhere,
  buying something, getting information, or talking to someone. Whatever it may be, we can
  drop it deliberately, knowing that we don&#146;t really need it. Letting go of something
  we want requires willpower. But as soon the mind has dropped its wishes, we can experience
  the ease of contentment.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To get an inkling of voidness liberation, we can
  deliberately empty the mind of all it contains, realizing that it has no absolute
  significance. The less we carry in the mind, the less tired the mind becomes. Usually our
  minds are full to the brim, which is a great burden for us. Voidness liberation means that
  there is an absence of all formations (thoughts and reactions). When, for a moment, we
  have let them go, we can notice how relieved we feel, and we get a taste of voidness
  liberation. Then we let thoughts and reactions return and realize the difference.
  Immediately irritation arises, which usually escapes our awareness because we&#146;re used
  to a mind full of formations. We experience the heavy, debilitating, burdensome nature of
  thoughts only when we are able to compare our usual mind states with momentary emptiness.
  This may be the first time that we notice the constant sense bombardment we commonly
  experience.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The most insidious irritations arise through thinking.
  Thought is a constant process with which we identify and then we act upon. We can&#146;t
  act upon everything we see or hear. If we see a beautiful sunset or hear some great music,
  there&#146;s nothing to do about it, except to like it. No need for a reaction, which may
  easily result in new problems. Even the most innocuous situations can cause friction if we
  identify with our thinking process. Once we express our views, hopes, and beliefs, the
  argument starts, and tears start flowing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Any meditator knows that the thoughts that arise in the
  mind have no true significance. When we want to meditate, they are nothing but a nuisance.
  But the same applies when we don&#146;t want to meditate. It makes no difference. Mind is
  mind.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is another way of experiencing a moment of voidness.
  When we see the interconnectedness of dukkha, anicca, and anatta, we glimpse the lack of
  substance in all existence. We can see the clouds moving in the sky and the wind blowing
  in the trees. We can notice our blood pulsing and our breath flowing. The universe is
  contracting and expanding constantly. Within all that movement, we cannot find anything to
  grasp and retain. There is nothing solid at all anywhere.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Such a moment of seeing frees us from craving and
  clinging, from samsaric existence with all its dukkha. Clinging is always connected with
  the fear of losing, and craving is always connected with the fear of not having or not
  being. Fear and anxiety are natural states of being in the human condition. The
  supermundane condition is without fear, since there is nothing to be lost or gained. We
  crave and cling to whatever we think is important. Being free from craving or clinging for
  a moment doesn&#146;t mean we are indifferent to others. The Buddha&#146;s great
  compassion arose out of his enlightenment. He saw quite clearly that everybody was
  suffering on account of craving and clinging. Because he had eliminated these mind states
  within himself, his great compassion was not marred by any concern for himself, and he
  could completely give himself to others. We can take steps to approach this ideal and get
  a glimpse of its peacefulness. It is accessible.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Liberation does not happen by grace from above, descending
  on us like a golden mantle of bliss. It requires moment-to-moment mindfulness and
  purification until the last speck of impurity has been removed. When we have moments
  without craving and clinging, we must attend to them with great care and become familiar
  with them, so that we can repeat them as often as possible. Unless we are fully aware of
  the contents of our minds, unfortunate moments may predominate. That&#146;s why one sees
  so very few happy people. Happiness is not an accident, it requires hard work.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Just as happiness is an inner condition, so peace is not a
  sheet of paper that we sign, as if it were a United Nations treaty. If it were, everybody
  would be peaceful. Peace comes about by letting go. We need to discover where we cling the
  most and then work with that, whatever it may be. For some of us this is our bodies. We
  all have to let go of them some day. It would be a good idea to prepare for that day and
  enjoy the bliss of letting go now, instead of waiting until the last moment.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We prepare ourselves in our practice by realizing moments
  of liberation. To realize signless liberation, we can fully open up to the experience of a
  single moment of impermanence, without shying away from it. To realize wishless
  liberation, we can be aware that every desire creates unsatisfactoriness and irritation,
  and let go of just one desire. If we could do that at the rate of one per day for the next
  year, we would change drastically. When we practice letting go of one desire, we can
  repeat that with the rest of them. Practice makes perfect. The first one is the most
  difficult.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To realize voidness liberation, we can experience all
  mental formations as a bombardment of electrical impulses. Some of these impulses come
  together and make absolutely no sense. If we believe in them and then relate them to
  others, we start arguing. &#147;How could anybody think like that?&#148;we say to
  ourselves. We can stop everything for a moment and just be there and experience ease and
  relief.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Seeing impermanence and unsatisfactoriness in everything
  brings us to voidness. If there is nothing that remains steady or is satisfactory, then
  there are only phenomena that have arisen through craving. For instance, this building is
  here because someone wanted a meditation hall. This person is here because somebody wanted
  a child. The karma of having been born resulted from wanting to be alive. Everything in
  existence has arisen because of craving, which is dukkha.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first instance of penetrating dukkha might create
  resistance: &#147;What&#146;s the use of it all? What am I here for?&#148; Our reason for
  being is to penetrate the truth of anicca, dukkha, and anatta and avoid repeating the
  process life after life. Do we really want to go through our whole life experience again,
  hoping to improve our performance? We will repeat our mistakes until the learning is
  completed. When we drop whatever is in our minds and experience a moment of freedom, we
  will know that nothing happens without craving. And we touch emptiness, voidness, and
  peace through penetration and insight.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We need not worry about what happens after death. We can
  attend to each moment and learn something new. Everybody has lessons to learn, and if we
  don&#146;t use each day for that, we have lived that day for no purpose. All we have done
  is kept alive (which is a losing proposition). Our whole life is intended for penetration
  into wisdom, and each day is our whole life.</font></p>
