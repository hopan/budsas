    <p>The major obstacles to successful meditation and
    liberating insight take the form of one or more of the Five
    Hindrances. The whole practice leading to Enlightenment can
    be well expressed as the effort to overcome the Five
    Hindrances, at first suppressing them temporarily in order to
    experience Jhana and Insight, and then overcoming them
    permanently through the full development of the Noble
    Eightfold Path.</p>
    <p>So, what are these Five Hindrances? They are:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>KAMACCHANDA : Sensory Desire<br>
        VYAPADA : Ill Will<br>
        THINA-MIDDHA: Sloth and Torpor<br>
        UDDHACCA-KUKKUCCA : Restlessness and Remorse<br>
        VICIKICCHA : Doubt</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>1. Sensory desire</b></font>
    refers to that particular type of wanting that seeks for
    happiness through the five senses of sight, sound, smell,
    taste and physical feeling. It specifically excludes any
    aspiration for happiness through the sixth sense of mind
    alone.</p>
    <p>In its extreme form, sensory desire is an obsession to
    find pleasure in such things as sexual intimacy, good food or
    fine music. But it also includes the desire to replace
    irritating or even painful five-sense experiences with
    pleasant ones, i.e. the desire for sensory comfort.</p>
    <p>The Lord Buddha compared sensory desire to taking out a
    loan. Any pleasure one experiences through these five senses
    must be repaid through the unpleasantness of separation, loss
    or hungry emptiness which follow relentlessly when the
    pleasure is used up. As with any loan, there is also the
    matter of interest and thus, as the Lord Buddha said, the
    pleasure is small compared to the suffering repaid.</p>
    <p>In meditation, one transcends sensory desire for the
    period by letting go of concern for this body and its five
    sense activity. Some imagine that the five senses are there
    to serve and protect the body, but the truth is that the body
    is there to serve the five senses as they play in the world
    ever seeking delight. Indeed, the Lord Buddha once said,
    &quot;<em><strong>The five senses ARE the world</strong></em>&quot;
    and to leave the world, to enjoy the other worldly bliss of
    Jhana, one must give up for a time ALL concern for the body
    and its five senses.</p>
    <p>When sensory desire is transcended, the mind of the
    meditator has no interest in the promise of pleasure or even
    comfort with this body. The body disappears and the five
    senses all switch off. The mind becomes calm and free to look
    within. The difference between the five sense activity and
    its transcendence is like the difference between looking out
    of a window and looking in a mirror. The mind that is free
    from five sense activity can truly look within and see its
    real nature. Only from that can wisdom arise as to what we
    are, from where and why?!</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>2. Ill will</b></font> refers to
    the desire to punish, hurt or destroy. It includes sheer
    hatred of a person, or even a situation, and it can generate
    so much energy that it is both seductive and addictive. At
    the time, it always appears justified for such is its power
    that it easily corrupts our ability to judge fairly. It also
    includes ill will towards oneself, otherwise known as guilt,
    which denies oneself any possibility of happiness. In
    meditation, ill will can appear as dislike towards the
    meditation object itself, rejecting it so that one's
    attention is forced to wander elsewhere.</p>
    <p>The Lord Buddha likened ill will to being sick. Just as
    sickness denies one the freedom and happiness of health, so
    ill will denies one the freedom and happiness of peace.</p>
    <p>Ill will is overcome by applying Metta, loving kindness.
    When it is ill will towards a person, Metta teaches one to
    see more in that person than all that which hurts you, to
    understand why that person hurt you (often because they were
    hurting intensely themselves), and encourages one to put
    aside one's own pain to look with compassion on the other.
    But if this is more than one can do, Metta to oneself leads
    one to refuse to dwell in ill will to that person, so as to
    stop them from hurting you further with the memory of those
    deeds. Similarly, if it is ill will towards oneself, Metta
    sees more than one's own faults, can understand one's own
    faults, and finds the courage to forgive them, learn from
    their lesson and let them go. Then, if it is ill will towards
    the mediation object (often the reason why a meditator cannot
    find peace) Metta embraces the meditation object with care
    and delight. For example, just as a mother has a natural
    Metta towards her child, so a meditator can look on their
    breath, say, with the very same quality of caring attention.
    Then it will be just as unlikely to lose the breath through
    forgetfulness as it is unlikely for a mother to forget her
    baby in the shopping mall, and it would be just as improbable
    to drop the breath for some distracting thought as it is for
    a distracted mother to drop her baby! When ill will is
    overcome, it allows lasting relationships with other people,
    with oneself and, in meditation, a lasting, enjoyable
    relationship with the meditation object, one that can mature
    into the full embrace of absorption.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>3. Sloth and torpor</b></font>
    refers to that heaviness of body and dullness of mind which
    drag one down into disabling inertia and thick depression.
    The Lord Buddha compared it to being imprisoned in a cramped,
    dark cell, unable to move freely in the bright sunshine
    outside. In meditation, it causes weak and intermittent
    mindfulness which can even lead to falling asleep in
    meditation without even realising it!</p>
    <p>Sloth and torpor is overcome by rousing energy. Energy is
    always available but few know how to turn on the switch, as
    it were. Setting a goal, a reasonable goal, is a wise and
    effective way to generate energy, as is deliberately
    developing interest in the task at hand. A young child has a
    natural interest, and consequent energy, because its world is
    so new. Thus, if one can learn to look at one's life, or
    one's meditation, with a 'beginner's mind' one can see ever
    new angles and fresh possibilities which keep one distant
    from sloth and torpor, alive and energetic. Similarly, one
    can develop delight in whatever one is doing by training
    one's perception to see the beautiful in the ordinary,
    thereby generating the interest which avoids the half-death
    that is sloth and torpor.</p>
    <p>The mind has two main functions, '<em><strong>doing</strong></em>'
    and '<em><strong>knowing</strong></em>'. The way of
    meditation is to calm the 'doing' to complete tranquillity
    while maintaining the 'knowing'. Sloth and torpor occur when
    one carelessly calms both the 'doing' and the 'knowing',
    unable to distinguish between them.</p>
    <p>Sloth and torpor is a common problem which can creep up
    and smother one slowly. A skilful meditator keeps a sharp
    look-out for the first signs of sloth and torpor and is thus
    able to spot its approach and take evasive action before it's
    too late. Like coming to a fork in a road, one can take that
    mental path leading away from sloth and torpor. Sloth and
    torpor is an unpleasant state of body and mind, too stiff to
    leap into the bliss of Jhana and too blinded to spot any
    insights. In short, it is a complete waste of precious time.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>4. Restlessness</b></font> refers
    to a mind which is like a monkey, always swinging on to the
    next branch, never able to stay long with anything. It is
    caused by the fault-finding state of mind which cannot be
    satisfied with things as they are, and so has to move on to
    the promise of something better, forever just beyond.</p>
    <p>The Lord Buddha compared restlessness to being a slave,
    continually having to jump to the orders of a tyrannical boss
    who always demands perfection and so never lets one stop.</p>
    <p>Restlessness is overcome by developing contentment, which
    is the opposite of fault-finding. One learns the simple joy
    of being satisfied with little, rather than always wanting
    more. One is grateful for this moment, rather than picking
    out its deficiencies. For instance, in meditation
    restlessness is often the impatience to move quickly on to
    the next stage. The fastest progress, though is achieved by
    those who are content with the stage they are on now. It is
    the deepening of that contentment that ripens into the next
    stage. So be careful of 'wanting to get on with it' and
    instead learn how to rest in appreciative contentment. That
    way, the 'doing' disappears and the meditation blossoms.</p>
    <p>Remorse refers to a specific type of restlessness which is
    the kammic effect of one's misdeeds. The only way to overcome
    remorse, the restlessness of a bad conscience, is to purify
    one's virtue and become kind, wise and gentle. It is
    virtually impossible for the immoral or the self indulgent to
    make deep progress in meditation.</p>
    <p><font color="#800080"><b>5. Doubt</b></font> refers to the
    disturbing inner questions at a time when one should be
    silently moving deeper. Doubt can question one's own ability
    &quot;Can I do This?&quot;, or question the method &quot;Is
    this the right way?&quot;, or even question the meaning
    &quot;What is this?&quot;. It should be remembered that such
    questions are obstacles to meditation because they are asked
    at the wrong time and thus become an intrusion, obscuring
    one's clarity.</p>
    <p>The Lord Buddha likened doubt to being lost in a desert,
    not recognising any landmarks.</p>
    <p>Such doubt is overcome by gathering clear instructions,
    having a good map, so that one can recognise the subtle
    landmarks in the unfamiliar territory of deep meditation and
    so know which way to go. Doubt in one's ability is overcome
    by nurturing self confidence with a good teacher. A
    meditation teacher is like a coach who convinces the sports
    team that they can succeed. The Lord Buddha stated that one
    can, one will, reach Jhana and Enlightenment if one carefully
    and patiently follows the instructions. The only uncertainty
    is 'when'! Experience also overcomes doubt about one's
    ability and also doubt whether this is the right path. As one
    realised for oneself the beautiful stages of the path, one
    discovers that one is indeed capable of the very highest, and
    that this is the path that leads one there.</p>
    <p>The doubt that takes the form of constant assessing
    &quot;Is this Jhana?&quot; &quot;How am I going?&quot;, is
    overcome by realising that such questions are best left to
    the end, to the final couple of minutes of the meditation. A
    jury only makes its judgement at the end of the trial, when
    all the evidence has been presented. Similarly, a skilful
    meditator pursues a silent gathering of evidence, reviewing
    it only at the end to uncover its meaning.</p>
    <p>The end of doubt, in meditation, is described by a mind
    which has full trust in the silence, and so doesn't interfere
    with any inner speech. Like having a good chauffeur, one sits
    silently on the journey out of trust in the driver.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Any problem which arises in meditation will be one of
    these Five Hindrances, or a combination. So, if one
    experiences any difficulty, use the scheme of the Five
    Hindrances as a 'check list' to identify the main problem.
    Then you will know the appropriate remedy, apply it
    carefully, and go beyond the obstacle into deeper meditation.
    </p>
    <p>When the Five Hindrances are fully overcome, there is no
    barrier between the meditator and the bliss of Jhana.
    Therefore, the certain test that these Five Hindrances are
    really overcome is the ability to access Jhana.</p>
