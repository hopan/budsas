    scholar Phra Dhammapitaka discusses the place of women in Buddhism and the challenges they
    face, and what both men and women can do to make a difference. -- <br>
    Bangkok Post - Thailand; Sep 22, 2001 - A STORY BY SANITSUDA EKACHAI</em></font><p
    align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-ooOoo-</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Calls to re-establish the Bhikkhuni-Sangha as the equal
    female counterpart to the Buddhist monkhood never fail to draw severe criticism from
    conservatives, who consider it an influence of Western feminism. But the ecclesiastical
    order cannot put off much longer giving proper consideration to the issue, considering its
    desire to win more acceptance in the course of &quot;dhamma spread'' in the West. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The arguments against the re-introduction of Bhikkhuni
    Sangha vary from traditional claims of women's spiritual inadequacy because of their
    inherent &quot;irrationality and sensitivity'' to the more concrete, practical problems of
    procedure. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to Theravada Buddhism, which governs Thailand,
    the re-emergence of Bhikkhuni is impossible simply because there are no existing Theravada
    Bhikkhuni to ordain and continue the lineage which disappeared before Buddhism was
    introduced to this country. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But as more educated women become interested in Buddhism,
    they bring with them new questions they want the clergy to answer. Among them: Where do
    women stand in Buddhism? Are women really spiritually inferior? How should women's
    struggle towards equality in religious spheres be handled? And if the re-establishment of
    Bhikkhuni ordination is impossible, what is the best alternative answer to the needs of
    religious women who want to live an ascetic life? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here are the authoritative views from Phra Dhammapitaka
    (P.A. Payutto), Thailand's highly respected monk and Buddhist scholar, whose book, Buddha
    Dhamma, is considered a gem in contemporary Thai Buddhist literature. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Apart from the Bhikkhuni controversy, the monk philosopher
    expresses his views on feminism and its strengths and weaknesses in terms of Buddhist
    thinking. He also gives advice on how society should elevate women's position in religion
    and how the Thai women's rights movement should incorporate Buddhist thinking in
    approaching problems. </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">-ooOoo-</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>- What is the status of women in Buddhism? </strong></em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is obvious. Women, in the time of the Lord Buddha,
    had inferior status. Yet he established the Bhikkhuni-Sangha as a female counterpart to
    the male Sangha. They were equally and highly respected. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For example, we have Phra Moggallana and Phra Sariputta as
    Lord Buddha's principal Bhikkhu disciples. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As for Bhikkhuni, we also have Phra Khema and Phra
    Uppalavanna, whose excellence was on a par with that of the Bhikkhu disciples. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There were many other highly capable and wise Bhikkhuni.
    So, there is no question about women's spiritual ability to achieve Nirvana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, if we study the origin of Bhikkhuni, we will know
    that it did not come about without difficulty. And it was with great reluctance that Lord
    Buddha agreed to the ordination of women. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The question of women's ordination has to be looked at on
    two levels, spiritually and socially. Spiritually, Lord Buddha conceded that women, too,
    can achieve Nirvana and it was for this reason alone that he finally ordained Bhikkhuni,
    although at a social cost. Socially, women's ordination had the capability to weaken
    Buddhism because it made the religion, which was still young at the time, an easy target
    of attack. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are also special problems springing from the nature
    of womanhood itself that make it more difficult and dangerous for women to live an ascetic
    life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The host of complicated rules and regulations for
    Bhikkhunis were formulated in recognition of these difficulties. In the early phase, the
    Bhikkhuni roamed the forests alone in search of tranquillity, like the monks. But they
    were attacked. Lord Buddha then had to set rules requiring the Bhikkhunis to live in
    temples together with the monks. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because of such difficulties resulting from social
    factors, Lord Buddha had to establish various preconditions for women who wanted to be
    ordained. As I see it, it was his own cautious way of making women realise the difficulty
    that lay ahead of them, and of ensuring the Bhikkhuni's own institutional strength. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Historically, however, the Bhikkhunis did not last very
    long. This may have been caused partly by the war-related disasters which had almost
    entirely swept the Bhikkhu from the Indian subcontinent. In Sri Lanka, the line of
    Theravada Buddhism was also once severed because of wars with Portugal. To continue the
    lineage, they had to summon Thai Theravada monks to perform the ordination. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the historical reality that we have to work with.
    In principle, women can be ordained since they, too, can reach the ultimate truth. We once
    had Bhikkhuni and they proved to be highly able. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>- Today we have fewer problems regarding
    safety and women are enjoying a better status. What do you think should be done to help
    women who want to devote themselves to an ordained life? </strong></em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Our ancestors faced the same question. That is why we have
    nuns as an alternative. Nunhood was established to answer the need of religious women who
    want to live their lives in search of spiritual truth when there were no Theravada
    Bhikkhuni left to ordain them. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nuns don white robes and shave their heads to distinguish
    themselves from lay people. But socially, they are not seen as the equals of monks. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lately, however the image of the nuns has suffered. They
    are generally thought of as heartbroken women seeking refuge or as down-and-outs with
    nowhere to go, using the nun's garb as a pretext to beg. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the problem that we have to solve. We have to
    elevate the status of nuns through educational assistance and institutional strength. Or,
    we can choose to set up a totally new institution like our ancestors did when they
    established nunhood. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In any case, even after organisational and educational
    improvements, nuns, in the Theravada sect, cannot be considered as equals to monks. As for
    those who are struggling for such status, there is still the alternative of ordination in
    the Mahayana sect. To be a Bhikkhuni is still possible. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>- What do you think of the appropriateness of
    bringing up the issue of Bhikkhuni at the present time? </strong></em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's their right to do so. The problem is that if they are
    ordained in the Mahayana sect, they will be treated as such. It is like being a Chinese
    Buddhist monk in Thailand. But they cannot use the Mahayana ordination to make them
    Bhikkhuni under the Theravada observance. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is where the problem arises. As I see it, we should
    accept the facts realistically. If we are ordained in the Mahayana faith, so be it. We
    must rely on our own practices and behaviour to win respect and recognition from the
    public. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>- It was reported there have been some
    movements in the West to raise this issue and that those involved have already contacted
    some high-ranking monks in Thailand to ask for advice. </strong></em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I don't know very much about this. I've heard, however,
    that women were also ordained in the temples in England, But they are called by a
    different name, not Bhikkhuni. This is one of the efforts to set up a new institution to
    answer women's religious needs. It is like our own nunhood but now under several different
    names such as &quot;Dasasila-Mata'', meaning the mother with 10 precepts, or another group
    called &quot;Sila-carini''. Such efforts are normal. When there exists a real need on the
    part of women to live an ascetic life and they cannot be Bhikkhuni, new institutions are
    set up. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So far, this new institution has not proven very
    successful in Thailand, but that might not be the case in England where the social
    environment is different. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The question of Bhikkhuni is twofold, involving both
    spiritual ability and social acceptance. The lack of social acceptance and the implicit
    unequal status, however, does not affect women's spiritual capability. In some places
    where social conditions are more favourable towards women, social acceptance of women's
    ordination can be a lot easier. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>- Do you personally support the ordination of
    women? </strong></em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I agree with the setting up of an appropriate institution.
    I myself think that there should be some reconsideration of this issue if there exists a
    real need for women to lead a clerical life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, this is not something that can be decided in
    haste. It needs cautious consideration of all the positive and negative factors. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>- What do you think is better in terms of
    social acceptance, nunhood or the setting up of a new organisation under a new name? </strong></em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The improvement of nunhood is more effective in terms of
    social acceptance because it would be the continuation of a tradition. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The situations in Thailand and abroad are different. Over
    there, they can set up a new institution because the whole thing is new. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But no matter what it is called, it can be considered as
    one form of nunhood although they do not wear white robes. In Thailand, some groups of
    nuns also wear saffron robes. But this is still seen as another development of traditional
    nuns. This feeling of traditional continuity makes it easier to win acceptance from the
    more conservative sector of Thai society. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Besides, we should also consider if the setting up of a
    new institution apart from nunhood might lead to subsequent factionalisation and
    disharmony. The institutional improvement of nunhood, however, can include both the old
    and the new and maintain religious harmony. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>- To what extent has the ecclesiastical
    hierarchy given assistance to Buddhist nuns? </strong></em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A: The nuns have received very little official support.
    However, there have been efforts to raise the status of nuns through such means as the
    setting up of the Nun Institution of Thailand at Wat Bovorn Nives Temple. Nuns can receive
    an education up to the level of Parien Nine (the highest level that monks can study). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The improvement of nuns' image and status is necessary to
    win public acceptance. There should be no beggar nuns left. Meanwhile, the nuns must be
    well educated and knowledgeable. Actually, there are many highly able nuns right now.
    Their knowledge in the Abhidhamma (high level dhamma) is even sought after by monks. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Self-improvement and dignified behaviour are necessary to
    correct the tainted image. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But to be frank, monks are also not free of criticism on
    grounds of inappropriate behaviour. The image of the monks is also tainted, not only that
    of the nun. It takes a lot of work to correct this. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Apart from self-improvement on the nuns' part, society,
    too, must help, especially as regards laws. At present, the status of nuns has not yet
    been legally recognised. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>- Do you think the new generation of women who
    are conscious of women's rights will be disillusioned with Buddhism if they are denied an
    equal opportunity to enter religious life? </strong></em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is no need to feel that way. The problem is not that
    difficult. We only have to look at where the problem lies and solve it. In this case, it
    comes from society. Since the problem arises from the lack of social acceptance and from
    unfavourable social conditions _ we only have to find social means to correct it. Women's
    spiritual capacity is not in question. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>- How would you analyse the problem of
    male/female relationships and their consequent conflicts? </strong></em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The problem is threefold. Firstly, biological difference.
    Secondly, social values and conditions. And thirdly, the spiritual and mental aspect,
    including one's capabilities. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is no question on the third point. For women, too,
    can reach ultimate Truth and become &quot;Phra Arahant'' (enlightened ones). But even Phra
    Arahant cannot remove themselves from the world. That's why we have to take into account
    what determines our place in society. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nature and social conditions are correlated. Women's
    biological nature has placed them socially at a disadvantage. And because of this
    biological predestination, it is more difficult for women than men to live a life that is
    free and independent from society. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>- According to feminist thinking, differences
    between women and men mainly come from culture and socialisation. </strong></em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But the truth of biological difference is indisputable.
    Women are childbearers. And women are immediately in a different social position for this
    reason alone. Women have to be constantly cautious whenever and wherever they go because
    they are easy targets of attack. Even today, when society has made much progress in other
    difficult areas, this problem of women's safety has not been solved. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>- There are arguments that given the dynamic
    social changes and technological advances of recent years, the sharp division of sex roles
    is already blurred, and because of this change women's roles, including those in religion,
    should be reconsidered. </strong></em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I have read articles about the women's rights movement. I
    think it is going too far if men and women are busy fighting over their own self-interests
    and becoming enemies instead of cooperating for the common good of their children. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>- How is the problem of women's rights seen
    from the point of view of Buddhism? </strong></em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is simply seen from reality, from what is. For example,
    we have to look at women's actual social and biological conditions realistically. However,
    I think society has improved so much that the use of physical force to maintain power is
    decreasing, which effects the relationship of men and women. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Changes are needed to fit the new social reality. If
    society is less violent, women's status will be better and make their ascetic life easier.
    All is inter-related. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>- Do you think that campaigns to correct
    social injustices, especially the women's rights movement, are still hampered by emotional
    considerations? </strong></em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is still a problem. But it is also understandable. It
    is natural that men, or any other human group, will hold on to their privileges and will
    not want to see their interests compromised. But among them, there must be some with good
    intentions who want to cooperate in bringing about change. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Also, the end should be consistent with the means. If we
    are pursuing a virtuous goal, the means must also be virtuous. Anger and hatred only evoke
    strong reactions that will only make our efforts to change things more difficult. More
    often than not, we still rely on dominance and aggression to solve problems. This
    ironically shows that humans have not made much progress in this sense. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>- Does that mean the use of united force and
    bargaining are still necessary then, given the selfish nature of human beings? </strong></em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Our means should help develop society at the same time,
    that is, to help create a society where problems are solved through wisdom and peaceful
    means. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But this is often easier said than done. From what I've
    observed, even the women's rights movement is focusing on the conflict of interests
    between men and women. It has become a battle. This is but one such form of struggle. The
    enlightened path is to use reason and rationality. We need to clarify and point out where
    the inequality lies or what injustices should be corrected, then clarify the negative
    social consequences brought about by women's inequality. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>- Which Buddhist values do you think can be
    used in staging consciousness-raising campaigns on women's human rights? </strong></em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All. But the first and foremost is not to let ourselves be
    dominated by emotions. Apart from rationality, the movement should be based on compassion
    beyond our own interests for the good of society. The women's rights movement should also
    integrate compassion for men by encouraging people to help one another to have a better
    life together. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The use of force to bargain may still be a necessary
    strategy given the awareness that human beings are still not that developed. But it will
    be better if we use it as sparingly as possible so that we may help raise the standards of
    our society. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To improve the status of women in religious life can be
    done through many peaceful means such as education, image improvement, and endorsing their
    legal status. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>- Won't the establishment of Bhikkhuni-Sangha
    help strengthen and spread the Lord Buddha's teachings? </strong></em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A: Yes. Even today when women cannot be ordained, they are
    already strong supporters of Buddhism. There are several women who are very knowledgeable
    in the Abhidhamna. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It must be stressed, however, that we should not let
    efforts to improve the status of women develop into a conflict of interests which will
    trigger clashes and the use of emotions. The best way is to aim for higher good out of
    compassion for society, especially compassion for women, which also means a better life
    for men and women together. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>- What is Your Reverend's opinion on the
    changing of men's attitudes to keep up with the changing role of women? </strong></em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Men must admit that the social situation now is no longer
    the same, and that it calls for some adaptation on their part. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the old days, physical protection for women was
    important, and that fact partly accounts for male dominance in society. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But society is changing vastly. There is more social
    safety, and reason is more important than force. The development of women's status has to
    go hand in hand with the development toward a non-violent society. If not, women and men
    will find themselves being enemies instead of helping one another toward a better life.
    Parents should think about what they must do for the good of their own children, and not
    be obsessed with being equals. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>- There are some arguments that women's
    sacrifices have been so long emphasised that a woman's assertion of her rights is seen as
    selfishness. </strong></em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We have to look carefully at how culture permutates and
    advances. Culture is partly determined by the natural biological differences between men
    and women. Culture was not created only to please one segment of people in society.
    However, the stronger use their physical advantages to exploit the weak, which leads to an
    unequal relationship. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To solve the problem, we should not deny biological
    reality. But a stronger group should not take advantage of a weaker. This is the key, the
    rearrangement of relations. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In order to understand the problem of women's rights, we
    should take into account the three facets of the problem, biological, social and
    spiritual. They cannot be isolated from one another. The problem can be solved through
    compassion. Men, given their better position, should even be more compassionate and try to
    give women more opportunities. This is because, in terms of dhamma, when we admit that men
    and women could achieve the ultimate truth spiritually, a good society is, therefore, a
    society which gives opportunities for everyone to reach this potential. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>- In your opinion, what is the ideal
    relationship between men and women? </strong></em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It must be based on mutual compassion. Men should think
    what can be done to help women further their personal growth and fulfil their potential. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>- What do you think about women's equality? </strong></em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Equality should not be the end in itself. It should only
    be seen as a means or a factor to help men and women to live a life in which they are both
    able to achieve their spiritual potential and to reach the ultimate truth together. </font></p>
