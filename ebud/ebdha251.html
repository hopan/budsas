      <P>Details or Transcript:</P>
      </FONT>
      <P>Ajahn Brahm</B> of the Thai Forest Tradition is the Abbot of Bodhinyana 
      Monastery in Western Australia - a retreat for many a weary traveller and 
      roaming Buddhist. <B>Gil Alon</B> is a Zen Roshi who travels the world as 
      a theatre director and drama coach, and for whom Zen is the perfect 
      philosophy for life on stage.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> How different can two Buddhists be? Hello, I’m 
      Rachael Kohn and this is The Spirit of Things on ABC Radio National. A 
      Forest Monk and a Zen Roshi; the first prefers the tranquillity of a rural 
      monastery; the other takes his tranquillity to the stage, where he acts 
      and directs theatre.</P>
      <P>In fact, this is one of the exercises that Israeli-born Zen Roshi Gil 
      Alon teaches his acting students.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Gil Alon:</B> One of the very basic Buddhist ideas which is not only 
      Buddhist, but we use it as an example, they talk about the one-ness, the 
      one-ness that everything is one, everyone is one, and of course you can 
      talk about it for hours, but if you do not experience it, it’s worthless. 
      So one of the exercises I ask my students to find a partner, each one to 
      find a partner and seat one in front of the other, folded legs, holding 
      hands in a very relaxed way, and for something like 10 or 15 minutes, just 
      to stare at their partner’s eyes. That’s it. And immediately they are 
      embarrassed, and it’s difficult because we don’t do it usually. </P>
      <P>And I ask them not to talk while they’re doing it, not to look in other 
      directions, not to make funny faces and not to move with the background 
      music that I play, but I tell them surprisingly you are allowed to laugh, 
      because laughter is out of embarrassment, so when laughter is coming just 
      laugh it out until its finished. But in one condition: don’t use the 
      laughter to remove your eyes from your partner’s eyes, just laugh into his 
      eyes or her eyes. </P>
      <P>And then after five minutes or so, it comes down, and people experience 
      the real one-ness, because just staring into the other eyes for a certain 
      time without removing your eyes, you discover endless depths of mutual 
      one-ness. And then when they share what they’ve been through, each couple 
      can tell you a different story, but they all share the experience of this 
      one-ness. This is only one example.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> How does that help in the acting situation?</P>
      <B>
      <P>Gil Alon:</B> It helps, according to my perception of acting, that they 
      start to drop judgements, they start to drop competition because real 
      acting, real creativity on stage happens only when you give yourself 
      totally to your partner, and the partner is giving himself totally to you, 
      and you both give yourself totally to the objects on stage and to the 
      audience. And then creativity appears, not by competition, not by trying 
      to show off or all these kinds of things. This is my perception.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> I remember doing one of those exercises; once you 
      stop thinking you’ll go crazy, it’s quite good. That was Gil Alon, and 
      later in the program we’ll hear how one of Israel’s television 
      personalities became a Zen Roshi, off and on the stage.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">* * *</P>
      <P>Finding peace in the fast lane of the entertainment world is quite 
      different from the kind of life that Ajahn Brahmavamso chose as a young 
      man. Born in London and educated in Theoretical Physics at Cambridge 
      University, he became a Buddhist monk in the Thai Forest tradition of 
      Ajahn Chah. Now the Abbot of Bodhinyana Monastery, in Serpentine, Western 
      Australia, he’s in demand as a speaker and is known for his story telling.</P>
      <P>Although simplicity is the essence of monastic life, and that’s 
      particularly so in the rural setting of Serpentine, the whole point of 
      Buddhist insight is to find tranquillity in the midst of chaos. And that’s 
      how it was when I c aught up with Ajahn Brahm in the Bodhikusuma Buddhist 
      and Meditation Centre located in the noisy inner city suburb of 
      Chippendale in Sydney, where the transport trucks rumbled by just outside 
      the door.</P>
      <P>Ajahn Brahm, you’ve been a monk for some years now, was it when you 
      were 23?</P>
      <B>
      <P>Ajahn Bramavanso:</B> When I was 23, I decided I’d had enough of the 
      world and became a monk. I used to be a schoolteacher before, and that’s 
      enough to make anyone leave the world and become a monk.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> Now I thought you had been studying physics at 
      Cambridge University.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Ajahn Bramavanso:</B> Yes, that was before I became a schoolteacher. I 
      thought I’d do something good with my life, instead of making bombs or 
      things like that. And so I decided to try schoolteaching. However, after a 
      while the whole feeling for a monastic life, or for something spiritual, 
      was very strong inside of me. And one of the lovely things about Buddhist 
      monastic life, in the Thai tradition was you can become a monk just for a 
      short time.</P>
      <P>So I decided I would take a couple of years off my career life, and 
      then go off to Thailand, become a monk, get it out of my system, and then 
      go back to the world again. But once I became a monk, something happened 
      very quickly that I realised that’s what I always wanted to do, I felt so 
      comfortable in the role of a monk.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> Were you actually taking refuge as it were, away from 
      the school life, I mean teaching children? What was it that really made 
      you take quite a radical step.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Ajahn Bramavanso:</B> OK, what really made me take that step was a 
      realisation that deep inside there was much more to life than just getting 
      on in one’s career or in relationships. Perhaps one of the most moving 
      experiences in my life was one of my first meditation retreats. I did get 
      into a very deep state of meditation, which was so joyful, it was so much 
      bliss. And that never left me, and I wanted to find out what exactly that 
      meant and how it fits in to the scheme of things. So that degree of deep 
      meditation was something which changed a lot of perspectives on the 
      meaning of life. I wanted to explore those perspectives more, and that 
      could only be done in monastic life.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> Well the description you give of life in Thailand 
      doesn’t exactly sound joyful. I mean you spent a lot of time building 
      monasteries, in fact I think it totals to about 20 years building 
      monasteries, in rather difficult circumstances.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Ajahn Bramavanso:</B> It was difficult physically, building the 
      monasteries, but there was always a lot of fun around, and it was done 
      joyfully. For example one of my stories was when we were building the main 
      hall in my teacher Ajahn Chah’s monastery, there was a lot of earth left 
      over and we had to move that earth from one place to another because Ajahn 
      Chah, my teacher, said it didn’t look good over there. </P>
      <P>It took three whole days of very hard work from 9 o’clock in the 
      morning until about 10pm with hardly any breaks. We’d already eaten our 
      meal for the day, and that was one day after the other in the tropical 
      heat. When we were finished, we were very happy but then Ajahn Chah left 
      for another monastery. The following morning, his deputy abbot came up to 
      us and said he thought the soil was in the wrong place and we had to move 
      it. So for another three days we moved it to another spot, and again I was 
      very happy when it was all finished.</P>
      <P>But the next day, Ajahn Chah came back and he said, ‘What did you put 
      the soil over there for, I told you to leave it over here.’ And so for 
      another three days we had to move the soil again. And of course by this 
      time I was getting very angry and upset. And being a Westerner, in an 
      Asian monastery, I could swear in English without anyone understanding. 
      But they did understand because they could see my body language.</P>
      <P>And I always remember one monk coming up to me and saying, ‘It’s 
      pushing the wheelbarrow is easy, it’s the thinking about it which is 
      hard.’ And that’s changed the whole perspective of what I was doing. As 
      soon as I stopped complaining and moaning, it was easy to push that 
      wheelbarrow, in fact it felt much lighter. And this is actually how I 
      learned about the secrets, one of the secrets, of monastic life. Didn’t 
      matter what you were doing, whether you were sitting for hours and hours 
      and hours in your hut, whether you were working building a monastery, 
      there’s a thinking about it which made it hard.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> Well it also sounds like one of the secrets of 
      monastic life is learning how to take orders. I mean it’s positively 
      torture, isn’t it? to be told to do one thing and then to undo it and then 
      re-do it again?</P>
      <B>
      <P>Ajahn Bramavanso:</B> Well sometimes. If you look from my perspective 
      it seems like it should be, look for another perspective, it wasn’t at 
      all. It was just again, one can make anything torture, one could make sort 
      of eating torture, or being interviewed torture, but it’s one’s attitude 
      which is the most important thing, and this is one of the things you 
      really found in monastic life, it’s how you approached it. And a lot of 
      times you had a choice. If you were going to keep those old silly ways of 
      looking at life, then you would suffer. But if you actually changed the 
      way you looked at life, in other words you did learn some wisdom, you find 
      it was no problem at all.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> Were you always interested in your attitude to 
      things? I mean were you always a kind of perfectionist, to try to find 
      just the right sort of happiness, because when I think of happiness and 
      most of us are quite content with some happiness and some unhappiness, you 
      know the combination is what life delivers in most cases. But you seem to 
      be going for the kind of almost magical solution to find happiness in all 
      things.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Ajahn Bramavanso:</B> Correct, yes, because I always thought that the 
      search for happiness is the underlying force of life. No matter what we’re 
      doing in our world, in our life, it’s always a search for some sort of 
      happiness. Then again, one of those early experiences of deep bliss in 
      meditation gave me a taste of some happiness which was out of this world. 
      And so once you’ve tasted that you wanted to make even a deeper search 
      into the meaning of happiness. </P>
      <P>The meaning of happiness is the meaning of life. And so it wasn’t just 
      the meaning of happiness in meditation, it was also the meaning of 
      happiness in anything you were doing. Because even sometimes your body 
      gave you orders in saying, ‘Now you have to sleep’ or ‘Now you have to be 
      sick’ or ‘Now you can’t do what you want’. So it didn’t matter whether 
      there was something else in life which stopped you doing what you wanted 
      to do. That was like the orders of life, and you had a chance there to 
      actually let go, to surrender to the moment when you can’t change things, 
      and be content. And that’s one of the wonderful things which I found in 
      Buddhist practice. You can be happy, no matter what’s going on.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> In fact you tell a story about going to a prison and 
      speaking to prisoners, where you described your life to them, and they’re 
      so shocked, they actually say, ‘Gee, come and live with us, it’s a lot 
      nicer here than a monastic life’. In fact stories are quite important to 
      you, in the way that you communicate.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Ajahn Bramavanso:</B> Life is lived in stories, not in thoughts. 
      Thoughts are almost like a second-hand report of what actually happens in 
      your life. So if you can take the stories of life and illustrate from them 
      the meanings of life, I think people can relate to it much more easily. So 
      I like those stories. </P>
      <P>Just to actually complete that story which you only mentioned in part 
      when one of my monks, it wasn’t myself, another monk was teaching in jail, 
      after the session they asked him about what it was like in a Buddhist 
      monastery in the West, and we told him we get up so early in the morning, 
      3 o’clock in the morning and then we have to go to this cold hall to sit 
      for hours cross-legged, meditating, and doing some chanting. And then only 
      afterwards, maybe at 6.30, we might get a cup of tea, and then you have to 
      work for three or four hours, hard work, before you can get some lunch. 
      And that lunch is just what you’re given, you’ve got no choice, and it’s 
      all eaten in one bowl, all mixed together. So it’s not very delicious at 
      all. And in the afternoon it’s usually more work in those days. And then 
      you can’t watch the television, there is no television or radio, and you 
      can’t follow sport, you can’t play sports, you can’t play music or listen 
      to music. There’s no movies to watch, and there’s nothing in the evening, 
      you can’t eat in the evening, except just to go to the main hall and to 
      sit in more meditation, cross-legged on the hard floor for hours, and when 
      you do go back to your hut to sleep, it’s on the floor, in the cold. </P>
      <P>And so when I said this, or when this monk said this, the prisoners 
      were very shocked, and this is when one of the prisoners forgot where they 
      were and said, ‘That’s disgusting, that’s terrible, that’s awful; why 
      don’t you monks come and live in here with us, in the jail?’ which was 
      crazy, they forgot where they were. But the important part of that story 
      was the reason why my monks and other people who visit the monastery like 
      to stay there, and it’s because they’re content, they don’t look upon a 
      monastery as a prison, simply because it’s where they want to be. Whereas 
      prisoners in a jail, because they don’t want to be there, therefore it is 
      a prison.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> It’s all about freedom, isn’t it, about our 
      perspective on freedom, what constitutes freedom. I mean when I think 
      about what constitutes freedom for me, it’s spontaneity, it’s learning, 
      it’s choice. What is it for you?</P>
      <B>
      <P>Ajahn Bramavanso:</B> Well there’s two types of freedom. The freedom of 
      desire and the freedom from desire, and most people in the world only know 
      the freedom of desire, the freedom of choice. In Buddhism, especially in 
      meditation, we’re looking at the freedom from choice, the freedom from 
      desire. </P>
      <P>So one is so content, so at peace, that desires don’t come up. One is 
      free from the tyranny of these desires always pushing or pulling you, and 
      telling you what to do. And it’s those are the orders which are coming 
      from inside of each one of us, ordering us to be somehow different, 
      ordering the pain to go away, ordering us to achieve some sort of goal, 
      which we don’t really know why we’re reaching for this, but we’re supposed 
      to do it. So these are the orders which in meditation we’re becoming free 
      of.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> Did you always know why you were reaching for this 
      goal to be a Buddhist monk, to be an abbot.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Ajahn Bramavanso:</B> No, an abbot just happened by bad luck, but being 
      an Buddhist monk, I’d always had an inclination, that even though you saw 
      many, many people who had so many things, that they did seem to have the 
      opportunity to live their dreams, their dreams never stopped, they were 
      never free from this, always reaching out, this stretching, this hunger, 
      this thirst, and that hunger, that thirst, like any hungry person or 
      thirsty person, is not all that comfortable. Sometimes we want to end 
      thirst, we want to end hunger and be satisfied forever, but that never 
      seemed to happen. But when I came across some Buddhist monks, they were 
      the happiest people I’d ever seen. </P>
      <P>They appeared to be free, and even though that many wealthy people, 
      successful people in the world, they are looked upon as being icons, 
      looked upon as being people we try and emulate. If you actually asked 
      them, or interview them and ask the question ‘Do you really feel free?’ 
      then I think they would give some very interesting answers. But if you ask 
      a monk who lives in a monastery with many rules, and many things you can’t 
      do, if you ask a monk ‘Do you feel free?’ actually the feeling is freedom. 
      So the ideas of freedom, the freedom of desire and the freedom from 
      desire, in our modern world, we’ve got so much liberty to follow our 
      desires and actually achieve those desires, basically we can do almost 
      anything we want. But how many people feel free?</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> It all depends on what we expect from life. I know 
      that your message is often about happiness, and how the point of life is 
      kind of like that song, ‘Don’t Worry, Be Happy’, which is all about 
      changing one’s attitude, not really about changing the world. And yet you 
      would know, that that kind of an attitude can also be breeding a certain 
      indifference to the world.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Ajahn Bramavanso:</B> OK, well I don’t think this relates to 
      indifference at all, because many people change their attitude and the 
      world changes with it. </P>
      <P>Now the attitude of anger, of trying to get rid of problems, is like 
      the attitude to the pest exterminator, and the attitude of the pest 
      exterminator is instead of trying to live with nature, he always wanted 
      control and eliminate all those things which create problem for us, and 
      that could be a husband or a wife or it could be sort of some enemy which 
      we perceive as being our pest. And you find you can’t eliminate all the 
      pests in the world, nor can you eliminate the pests in your own body, like 
      cancers and other sicknesses. Nor can you eliminate the pests in the 
      world. Some time there comes a time to learn how to leave at peace and in 
      harmony with nature.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> Does Buddhism ever teach a resistance to things which 
      are dangerous, which are bad, which are evil?</P>
      <B>
      <P>Ajahn Bramavanso:</B> Yes, we teach a resistance to anger, we teach a 
      resistance to jealousies, we teach a resistance to stupidity. Those are 
      the things which we should really be resisting, you know, the anger and 
      the feelings of revenge, the hurt, the grief, the guilt inside of us, all 
      those negative emotions which make our world. Those are the things which 
      we want to resist, to understand, to overcome, by letting go. And so those 
      things aren’t there any more.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> I like the story that you tell about the lecturer who 
      comes into the classroom and brings a jar full of rocks. Can you tell that 
      story?</P>
      <B>
      <P>Ajahn Bramavanso:</B> OK, yes, that’s actually from the internet, so 
      many of your listeners will probably know that one, but it’s a good story. 
      There was a lecturer at a university who was showing just how broad his 
      wisdom was, and instead of reading out his lecture notes one morning, he 
      came with a big jar and put it on his desk. And while everybody in his 
      class was wondering what he was up to, he started to put in some stones 
      from a bag, one by one, into the jar until he could get no more in. And 
      once he could get no more stones into his jar, he asked his class ‘Is the 
      jar full?’ and the class said, ‘Yes, it is.’ </P>
      <P>He smiled, and from under the desk he got out another bag, and that bag 
      was full of gravel, small stones and one by one he managed to fit those 
      small stones in the spaces between the big rocks. And once he could get no 
      more small stones in, he looked up at his class and asked ‘Is the jar 
      full?’ Now they all shook their heads and said, ‘No’. They were on to him 
      by now. And so he smiled and got another bag, of sand. He poured that sand 
      on top of the big rocks and small rocks, shook the jar, much of the sand 
      went into the spaces between the big rocks and small rocks. After he could 
      get no more sand in, he asked once more, ‘Is the jar full?’ And gain the 
      class said ‘No’. And he got some water and poured that in. And after he 
      could get no more water in, he stopped, he asked the class, ‘What am I 
      trying to prove? What is the purpose of this demonstration?’ </P>
      <P>Now this was a business school, so one of the students in the class put 
      up their hand and said, ‘Sir, it shows to us that no matter how busy our 
      schedule, we can always fit something more in.’ And he said, ‘No, no, no, 
      that’s not what I’m trying to show. What I’m trying to show is if you want 
      to fit the big rocks in, you have to fit them in first. Don’t leave them 
      to the last, otherwise you will never get them in.’ It was a story about 
      priorities, what you should really fit in to your schedule of your day, of 
      your life first of all. </P>
      <P>So there are some things which many people realise are the precious 
      stones, the big rocks of their life, like their family, like their 
      relationships, like their peace of mind, whatever it is, and sometimes we 
      leave them till last in our day, in our week, in our life, we find we 
      never have the opportunity to fit them in. And that’s one of the reasons 
      why people don’t find happiness. Their priorities are not correct. We 
      should always remember that story of the stones in the jar, and put into 
      our life what’s very, very important first of all. The other things you 
      can always fit in, but later.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> Ajahn Brahm, are there any more things that you want 
      to fit into your jar?</P>
      <B>
      <P>Ajahn Bramavanso:</B> Fit into the jar? Just peace and happiness for 
      myself and for others. I mean after all, that’s what’s most important to 
      me in my life, is the happiness of myself and the happiness of others, but 
      what I found after many years of life as a monk, I cannot distinguish 
      between the happiness of others and the happiness of myself. So that’s why 
      I go out and serve as much as possible, to give talks, to tell stupid 
      stories to make them laugh.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> You’re very good at it.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Ajahn Bramavanso:</B> Thanks very much.</P>
      <I>
      <P>[MUSIC...]</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> Ajahn Brahm, we’re sitting in front of what looks to 
      be a fairly traditional altar I suppose, with the great Golden Buddha in 
      the centre, and lots of lotus flowers around. Can you explain the 
      symbolism of this?</P>
      <B>
      <P>Ajahn Bramavanso:</B> Yes certainly. I mean we have at the very top 
      there, a golden Buddha sitting in meditation with a bit of a smile on his 
      face, and obviously that’s a symbol of peace, and when people see images 
      like that, it’s meant to engender a very soft and gentle feeling inside of 
      them of peace. We have the candles on the sides of the Buddha, that’s 
      always been like the symbol of wisdom, because you have to light a candle 
      to dispel the darkness, and for a long time that has been a symbol of 
      enlightenment, so the wisdom is there, no-one owns wisdom, but we need to 
      have a candle in order to actually see it for ourselves.</P>
      <P>We have also on our shrine here, the lotus. The lotus is also a very 
      potent symbol of Buddhism. Some of the lotuses we have there are 
      ornamental, with many, many leaves on them, many petals, which is a symbol 
      of the thousand petalled lotus, which is one of my favourite symbols for 
      meditation, because to open the petals of a lotus, it means that the sun 
      has to maintain its warmth on the thousandth petal before that opens up to 
      reveal the 999th petal, and the sun has to stay on that thousand petal 
      lotus a long time before it starts to open up the innermost petals. </P>
      <P>The innermost petals of a lotus are the most fragrant, the most subtle 
      and the most beautiful, and if you’re lucky, and the sun maintains its 
      warmth long enough, then the heart of the lotus can really open up and you 
      can see what is called the jewel in the heart of the lotus. That is the 
      very old mantra in Tibetan Buddhism, <I>om mani padme hum</I>, Hail to the 
      jewel in the heart of the lotus. It’s a symbol for meditation because you 
      have to have mindfulness, unremitting, without any interference or 
      stopping for a long time, to open up this thousand petalled lotus of your 
      mind and to see what’s truly inside, the jewel in the heart of you.</P>

      <P>[CHANTING/MUSIC/GONGS ...]</P>
      </I><B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> Gil Alon is an Israeli-born entertainer, who started 
      earning his living as an actor from the age of 16. He had an unusual but 
      very popular television show for 8 years which you’ll hear about. But his 
      main work is now as a director and acting coach. In the midst of all this, 
      Gil Alon is a Zen Roshi in the Soto School of Buddhism.</P>
      <P>His interest in Buddhism was sparked by a collection of Chinese stories 
      that he read at the age of 21. </P>
      <P>Well to make him feel at home, I met Gil in a rehearsal studio down in 
      the Sydney Wharf Theatre Complex under the Harbour Bridge. There he told 
      me about the unexpected appeal of those Chinese stories.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Gil Alon:</B> I don’t think it’s something logical. There were sort of 
      what they call <I>koans</I>, you know, pointless stories, so-called. I 
      think I was puzzled by the fact that although I didn’t understand them, it 
      didn’t bother me that I don’t understand them. Which was unique, because I 
      have to understand, and somehow with these stories, I said, OK, I have no 
      idea, no clue what is the meaning of these stories, so fine, OK.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> So was it something in the challenge of being an 
      actor that made you turn again, once again, to those stories?</P>
      <B>
      <P>Gil Alon:</B> Well later on, yes, but first of all, as looking for 
      means to quieten the hectic life of an actor was the first reason to look 
      for something to be relaxed, to find kind of technique, meditation or 
      whatever. Because I knew that my schedule daily started at 7 in the 
      morning, ends 1 o’clock after midnight. And I loved it so much, but I 
      wanted to find the way to continue this kind of schedule, but with 
      tranquillity. Then when I found the Japanese Zen meditation, it was again 
      very natural for me.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> What did your Zen training involve?</P>
      <B>
      <P>Gil Alon:</B> Well first of all when I started to look for something, I 
      discovered that one of the alternative medicine colleges in Israel opened 
      a Zen and High Awareness Department. So I went there and I started to 
      study, and there was immediate contact between me and the leader teacher 
      there because we had lots of teachers and we had kind of introduction, 
      including all kinds of spiritual paths which are not Zen Buddhism. That’s 
      how we got glimpse and opened windows to all other kinds of disciplines.
      </P>
      <P>So it was immediate contact between me and the leader teacher who was a 
      Korean monk for seven years in a Korean monastery. Then gradually, as his 
      disciple, I became his assistant and then when he could not attend the 
      classes, one day he told me, ‘This is your time, now you take it.’ And I 
      had to face the class. And then he took me with him to other parts of 
      Israel where he would teach and yes, gradually it started to develop.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> But becoming a Zen Roshi is fairly demanding; did you 
      think that you’d be able to maintain your acting career as well as being a 
      Zen Roshi?</P>
      <B>
      <P>Gil Alon:</B> Well I didn’t mean to, it happened. You know, when I 
      started to travel and to study in other countries, because I was 
      interested in other kinds of Buddhism, and finally when I arrived to Japan 
      I found the master and this master, being recommended by my teacher in 
      Israel, and when I found this 83-years-old Japanese Master, again it was 
      immediate contact, and something was very strong there. But again, I was 
      there to study, that’s it. So he has a centre which has no discipline, 
      which I like so much.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> What do you mean ‘has no discipline’? Surely all 
      Buddhism has some form of meditation and study.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Gil Alon:</B> They have the formal Zazen meditation which is the 
      meditation that if you don’t know nothing about it, the nun who’s taking 
      care of this centre will show you once how to do it, then they leave you 
      alone, they have four times a day in a regular day, official times for 
      meditation, but nobody forces you, it’s up to you how many times you 
      meditate, how much time you spend in the library studying, and how many 
      hours you spend with the Master, it’s up to you, and this is what I like, 
      because I don’t like people telling me what to do. So when I have a free 
      frame, I do more. So I spent hours upon hours with my Master, nagging him, 
      asking, asking, and nagging, and then I understood that I’m going to 
      convert, and I took the Buddhist precepts and became officially Buddhist 
      and continued to be with him.</P>
      <P>And suddenly one day, he said, ‘OK if you want Dharma transmission, we 
      do it.’ And I still didn’t know what does it mean exactly. And they have 
      more bombastic title for this, which for me was very frightening, because 
      I said, ‘So what does it mean?’ He said, ‘You will become the 91st 
      Patriarch of the Lineage’, and I had the transmission and I flew 
      immediately to South Korea because I had a tour planned for me, going all 
      around the country teaching theatre groups. So I had no time to adjust, I 
      didn’t understand what happen. And I was in kind of a panic, because I 
      said, ‘What shall I do with this title? What is it?’ And then, kind of an 
      understanding appeared that this is only a title, it’s a door. Now I 
      should start to walk, and then I started to calm down a little bit.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> Is that when you decided to somehow make your Zen 
      part of your technique of acting, or something that you could impart to 
      acting groups?</P>
      <B>
      <P>Gil Alon:</B> Well yes, again I can say looking backwards it was a 
      process of realisation because I was approaching from two different angles 
      to the same point, and concerning art, I was always concerned, is it 
      possible to be the art? Go on stage without all the rubbish that all the 
      actors have in their mind, (‘I’m better than him’; ‘I’m very bad today’; 
      ‘The people laughed less than yesterday’; ‘The director is in the 
      auditorium, today I’m very bad, I will not get the role in the next 
      production’) all this kind of rubbish is going inside our mind while 
      uttering the text, while playing the scene. So is it possible just to be 
      the art itself, in the moment, in the now. And this is my exploration.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> So in fact what you’re saying is that there’s a 
      certain affinity between Zen Buddhism and the art of acting?</P>
      <B>
      <P>Gil Alon:</B> Of course. With all the arts, but with the art of acting 
      as well. I’ll give you an example of what I do with my students. Part of 
      the introduction exercises, I play a piece of music and I ask them to 
      move, but let the music move you; try not to decide, try not to judge, 
      don’t be dancers, don’t make choreography, every movement is acceptable, 
      and see if it’s possible if you have an idea how to move your hand, do 
      something else. And try to conquer the thoughts which most of us are 
      haunted by. Just do. And we all face this very moment that we stand there, 
      ‘What can I do? I have no ideas’. When you think that you have no ideas, 
      or your ideas are finished, this is only your opinion, there’s nothing to 
      do with reality because if you just do something physically, then ideas 
      will come and you understand that ideas are endless, it’s not possible 
      that your ideas will be finished.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> How different is it from some of the traditional 
      methods that actors use to prepare for a role, such as method acting, when 
      you try to grasp the essence of a character. Is this Zen approach very 
      different from that?</P>
      <B>
      <P>Gil Alon:</B> Yes. I mean Zen approach is also inclusive, and when you 
      work on a character there are many, many angles that you combine to one 
      character finally. But I believe that each one of us as an actor or as a 
      human being, we have all the emotions that exist in the world, it doesn’t 
      matter if they are repressed or on the surface, but we have everything 
      now. So there is no need to remember my grandmother who passed away 20 
      years ago in order to cry, it’s not necessary to remember something funny 
      that happened to me, or someone tickled me yesterday and I have to 
      remember this in order to laugh now. Just do it. And it’s possible. Cry 
      now. Laugh now. Feel pain now. Because everything is now in everyone.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> It sounds like some of your workshops probably look 
      like group therapy sessions.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Gil Alon:</B> Well I will not call it like this because I never deal 
      with personal problems, I never ask someone to talk about himself. But it 
      is emotional, yes. People cry, people laugh, because they discover 
      themselves, and because there is a big relief when I say ‘Please don’t be 
      good. Don’t compete, I’m not interested, and I will never tell you if the 
      exercise was bad or good, because if you manage to do what I ask you to 
      do, you’ll learn something about yourself, and if you cannot manage to do 
      what I ask you to do, you also learn something about yourself. So it’s not 
      possible that a wrong exercise will appear in our workshop.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> Well the approach you take not to judge someone’s 
      performance is probably very attractive to the actor who is often quite 
      sensitive about judgements.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Gil Alon:</B> Yes. We are all educated not only in the arts field, all 
      our life to build our confidence with things from outside, you know, 
      people love me, I feel better; I’m criticised, I feel sad; if 3,000 people 
      came to see me in the auditorium, I’m good, if only 8 came I’m bad, but 
      art doesn’t care. It’s you who cares. So that’s what I’m trying to 
      investigate and to share with the students.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> Gil, you’re from Israel, and I wondered how much 
      Buddhism has made inroads into Israel?</P>
      <B>
      <P>Gil Alon:</B> Well the spiritual trend in Israel is extremely big, and 
      wherever you go, everyone is into meditation, reiki, aromatherapy massage, 
      self-development, New Age stuff, whatever you want. So it’s a secular 
      country, everyone can practice whatever he wants, so it’s there.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> Do you find any unusual affinities between Zen 
      Buddhism and Judaism?</P>
      <B>
      <P>Gil Alon:</B> Well as far as I understood from my other studies, when 
      you go into the roots, the crystal root of the philosophies of the 
      religions, they come to the same point from different angles. And for me 
      this is the same, yes.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> Did you find the Zen <I>koans</I> or the Zen stories 
      have any similarities to Jewish stories?</P>
      <B>
      <P>Gil Alon:</B> Yes, I mean if you are familiar with the stories of Bal 
      Shem Tov and the Rabbi Nakhman of Braslav, they are Zen stories, they are 
      Zen koans in a way. And I think one book of the Bible, I hope I can 
      pronounce it correctly in English, in Hebrew it’s ...</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> Ecclesiastes.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Gil Alon:</B> Yes. So this is a Zen book.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> What’s the quality, say of Ecclesiastes, which makes 
      you see it as a Zen document?</P>
      <B>
      <P>Gil Alon:</B> First of all this is my point of view, and second, I 
      think it’s a tricky book and it’s up to you because you can choose to read 
      it optimistic and you can choose to read it pessimistic. And it’s up to 
      you.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> You’ve been in many theatre productions in Israel, 
      such as ‘The Unbearable Lightness of Being’ by Milan Kundera. Is there any 
      one that for you has a strong kind of Buddhist outlook or ethic?</P>
      <B>
      <P>Gil Alon:</B> Well after my first tour in South East Asia when I came 
      back to Israel, I got a role in a new Israeli production which opened new 
      Israeli theatre up north and my role was a monk, a Taoist monk, crazy 
      Taoist monk. So that was a very, very direct expression of what happened 
      to me and it was amazing. And the play was so good, by an Israeli who knew 
      nothing about Taoism and nothing about Zen, and it was amazing because he 
      wrote it, you know, just like this. And I said ‘How do you know what’s 
      written there?’ He said, ‘I don’t know’, and I opened the Scriptures that 
      I got from Japan and I told him, ‘It’s the same, you talk about the same 
      words, even the same words’, and it was really, really a fascinating 
      experience.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> Does the theatre mean something special, something 
      more to you than entertainment?</P>
      <B>
      <P>Gil Alon:</B> Well what is entertainment and what is theatre? These are 
      kind of labels, because I did entertainment as well. I had a one man show 
      that ran eight years where I used to tell jokes according to subjects from 
      the audience, and this was in one hand pure entertainment, but on second 
      hand I felt like military service because I was never relaxed, because I 
      could be always surprised, and I had to keep myself on the edge all the 
      time. It was unbelievable laboratory for me. Again it was an entertainment 
      but I also consider it as a Zen experience because many <I>koans</I> are 
      jokes, and a joke is a glimpse of enlightenment. This is one example; 
      entertainment we consider lighter than theatre, more simple than theatre, 
      or more shallow than theatre, but again, it depends on you what you do 
      with it.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> Does your Buddhism serve your acting, or is it the 
      other way round?</P>
      <B>
      <P>Gil Alon:</B> I started to reconcile it in myself as an actor, and to 
      find the way how can I go on stage and be the art, not bothering with the 
      ideas, with the commentaries, with the reactions, I mean it’s very nice 
      when people clap you and laugh but not losing confidence if it’s not. But 
      it’s an endless process.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> Do you think you’re a better actor now that you’re a 
      Zen Roshi as well?</P>
      <B>
      <P>Gil Alon:</B> I will leave it to the others to say, but I hope that I 
      can be more connected to art itself than all the things around that we are 
      burdened with usually.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> How does the Zen community actually feel about you 
      being an actor? Are you breaking any kind of rules there, or is that the 
      essence of Zen anyway, to break rules?</P>
      <B>
      <P>Gil Alon:</B> Well first of all personally I think that rules are meant 
      to be broken, and it’s a must to break rules. But in Israel I don’t know 
      anyone who is into Zen and acting, but since I started to travel, I found, 
      and I gave a Dharma talk in Perth, in the Zen community in Perth, and they 
      told me, ‘Oh, we have an actor in our group’, and they introduced him to 
      me, a musician is there, and a singer is there, and we all know it from 
      all over the world, not only Zen but more and more artists are practising 
      Buddhism in this way or another.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> Is there a certain philosophical affinity between the 
      acting life and Buddhism? Because it seems to me Buddhist outlook talks 
      about the transience of all things, that things are born and pass away, 
      and the actor is also making a world that disappears after two hours, it’s 
      just, you know, he’s inventing a world. Is there a kind of natural 
      affinity there?</P>
      <B>
      <P>Gil Alon:</B> Yes, and I totally agree with your definition, and I 
      would continue it by saying that both my Zen and my drama masters used to 
      say that the way to transcend this, what you said, is through action. Just 
      the now is important, only what I say now on the stage. I cannot rely on 
      the fact that I was good yesterday. Who cares? Or I will be good tomorrow. 
      Now is needed. So this is what I heard from all my drama education, and 
      suddenly I started my journey into Zen and I hear the same, in a way. So I 
      said, ‘Oh, something is similar here; it should be investigated.’</P>
      <B>
      <P>Rachael Kohn:</B> And Israeli theatre director Gil Alon has never 
      stopped investigating it, to the benefit, it seems, of his students.<BR>
