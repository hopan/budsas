      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="6">T</FONT>he early Buddhist discourses often 
      refer to the mutual opposition between two views. One is the view of 
      permanence or eternalism (<I>sassatavada</I>). The other is the view of 
      annihilation (<I>ucchedavada</I>). The former is sometimes referred to as
      <I>bhava-ditthi</I>, the belief in being, and the latter as <I>
      vibhava-ditthi</I>, the belief in non-being. The world at large has a 
      general tendency to lean upon one of these two views. Thus, addressing 
      Kaccayana, the Buddha says: 'This world, O Kaccayana, generally proceeds 
      on a duality, of (the belief in) existence and (the belief in) 
      non-existence.' What interests us here is the fact that it is against 
      these two views that Buddhist polemics are continually directed. What is 
      more, all the fundamental doctrines of early Buddhism are presented in 
      such a way as to unfold themselves, or to follow as a logical sequence, 
      from a sustained criticism of <I>sassatavada</I> and <I>ucchedavada</I>. 
      This particular context is sometimes explicitly stated; at other times it 
      is taken for granted. Therefore, it is within the framework of the 
      Buddhist critique of <I>sassatavada</I> and <I>ucchedavada</I> that the 
      Buddhist doctrines seem to assume their significance. For it is through 
      the demolition of these two world-views that Buddhism seeks to construct 
      its own world-view. The conclusion is that it was as a critical response 
      to the mutual opposition between these two views that Buddhism emerged as 
      a new faith amidst many other faiths.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left">This should become clear if we examine briefly the 
      religious and intellectual milieu in which Buddhism originated. In fact, 
      the prevailing mood of the time is very well reflected in the early 
      Buddhist discourses themselves. The first sutta of the first <I>nikaya</I> 
      (section or 'basket') in the <I>tipitaka</I> (the 'Three Baskets' of the 
      Buddhist canon) begins with an enumeration, and a refutation from the 
      Buddhist point of view, of 62 other views. This and many other suttas in 
      the first four <I>nikayas</I> show that there prevailed a wide variety of 
      mutually exclusive speculations on the nature and destiny of man and his 
      place in the cosmos. Despite their wide variety, we can classify them into 
      three main groups. The first includes all the religions current at the 
      time; the second comprises materialist theories which arose in direct 
      opposition to religion; and the third consists of all forms of scepticism 
      which arose as a reaction against both.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left">Among the many religions of the day, some were a linear 
      development of Vedic thought while others seem to have emerged either in 
      isolation from or in opposition to it. In the former, the trend was more 
      towards theism, monism and orthodoxy; in the latter, it was more towards 
      non-theism, pluralism and heterodoxy. Between the two groups there were a 
      variety of religious teachings which were based on epistemological grounds 
      such as scriptural authority (<I>pitaka-sampada</I>), revelation (<I>anussava</I>), 
      the omniscience of the teacher (<I>sabbaññuta</I>), knowledge gained 
      through extrasensory perception and arguments based on pure reasoning (<I>takka-vimamsa</I>). 
      Although they represented a wide spectrum of religious views and 
      practices, they all appear to have subscribed to a belief in a soul or 
      self-entity. This common belief, though it had many variations, is 
      represented in the early Buddhist discourses as a general statement: <I>
      aññam jivam aññam sariram</I> (the <I>jiva</I> or soul is one thing and 
      the <I>sarira</I> or body is another). This distinction seems to emphasize 
      the fact that while the soul is something permanent, the body is something 
      perishable. This distinction is also one between the physical body and the 
      metaphysical self. There seems to have been general agreement among all 
      religions that, since this self-entity is something immutable, it survives 
      death and that it is in this self-entity (soul) that man's true essence is 
      to be found. This religious or spiritual view of the human personality is 
      the theory of the metaphysical self. It was this belief in a permanent 
      spiritual substance within man that came to be represented in the Pali 
      suttas as <I>sassatavada</I>. Accordingly, from the Buddhist point of 
      view, all the religions of the day which subscribed to an eternal 
      self-subsisting spiritual entity were but different kinds of <I>
      sassatavada</I>.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left">The materialist tradition which emerged in direct 
      opposition to religion also seems to have had more than one school of 
      thought. These took their stand on the epistemological ground that 
      sense-perception was the only valid means of knowledge. Hence they 
      questioned the validity of theological and metaphysical theories which do 
      not come within the ambit of sense-experience. This explains why they 
      rejected the religious version of <I>atmavada</I>, the belief in a 
      metaphysical self, and gave it a new interpretation. This new 
      interpretation is expressed in the Pali suttas by the words <I>tam jivam 
      tam sariram</I> (the self is the same as the body). This is quite in 
      contrast to the religious view which emphasizes their duality rather than 
      their identity. The line of argument which seems to have led to this 
      conclusion may be stated as follows: there is no observable self-entity 
      apart from the body, and since only the observable exists, this 
      self-entity must be identical with the physical body. Therefore, for 
      materialism the soul is a product of the four primary elements of matter (<I>ayam 
      atta rupi catummahabhutiko</I>). This materialist view of the human 
      personality is the theory of the physical self. Because materialism 
      identifies the self with the physical body, it necessarily follows that at 
      death, with the break-up of the body, the self too is annihilated (<I>ucchindati, 
      vinassati</I>), without any prospect of post-mortal existence. In view of 
      this inevitable conclusion to which the materialist view of life leads, it 
      came to be represented in the Buddhist texts as <I>ucchedavada</I> 
      (annihilationism).</P>
      <P ALIGN="left">There is a general belief among some modern scholars that 
      materialism (<I>ucchedavada</I>) rejects<I> in toto</I> what is called <I>
      atmavada</I> or the belief in a soul or self-entity. Generally speaking 
      this may be true, but from the Buddhist point of view it is not valid. 
      According to the Buddhist understanding of <I>atmavada</I>, any kind of 
      thing, whether it is material, mental or spiritual, could become an åtman 
      if it becomes an object of self-identification. This process of 
      self-identification is said to manifest itself in three ways: this is mine 
      (<I>etam mama</I>); this I am (<I>esoham asmi</I>); and this is my self (<I>eso 
      me atta</I>). As materialism takes the body to be the self, to be an 
      object of self-identification, it is also a variety of <I>atmavada</I>. 
      One objection that may be raised here is that what materialists identify 
      as the self is not a metaphysical entity but the perishable physical body. 
      In the context of Buddhist teachings, however, what matters is not the 
      permanence or impermanence of the object of self-identification but the 
      very fact of self-identification. Thus Buddhists view both <I>sassatavada</I> 
      and <I>ucchedavada</I> as two varieties of <I>atmavada</I>.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left">Because <I>sassatavada</I> emphasizes the duality between 
      the soul and the body, its theory of man's emancipation is based on this 
      notion of duality. Between the soul and the body, it is the soul that is 
      in bondage. Hence if anything is to be saved, it must be the soul. What 
      prevents its upward journey is the gravitational pull of the body, that is 
      gratification in sensuality. Thus deliverance of the soul, its 
      perpetuation in a state of eternal bliss, requires the mortification of 
      the flesh. This is what came to be represented in the Buddhist texts as <I>
      attakilamathanuyoga</I> (self-mortification). It is very likely that it 
      was this belief that led to a variety of ascetic practices during the time 
      of the Buddha. A case in point was Jainism, which advocated rigid 
      austerities to liberate the soul.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left">For <I>ucchedavada</I> (materialism), on the other hand, 
      man 'is a pure product of the earth' awaiting annihilation at death. His 
      aim in this temporary life thus cannot be the rejection of sense-pleasures 
      in the pursuit of a higher spiritual ideal. If anything, it should be just 
      the opposite. This is what came to be described in the Buddhist texts as<I> 
      kamasukhallikanuyoga</I> (sensual gratification). Hence self mortification 
      and sensual gratification represent the practical aspects of the two 
      theories of <I>sasssatavada</I> and<I> ucchedavada</I>.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left">It is very likely that it was this polarization of 
      intellectual thought into <I>sasssatavada</I> and <I>ucchedavada</I>, with 
      a number of sects and subsects within each tradition, that paved the way 
      for the emergence of scepticism. It is of course true that, as K N 
      Jayatilake observes, there had been sceptical hints and agnostic trends 
      even in pre-Buddhistic Indian thought. However, as he further observes, 
      the actual 'impetus and the occasion for their arising seem to have been 
      provided by the presence of diverse, conflicting and irreconcilable 
      theories pertaining to moral, metaphysical and religious beliefs'. In the 
      Indian context, however, scepticism does not necessarily mean complete 
      dissociation from any ideal of salvation. For there is evidence to suggest 
      that some adopted scepticism on the grounds that knowledge was not only 
      impossible but also a danger to moral development and salvation.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left">The polarization of religious and intellectual thought 
      into <I>sassatavada</I> and <I>ucchedavada</I> paved the way for the birth 
      of scepticism, and it seems very likely that this very same circumstance 
      led to the emergence of Buddhism as well. This conclusion is, in fact, 
      very much suggested by the Buddha's first sermon, the Sermon on the 
      Setting in Motion of the Wheel of the Dhamma (the Dhammacakkapavattana 
      Sutta). It is against the background of <I>sassatavada</I> and <I>
      ucchedavada</I> that the Buddha sets out in it his newly discovered path 
      to emancipation, the Noble Eightfold Path (<I>ariya-atthangikamagga</I>). 
      The Buddha himself calls it <I>majjhima patipada</I> (the Middle Path) 
      because it avoids the two extremes of sensual indulgence and 
      self-mortification. The avoidance of these two extremes also means the 
      avoidance of the two theories which serve as their background, namely <I>
      sassatavada</I> and<I> ucchedavada</I>, in other words the physical and 
      the metaphysical theories of the nature of the human personality. Thus the 
      use of the two words Middle Path brings into focus the religious and 
      intellectual background against which Buddhism originated. That the Middle 
      Path is not a compromise between the two extremes or an admixture of them 
      is indicated by its definition in the same sermon as <I>ubho ante 
      anupagamma </I>(without entering into either extreme). This shows that it 
      is called the Middle Path because it transcends the mutual opposition 
      between the two extremes.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left">In point of fact, the Buddha's life itself delineates the 
      perennial conflict between <I>sassatavada</I> and <I>ucchedavada </I>and 
      its transcendence by the Middle Path. The Buddha's lay life as a prince 
      exemplifies one extreme; his life as an ascetic practising severe 
      austerities exemplifies the other. And his attainment of enlightenment by 
      giving up both extremes shows the efficacy of the Middle Path for 
      deliverance from all suffering.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left">The Buddhist critique of views, it may be noted here, is 
      not confined to arguments based on logic, epistemology and ontology. It 
      also takes into consideration their psychological motivation, that is the 
      mental dispositions which serve as their causative factors. The theory 
      behind this is that our desires and expectations have an impact on what we 
      tend to believe in. According to the Buddhist diagnosis of the 
      'psychology' of <I>sassatavada </I>(=<I>bhava-ditthi</I>) and <I>
      ucchedavada</I> (=<I>vibhava-ditthi</I>), the former is due to craving for 
      being (<I>bhava-tanha</I>), the desire to perpetuate individuality, and 
      the latter is due to craving for non-being (<I>vibhava-tanha</I>), the 
      desire to be completely annihilated at death. From the Buddhist point of 
      view the reasoning for this may be conjectured as follows: because <I>
      ucchedavada</I> rejects survival, it tends to encourage man to lead a life 
      without being burdened by a sense of moral responsibility or tormented by 
      moral inhibitions. Therefore it abhors any prospect of after-death 
      existence, as it implies the possibility of moral retribution. It is this 
      psychological resistance on the part of the one who believes in <I>
      ucchedavada</I> that leads to the desire for annihilation at death. Thus, 
      the mutual conflict between <I>sassatavada</I> and<I> ucchedavada</I> 
      represents not only the perennial conflict between the spiritual and the 
      materialist theories of existence but also the human mind's oscillation 
      between two deep-seated desires.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left">From what we have observed so far, two things should be 
      clear. The first is that <I>sassatavada</I> is the Buddhist term for all 
      religions other than Buddhism which were current at the time of the 
      Buddha. The second is that <I>ucchedavada</I> is the Buddhist term for all 
      forms of materialism which reject all religions, including Buddhism. Thus 
      the Buddhist critique of <I>sassatavada</I> and <I>ucchedavada</I> 
      identifies Buddhism's position in relation to other world-views which were 
      contemporaneous with it.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left">It must also be mentioned here that, although Buddhism 
      rejects both <I>sassatavada</I> and <I>ucchedavada</I>, it does so after 
      making a critical assessment of them. According to this assessment, the 
      Buddha was more sympathetic towards <I>sassatavada</I> and more critical 
      of <I>ucchedavada</I>. This too is clear from the Buddha's first sermon, 
      where he refers to the two extremes of sensual indulgence and 
      self-mortification. Three of the terms used here in criticizing the 
      former, which represents<I> ucchedavada</I>, are <I>hina</I> (inferior),
      <I>gamma</I> (rustic or vulgar) and <I>pothujjanika</I> (worldly). 
      However, these three terms are conspicuously absent in the Buddha's 
      assessment of self-mortification, which represents <I>sassatavada</I>. The 
      implication seems to be that although <I>sassatavada</I> does not lead to 
      the realization of the ideal of emancipation (<I>anattha-samhita</I>), 
      nevertheless it does not lead to the collapse of the moral life. It is not 
      subversive of the moral foundation of human society. As it recognizes a 
      spiritual source in man, it also recognizes moral distinctions. In point 
      of fact, according to Buddhism's assessment, all religions are different 
      forms of <I>kammavada</I>, because they all advocate the supremacy of the 
      moral life. On the other hand, <I>ucchedavada</I>, which represents the 
      materialist theory, encourages a pattern of life which takes gratification 
      in sensuality as the ultimate purpose in life. It takes for granted that 
      man's present existence is entirely due to fortuitous circumstances and 
      thus that he is not morally responsible for what he does during his 
      temporary sojourn in this world.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left">We observed earlier that it was on the basis of the Noble 
      Eightfold Path that Buddhism transcends the mutual opposition between 
      sensual indulgence and self-mortification. On what basis, then, does 
      Buddhism transcend the mutual opposition between <I>sassatavada </I>and <I>
      ucchedavada</I>? The answer is provided by the Kaccayanagotta Sutta of the 
      Samyutta Nikaya, where the Buddha addresses Kaccayana thus:</P>
      <P ALIGN="left">This world, O Kaccayana, generally proceeds on a duality, 
      of (the view of) existence and (the view of) non-existence. But he who 
      with right insight sees the uprising of the world as it really is does not 
      hold with the non-existence of the world. But he who with right insight 
      sees the passing away of the world as it really is does not hold with the 
      existence of the world. Everything exists - this is one extreme. Nothing 
      exists - this is another extreme. Not approaching either extreme the 
      Tathagata (the Buddha) teaches you a doctrine by the middle (<I>Tathagato 
      majjhena dhammam deseti</I>).</P>
      <P ALIGN="left">That the words 'a doctrine by the middle' are a reference 
      to the Buddhist doctrine of dependent origination (<I>paticcasamuppada</I>) 
      is clear not only from the context but also from what follows it. For 
      immediately after this the Buddha refers to it specifically, implying 
      thereby that it is through this particular doctrine that Buddhism avoids 
      both <I>sassatavada</I> and <I>ucchedavada</I>. It will thus be seen that 
      just as the Noble Eightfold Path is called the Middle Path, because it 
      avoids the two extremes of sensual gratification and self-mortification, 
      the doctrine of dependent origination is called the doctrine by the middle 
      (<I>majjhima-dhamma</I>), because it avoids in the self-same manner their 
      theoretical background.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left">The central position assigned to this particular doctrine 
      is seen by the Buddha's statement that one who discerns dependent 
      origination discerns the Dhamma (<I>Yo paticcasamuppadam passati so 
      dhammam passati</I>). This statement has often been understood as a 
      reference to the well-known twelve-linked causal formula. However, it is 
      very likely that the reference here is to the causal principle, that is 
      the very fact of dependent origination, and not to its application. The 
      causal principle, as stated in the Pali suttas, is as follows: whenever A 
      is present, B is present (<I>imasmim sati idam hoti</I>); whenever A is 
      absent, B is absent (<I>imasmim asati idam na hoti</I>). Therefore, 'from 
      the arising of A, B arises (<I>imass'uppada idam uppajjati</I>); from the 
      cessation of A, B ceases (<I>imassa nirodha idam nirujjhati</I>). This 
      principle should be distinguished from its application, as it has many 
      applications. In fact, it is on the basis of this principle that Buddhism 
      seeks to explain all its fundamental doctrines, such as the analysis of 
      mind and the theory of perception, karma and the moral order and the 
      nature of the empirical individuality and its samsaric dimension. This 
      explains why, as the above quotation shows, an insight into the principle 
      of dependent origination is said to constitute an insight into the very 
      heart of the Dhamma. Stated otherwise, this means that it is the 
      foundation of the Buddhist world-view, and it is through this doctrine 
      that Buddhism transcends the other two world-views represented by <I>
      sassatavada</I> and <I>ucchedavada</I>.</P>
      <P ALIGN="left">If Buddhism avoids <I>sassatavada</I>, this means that 
      there is no self-entity within man which is impervious to change. This may 
      also be interpreted as the denial of any kind of spiritual substance 
      within man which relates him to some kind of transcendental reality 
      serving as the ultimate ground of existence. If Buddhism avoids <I>
      ucchedavada</I>, this means that the human personality is not a pure 
      product of matter but is an uninterrupted and interconnected process of 
      psycho-physical phenomena which does not terminate at death. Although 
      Buddhism does not agree completely with <I>sassatavada</I>, it does not 
      deny survival (<I>punabbhava</I>) and moral responsibility (<I>kammavada</I>).</P>

      <P ALIGN="left">These three quotations from the discourses of the Buddha 
      show what Buddhism is and what it is not. Buddhism is concerned, not 
      mainly as some are inclined to believe, but totally, with man's 
      existentialist predicament which according to Buddhism is the problem of 
      suffering. If Buddhism is to be understood in this context, it follows 
      that all Buddhist teachings - whether they relate to ontology, 
      epistemology, psychology and ethics - are ultimately related to the 
      problem of suffering and its final solution. It is on this theme that all 
      Buddhist teachings converge and it is in relation to this that they assume 
      their significance. The Buddhist doctrine of dependent origination, which 
      the Buddha himself wants us to consider as the heart of the Dhamma does in 
      fact amount to a statement of the origin and cessation of suffering, when 
      it is understood both under its progressive and regressive aspects. Its 
      latter aspect which explains the cessation of suffering is often 
      overlooked in modern writings which results in the mistaken view that the 
      Buddhist teaching on causality is concerned only with the origin of 
      suffering. </P>
      <P ALIGN="left">That all Buddhist teachings converge on the problem of 
      suffering and its solution is also shown by the reference in the Pali 
      suttas to two kinds of teaching . The first is called <I>anupubbi-katha
      </I>or the 'graduated talk'. Talk on charity (<I>dana-katha</I>), talk on 
      morality (<I>sila-katha</I>), talk on heaven as a reward for virtuous 
      living (<I>sagga-katha</I>), talk on the disadvantages, the folly and the 
      defiling nature of sense pleasures and the advantages of renunciation - 
      this is what constitutes 'the graduated talk'. It is this aspect which 
      Buddhism seems to have shared with all other religions of the day as 
      different kinds of kammavada i.e. as commonly advocating the moral life. 
      The second is <I>sumukkamsika-desana </I>or the 'exalting discourse' which 
      consists of the Buddhist diagnosis of the human condition and the solution 
      thereto. If the first is called 'graduated talk', this could be understood 
      in two ways. One is that it gradually prepares the background necessary 
      for the deliverance of the 'exalting discourse'. The other is that it also 
      gradually prepares the mind of the listener as a proper receptacle (cf. <I>
      kallacitta, muducitta</I>, etc.) for its proper understanding. This 
      clearly shows that the Buddha's 'exalting discourse' which refers to the 
      fact of suffering and its solution is his teaching par excellence and that 
      all other teachings are only a prelude to it. If the Buddha makes recourse 
      to the 'graduated talk', it is not for its own sake, but for the sole 
      purpose of preparing the ground for the deliverance of this 
      characteristically Buddhistic doctrine. </P>
      <P ALIGN="left">Buddhism presents its teaching on the problem of suffering 
      and the solution thereto through four propositions: There is suffering (<I>dukkha</I>); 
      there is a cause for this suffering; there is a cessation of suffering 
      through the removal of the cause of suffering; there is a way which leads 
      to the removal of the cause of suffering which results in the cessation of 
      suffering. It is these four propositions that the Buddha has introduced as 
      the Four Noble Truths (<I>cattari ariya-saccani</I>). </P>
      <P ALIGN="left">That their formulation does not rest on a theory of 
      degrees of truth is fairly obvious. For what they bring into focus is not 
      the dichotomy between two kinds of truth corresponding to two levels of 
      reality, as is the case with the theory of double truth which came to be 
      developed in the schools of Buddhist thought. What it brings into focus, 
      instead, is the logical sequence between four facts. Therefore they do not 
      lend themselves to be interpreted on a hierarchical basis. If the first 
      truth refers to man's present predicament (pathological), the second seeks 
      to explain its origination (diagnostical); if the third refers to the 
      complete elimination of suffering (ideal), the fourth shows the way to its 
      realization (prescriptive). This is not to overlook the fact that the four 
      truths in combination imply two levels of reality, the samsaric dimension 
      of the empiric individuality and its Nibbanic dimension when the former is 
      brought to an end. However, this distinction between two levels of 
      experience (=reality) does not in any way impart to the Four Noble Truths 
      a qualitative distinction as four statements of truth. Taken as four 
      propositions, they are co-ordinate. This seems to be the reason why they 
      are all introduced as Noble Truths. </P>
      <P ALIGN="left">Because of the logical sequence between the Four Noble 
      Truths, the significance of each cannot be understood in a context from 
      where the other three are excluded. Each assumes significance in relation 
      to the other three. If the truth of suffering is sought to be understood 
      in isolation from the rest, such an understanding will necessarily lead to 
      the conclusion that Buddhism advocates a pessimistic view of life. Any 
      such misconception could be easily removed if it is understood in its 
      proper context, i.e. in relation to the other three truths. Even Nibbana, 
      which is the final goal of Buddhism and which corresponds to the third 
      Noble Truth, assumes its significance in the context of the other three 
      Noble Truths. Their mutual relation and inter-connection are such that it 
      would not be incorrect to say that they are not four different 
      propositions, but are four aspects of one and the same proposition. In 
      point of fact, it is maintained in the Buddhist discourses themselves that 
      'when the first Noble Truth is comprehended, the second suggests itself, 
      when the second is comprehended, the third suggests itself, when the third 
      is comprehended, the fourth suggests itself'. As Arvind Sharma observes, 
      'the four Noble Truths constitute a progressive series, each leading to 
      the next and each throwing light on the next'. </P>
      <P ALIGN="left">The logical sequence which the four Noble Truths exhibit 
      is also taken into consideration when they become the basis for actual 
      practice of the religious life. Hence it is observed that the fact of 
      suffering is to be thoroughly understood (<I>parinneyya</I>), the cause of 
      suffering is to be removed (<I>pahatabba</I>), the cessation of suffering 
      is to be realized a (<I>sacchikatabba</I>), and the path that leads to the 
      cessation of suffering is to be developed (<I>bhavetabba</I>) . If the 
      second and the fourth could be taken as two aspects relating to practice, 
      then here we have the three main dimensions of Buddhism as a theory and 
      praxis, namely understanding, practice and realization. It is under these 
      three aspects that all Buddhist teachings relating to the problem of 
      suffering and its final solution are presented. </P>
      <P ALIGN="left">Like many other Buddhist teachings, the Buddhist teaching 
      on suffering, too, is presented against the background of similar theories 
      current at the time. Mention is made in the Pali suttas of four theories 
      as to why man suffers . According to the first suffering is self-caused (<I>sayamkata</I>). 
      This is based on the view that there is a persisting self entity which 
      acts and suffers its consequences. The second is based on the theory of 
      external causation according to which man suffers due to a principle which 
      is external to him (<I>paramkata</I>), such as a creator God (<I>issara</I>), 
      Destiny (<I>niyati</I>), Nature ('<I>svabhava</I>'). According to the 
      third suffering is both self-caused and caused by another (<I>sayamkatam 
      ca paramkatam</I>). It is an attempt to combine the first two theories. 
      The fourth rejects all the three theories mentioned above and seeks to 
      explain man's suffering as befallen by chance, i.e. due to fortuitous 
      circumstances (<I>adhiccasamuppanna</I>). </P>
      <P ALIGN="left">Buddhism rejects all the four theories and explains man's 
      suffering on the basis of dependent origination (<I>paticca-samuppanna 
      dukkham</I>). This is the significance of the twelve-linked causal 
      formula, where each succeeding link is said to result from what 
      immediately precedes it. What this amounts to is that the causes of 
      suffering are identifiable without reference to an external principle and 
      without positing a self-entity which persists throughout the cycle of 
      samsaric existence and also without subscribing to the view that suffering 
      is befallen by chance. </P>
      <P ALIGN="left">This does not mean that the Buddhist causal formula 
      explains only the origination of suffering. It does explain its cessation 
      as well. It is only in its progressive order that it explains how 
      suffering comes to be. This is based on the principle: Whenever A is 
      present B is (also) present (<I>imasmim sati idam hoti</I>). Therefore: 
      from the arising of A, B arises (<I>imassa uppada idam uppajjati</I>). In 
      its regressive order, the causal formula shows how suffering comes to 
      cessation. This is based on the principle: whenever A is absent, B is 
      (also) absent (<I>imasmim asati idam na hoti</I>). Therefore: from the 
      cessation of A, B (too) comes to cessation (<I>imassa nirodha idam 
      nirujjhati</I>). What this means is that every statement referring to the 
      arising of suffering is always supplemented by another statement which 
      explains how suffering comes to an end, to be more precise, how it can be 
      brought to an end. </P>
      <P ALIGN="left">The causality of suffering does also show that although 
      Buddhism recognizes the samsaric dimension of the empiric individuality, 
      it does not trace the causes of suffering to any transcendental reality.
      </P>
      <P ALIGN="left">In his <I>Spokes of the Wheel</I>, Arvind Sharma raises a 
      very pertinent question: When Buddhism speaks of suffering, does this mean 
      1) there is suffering in life or 2) that life itself is suffering. His 
      answer is that the Buddhist teaching seems to alternate between these two 
      understandings. Whether this answer is justifiable should become clear if 
      we examine how the fact of suffering is defined in the Buddhist texts. In<I> 
      The Religions of Man</I>, Hurston Smith identifies six particular 
      occasions of suffering as recognized in Buddhism. They are 1) the trauma 
      of birth (<I>ja ti pi dukkha</I>), 2) the pathology of sickness (<I>vyadhi 
      pi dukkha</I>), 3) the morbidity of decrepitude (<I>jara pi dukkha</I>) 4) 
      the phobia of death (<I>maranam pi dukkham</I>), 5) to be separated from 
      what one loves (<I>piyehi vippayoga</I>). Before we refer to what Hurston 
      Smith cites as the sixth, two more items should be added to the above 
      list. They are: 6) to be united with what is unpleasant (<I>appiyehi 
      sampayoga</I>) and 7) impeded will or unfulfilled expectation (<I>yam 
      icchati tam na labhati</I>). The last item which Smith cites as the sixth 
      is a comprehensive summing up of what suffering is. That is, 8) in brief 
      the five aggregates of grasping are all suffering. This concluding 
      sentence in the Buddhist definition of suffering is the one that is most 
      significant, the one that could be the most controversial. For the seven 
      occasions of suffering listed before the last one, could be accepted by 
      almost all as veritable sources of suffering. </P>
      <P ALIGN="left">As we shall see in the course of this article, according 
      to Buddhism the five aggregates of grasping (<I>panca upadanakkandha</I>) 
      themselves constitute the human personality in its samsaric dimension. The 
      very fact that they are described as suffering clearly shows that from the 
      Buddhist point of view, it is not correct to say that there is suffering 
      in life. The correct answer should be life itself is suffering. </P>
      <P ALIGN="left">If life itself is suffering is not this controverted by 
      empirical evidence. Aren't there pleasures in sensual gratification, in 
      the titillation of the senses? Buddhism would not quarrel with such an 
      assertion. 'If there were no satisfaction in the world' - so runs the 
      Buddhist argument - 'beings would not be attached to the world' . Buddhist 
      texts make glowing praises of the blessings of the good house-holder's 
      life. Reference is made to many kinds of pleasure and happiness which 
      could be obtained through righteous or non-righteous means. There is 
      happiness on being praised, on obtaining wealth and by birth as denizen in 
      a heavenly existence . The bliss of heavenly life is recorded in glowing 
      terms. As Arvind Sharma rightly observes, the very fact that Buddhism 
      rejects <I>kamasukhallikanuyoga </I>shows that a life given to sensual 
      gratification is not impossible. It is not even described as suffering (<I>dukkha</I>) 
      as is its opposite, <I>attakilamathanuyoga</I>, a life given to 
      self-mortification. If it is rejected, it is not because of its 
      impossibility, but because of its futility. Again the very fact that 
      Nibbana is defined as the Highest Happiness does also show, by 
      implication, that there are many other forms of happiness which are lower 
      than that. What all this suggests is that Buddhism recognizes different 
      levels of happiness which culminate in Nibbana. Hence happiness itself 
      came to be defined as that which has Nibbana as its consummation (<I>Nibbanaparamam 
      sukham</I>). </P>
      <P ALIGN="left">In point of fact, the Buddhist definition of suffering, to 
      which we referred earlier, could also be considered as a definition of 
      happiness, as well. The fact that suffering is defined as association with 
      what is unpleasant (<I>appiyehi sampayoga</I>) shows that, conversely, 
      dissociation from what is unpleasant is a source of happiness. Secondly, 
      if dissociation from what is pleasant (<I>piyehi vippayoga</I>) is a 
      source of suffering, its opposite condition should necessarily be a source 
      of happiness. Thirdly if impeded will or frustration (<I>yam na labhati 
      tam</I>) is suffering, it follows that the fulfillment of will, 
      fulfillment of our desires and expectations are a sure source of 
      happiness. </P>
      <P ALIGN="left">Is there then a contradiction between the assertion that 
      life is suffering and the recognition of the actuality and the possibility 
      of pleasures in life? The answer to this question should become clear if 
      we go back to the Buddhist definition of suffering. This definition shows 
      that Buddhism recognizes three levels of suffering. At the most elemental 
      level, suffering appears as physical pain and oppression. This is 
      represented by such occasions as<I> jati, jara and vyadhi</I>, which 
      Hurston Smith has translated as the trauma of birth, the pathology of 
      sickness and the morbidity of decrepitude. To this may be added such 
      experiences as hunger, thirst, privation and accident. The next level is 
      suffering as psychological experience. Association with what is unpleasant 
      or dissociation from what is pleasant or impeded will or frustrated desire 
      could be cited as appropriate instances. At the third or the deepest level 
      is anguish or disharmony, which seems to be at the very core of human 
      life. It is this level which Buddhism takes into consideration when it 
      says that the five aggregates of grasping are themselves suffering. It 
      will be seen that the various occasions of suffering which are identified 
      in the above definition are so enumerated as to bring into focus these 
      three levels of suffering. </P>
      <P ALIGN="left">What we have introduced as the first two levels of 
      suffering do not completely exclude the possibilities of happiness. For in 
      the first two levels only some occasions that lead to suffering are 
      identified and itemized. Therefore, if we take into consideration only the 
      first two levels, then we should conclude that life has suffering and not 
      life is suffering. But when we come to the third level, the definition is 
      so comprehensive to justify the conclusion that life is suffering and not 
      that life has suffering. </P>
      <P ALIGN="left">Now, let us consider why and how the five aggregates of 
      grasping are said to be suffering. It is a well known fact that according 
      to the Buddhist analysis of the empiric individuality, it consists of five 
      aggregates known as <I>khandhas</I>. The human personality can therefore 
      be defined as their sum total. However, in the Buddhist definition of 
      suffering it is not the five aggregates (<I>pancakkhandha</I>) but the 
      five aggregates of grasping (<I>panca upadanakkhandha</I>) that are 
      characterised as suffering. This shows that although the five aggregates 
      in themselves are not suffering, they can be a source of suffering when 
      they become objects of grasping (<I>upadana</I>). Thus there is a clear 
      distinction between the five aggregates on the one hand and the 
      fiveaggregates of grasping, on the other. Strictly speaking, what Buddhism 
      calls the individual is not the five aggregates, but the five aggregates 
      when they are grasped or appropriated. This explains why in the Buddhist 
      definition of suffering, the reference is made to the aggregates of 
      grasping and not to the aggregates themselves. The so-called individual 
      can thus be reduced to a causally conditioned process of grasping. And it 
      is this process of grasping that Buddhism describes as suffering. Hence 
      the Buddhist conclusion is that life, at its very bottom or core, is 
      characterized by suffering. </P>
      <P ALIGN="left">This explanation gives rise to two questions. One is by 
      whom are the five aggregates grasped. The other is how and why this 
      process of grasping leads to suffering? The answer to the first question 
      is that besides the process of grasping, there is no agent who performs 
      the act of grasping. This may appear rather paradoxical, nevertheless it 
      is understandable in the context of the Buddhist doctrine of <I>anatta</I> 
      and the Buddhist doctrine of dependent origination. What both seek to show 
      is that the individual is a conditioned process, without an agent either 
      inside or outside the process. This process of grasping manifests itself 
      in three ways: This is mine (<I>etam mama</I>), this I am (<I>esoham asmi</I>), 
      and this is myself (<I>eso me atta</I>). The first is due to craving (<I>tanha</I>); 
      the second is due to conceit (<I>mana</I>); and the third is due to the 
      mistaken belief in a self-entity (<I>ditthi</I>) . It is through this 
      process of three-fold self-identification that the idea of 'mine', 'I am' 
      and 'my self' arises. If there is a thing called individuality in its 
      samsaric dimension, it is entirely due to the superimposition on the five 
      aggregates of these three ideas. </P>
      <P ALIGN="left">Now let us take the second question as to why and how the 
      aggregates of grasping are themselves called suffering. This is because 
      the five aggregates which become the object of self-identification are in 
      a state of constant change, in a state of continuous flux, with no 
      enduring essence, with no perduring substance. Their nature is such that 
      they do not remain in the way we want them to remain. They are not under 
      our control. As we have mentioned in our second lecture, this is one of 
      the fundamental meanings of<I> anatta.</I> Hence by identifying ourselves 
      with what is impermanent, with what does not come under our full control, 
      we come to suffering. This explains why Buddhism traces the fact of 
      suffering to the fact of impermanence (<I>Yad aniccam tam dukkham</I>). 
      Hence the very act of self-identification is itself suffering. When the 
      process of self-identification is eliminated, suffering, too, comes to an 
      end. This is the difference between samsara and Nibbana. The samsara 
      continues as long as the process of self-identification persists. As long 
      as it persists there is suffering. The moment it stops, the samsaric 
      process, too, comes to an end, and together with it all suffering, too 
      comes to an end. This is the significance of the first quotation which we 
      cited at the very beginning of this lecture: 'If anything arises, it is 
      suffering, if anything passes away it is (also) suffering.' </P>
      <P ALIGN="left">In the Buddhist texts themselves three kinds of suffering 
      are distinguished which do not exactly correspond to the three levels of 
      suffering to which we have been drawing attention up to now. The first is
      <I>dukkha-dukkha</I>. This reduplicated form of the term refers to 
      suffering as generally understood, i.e. physical pain as well as its 
      deeper psychological experience as sorrow and anxiety. It therefore 
      corresponds to the first two levels of our classification. The second is
      <I>viparinama-dukkha</I>, i.e. suffering through change, what Edward Conze 
      translates as 'suffering from reversal'. This refers to situations when, 
      even when we are happy, suffering stares at us in the background. Moments 
      of happiness do not obtain in uninterrupted continuity, but have a 
      tendency to get interrupted through change of circumstances. It is a 
      deeper analysis than the first. The third which is called <I>
      sankhara-dukkha</I> corresponds exactly to the third level of suffering 
      which we discussed above, i.e. suffering involved in grasping the five 
      aggregates. </P>
      <P ALIGN="left">Commenting on the theory of suffering as generally 
      understood by classical Indian religions, B K Motilal poses an important 
      question. It is that whether the 'pain-thesis is a factual statement or a 
      statement of evaluation, whether it is a proposition or an exclamation 
      (i.e. an exhortation to act), whether it is a description of how things 
      are or a prescription of how we ought to consider it' . In his opinion 
      what we referred to above as <I>dukkha-dukkha</I> is clearly a factual 
      proposition. Thus for example, suffering experienced due to impeded will 
      is lived and factual suffering. On the other hand, he observes that the 
      third level of suffering which is <I>sankhara-dukkha</I> is clearly a 
      statement of evaluation, evaluation in relation to Nibbana . </P>
      <P ALIGN="left">Although we tend to agree with this conclusion, it must 
      also be admitted that this conclusion is made from the point of view of 
      samsaric existence. On the other hand, the Buddhist definition of all 
      suffering (not only <I>saakhara-dukkha</I>) is made from the point of view 
      of Nibbana. It is of course true that such palpable instances of suffering 
      as phobia of death could be understood without reference to Nibbana. 
      However, the fact that Nibbana is also defined as 'freedom from death' (<I>amata</I>) 
      shows that according to the Buddhist assessment, even the phobia of death 
      as suffering has significance in relation to Nibbana. Nibbana is the very 
      negation of samsara. And since the former is defined as the highest level 
      of happiness from that point of view all samsaric experience is suffering. 
      Even as a general statement, it may not be incorrect to say that all 
      assessment of suffering involves some kind of evaluation. For suffering 
      assumes significance in relation to its contrary, which is happiness. 
      One's fear of death should be understood in relation to one's desire to 
      live. If association with what is unpleasant (<I>appiyehi sampayoga</I>) 
      is an occasion of suffering, it is because dissociation from what is 
      unpleasant ('<I>appiyehi vippayoga</I>') is a source of happiness. 
      Therefore, it is difficult to understand why only <I>sankhara-dukkha</I> 
      should be singled out as an instance of evaluation. </P>
      <P ALIGN="left">In any case, Buddhism describes suffering as<I> tatha </I>
      (real and objective), <I>avitatha</I> (not unreal and not non-objective) 
      and <I>anannatha</I> (invariable). These three characteristics are applied 
      to the principle of dependent origination (<I>paticcasamuppada</I>) too. 
      What seems to be emphasized here is that although suffering is a 
      subjective experience, it is presented as an objective fact in order to 
      emphasize its universality. </P>
      <P ALIGN="left">If Buddhism emphasizes the universality of suffering, this 
      could be understood from another point of view, from the point of view of 
      the cause of suffering. The cause of suffering is the self-centred desire 
      which manifests itself in many forms. Hence the universality of suffering 
      does also mean the universality of the self-centred desire. To say that 
      man suffers is the same as saying that man is motivated by self-centred 
      desires. The two statements are mutually convertible, the first is by way 
      of the effect and the second is by way of the cause. In modern writings on 
      Buddhism this fact, namely the causative factor of suffering, is often 
      overlooked. </P>
      <P ALIGN="left">Buddhism's great concern with the problem of suffering 
      may, on a superficial appraisal, appear as an inordinate obsession with an 
      unwarranted problem, particularly when it is considered in the context of 
      the joys and pleasures of life. What should not be overlooked here is that 
      if Buddhism is concerned with the problem of suffering it is because it is 
      equally concerned with its solution. If it identifies all sources and 
      occasions of suffering, it is in order to ensure that happiness is based 
      on a sure and solid foundation. Thus even jhanic experience and the 
      delights of heavenly existence which for all practical purposes may be 
      described as an instance of supreme happiness are also identified as 
      suffering. Therefore, the Buddhist teaching on suffering could also be 
      understood as the Buddhist teaching on the pursuit of happiness. </P>
      <P ALIGN="left">The Buddhist attitude to suffering is very well analyzed 
      by Alexandra David-Neel in her <I>Buddhism, Its Doctrines and Its Methods</I> 
      . She refers here to four possible attitudes in respect of suffering. The 
      first is the denial of suffering, in the face of all evidence. This may be 
      interpreted as naiveoptimism. The second is 'passive resignation, the 
      acceptance of a state of things which one considers inevitable'. This may 
      be interpreted as out-and-out pessimism. The third is camouflage of 
      suffering by the help of pompous sophistry or by gratuitously attaching to 
      it such virtues and transcendent aims as one thinks may ennoble it or 
      diminish its bitterness'. This may be interpreted as rationalization of 
      suffering. The fourth is 'the war against suffering, accompanied by the 
      faith in the possibility of overcoming it'. This may be described as the 
      rational and the most sane attitude to suffering. It is this fourth 
      attitude to suffering that Buddhism adopts. This also explains why 
      Buddhism does not make any attempts to interpret suffering. For any 
      interpretation of suffering implies an attempt to rationalize it. 
      Rationalization of suffering, in turn, implies an attempt to 'hide its 
      bitterness' on spiritual or other grounds. It amounts to an escapism in 
      the face of suffering, which in other words, means a postponement of a 
      solution to it. </P>
      <P ALIGN="left">Accordingly Buddhism emphasizes the urgency of the need 
      for a solution to the problem of suffering. Man's existentialist 
      predicament is, therefore, compared to a person who has been pierced with 
      a poisoned arrow (<I>salla-viddha</I>). This simile draws attention not 
      only to his present predicament but also to the urgency of solving it. It 
      also draws attention to two other things: That is, what one should do and 
      what one should not do at such a situation. In the first place, he must 
      not waste his time by asking such silly questions as to who shot the 
      arrow, what is his name, caste, etc. Nor should be insist that he would 
      not get the poisoned arrow removed until he knows the answers to these 
      questions 33. To raise such questions is to create another problem which 
      has no relevance to the problem at issue, and what is more, the patient 
      would die before he could get satisfactory answers to his questions. </P>
      <P ALIGN="left">It is on this analogy that the Buddhist attitude to the 
      problem of suffering and the solution of metaphysical questions should be 
      understood. Hence it is that when Malunkyaputta asked the Buddha whether 
      the world is eternal or non-eternal or whether the world is finite or 
      infinite, the Buddha refused to answer these questions. Malunkyaputta then 
      decided to leave the order. Then addressing him the Buddha says: 'The 
      religious life, O Malunkyaputta does not depend on the dogma that the 
      world is eternal or not, nor does it depend on the dogma that the world is 
      finite or not. Whether the world is eternal or not, whether the world is 
      finite or not, there is birth, there is death, there are grief, sorrow, 
      suffering, lamentation and despair and it is for their extinction in this 
      very life itself, that I preach the doctrine' . It was in illustrating 
      this point that the Buddha used the simile of the poisoned arrow. If the 
      Buddha refused to answer such metaphysical questions it was because their 
      solution whether they are solvable or not is another question - has no 
      relevance to man's understanding of his present predicament or to solving 
      it. These questions, as the Buddha says, are not concerned with the 
      spiritual and the Higher Life. 'They do not conduce to aversion, to 
      dispassion, to cessation (of suffering), to calming, to higher knowledge, 
      to awakening or to Nibbana'. What is most significant to note here is that 
      immediately after saying so, the Buddha goes on to explain the Four Noble 
      Truths, which is the Buddhist formulation of the problem of suffering and 
      its solution. It is in this context that the second quotation which we 
      cited at the beginning of this lecture becomes significant: 'Both formerly 
      and now also, 'Anuradha, I declare only two things, suffering and its 
      cessation'. </P>
