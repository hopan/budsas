  <i><p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></i></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&quot;This doctrine is profound, hard to see, difficult
  to understand, calm, sublime, not within the sphere of logic, subtle, to be understood by
  the wise.&quot;</i> Majjhima Nikaya </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha has passed away, but the sublime Teaching,
  which He expounded during His long and successful ministry and which He unreservedly
  bequeathed to humanity, still exists in its pristine purity.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although the Master has left no written records of His
  Teachings, His disciples preserved them, by committing to memory and transmitting them
  orally from generation to generation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Three months after the Death of the Buddha, in the eighth
  year of <i>King Ajatasattu</i>'s reign, 500 pre-eminent Arahants concerned with preserving
  the purity of the Doctrine held a Convocation at <i>Rajagaha</i> to rehearse it. The
  Venerable <i>Ananda Thera</i>, the Buddha's beloved attendant who had the special
  privilege and honour of hearing the discourses from the Buddha Himself, and the Venerable <i>Upali
  Thera</i> were chosen to answer questions about the <i>Dhamma</i> (Doctrine) and the <i>Vinaya</i>
  (Discipline) respectively.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This First Council compiled and arranged in its present
  form the Pali Tipitaka, which represents the entire body of the Buddha's Teaching.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Two other Councils of Arahants were held 100 and 236 years
  later respectively, again to rehearse the Word of the Buddha because attempts were being
  made to pollute the pure Teaching.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">About 83 B.C., during the reign of the pious <i>Simhala
  King Vatta Gamani Abhaya</i>, a Council of Arahants was held, and the Tipitaka was, for
  the first time in the history of Buddhism, committed to writing at <i>Aluvihara</i> in
  Ceylon.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thanks to the indefatigable efforts of those noble and
  foresighted Arahants, there is no room either now or in the future for higher critics or
  progressive scholars to adulterate the pure Teaching.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The voluminous Tipitaka, which contains the essence of the
  Buddha's Teaching, is estimated to be about eleven times the size of the Bible.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The word Tipitaka means three Baskets. They are the Basket
  of Discipline <i>(Vinaya Pitaka)</i>, the Basket of Discourses <i>(Sutta Pitaka)</i> and
  the Basket of Ultimate Doctrine <i>(Abhidhamma Pitaka)</i>.</font></p>
  <h2 ALIGN="RIGHT"><font face="Times New Roman">Vinaya Pitaka</font></h2>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Vinaya Pitaka, which is regarded as the sheet anchor
  of the Holy Order, deals mainly with the rules and regulations of the Order of Bhikkhus
  (monks) and Bhikkhunis (nuns). For nearly twenty years after the Enlightenment of the
  Buddha, no definite rules were laid down for control and discipline of the Sangha (Order).
  Subsequently as occasion arose, the Buddha promulgated rules for the future discipline of
  the Sangha. Reasons for the promulgated of rules, their various implications and specific
  ceremonies of the Sangha are fully described in the Vinaya Pitaka. The history of the
  gradual development of Sasana from its very inception, a brief account of the life and
  ministry of the Buddha additional, and details of the three Councils are some other
  relevant contents of the Vinaya Pitaka. Indirectly it reveals useful information about
  ancient history, Indian customs, ancient arts and sciences. One who reads the Vinaya
  Pitaka cannot but be impressed by the democratic constitution of the Sangha, their holding
  of possessions in common, the exceptionally high moral standard of the Bhikkhus, and the
  unsurpassed administrative abilities of the Buddha, who anticipated even the present
  Parliamentary system. Lord Zetland writes; <i>&quot;And it may come as a surprise to many
  to learn that in the Assemblies of the Buddhists in India two thousand years and more ago
  are to be found the rudiments of our own Parliamentary practice of the present day.&quot;</i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Vinaya Pitaka consists of the following five books:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Parajika Pali (Major Offences)<br>
    2. Pacittiya Pali (Minor Offences)<br>
    3. Mahavagga Pali (Greater Section)<br>
    4. Cullavagga Pali (Lesser Section)<br>
    5. Parivara Pali (Epitome of the Vinaya)</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2 ALIGN="RIGHT"><font face="Times New Roman">Sutta Pitaka</font></h2>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Sutta Pitaka consists chiefly of instructive
  discourses delivered by the Buddha to both the Sangha and the laity on various occasions.
  A few discourses, expounded by disciples such as the Venerable <i>Sariputta</i>, <i>Moggallana</i>,
  and <i>Ananda</i>, are incorporated and are accorded as much veneration as the Word of the
  Buddha Himself, since they were approved by Him. Most of the sermons were intended mainly
  for the benefit of Bhikkhus, and they deal with the Holy Life and with the exposition of
  the Doctrine. There are several other discourses which deal with both the material and the
  moral progress of His lay-followers. The Sigalovada Sutta, for instance, deals mainly with
  the duties of a layman. There are also a few interesting talks given to children.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This Pitaka may be compared to a book of prescriptions,
  since the discourses were expounded on diverse occasions to suit the temperaments of
  various persons. There may be seemingly contradictory statements, but they should not be
  misconstrued as they were uttered by the Buddha to suit a particular purpose; for
  instance, to the self same question He would maintain silence, when the inquirer was
  merely foolishly inquisitive, or give a detailed reply when He knew the inquirer to be an
  earnest seeker after the Truth.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Sutta Pitaka consists of the following five Nikayas
  (Collections):</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Digha Nikaya (Collection of Long Discourses)<br>
    2. Majjhima Nikaya (Collection of Middle-length Discourses)<br>
    3. Samyutta Nikaya (Collection of Kindred Sayings)<br>
    4. Anguttara Nikaya (Collection of Gradual Sayings)<br>
    5. Khuddaka Nikaya (Smaller Collection)</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This fifth is subdivided into fifteen books:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Khuddaka Patha (Shorter Texts)<br>
    2. Dhammapada (The Way of Truth)<br>
    3. Udana (Paeans of Joy)<br>
    4. Itivuttaka (&quot;Thus said&quot; Discourses)<br>
    5. Sutta Nipata (Collected Discourses)<br>
    6. Vimana Vatthu (Stories of Celestial Mansions)<br>
    7. Peta Vatthu (Stories of Peta)<br>
    8. Theragatha (Psalms of the Brethren)<br>
    9. Therigatha (Psalms of the Sisters)<br>
    10. Jataka (Birth Stories of the Bodhisatta)<br>
    11. Niddesa (Expositions)<br>
    12. Patisambhida (Book on Analytical Knowledge)<br>
    13. Apadana (Lives of Arahants)<br>
    14. Buddhavamsa (History of the Buddha)<br>
    15. Cariya Pitaka (Modes of Conduct)</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2 ALIGN="RIGHT"><font face="Times New Roman">Abhidhamma Pitaka</font></h2>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Abhidhamma Pitaka is the most important and most
  interesting of the three containing as it does the profound philosophy of the Buddha's
  teaching in contrast to the simpler discourses in the Sutta Pitaka. Abhidhamma, the Higher
  Doctrine of the Buddha, expounds the quintessence of His profound teachings.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to some scholars Abhidhamma is not a teaching of
  the Buddha, but is a later elaboration of scholastic monks. Tradition, however, attributes
  the nucleus of the Abhidhamma to the Buddha Himself. The <i>Matika</i> of Matrices of the
  Abhidhamma, such as <i>Kusala Dhamma</i> (Wholesome States), <i>Akusala Dhamma</i>
  (Unwholesome States), and <i>Abyakata Dhamma</i> (Indeterminate States) etc., which have
  been elaborated in the six books (Kathavatthu being excluded), were expounded by the
  Buddha. To the Venerable Sariputta is assigned the honour of having explained all these
  topics in detail.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Whoever the great author or authors may have been, it has
  to be admitted that the Abhidhamma must be the product of an intellectual genius
  comparable only to the Buddha. This is evident from the intricate and subtle <i>Patthana
  Pakarana</i> which describes in detail the various causal relations.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To the wise truth-seekers, Abhidhamma is an indispensable
  guide and an intellectual treat. Here is found food for thought to original thinkers and
  to earnest students who wish to develop wisdom and lead an ideal Buddhist life. Abhidhamma
  is not a subject of fleeting interest designed for the superficial reader.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Modern Psychology, limited as it is, comes within the
  scope of ( Abhidhamma inasmuch as it deals with mind, thoughts, thought-processes, and
  mental properties; but it does not admit of a psyche or a soul. It teaches a psychology
  without a psyche.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If one were to read the Abhidhamma as a modern text-book
  on psychology, one would be disappointed. No attempt has here been made to solve all the
  problems that confront a modern psychologist.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Consciousness <i>(Citta)</i> is defined. Thoughts are
  analysed and classified chiefly from an ethical standpoint. All mental properties <i>(Cetasika)</i>
  are enumerated. The composition of each type of consciousness is set forth in detail. How
  thoughts arise is minutely described. <i>Bhavanga</i> and <i>Javana</i> thought-moments,
  which are explained only in the Abhidhamma, and which have no parallel in modern
  psychology, are of special interest to research students in psychology. Irrelevant
  problems that interest students and scholars, but have no relation to one's Deliverance,
  are deliberately set aside.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Matter is summarily discussed, but it has not been
  described for physicists. Fundamental units of matter, material properties, source of
  matter, relationship of mind and matter are explained. Abhidhamma does not attempt to give
  a systematised knowledge of mind and matter. It investigates these two composite factors
  of the so-called being, to help the understanding of things as they truly are. A
  philosophy has been developed on those lines. Based on that philosophy, an ethical system
  has been evolved to realize the ultimate Goal, Nibbana. As Mrs. Rhys Davids rightly says:
  &quot;Abhidhamma deals with (i) what we find (a) within us (b) around us and of (ii) what
  we aspire to find.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">While the Sutta Pitaka contains the conventional teaching <i>(vohara
  desana)</i>, the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the ultimate teaching <i>(paramattha desana)</i>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is generally admitted by most exponents of the Dhamma
  that a knowledge of the Abhidhamma is essential to comprehend fully the Teachings of the
  Buddha, as it presents the key that opens the door of reality.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Abhidhamma Pitaka is composed of the following seven
  works:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Dhammasangani (Classification of Dhamma)<br>
    2. Vibhanga (Divisions)<br>
    3. Dhatukatha (Discourse on Elements)<br>
    4. Puggala Pannatti (The Book on Individuals)<br>
    5. Kathavatthu (Points of Controversy)<br>
    6. Yamaka (The Book of Pairs)<br>
    7. Patthana (The Book of Causal Relations)</font></p>
