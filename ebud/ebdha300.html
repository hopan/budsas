      <TD WIDTH="100%"><FONT SIZE="6">M</FONT>y alms bowl is central to my life. 
      A symbol of the Theravada Buddhist monastic tradition in which I trained, 
      it is the soul of my mendicancy - coming empty-handed before the laity to 
      receive material nourishment and responding to their generosity. Sometimes 
      that means reciprocating with a teaching from the Buddha, sometimes with a 
      blessing chant or simply an expression of gratitude and kindness.<P>I am a 
      beggar, and I must also be true. It is not easy to be a true beggar. I 
      have to be worthy to be fed by the kindness of others and have all my 
      needs provided. This way is rare and precious, as are acts of generosity 
      in a world so driven by greed and selfishness.</P>
      <P>Cultivating the spiritual path with integrity demands much of a beggar, 
      primarily a faithful allegiance to the <I>Vinaya</I>, the code by which I 
      live, as well as a sincere appreciation and respect for my supporters, 
      their devotion and hard work to obtain, prepare and bring offerings, even 
      at considerable sacrifice. It also calls for contentment with little - a 
      simplicity of being and a commitment to renounce on many levels.</P>
      <P>These qualities develop through a vigilance of heart that is difficult 
      to practise in a large, well-funded institution. In those days when my 
      monastic requisites, especially meals, were complete, assured and 
      generally abundant, I used self-abstinence to remind myself of the value 
      of all that was given to us. On occasion, we also went on tudong or walked 
      for alms in the nearby villages, accepting whatever we received as our 
      meal for the day. But these were temporary privations - not a sustained 
      way of life. They bore the flavour of heroic adventure but could hardly 
      reflect the daily grind of spiritual endeavour.</P>
      <P>It was only after I left the mother monastery to live on my own in New 
      Zealand, a non-Buddhist country, that I came to know true choicelessness, 
      at times facing physical hunger or a powerless isolation. This propelled 
      me into a level of faith not demanded of me before, especially on days 
      when I received very little, if anything, that would serve as a meal. And 
      so I learnt to meditate on the emptiness of my bowl - consciously 
      relinquishing desire for food and accepting hunger. Bearing hunger with 
      faith led me beyond despair to a gratitude and joy for what I did receive 
      - a feeling of fullness that was not borne of food. These hardships 
      ripened me. I have gone hungry. But I have been able to keep going because 
      every part of my body is made up of the loving-kindness from generous 
      people who have cared for me for years and years, and my life is composed 
      of pure kindness and thanksgiving.</P>
      <P>Now, in my passage through Malaysia, I have again taken the opportunity 
      to walk <I>pindapat</I> in the local market of Penang where it is 
      surprisingly easy to beg. I knew I would be well-fed.</P>
      <P>With my bowl secure in its harness around my shoulder and cradling it 
      in my palms, I stood between the main fruit and vegetable vendors and rows 
      of flimsy stalls that display a collage of baby clothes, ladiesâ€™ handbags, 
      jewellery, household items, and colourful trinkets.</P>
      <P>I chanted for each person who stopped to make offerings. Within 
      minutes, my bowl was weighed down with fruits, biscuits, pancakes, rice 
      and coconut delicacies, and fried noodles - each wrapped in a colourful 
      plastic bag.</P>
      <P>The early Sunday morning shoppers, primarily local Chinese, know what 
      to do when they meet someone in robes going for alms. In this society, 
      Buddhist nuns rarely go <I>pindapat</I>, and the monks who beg often 
      accept money. Today they saw a nun - a foreigner - receiving only 
      offerings of food into her bowl.</P>
      <P>Word spread. Whenever people tried to give money, I had to be quick to 
      cover my bowl with my hand. Amazed, they returned with sweetmeats, sticky 
      rice, or fruits. More came, and when my bowl was brimming, they piled 
      their offerings into a growing collection of pink plastic bags at my feet. 
      With all this attention, I was distracted from my normal practice of 
      focusing on the bowl and meditating on emptiness.</P>
      <P>The first time someone knelt and made <I>anjali</I>, I quickly removed 
      my sandals before chanting a blessing, <I>Sukhi hotu, avera hotu, 
      abhayapaja hotu</I>. I had not wandered out barefoot as the Buddha would 
      have done because of the rubbish everywhere but it felt wrong to receive 
      her respect wearing shoes. Remembering how I had thrown off my sandals and 
      walked the filthy streets of Yangon last year to beg for alms inspired me 
      to be barefoot again.</P>
      <P>I continued to stand, softly chanting the <I>Dhammacakkappavattana 
      Sutta</I> to myself and giving blessings each time someone placed more 
      food in my bowl. I felt the turning of the wheel of Dharma and reflected 
      on the thousands of years that this way of begging and receiving has 
      nurtured the faithful. And here again, it was being upheld by simple acts 
      of kindness - now a child with a bag of fried rolls, now a woman with 
      jackfruit, now an Indian man curious to know from which country I hailed.</P>
      <P>Some asked whether to place their offerings directly into the bags at 
      my feet when they saw the bowl overflowing. I wanted at least to accept 
      each offering in my hand if I could not with my bowl, and so create a 
      sense of connection and relationship, chant a blessing and bear witness to 
      their kindness.</P>
      <P>It was in one of these moments between the overflow of the bowl and the 
      rush of generosity that I suddenly felt a hypocrite. I was well-fed, 
      staying with my devotee, lacking nothing, and the bags were spilling out 
      beside me.</P>
      <P>What right did I have to stand there and beg? How could I dare hold my 
      bowl out to be filled again and again when so much had already been given? 
      What right did I have even to begin to beg? Stifling and sweating in my 
      robes, these questions crowded my mind. I remembered the story of the 
      Sorcerer&#39;s Apprentice who tried to clean while the brooms multiplied and 
      kept bringing more water... It seemed absurd to be juggling so many bags 
      of food when I had no hunger in my belly.</P>
      <P>Not even half an hour had elapsed. Embarrassed, anxious, and feeling 
      unworthy of receiving the tide of generosity, I fretfully looked about 
      hoping my devotee would return soon to collect me. And then, to calm my 
      mind, I began to chant more loudly.</P>
      <P>Contemplating the Four Noble Truths, with eyes downcast, I watched the 
      feet of all who passed me - sandals of every colour and style, high heels 
      and broken shoes, human beings of all ages, shuffling, hobbling or brisk 
      in pace. Looking at their faces, I saw the bent, disabled and healthy, the 
      dishevelled and well-dressed, the shrivelled and overweight, smiles and 
      grimaces, distracted expressions and down-turned mouths, mothers, infants, 
      a father grasping the hand of his small son, bicycles and litter, traders 
      shouting and the smells of the market, the world - the World.</P>
      <P>My heart grew bright with compassion. I knew that I was standing there 
      to let my bowl be filled again and again by those who love Truth. Hungry 
      or not, I had every right to receive what they freely gave. I was not 
      abusing that beauty because it was not for me that they filled the bowl. I 
      was a beggar for love of that blessedness, and the filling and emptying of 
      my bowl was the natural process of each of our lives being remembered and 
      honoured in random acts of kindness. I receive and I give back.</P>
