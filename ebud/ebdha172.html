    <td width="100%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">K</font>amma is the law of
    moral causation. The theory of kamma is a fundamental doctrine in Buddhism. This belief
    was prevalent in India before the advent of the Buddha. Nevertheless, it was the Buddha
    who explained and formulated this doctrine in the complete form in which we have it today.
    </font><blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">What is the cause of the inequality that exists among
      mankind? <br>
      Why should one person be brought up in the lap of luxury, endowed with fine mental, moral
      and physical qualities, and another in absolute poverty, steeped in misery? <br>
      Why should one person be a mental prodigy, and another an idiot? <br>
      Why should one person be born with saintly characteristics and another with criminal
      tendencies? <br>
      Why should some be linguistic, artistic, mathematically inclined, or musical from the very
      cradle? <br>
      Why should others be congenitally blind, deaf, or deformed? <br>
      Why should some be blessed, and others cursed from their births? </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Either this inequality of mankind has a cause, or it is
    purely accidental. No sensible person would think of attributing this unevenness, this
    inequality, and this diversity to blind chance or pure accident. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this world nothing happens to a person that he does not
    for some reason or other deserve. Usually, men of ordinary intellect cannot comprehend the
    actual reason or reasons. The definite invisible cause or causes of the visible effect is
    not necessarily confined to the present life, they may be traced to a proximate or remote
    past birth. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to Buddhism, this inequality is due not only to
    heredity, environment, &quot;nature and nurture&quot;, but also to kamma. In other words,
    it is the result of our own past actions and our own present doings. We ourselves are
    responsible for our own happiness and misery. We create our own Heaven. We create our own
    Hell. We are the architects of our own fate. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Perplexed by the seemingly inexplicable, apparent
    disparity that existed among humanity, a young truth-seeker approached the Buddha and
    questioned him regarding this intricate problem of inequality: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;What is the cause, what is the reason, O Lord,&quot;
    questioned he, &quot;that we find amongst mankind the short-lived and long-lived, the
    healthy and the diseased, the ugly and beautiful, those lacking influence and the
    powerful, the poor and the rich, the low-born and the high-born, and the ignorant and the
    wise?&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha's reply was: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>&quot;All living beings have actions (kamma) as their
      own, their inheritance, their congenital cause, their kinsman, their refuge. It is kamma
      that differentiates beings into low and high states.&quot; </em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He then explained the cause of such differences in
    accordance with the law of cause and effect. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Certainly we are born with hereditary characteristics. At
    the same time we possess certain innate abilities that science cannot adequately account
    for. To our parents we are indebted for the gross sperm and ovum that form the nucleus of
    this so-called being. They remain dormant within each parent until this potential germinal
    compound is vitalised by the karmic energy needed for the production of the foetus. kamma
    is therefore the indispensable conceptive cause of this being. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The accumulated karmic tendencies, inherited in the course
    of previous lives, at times play a far greater role than the hereditary parental cells and
    genes in the formation of both physical and mental characteristics. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha, for instance, inherited, like every other
    person, the reproductive cells and genes from his parents. But physically, morally and
    intellectually there was none comparable to him in his long line of Royal ancestors. In
    the Buddha's own words, he belonged not to the Royal lineage, but to that of the Aryan
    Buddhas. He was certainly a superman, an extraordinary creation of his own kamma. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the Lakkhana Sutta of Digha Nikaya, the
    Buddha inherited exceptional features, such as the 32 major marks, as the result of his
    past meritorious deeds. The ethical reason for acquiring each physical feature is clearly
    explained in the Sutta. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is obvious from this unique case that karmic tendencies
    could not only influence our physical organism, but also nullify the potentiality of the
    parental cells and genes &#150; hence the significance of the Buddha's enigmatic
    statement, - &quot;We are the heirs of our own actions.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dealing with this problem of variation, the Atthasalini,
    being a commentary on the Abhidharma, states: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>&quot;Depending on this difference in kamma appears
      the differences in the birth of beings, high and low, base and exalted, happy and
      miserable. Depending on the difference in kamma appears the difference in the individual
      features of beings as beautiful and ugly, high-born or low born, well-built or deformed.
      Depending on the difference in kamma appears the difference in worldly conditions of
      beings, such as gain and loss, and disgrace, blame and praise, happiness and misery.&quot;
      </em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, from a Buddhist point of view, our present mental,
    moral intellectual and temperamental differences are, for the most part, due to our own
    actions and tendencies, both past and present. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although Buddhism attributes this variation to kamma, as
    being the chief cause among a variety, it does not, however, assert that everything is due
    to kamma. The law of kamma, important as it is, is only one of the twenty-four conditions
    described in Buddhist Philosophy. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Refuting the erroneous view that &quot;whatsoever fortune
    or misfortune experienced is all due to some previous action&quot;, the Buddha said: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>&quot;So, then, according to this view, owing to
      previous action men will become murderers, thieves, unchaste, liars, slanderers, covetous,
      malicious and perverts. Thus, for those who fall back on the former deeds as the essential
      reason, there is neither the desire to do, nor effort to do, nor necessity to do this
      deed, or abstain from this deed.&quot; </em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It was this important text, which states the belief that
    all physical circumstances and mental attitudes spring solely from past kamma that Buddha
    contradicted. If the present life is totally conditioned or wholly controlled by our past
    actions, then certainly kamma is tantamount to fatalism or determinism or predestination.
    If this were true, free will would be an absurdity. Life would be purely mechanistic, not
    much different from a machine. Being created by an Almighty God who controls our destinies
    and predetermines our future, or being produced by an irresistible kamma that completely
    determines our fate and controls our life's course, independent of any free action on our
    part, is essentially the same. The only difference lies in the two words God and kamma.
    One could easily be substituted for the other, because the ultimate operation of both
    forces would be identical. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Such a fatalistic doctrine is not the Buddhist law of
    kamma. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to Buddhism, there are five orders or processes<em>
    (niyama) </em>which operate in the physical and mental realms. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">They are: </font><ol>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Utu Niyama </strong>- physical inorganic order,
        e.g. seasonal phenomena of winds and rains. The unerring order of seasons, characteristic
        seasonal changes and events, causes of winds and rains, nature of heat, etc., all belong
        to this group. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Bija Niyama</strong> - order of germs and seeds
        (physical organic order), e.g. rice produced from rice-seed, sugary taste from sugar-cane
        or honey, peculiar characteristics of certain fruits, etc. The scientific theory of cells
        and genes and the physical similarity of twins may be ascribed to this order. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Kamma Niyama</strong> - order of act and result,
        e.g., desirable and undesirable acts produce corresponding good and bad results. As surely
        as water seeks its own level so does kamma, given opportunity, produce its inevitable
        result, not in the form of a reward or punishment but as an innate sequence. This sequence
        of deed and effect is as natural and necessary as the way of the sun and the moon. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Dhamma Niyama</strong> - order of the norm, e.g.,
        the natural phenomena occurring at the advent of a Bodhisattva in his last birth.
        Gravitation and other similar laws of nature. The natural reason for being good and so
        forth, my be included in this group. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Citta Niyama</strong> - order or mind or psychic
        law, e.g., processes of consciousness, arising and perishing of consciousness,
        constituents of consciousness, power of mind, etc., including telepathy, telaesthesia,
        retro-cognition, premonition, clairvoyance, clairaudience, thought-reading and such other
        psychic phenomena which are inexplicable to modern science. </font></li>
    </ol>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Every mental or physical phenomenon could be explained by
    these all-embracing five orders or processes which are laws in themselves. kamma as such
    is only one of these five orders. Like all other natural laws they demand no lawgiver. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of these five, the physical inorganic order and the order
    of the norm are more or less mechanistic, though they can be controlled to some extent by
    human ingenuity and the power of mind. For example, fire normally burns, and extreme cold
    freezes, but man has walked scatheless over fire and meditated naked on Himalayan snows;
    horticulturists have worked marvels with flowers and fruits; Yogis have performed
    levitation. Psychic law is equally mechanistic, but Buddhist training aims at control of
    mind, which is possible by right understanding and skilful volition. kamma law operates
    quite automatically and, when the kamma is powerful, man cannot interfere with its
    inexorable result though he may desire to do so; but here also right understanding and
    skilful volition can accomplish much and mould the future. Good kamma, persisted in, can
    thwart the reaping of bad kamma, or as some Western scholars prefer to say 'action
    influence', is certainly an intricate law whose working is fully comprehended only by a
    Buddha. The Buddhist aims at the final destruction of all kamma. </font></p>
    <strong><p ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000C1" face="Times New Roman">WHAT IS KARMMA? </font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Pali term kamma literally means action or doing. Any
    kind of intentional action whether mental, verbal, or physical, is regarded as kamma. It
    covers all that is included in the phrase &quot;thought, word and deed&quot;. Generally
    speaking, all good and bad action constitutes kamma. In its ultimate sense kamma means all
    moral and immoral volition. Involuntary, unintentional or unconscious actions, though
    technically deeds, do not constitute kamma, because volition, the most important factor in
    determining kamma, is absent. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha says: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>&quot;I declare, O Bhikkhus, that volition is kamma.
      Having willed one acts by body, speech, and thought.&quot; (Anguttara Nikaya) </em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Every volitional action of individuals, save those of
    Buddhas and Arahants, is called kamma. The exception made in their case is because they
    are delivered from both good and evil; they have eradicated ignorance and craving, the
    roots of kamma. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Destroyed are their germinal seeds <em>(Khina bija)</em>;
    selfish desires no longer grow,&quot; states the Ratana Sutta of Sutta nipata. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This does not mean that the Buddha and Arahantas are
    passive. They are tirelessly active in working for the real well being and happiness of
    all. Their deeds ordinarily accepted as good or moral, lack creative power as regards
    themselves. Understanding things as they truly are, they have finally shattered their
    cosmic fetters &#150; the chain of cause and effect. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">kamma does not necessarily mean past actions. It embraces
    both past and present deeds. Hence in one sense, we are the result of what we were; we
    will be the result of what we are. In another sense, it should be added, we are not
    totally the result of what we were; we will not absolutely be the result of what we are.
    The present is no doubt the offspring of the past and is the present of the future, but
    the present is not always a true index of either the past or the future; so complex is the
    working of kamma. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is this doctrine of kamma that the mother teaches her
    child when she says &quot;Be good and you will be happy and we will love you; but if you
    are bad, you will be unhappy and we will not love you.&quot; In short, kamma is the law of
    cause and effect in the ethical realm. </font></p>
    <strong><p ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000C1" face="Times New Roman">KAMMA AND VIPAKA </font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kamma is action, and Vipaka, fruit or result, is its
    reaction. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Just as every object is accompanied by a shadow, even so
    every volitional activity is inevitably accompanied by its due effect. kamma is like
    potential seed: Vipaka could be likened to the fruit arising from the tree &#150; the
    effect or result. Anisamsa and Adinaya are the leaves, flowers and so forth that
    correspond to external differences such as health, sickness and poverty &#150; these are
    inevitable consequences, which happen at the same time. Strictly speaking, both kamma and
    Vipaka pertain to the mind. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As kamma may be good or bad, so may Vipaka, - the fruit
    &#150; is good or bad. As kamma is mental so Vipaka is mental (of the mind). It is
    experienced as happiness, bliss, unhappiness or misery, according to the nature of the
    kamma seed. <em>Anisamsa</em> are the concomitant advantages &#150; material things such
    as prosperity, health and longevity. When Vipaka's concomitant material things are
    disadvantageous, they are known as <em>Adinaya</em>, full of wretchedness, and appear as
    poverty, ugliness, disease, short life-span and so forth. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As we sow, we reap somewhere and sometime, in his life or
    in a future birth. What we reap today is what we have sown either in the present or in the
    past. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Samyutta Nikaya states: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>&quot;According to the seed that's sown, <br>
      So is the fruit you reap there from, <br>
      Doer of good will gather good, <br>
      Doer of evil, evil reaps, <br>
      Down is the seed and thou shalt taste <br>
      The fruit thereof.&quot; </em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kamma is a law in itself, which operates in its own field
    without the intervention of any external, independent ruling agency. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Happiness and misery, which are the common lot of
    humanity, are the inevitable effects of causes. From a Buddhist point of view, they are
    not rewards and punishments, assigned by a supernatural, omniscient ruling power to a soul
    that has done good or evil. Theists, who attempt to explain everything in this and
    temporal life and in the eternal future life, ignoring a past, believe in a 'postmortem'
    justice, and may regard present happiness and misery as blessings and curses conferred on
    His creation by an omniscient and omnipotent Divine Ruler who sits in heaven above
    controlling the destinies of the human race. Buddhism, which emphatically denies such an
    Almighty, All merciful God-Creator and an arbitrarily created immortal soul, believes in
    natural law and justice which cannot be suspended by either an Almighty God or an
    All-compassionate Buddha. According to this natural law, acts bear their own rewards and
    punishments to the individual doer whether human justice finds out or not. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are some who criticise thus: &quot;So, you
    Buddhists, too, administer capitalistic opium to the people, saying: &quot;You are born
    poor in this life on account of your past evil kamma. He is born rich on account of his
    good kamma. So, be satisfied with your humble lot; but do good to be rich in your next
    life. You are being oppressed now because of your past evil kamma. There is your destiny.
    Be humble and bear your sufferings patiently. Do good now. You can be certain of a better
    and happier life after death.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddhist doctrine of kamma does not expound such
    ridiculous fatalistic views. Nor does it vindicate a postmortem justice. The All-Merciful
    Buddha, who had no ulterior selfish motives, did not teach this law of kamma to protect
    the rich and comfort the poor by promising illusory happiness in an after-life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While we are born to a state created by ourselves, yet by
    our own self-directed efforts there is every possibility for us to create new, favourable
    environments even here and now. Not only individually, but also, collectively, we are at
    liberty to create fresh kamma that leads either towards our progress or downfall in this
    very life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the Buddhist doctrine of kamma, one is not
    always compelled by an 'iron necessity', for kamma is neither fate, nor predestination
    imposed upon us by some mysterious unknown power to which we must helplessly submit
    ourselves. It is one's own doing reacting on oneself, and so one has the possibility to
    divert the course of one's kamma to some extent. How far one diverts it depends on
    oneself. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Is one bound to reap all that one has sown in just
    proportion? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha provides an answer: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>&quot;If anyone says that a man or woman must reap in
      this life according to his present deeds, in that case there is no religious life, nor is
      an opportunity afforded for the entire extinction of sorrow. But if anyone says that what
      a man or woman reaps in this and future lives accords with his or her deeds present and
      past, in that case there is a religious life, and an opportunity is afforded for the
      entire extinction of a sorrow.&quot; (Anguttara Nikaya) </em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although it is stated in the Dhammapada that &quot;not in
    the sky, nor in mid-ocean, or entering a mountain cave is found that place on earth where
    one may escape from (the consequences of) an evil deed&quot;, yet one is not bound to pay
    all the past arrears of one's kamma. If such were the case emancipation would be
    impossibility. Eternal recurrence would be the unfortunate result. </font></p>
    <strong><p ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000C1" face="Times New Roman">WHAT IS THE CAUSE
    OF KAMMA? </font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ignorance <em>(avijja)</em>, or not knowing things as they
    truly are, is the chief cause of kamma. Dependent on ignorance arise activities <em>(avijja
    paccaya samkhara</em>) states the Buddha in the <em>Paticca Samuppada</em> (Dependent
    Origination). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Associated with ignorance is the ally craving (<em>tanha</em>),
    the other root of kamma. Evil actions are conditioned by these two causes. All good deeds
    of a worldling <em>(putthujana)</em>, though associated with the three wholesome roots of
    generosity <em>(alobha</em>), goodwill <em>(adosa)</em> and knowledge <em>(amoha)</em>,
    are nevertheless regarded as kamma because the two roots of ignorance and craving are
    dormant in him. The moral types of Supramundane Path Consciousness <em>(magga citta)</em>
    are not regarded as kamma because they tend to eradicate the two root causes. </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Who is the doer of kamma? <br>
      Who reaps the fruit of kamma? <br>
      Does kamma mould a soul? </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In answering these subtle questions, the Venerable
    Buddhaghosa writes in the Visuddhi Magga: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>&quot;No doer is there who does the deed; <br>
      Nor is there one who feels the fruit; <br>
      Constituent parts alone roll on; <br>
      This indeed! Is right discernment.&quot; </em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For instance, the table we see is apparent reality. In an
    ultimate sense the so-called table consists of forces and qualities. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For ordinary purposes a scientist would use the term
    water, but in the laboratory he would say H<sub>2</sub>0. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this same way, for conventional purposes, such terms as
    man, woman, being, self, and so forth are used. The so-called fleeting forms consist of
    psychophysical phenomena, which are constantly changing not remaining the same for two
    consecutive moments. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhists, therefore, do not believe in an unchanging
    entity, in an actor apart from action, in a perceiver apart from perception, in a
    conscious subject behind consciousness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Who then, is the doer of kamma? Who experiences the
    effect? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Volition, or Will <em>(tetana)</em>, is itself the doer,
    Feeling <em>(vedana)</em> is itself the reaper of the fruits of actions. Apart from these
    pure mental states <em>(suddhadhamma</em>) there is no-one to sow and no-one to reap. </font></p>
    <strong><p ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000C1" face="Times New Roman">CLASSIFICATION OF
    KAMMA </font></strong></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font color="#0000C1" face="Times New Roman"><strong>(A) With respect to
    different functions, kamma is classified into four kinds: </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. REPRODUCTIVE KAMMA </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Every birth is conditioned by a past good or bad kamma,
      which predominated at the moment of death. kamma that conditions the future birth is
      called Reproductive kamma. The death of a person is merely 'a temporary end of a temporary
      phenomenon'. Though the present form perishes, another form which is neither the same nor
      absolutely different takes its place, according to the potential thought-vibration

      Supportive Kamma. The Counteractive or Obstructive kamma came into operation when he was

    <strong><p ALIGN="left"><font color="#0000C1" face="Times New Roman">(B) There is another
    classification of kamma, according to the priority of effect: </font></p>
    <ol>
      </strong>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">WEIGHTY <em>(GARUKA)</em> KAMMA. </font></li>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is either weighty or serious &#150; may be either
      good or bad. It produces its results in this life or in the next for certain. If good, it
      is purely mental as in the case of Jhana (ecstasy or absorption). Otherwise it is verbal
      or bodily. On the Immoral side, there are five immediate effective heinous crimes <em>(pancanantariya
      kamma)</em>: Matricide, Patricide, and the murder of an Arahant, the wounding of a Buddha
      and the creation of a schism in the Sangha. Permanent Scepticism <em>(Niyata Micchaditthi)</em>
      is also termed one of the Weighty<em> (garuka)</em> kammas. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">If, for instance, any person were to develop the <em>jhana</em>
      (ecstasy or absorption) and later were to commit one of these heinous crimes, his good
      kamma would be obliterated by the powerful evil kamma. His subsequent birth would be
      conditioned by the evil kamma in spite of his having gained the <em>jhana</em> earlier.
      Devadatta lost his psychic power and was born in an evil state, because he wounded the
      Buddha and caused a schism in the Sangha. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">King Ajatasattu would have attained the first stage of
      Sainthood <em>(Sotapanna)</em> if he had not committed patricide. In this case the
      powerful evil kamma acted as an obstacle to his gaining Sainthood. </font></p>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">PROXIMATE <em>(ASANNA)</em> KAMMA OR DEATH-PROXIMATE KAMMA</font></li>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is that which one does or remembers immediately
      before the moment of dying. Owing to the great part it plays in determining the future
      birth, much importance is attained to this deathbed <em>(asanna</em>) kamma in almost all
      Buddhist countries. The customs of reminding the dying man of good deeds and making him do
      good acts on his deathbed still prevails in Buddhist countries. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes a bad person may die happily and receive a good
      birth if he remembers or does a good act at the last moment. A story runs that a certain
      executioner who casually happened to give some alms to the Venerable Sariputta remembered
      this good act at the dying moment and was born in a state of bliss. This does not mean
      that although he enjoys a good birth he will be exempt from the effects of the evil deeds
      which he accumulated during his lifetime. They will have there due effect as occasions
      arise. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">At times a good person may die unhappy by suddenly
      remembering an evil act of his or by harbouring some unpleasant thought, perchance
      compelled by unfavourable circumstances. In the scriptures, Queen Mallika, the consort of
      King Kosala, remembering a lie she had uttered, suffered for about seven days in a state
      of misery when she lied to her husband to cover some misbehaviour. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">These are exceptional cases. Such reverse changes of birth
      account for the birth of virtuous children to vicious parents and of vicious children to
      virtuous parents. As a result of the last thought moment being conditioned by the general
      conduct of the person. </font></p>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">HABITUAL <em>(ACCINA) </em>KAMMA </font></li>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is that which on habitually performs and recollects and
      for which one has a great liking. Habits whether good or bad becomes ones second nature,
      tending to form the character of a person. At unguarded moments one often lapses into
      one's habitual mental mindset. In the same way, at the death-moment, unless influenced by
      other circumstances, one usually recalls to mind one's habitual deeds. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Cunda, a butcher, who was living in the vicinity of the
      Buddha's monastery, died yelling like an animal because he was earning his living by
      slaughtering pigs. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">King Dutthagamini of Ceylon (Sri Lanka) was in the habit
      of giving alms to the Bhikkhus (monks) before he took his own meals. It was his habitual
      kamma that gladdened him at the dying moment and gave him birth in the Tusita heaven. </font></p>

    <p ALIGN="center"><strong><font color="#0000C1" face="Times New Roman">QUESTIONS ON THE
    THEORY OF KAMMA </font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>Question:</strong> Do the kammas of parents
    determine or affect the kammas of their children? </em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Answer:</strong> Physically, the kamma of children
    is generally determined by the kamma of their parents. Thus, healthy parents usually have
    healthy offspring, and unhealthy parents have unhealthy children. On the effect or how the
    kamma of their children is determined: the child's kamma is a thing apart of itself &#150;
    it forms the child's individuality, the sum-total of its merits and demerits accumulated
    in innumerable past existences. For example, the kamma of the Buddha-to-be, Prince
    Siddhattha was certainly not influenced by the joint kamma of his parents, King Suddhodana
    and Queen Maya. The glorious and powerful kamma of our Buddha-to-be transcended the kamma
    of his parents which jointly were more potent than his own. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>Question:</strong> If the kamma of parents do
    not influence those of their children, how would the fact be explained that parents who
    suffer from certain virulent diseases are apt to transmit these evils to their offsprings?
    </em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Answer: </strong>Where a child inherit such a
    disease it is due to the force of the parents' characteristics because of the force of the
    latter's Utu (conditions favourable to germination). Take, for example, two seeds from a
    sapling; plant one in inferior, dry soil; and the other in rich, moist soil. The result is
    that the first seed will sprout into a sickly sapling and soon show symptoms of disease
    and decay; while the other seed will thrive and flourish and grow up to be a tall and
    healthy tree. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It will be observed that the pair of seeds taken from the
    same stock grows up differently according to the soil into which they are put. A child's
    past kamma may be compared to the seed: the physical disposition of the mother to the
    soil; and that of the father to the moisture, which fertilised the soil. Roughly speaking,
    to illustrate our subject, we will say that, representing the sapling's germination,
    growth, and existence as a unit, the seed is responsible for one-tenth of them, the soil
    for six-tenths, and the moisture for the remainder, three-tenths. Thus, although the power
    of germination exists potentially in the seed (the child), its growth is powerfully
    determined and quickened by the soil (the mother) and the moisture (the father). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore, even as the conditions of the soil and moisture
    must be taken as largely responsible factors in the growth and condition of the tree. So
    must the influences of the parents (or progenitors, as in the case of the animal world) be
    taken into account in respect to the conception and growth of their offspring. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The parents' share in the kamma determining the physical
    factors of their issue is as follows: If they are human beings, then their offspring will
    be a human being. If they are cattle then their issue must be of their species. If the
    human being is Chinese, then their offspring must be of their race. Thus, the offspring
    are invariably of the same genera and species, etc., as those of the progenitors. It will
    be seen from the above that, although a child's kamma is very powerful in itself, if
    cannot remain wholly uninfluenced by those of it parents. It is apt to inherit the
    physical characteristic of its parents. Yet, it may occur that the child's kamma, being
    superlatively powerful, the influence of the parent's joint kamma cannot overshadow it. Of
    course, it need hardly be pointed out that the evil influences of parents can also be
    counteracted by the application of medical science. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All beings born of sexual cohabitation are the resultant
    effects of three forces: </font><ol>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">The old kamma of past existence; </font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">The seminal fluid of the mother, and </font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">The seminal fluid of the father. </font></li>
    </ol>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The physical dispositions of the parents may, or may not,
    be equal in force. One may counteract the other to a lesser or greater extent. The child's
    kamma and physical characteristics, such as race, colour, etc., will be the produce of the
    three forces. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>Question:</strong> On the death of a sentient
    being, is there a 'soul' that wanders about at will? </em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Answer:</strong> When a sentient being leaves one
    existence, it is reborn either as a human being, a celestial being, (Deva or Brahama), and
    inferior animal, or a denizen of one of the regions of hell. The sceptics and the ignorant
    people held that there are intermediate stages &#150; <em>antrabhava</em> &#150; between
    these; and that there are being who are neither of the human, the celestial, the Deva or
    the Brahma worlds nor of any one of the stages of exist recognised in the scriptures
    &#150; but are in an intermediate stage. Some assert that these transitional stages are
    possessed of the Five Khandhas ( Five Aggregates: they are Matter <em>(rupa</em>); Feeling
    <em>(vedana</em>); Perception <em>(sanna</em>); 4. Mental-activities <em>(sankhara)</em>;
    and Consciousness<em> (vinnana).</em> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some assert that these beings are detached 'souls' or
    spirits with no material encasement, and some again, that they are possessed of the
    faculty of seeing like Devas, and further, that they have power of changing at will, at
    short intervals, from one to any of the existence mentioned above. Others again hold the
    fantastic and erroneous theory that these beings can, and so, fancy themselves to be in
    other than the existence they are actually in. Thus, to take for example one such of these
    suppositious beings. He is a poor person &#150; and yet he fancies himself to be rich. He
    may be in hell &#150; and yet he fancies himself to be in the land of the Devas, and so
    on. This belief in intermediate stages between existences is false, and is condemned in
    the Buddhist teachings. A human being in this life who, by his kamma is destined to be a
    human being in the next, will be reborn as such; one who by his kamma is destined to be a
    Deva in the next will be appear in the land of the Devas; and one whose future life is to
    be in Hell, will be found in one of the regions of hell in the next existence. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The idea of an entity or soul or spirit 'going', 'coming',
    'changing' or 'transmigrating' from one existence to another is an idea entertained by the
    ignorance and materialistic, and is certainly not justified by the Dhammas that there is
    no such thing as 'going', 'coming', 'changing', etc., as between existences. The
    conception, which is in accordance with the Dhamma, may perhaps be illustrated by the
    picture thrown out by a cinema projector, or the sound of emitted by the gramophone, and
    their relation to the film or the sound-box and records respectively. For example, a human
    being dies and is reborn in the land of Devas. Though these two existences are different,
    yet the link or continuity between the two at death is unbroken in point of time. The same
    is true in the case of a man whose further existence is to be in hell. The distance
    between Hell and the abode of man appears to be great. Yet, in point of time, the
    continuity of 'passage' from the one existence to the other is unbroken, and no
    intervening matter or space can interrupt the trend of a man's kamma from the world of
    human beings to the regions of Hell. The 'passage' from one existence to another is
    instantaneous, and the transition is infinitely quicker than the blink of an eyelid or a
    lightening-flash. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kamma determines the realm of rebirth and the state of
    existence in that realm of all transient being (in the cycle of existences, which have to
    be traversed till the attainment, at last, of Nibbana). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The results of kamma are manifold, and may be effected in
    many ways. Religious offerings <em>(dana)</em> may obtain for a man the privilege of
    rebirth as a human being, or as a deva, in one of the six deva worlds according to the
    degree of the merit of the deeds performed, and so with the observance of religious duties
    <em>(sila</em>). The jhanas or states of absorption, are found in the Brahma world or
    Brahmalokas up to the summit, the twentieth Brahma world: And so with bad deeds, the
    perpetrators of which are to be found , grade by grade, down to the lowest depths of Hell.
    Thus are kamma, past, present and future were, are, and will ever be the sum total of our
    deeds, good, indifferent or bad. As was seen from the foregoing, our kamma determines the
    changes of our existences. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Evil spirits&quot; are, therefore, not beings in an
    intermediate or transitional stages of existence, but are really very inferior beings, and
    they belong to one of the following five realms of existence: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. World of Men: 2. The Lowest plane of deva-world; 3. The
      region of hell; 4. Animals below men, and 5. Petas (ghosts). </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Number 2 and 5 are very near the world of human beings. As
    their condition is unhappy, and they are popularly considered evil spirits. It is not true
    that all who die in this world are reborn as evil spirits; nor is it true that beings who
    die sudden or violent deaths are apt to be reborn in the lowest plane of the world of
    devas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>Question:</strong> Is there such a thing as a
    human being who is reborn and who is able to speak accurately of his or her past
    existence? </em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Answer:</strong> Certainly, this is not an
    uncommon occurrence, and is in accordance with the tenets of Buddhism in respect to kamma.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The following (who form, an overwhelming majority of human
    beings) are generally unable to remember there past existences when reborn as human
    beings: Children who die young. Those who die old and senile. Those who are addicted to
    the drug or drink habit. Those whose mothers, during their conception, have been sickly or
    have had to toil laboriously, or have been reckless or imprudent during pregnancy. The
    children in the womb, being stunned and started, lose all knowledge of their past
    existence. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The following are possessed of a knowledge of their past
    existences, viz: Those who are not reborn (in the human world) but proceed to the world of
    the devas, of Brahmas, or to the regions of Hell, remember their past existences. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who die suddenly deaths from accidents, while in
    sound health, may also be possessed of this faculty in the next existence, provided that
    their mothers, in whose womb they are conceived, are healthy. Again, those who live
    steady, meritorious lives and who in their past existences have striven to attain, often
    attain it. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lastly the Buddha, the Arahantas and Ariyas attain this
    gift which is known as <em>pubbenivasa abhinna</em> (Supernatural Power remembering
    previous existences). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>Question:</strong> Which are the five Abhinna?
    Are they attainable only by the Buddha? </em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Answer:</strong> The five Abhinna (Supernatural
    Powers): Pali - <em>abhi</em>, excellent, <em>nana</em>, wisdom) are: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Iddhividha</em> = Creative power; <br>
      <em>Dibbasola</em> = Divine Ear; <br>
      <em>Cetopariya nana</em> = Knowledge of others' thoughts; <br>
      <em>Pubbenivasanussati</em> = Knowledge of one's past existence; <br>
      <em>Dibbacakkhu</em> = The Divine eye. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Abhinna are attainalbe not only by the Buddha, but
    also by Arantas and Ariyas, by ordinary mortals who practise according to the Scriptures
    (as was the case with hermits etc, who flourished before the time of the Buddha and who
    were able to fly through the air and traverse different worlds). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Buddhist Scriptures, we find, clearly shown, the
    means of attaining the five Abhinna. And even nowadays, if these means are carefully and
    perseveringly pursued, it would be possible to attain these. That we do not see any person
    endowed with the five Abhinna today is due to the lack of strenuous physical and mental
    exertion towards their attainment. </font></p>
    <strong><p ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000C1" face="Times New Roman">NATURE OF KAMMA </font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the working of kamma there are maleficent and
    beneficent forces and conditions to counteract and support this self-operating law. Birth <em>(gati</em>)
    time or condition <em>(kala</em>) substratum of rebirth or showing attachment to rebirth <em>(upadhi)</em>
    and effort <em>(payoga)</em> act as such powerful aids and hindrances to the fruition of
    kamma. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Though we are neither the absolutely the servants nor the
    masters of our kamma, it is evident from these counteractive and supportive factors that
    the fruition of kamma is influenced to some extent by external circumstances,
    surroundings, personality, individual striving, and so forth. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is this doctrine of kamma that gives consolation, hope,
    reliance and moral courage to a Buddhist. When the unexpected happens, and he meets with
    difficulties, failures, and misfortune, the Buddhist realises that he is reaping what he
    has sown, and he is wiping off a past debt. Instead of resigning himself, leaving
    everything to kamma, he makes a strenuous effort to pull the weeds and sow useful seeds in
    their place, for the future is in his own hands. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He who believes in kamma does not condemn even the most
    corrupt, for they, too, have their chance to reform themselves at any moment. Though bound
    to suffer in woeful states, they have hope of attaining eternal Peace. By their own doings
    they have created their own Hells, and by their own doings they can create their own
    Heavens, too. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A Buddhist who is fully convinced of the law of kamma does
    not pray to another to be saved but confidently relies on him for his own emancipation.
    Instead of making any self-surrender, or calling on any supernatural agency, he relies on
    his own will power, and works incessantly for the well-being and happiness of all. This
    belief in kamma validates his effort and kindles his enthusiasm, because it teaches
    individual responsibility. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To the ordinary Buddhist, kamma serves as a deterrent,
    while to an intellectual, it serves as in incentive to do good. He or she becomes kind,
    tolerant, and considerate. This law of kamma explains the problem of suffering, the
    mastery of so-called fate and predestination of other religions and about all the
    inequality of mankind. </font></td>
