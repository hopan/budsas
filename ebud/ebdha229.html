        life begins with our parents; the intellect is cultivated through our
        teachers; family life is adjusted through experience; the world is
        appreciated through friends and relations; interdependence is realised
        through our employment and our final goal is achieved through spiritual
        guides.&quot;</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Society is a complex unit consisting of
        individuals each having a specific relationship with one another. Each
        person has a special place within the order of things. Each has a set of
        duties to perform and the well-being of society depends on how each
        individual member functions in it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One essential requirement for a happy
        society is that the individuals constituting the society must have
        tranquillity of mind. This tranquillity of mind arises from purity of
        thought, word and action, which means the observance of an ethical
        lifestyle based on the five precepts. As human beings we are unique in
        our ability to see the difference between good and bad. We have the
        capacity to make moral choices and thereby to influence the pattern of
        our own lives and that of others. This influence is exerted through our
        thoughts, speech and actions. If we are able to develop an inner purity
        and strength, then we have the basis on which we can give, in all our
        relationships, what is needed by others. It is we who can create a
        harmonious and safe society.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The moral, economic and social stability
        and well-being of a society are all rooted in the life-long disciplines
        of family and marital relationships, training in the habitual use of
        reason to balance varied needs, to act for others' welfare, and to
        rejoice in others' good. These are the essential elements by which we
        grow together.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Society grows through a network of
        relationships which are mutually interdependent. Every relationship is a
        whole-hearted commitment to support and to cherish. The world is a
        society of beings who depend utterly upon one another. We can grow
        neither materially nor spiritually unless we are committed to one
        another. The function of all social bonds is to provide a life-path both
        as a realistic discipline and as an opportunity for fulfilment, which
        guides and rewards at every stage from birth to death. In this strong
        web of relationships, marriage plays a central part.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The relationships of parents and child,
        teacher and student, husband and wife, friend and companion, employer
        and employee, the ordained and the layman - these are the roles we play;
        these are the very framework of society. In the family we learn the
        values, skills and disciplines required to fulfill our roles in society
        at large. All these relationships are developed by generosity, kind and
        gentle speech, a life of service and the warm, responsive quality of the
        mind. This is how.self-development serves others. Let us appreciate that
        true freedom is found in the undying care and protection of the united
        family - given this, there need never be divorce or a breakdown of
        traditional morality.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhist teachings are designed to
        enable men and women to achieve fulfilment and satisfaction in this life
        through their own efforts, and to establish a social order for the
        welfare of all, that is, it advocates a way of life that ensures the
        creation of a healthy society. Buddhism also gives insight into the very
        nature of man and events. It makes available the means to develop a
        simple and practical discipline of life suited to one's own temperament
        and conditions. It creates a steady growth of confidence, generosity,
        moral energy, sensitivity, concentration and understanding. These are
        the pillars of both the spiritual and of the family life. Work,
        stability, generosity and joyfulness are the marks of such a life-style,
        and these are generated in a way that accommodates change and does not
        depend on superficial tastes; above all, such a bond is a shield against
        suffering. The basis of the Buddha's teaching is that every thought,
        word and deed has significance both for one's own welfare and for the
        welfare of others.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The life of marriage is a unique balance
        of enlightened self-interest and unselfish devotion. It should be a
        religious partnership, a relationship free to grow, with trust and
        freedom from fear. Different, but complementary, each partner develops
        strengths which support and sustain the other, neither is superior nor
        inferior - it should be a true partnership.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If, householders, both husband and
        wife hope to be in one another's sight so long as this life lasts and in
        the future life as well, they should have the same faith, the same
        virtue, the same generosity, the same wisdom; then they will be in one
        another's sight so long as this life lasts and in the future life as
        well.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This statement of the Buddha's
        emphasizes four qualities, which both partners should develop equally in
        their attitudes, outlook and modes of behaviour. These are faith,
        virtue, generosity and wisdom.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Each relationship is based on the
        intelligent commitment of one partner to the other. Each lives primarily
        to support, guard and guide the other. This spirit is one of loving
        acceptance. The fulfillment of the human heart and mind in marriage is
        finding a balanced way through a testing and unsatisfactory world, a
        slow and patient task of constant awareness and love. This is the path
        for those who seek to triumph over difficulties and limitations, to
        establish virtue, patience, concentration, wisdom and freedom. Rigid
        teaching about male and female roles, about rights and privileges, are
        most likely to generate differences of opinion, factions and
        disappointment. In short, marriage grows from understanding, not
        impulse; from true loyalty, not indulgence. Marriage functions as an
        understanding of the balance of the needs of many, not the private
        satisfaction of the two immediate partners. The institution of marriage
        provides a basis for nurture and culture, and protection from
        loneliness, deprivation and fear. A wholesome, secure and loving
        relationship in marriage is of the utmost importance to the well-being
        of the family and of society.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The legends contained in the Jataka
        stories provide many excellent similes which help to clarify the
        teachings of the Buddha. In the Rukkhadamma story (Jataka no.74) we find
        expressed the value of solidarity:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;It is meet that kinsfolk should
        dwell together in concord and unity. For, when kinsfolk are at one,
        enemies find no opportunity. Not to speak only of human beings, even
        sense-lacking trees ought to stand together. For in bygone days in the
        Himalayas a tempest struck a Sal-forest; yet, because the trees, shrubs,
        bushes, and creepers of the forest were interlaced with one another, the
        tempest could not overthrow even a single tree but passed harmlessly
        over their heads. But alone in a courtyard stood a mighty tree; and
        though it had many stems and branches, yet, because it was not united
        with other trees, the tempest uprooted it and laid it low. Wherefore, it
        is meet that you too should dwell together in concord and unity.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The moral code comes first in family
        life, without which selfish desires and resentment might leave no
        relationship unharmed. In the family the parent is committed to
        guarding, supporting and guiding the child equally in pain and in
        pleasure, in success and in failure, remembering that authority is bound
        up with forgiveness. A family which trains in coping with pain and
        disappointment, pleasure and greed, is itself the best institution of
        education. This training of the conscience is provided through the two
        great protectors of righteousness - shame <i>(hiri)</i> and fear <i>(ottappa)</i>.
        <i>Hiri </i>is the embarrassment felt by an individual if one finds
        onself not adhering to the good behavioural pattern that one expects of
        oneself; <i>ottappa</i> is the dread of punishment or retribution if one
        is caught committing some wrong or the dread of the kammic result of
        such an unwholesome act. Conscience develops as one finds one cannot
        bear to break the family code or to be seen dishonouring it. What
        greater shame is there than to destroy the very trust that feeds us,
        which is the source of our pride and joy? With trust and mutual respect,
        with confidence in each others' responses, the family becomes a closely
        and strictly ordered unit in which the respect for age and respect for
        seniority felt in the mind is expressed by acts of both body and speech.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">No true religion and no good society can
        develop where the relationship of parents and children is not cherished
        above all. According to the Buddhist teaching, the family is the most
        important and formative association for the socialisation of the human
        infant. Sons and daughters learn various things under various teachers
        when they grow up, but the first, most important lessons they learn at
        home from their parents - like how to talk, how to eat, how to clean
        themselves, how to behave, etc. Hence the Buddha said that parents are
        Brahmà - God - and also are the first teachers: &quot;Brahmà is a term
        for parents. Early teachers is the term for parents. Parents are worthy
        of offerings, because the mother and father do much for children. They
        bring them up, nourish them, and introduce them to the world.&quot; No
        matter where the parents may be when the children grow older, they
        should visit their parents and offer them all their necessary
        requirements and gifts. That is why the Buddha said they are Worthy of
        Offerings. When the Buddha was asked, &quot;Who are the gods?&quot; he
        replied, &quot;Let your father and your mother be your gods.&quot;
        Brahmà is believed to have four noble qualities <i>(Brahma Vihàras</i>),
        namely: loving kindness <i>(mettà)</i>, compassion <i>(karunà)</i>,
        appreciative joy <i>(mudità)</i>, and equanimity <i>(upekkha)</i>.
        Parents maintain these four qualities towards their children throughout
        all the different events of life from the moment of conception onwards.
        Therefore, the reciprocal relationship between parents and.children, and
        the attitude of parents towards their children, are fashioned by these
        four qualities. The Buddha advised his followers to widen these feelings
        to apply them to all - these social feelings are to regulate our
        relationship towards our fellow-beings as well as between the individual
        and society. At the beginning these are social qualities, yet they can
        be developed into spiritual states which are highly blissful if
        cultivated properly.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When a child is born it is unable to
        live even for a few days without the help of someone else. It is the
        parents who look after and nurse him. Parents have to provide all the
        essential care until the child becomes grown up and is in a position to
        live without the help of others. The love of parents towards their
        children is beyond words, it is limitless. They do everything humanly
        possible to care for their children. They look after them, even going
        without proper sleep themselves, and they spend sleepless nights for the
        sake of their children. They nurse them, feed them, wash them, clean
        them and arrange for their comforts to the best of their ability.
        Parents are willing to spend all their wealth and forgo their own
        comforts for the sake of their children. They spend lavishly on their
        children's education, their one and only purpose being to see their
        children prosper and live happily. Their children's joy is their joy,
        their children's prosperity is their prosperity. If the child falls into
        any difficulty, his parents are also distressed and miserable. Limitless
        is the assistance and help which are rendered by parents to their
        children.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;As a mother gives up her own life
        for the sake of her child...&quot;</font></i><font face="Times New Roman">
        This quotation is from the Buddha's sermon on Loving-kindness, the Metta
        Sutta. This self-sacrificing love, love that seeks to protect and
        benefit, to feed and teach, even at the extreme cost, is a mother's
        love. It is this love that the Buddha taught. It is practical, caring
        and generous, and it is selfless. But this love should not be kept just
        for one's own child, this is the love to radiate to all of humanity, in
        fact to all beings.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the Sigalovada Sutta, which
        deals with the code of conduct for the laity, there are five duties to
        be performed by parents towards their children. These are:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. The parents should dissuade their
        children from doing evil. Parents are the first school for their
        children, where they learn their elementary lessons in good and evil.
        Therefore, parents should be very careful to steer their children away
        from all kinds of evil, such as lying, cheating, dishonesty, revenge and
        so on.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. The second duty of parents is that
        they should persuade their children to do good. By their words and by
        their example parents should persuade them to develop and manifest good
        qualities, such as kindness, obedience, courage, honesty, perseverance,
        simplicity, good manners and other kinds of virtue.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. The third duty of parents is that
        they should give their children a good education. The best legacy that
        parents can bequeath to their children is proper, decent education.
        There is no treasure more valuable for a human being than a good
        education. Parents should see that their children learn a suitable art
        or science along, of course, with good ethical and moral principles.
        Education develops discipline, and the disciplined person is a blessing
        to any nation or country.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. The fourth duty is that parents
        should arrange a suitable partner in marriage for their children. There
        are two types of marriages, i.e. love marriages and arranged marriages.
        Marriages are either brought about by love or they are arranged by
        parents. It is a paramount duty of parents to see whether the marriage
        of their children would develop into a life-long companionship, because
        marriage should start with love coupled with the advice of the parents.
        It should, however, develop later in life into a companionship. The wife
        is called in Buddhist literature &quot;the second most important person
        in one's life&quot;, the Pali term is <i>&quot;dutiya&quot;</i>. The
        wife is also called &quot;the best friend&quot; <i>(Bhariyà paramà
        sakhà)</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If husband and wife do not assist each
        other, do not love each other, do not share their happiness and sorrow
        with each other, do not look after each other, do not respect each
        other, their experience will be life-long misery. The parents have the
        right to advise their children with regard to their proposed marriages.
        Parents should admonish them and explain the duties of a husband and
        wife as given in the Sigalovada Sutta.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">5. The fifth duty of parents is that at
        the proper time they should hand over their inheritance to their
        children. During their lifetime loving parents not only do everything
        for the prosperity and well-being of their children, but they also make
        all preparations and arrangements for their future comfort and
        well-being. Their ancestral property, together with their hard-earned
        wealth, form a proper bequest or legacy.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhists are taught that parents are
        for the child as the earth itself is to all plants and creatures. The
        debt of moral obligations can never be repaid to one's parents, even if
        one were to sacrifice one's life for their sake. If a child ministers to
        his parents with everything possible for a hundred years, if he
        establishes his parents in supreme authority in absolute rule over the
        mighty earth, not even thus could he repay his debt to his parents. This
        is emphasized by the Buddha <i>(Gradual Sayings </i>I, Book of Twos
        4-2), &quot;I declare that one can never repay two people, namely mother
        and father. Even if one carries about one's mother on one shoulder and
        one's father on the other, and doing so would live a hundred years...
        Even if one establishes one's parents in supreme authority, in the
        absolute supremacy over all the world... even then one could not repay
        them. Why so? The reason is that parents do much for their children;
        they give life to them, nourish and bring them up, and introduce them to
        the world.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are some children who do not
        realize this or who forget the amount of affection and care which their
        parents have lavished upon them. Parental love is always greater than
        filial love. One cannot expect children or babies to be grateful or
        dutiful as they are still immature, but it is very wrong if children are
        ungrateful, stubborn or disobedient when they grow up. There are three
        types of children described in the Buddhist scriptures. These are: <i>Avajàta,
        Anujàta, and Atijàta</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">1) Those who are inferior to their
        parents in every respect are called <i>Avajàta</i>;<br>
        2) Those who are on the same level as their parents are called <i>Anujàta</i>;
        and<br>
        3) Those who excel their parents in every way are called <i>Atijàta</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even in their dreams parents do not want
        their children to be inferior to them. All parents without exception
        want their children to excel them in learning, in virtue, in position
        and so on. Therefore, every child must endeavour to fulfil these hopes.
        Parents' one and only hope is to see their children grow up as good and
        ideal people. They would be happy if their children surpass them, and
        they would surely be unhappy if their children fall below their.expected
        standard. In order to lead children on the right path, parents must
        first set an example for them to follow.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the first years, the young mind is
        nourished by the moral code of the parents. The Buddhist heritage has no
        dogmas to pass to future generations. It is a way of life based on the
        criterion of unsatisfactoriness of life due to craving. This craving is
        eradicated by the successful practice of generosity, morality and
        wisdom, and it is these qualities that are taught by example and
        guidance from one generation to another. One is mindful that it is not
        only what the parents profess, but rather what they really are and do,
        that the child drinks in, involuntarily and lovingly. The child enters
        the world moulded by the parents.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In five ways parents communicate their
        real sense of right and wrong, for the protection of the child, the
        protection of the family, and the protection of the society:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. They rejoice in the welfare of
        others; they resist the impulse to harm others by cruelty, anger or
        hatred. Buddhists undertake to train themselves to avoid killing or
        hurting any living being.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. In relation to possessions - they
        truly honour other people's rights, and give freely and wisely, after
        protecting their own. Buddhists undertake to train themselves not to
        steal or cheat.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. In relation to honour and purity in
        relationships - where fidelity is a virtue, neither temptation nor
        seduction abuse the safety of marriages of families. To Buddhists all
        others, with the exception of one's spouse, are like either a parent, a
        brother or sister, or one's child. Buddhists undertake to train
        themselves not to commit adultery or sexual misconduct in act or in
        thought.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. In speech - their speech is truthful,
        kindly, just and sensible. Buddhists undertake not to speak falsely.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">5. In responsibility - the parents never
        risk their own or their family's honour or safety through intoxication.
        Buddhists undertake to avoid hallucinogenics and intoxication which will
        cause carelessness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are some ways for children to
        repay partially, but not fully, their debt to their parents. That is: by
        dissuading them from evil, by encouraging them to do wholesome deeds,
        and by being good children living as close to the ideal as possible. If
        they live as ideal children that is one of the ways to repay their
        parents. Parents should be provided not only with fleeting material
        pleasure, but also with substantial spiritual pleasure, like confidence,
        morality, wisdom, etc. Dutiful, loving children are always obedient to
        their parents, who have bestowed upon them their overflowing love and
        compassion. They never disregard their wishes. They never get angry, nor
        provoke them, nor hurt their feelings. They always uphold their good
        name and honour by showing excellent character, refined behaviour,
        charming manners and a noble demeanour. In every way and to the best of
        their ability they should try to be worthy children of worthy parents.
        They do nothing which might discredit their parents' good name even
        after their death.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Rock Edicts of the great Indian
        Emperor Asoka (280 BC) concern themselves very much with the duties of
        children to their parents: &quot;Meritorious is obedience to mother and
        father.&quot; &quot;Right conduct to mother and father is
        obedience.&quot; &quot;Obey mother and father.&quot; &quot;Listen to
        mother and father.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Sigalovada Sutta the child is
        advised how he should honour his parents:-</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">i) As the parents have supported the
        child, so should the child support the parents. Sons and daughters
        should support their parents. They should wait upon them when they are
        sick or old. In fact they should deem it a great blessing and privilege
        to minister to, wait upon and look after their parents when they become
        helpless, old or destitute.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">ii) The child should do the parents'
        duties. Children should always try to understand what are the
        requirements and necessities of their parents, and they must try to
        provide them to the best of their abilities. Children should not
        hesitate to provide anything that their parents need for their
        satisfaction. They should see to the comfort and happiness of their
        parents.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Bodhisattva considered it his
        greatest privilege to sacrifice even his own life for the sake of his
        parents. It is a Bodhisattva virtue, a Bodhisattva ideal to look after
        his mother and father. It is a duty not only to see to their material
        happiness, but also their spiritual progress. Children should try to
        encourage their parents to develop virtues such as generosity, morality,
        piety, wisdom, etc.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">iii) Children should uphold the family
        tradition and lineage. It is an important duty of children to continue
        the good works started by their parents. They should preserve the family
        tradition. They should carry on any philanthropic or social work started
        by their parents, especially after their death. The good name of the
        parents should be preserved by their worthy children. Good, cultured
        children do nothing to bring discredit to the good name of their
        parents.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">iv) Children should act in such a way as
        to be worthy of their inheritance. Whatever legacy or property they
        receive from their parents should be protected and, if possible,
        increased. Children may earn a lot in later life, but they should always
        preserve the ancestral property with due honour and care.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">v) Furthermore, children should offer
        alms in honour of their departed relatives. It is one of the noble
        duties and customs to remember and revere parents after their death.
        Children offer alms to monks and the needy, and then transfer the merits
        acquired thereby to the departed ones.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhists believe in rebirth. They know
        that their departed parents have taken birth somewhere else. Therefore,
        after performing suitable meritorious deeds they radiate their thoughts
        of goodwill towards their dead parents, wishing them well-being and
        happiness wherever they may be. Periodical alms-givings are held or
        donations are given to charitable institutions, books on the Dhamma are
        published, schools, hospitals, orphanages and so on are established in
        the name of the parents. Dutiful and loving children perform various
        philanthropic works in order to perpetuate the hallowed names of their
        parents. They do so as a mark of gratitude in memory of their beloved
        parents.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As a son or daughter one has to be
        useful to one's parents in whatever way one can. One should not demand
        things that one's parents cannot afford, but try to make the best use of
        the facilities they are in a position to provide. One should develop
        one's inborn talents, and also gain whatever new knowledge one can, so
        that one grows up to adulthood as a capable person, ready to shoulder
        some responsibility in society. Hence, when one grows up to adulthood
        one should be in a position to engage in some useful trade or profession
        to earn enough to maintain oneself and also to help one's ageing parents
        and other deserving relatives and friends.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When one is married one should not be a
        burden or cause embarrassment to the partner, but should be in a
        position to contribute in whatever manner possible to make the task of
        the other easy and pleasant. Next, as a parent too one should be an
        asset, a source of strength and inspiration to the children. When one
        grows old and feeble one should try to be as little a burden as possible
        to the children.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This moulding and shaping of
        duty-conscious and law-abiding family members (parents and children)
        will lead to the emergence of a good social order with the consequent
        result of creating a contented humanity - that has been the aim of the
        Buddha's teachings. Hence we can see that he taught that the happiness
        of a whole society depends upon the happiness of the family. This way of
        life resonates with the ideal of caring for others.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The importance of <i>mettà </i>,
        loving-kindness, must be fully recognized. This loving-kindness must
        first be shown to oneself, the individual must be confident in himself
        before he can be of service to others; then this love should be radiated
        to one's parents, &quot;As I am happy, may my parents be happy&quot;. In
        this way we radiate these pure thoughts of goodwill to family and
        friends; to neighbours; to strangers; to those who may be unfriendly or
        hostile towards us; to all of humanity. The most frequently-recited and
        meditated upon sutta in Buddhism is the Metta Sutta - this should be
        recited daily by all Buddhists.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When such love is taught and becomes the
        most central theme of one's life, and the status of the family is held
        as the nucleus of society, it can be more easily appreciated how, in
        Buddhist countries, family unity is still extremely strong. However, as
        modern materialism creeps into the fabric of every culture; as media
        such as television, with its perpetual salutations to the glories of
        covetousness, becomes available even in small villages; as childrens'
        education places greater importance on skills for monetary gain than on
        excellence in character; so even in the bastions of Buddhist culture we
        are finding a waning of traditional values.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some reasons for the erosion of
        traditional morality may be that modern youth takes less notice of the
        advice handed down from one generation to another, advice such as has
        already been quoted: &quot;.. .should have the same faith, the same
        virtue, the same generosity, the same wisdom&quot; Instead they rely on
        the earthly emotions which are tied more to sexual attraction of the
        present than of a life-time commitment - not that Buddhism in any way
        demeans the importance of sexuality in the committed relationship, for
        this surely is the strongest emotion of mankind. But such emotions
        should be used wisely, used correctly; marriage should neither be
        dependent nor ignoring its real nature, but become free of dependence on
        it - this thinking would surely maintain the safety of a lasting
        relationship.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As the children, with their fine
        education, move from their home environments to get work elsewhere,
        often in a foreign country, slowly the &quot;thin end of the wedge&quot;
        of corruption of moral standards is inched into their weakening
        traditions. The first, even the second generation, may be able to hold
        on to the ethics inherent in their heritage - most fortunate are those
        which survive longer.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another reason for the decline in human
        relationships and weakening of traditional morality is often that a
        person may have too many undertakings, no only would he not be able to
        complete these undertakings successfully, but on the other hand he could
        upset everything and also would not be able to live happily with his
        kith and kin due to the fact that his duties and obligations to them
        would be neglected owing to lack of time and absence of mind.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">To tackle these crises let us not cling
        to the older rules just because they may have appeared successful in the
        past, let us not insist on acceptance of dogma, let us not try to
        conquer with authority, but let us reintroduce self-respect,
        self-confidence and self-love.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">True freedom is found in a life based on
        the greatest safety, which requires the undying care and protection of a
        united family. Certainly, given this, there need never be a person who
        is lost or lonely. Even if a child's immediate family are all dead, he
        still has uncles, cousins, and in-laws. All should see it as a source of
        honour and fulfillment to adopt, feed and love the child. This is true
        not only for a child, but also just as much for the old and infirm.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The moulding and shaping of
        duty-conscious and law-abiding members of a family (both parents and
        children) mean the emergence of a good social order with, as a
        consequent result, the creation of contented humanity. That has been the
        aim of the Buddha's teachings.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So we can see that the Buddha has taught
        that the happiness of the whole society is based on the happiness of the
        family. This way of life is permeated with the ideals of caring and
        being cared for. It guards tradition. Heart, mind and body are given to
        the creation of happiness for others, here and now. This will bring its
        own undying rewards hereafter.</font></p>
