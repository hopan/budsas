<font color="#800080"><h3>Sitting Meditation</h3></font>
<p>

To calm the mind means to find the right balance.  
If you try to force your mind too much it goes too far;  
if you don't try enough it doesn't get there, it misses 
the point of balance.

For most of us the mind is never at peace, it never have 
the solid enery of calmness.<P>
 
Find a comfortable posture, keeping the spine straight.  You can sit cross legged on a folded blanket or on a chair with both feet on the floor.  They key is to keep the spine straight.<P>

Bring your attention to feel the sensations of your breathing.  Take a few deep breaths to sense where you can feel the breath most easily.  Incoming breath will cause a sensation of touch on that point of the nostril; so will the outgoing breath which will cause a sensation of touch on that same point of the nostril.  Just focus on that sense of touch.<P>

Alternatively, bring your attention to feel the rising and falling of 
the abdomen.  When air is breathed in, the step by step arising of the 
abdomen must be noted.  He must concentrate on the gathering rigidity 
and sense of posture of the adbomen.  He notes with silent acknowledgements:
 'rising', 'rising', 'rising'.  When air is breathed out, the step by step falling of the 
abdoment must be noted.  He must concentrate on the decreasing sense 
of support, step by step movement of the abdomen.  He notes with a silent 
acknowledgement: 'falling', 'falling', 'falling'.  <P>

If we force our breath to be too long or too short we're not 
balanced, the mind won't be at peace.   We don't get concerned 
over how long or short, weak or strong it is, we just note it.  
KNOW its there.  We simply let it be. <P>

After a few breaths your mind will wander.   Catch this.  
No matter how long or short a time you have been away, 
simply come back to the next breath.  You can mindfully 
acknowledge where you have gone with a soft word in the 
back of your mind, such as "thinking", "wandering", "hearing".  
Even "itching", "pain", "anger", "lust", "happy" should be acknowledged.  
One word of acknowledgement and a simple return to the breath is best.  
Don't dwell on what is past  be ever present with the breath.  
If no other object arises, return to your breath.<P>  

<font color="#800080"><h3>Walking Meditation</h3></font>
<p>
Like sitting meditation, walking meditation is a practice for developing calm, 
connectedness and awareness.  It can be practiced before or after sitting meditation.  <P>
Should space not permit, the shortest track should not be less than 10 paces.  A medium length track would be 20 paces, 
and a long track should be 25 to 30 paces.  <P>

The yogi should cross his hands in front of him, right hand over left, both resting 
below the navel.  Begin to walk slowly, with each step feel the sensation of 
lifting your foot and off the earth.  Be aware as you place each foot 
on the earth and mentally note: "right step", "left step".  

Your mind must not be attached to the shape of the foot.  
It is very important that is it the sensation of touch, the hardness which you must
be interested in and not the foot itself.
The key is mindfulness in every step.<P>

Walking meditation can help to increase the power of concentration, and is a great help in sitting meditation.<P>

<font color="#800000"><h3 align="center">Edited from Dhamma Discourses<br>
by The Sayadaw U Kundalabhivamsa<br>
of Burma</h3></font>
<P>
<center>The following is a description of the levels of understanding
as a yogi progresses into the practice of Vipassana Meditation.
These Insights (Pali language: Nana) arise naturally within the
yogi without prompting from anyone and they conform in high
consistency among other yogis and meditation masters.
<BR>
This text is meant for advanced students of Vipassana meditation.
The beginner may doubt its validity.  But for one who have not tasted
salt, he could never know its taste.  For one have tasted, its difficult to describe
to another who have not.</center>
<P>

<B>THE FIRST INSIGHT.<br> 
Knowledge of Mind and Matter<BR>
Nama-Rupa Pariccheda Nana</B>
<P>
  When the yogi enters the meditation centre to note on the
  rise of his abdomen, the fall of his abdomen; he thinks
  that "his" abdomen is rising, "his" abdomen is falling.
  "He" is noting. 
<P>
  When noting the sense of touch while
  sitting, he thinks "his" body is sitting and touching, and
  "he" is noting. As concentration increases, he will find
  that the manner of the rising of the abdomen is one
  separate entity, and conscious mind knowing the rise of
  the abdomen is another serpate entity. 
<P>
  The behaviours
  such as rising, falling, sitting, touching are body-matter
  which do not have consciousness. The noting mind is
  mental-phenomena. Some foreign yogis reported to the
  Sayadaw that, in the early days of their retreat, there was
  only himself, one and only one. Now, it seemed there
  always were <FONT COLOR="#A25151">two</FONT> of him all the time.
  <P>
  Having reached the first insight, the wrong view on the
  concept of "I", is destroyed. The yogi
  understands that the terms such "I", "he" are only
  an ordinary way of expression.
<P>  
 eg.  Knowing that this is 'Mind' and that is 'Body'. Each can be seen 
 as clearly separate and different. 
<P>
<B>
THE SECOND INSIGHT<BR>
Knowledge Of Cause and Effect<BR>
Paccaya Pariggaha Nana</B>
<P>  
 All manners of the rise of the abdomen, the fall of the
 abdomen, the sitting, the touching all happen
 beforehand; then the noting consciousness follows to
 note the above bodily behaviours. The bodily behaviours
 are the causes, and they cause the mind to notice. The
 noting mind is the effect.
<P> 
 Some yogis experience that the pattern of the rising or the
 falling of the abdomen varies. The abdomen does not rise
 up straight towards the front. Sometimes. it rises nearer to
 one side of the body in a lopsided manner. Sometimes, it
 rises towards the back of the body. Sometimes, it is
 rotating while rising. Sometimes, the yogi notices that the
 rise occurs at the top of his head, sometimes on his
 hand.
 <P>
 The changing mode of rising is the cause. The noting
 mind following is the effect
<P>
<B>
THE THIRD INSIGHT.<BR> 
Knowledge of Comprehension<BR>
Sammasana Nana</B>
<P>
  The yogi faces all types of pains, aches, nausea, stomach-
  aches, shaking of his body, swaying of his body
  throughout his meditation. He faces mental sufferings as
  well as physical sufferings. He feels that his body is a load of 
  suffering. 
<P>
  He also finds that
  suffering varies and changes places. Suffering itself is not
  permanent. The yogi feels that he comes to
  meditate to find peace and bliss, but at that moment he
  finds he cannot obtain, nor create, what he anticipated.
  He has no say in that matter. His body is not
  responding to his desire. 
<P>
  The Third Insight is
  explained as the knowledge of investigation of the three
 characteristics of composite things.
<P>
 Seeing the previous knowledge deeper. The 3 universal
 characteristics of existence impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and non self
 becomes manifest. The beginning, middle and end of phenomena becomes obvious.
 Pains ususily can also be very intense before it subsides. The defilements of insight may
 arise clearly at this stage.
<P>
<B>
 THE FOURTH INSIGHT<BR>
 Knowledge of Arising and Dissolution<BR>
 Udayabbaya-Nupassana Nana</B>
 <P>
 The yogi does not have physical pain anymore.
 Therefore, the mind also is free of suffering. The yogi's
 body as well as his mind are light, soft, pliant and well-
 behaved. Those who used to change positions two times
 during one sitting, may need no change of position at all.
 The sense-objects and the noting mind are very
 compatible. The yogi enjoys the physical well-being as
 well as mental well-being. He enjoys bliss. He sees
 light, colours, celestial beings, monasteries, stupas, etc.
 These are the manifestations of early Udayabbaya
 nana.
 <P>
 As insight matures, the yogi notices the arising and then
 the perishing of the rise of the abdomen. He notices the
 arising and then the perishing of the fall of the abdomen.
 All phenomena have two parts, coming into being and
 then passing away. The yogi is happy because he can note
 all. Udayabbaya nana is explained as the knowledge into
 rising and passing away of phenomena.
 <P>
<B>
THE FIFTH INSIGHT.<BR> 
Knowledge of Dissolution<BR>
Bhanganupassana Nana</B>
<P>
 This Insight emphasizes the perishable nature of all
 phenomena. 
<P>
The beginning of the rise of the abdomen is
 not clear to him anymore. Only the passing away of the
 rise of the abdomen is distinct. While walking, he cannot
 find the beginning of his lifting the foot, nor the
 beginning of his movement forward, nor the beginning of
 the downward motion of his foot. He notices the end part
 of his lifting manner, the end part of his forwarding foot,
 and the end part of his downward press. 
<P>
Ending of all
  phenomena is distinct. The sense-object as well as the
  consciousness perish all the time. He does not find any
  form or matter in his body. This is called
  "strong and successful" Vipassana. He cannot find
  anything permanent in his body.
  The flux of cessation is so much and so fast that he finds it
  unsatisfactory. He cannot prevent nor
  correct it . Bhanga nana is explained
  as knowledge which reflects on the breaking up or
  perishable nature of composite things.
<P>
<B>  
THE SIXTH INSIGHT <BR>
Knowledge of Terror<BR>
Bhayanupassana Nana</B>
<P>
  Whatever the yogi notes, it just perishes. The yogi feels
  afraid of his body. This nana is explained as
  knowledge of the presence of fear of composite things.
<P>
<B>
THE SEVENTH INSIGHT<BR> 
Knowledge of Danger<BR>
Adinavanupassana Nana</B>
  <P>
  Since all phenomena out of his body perish all the
  time, he begins to find his Khandha as a decaying, rotting
  heap. He finds fault with it. Adinava Na-na is explained as
  knowledge which reflects on the danger of composite
  things.
<P>  
<B>
THE EIGHTH INSIGHT.<BR> 
Knowledge of Disgust<BR>
Nibbidanupassana Nana</B>
<P>
  The yogi feels disgusted with his body. He wants very
  much to discard it. This nana is explained as the
  knowledge which reflects on feelings of disgust aroused
  by composite things that are dangerous.
<P>
<B>  
THE NINTH INSIGHT<BR>
Knowledge of Desire for Freedom<BR> 
Muncituka-Myata Nana</B>
<P>
 The yogi does not wish to go on noting. He wants to
 discard his meditation. This nana is explained as the
 knowledge of the desire for release from composite things
 which cause feelings of disgust.
<P>
<B> 
THE TENTH INSIGHT <BR>
Knowledge of Reflection<BR>
Patisankhanpussana Nana</B>
<P> 
 The yogi finds that he cannot stop just like that. He feels
 that he has to go on noting. So, he carries on with his
 meditation. In the Text, this situation is explained with a
  simile:
 <P>
    <blockquote>A man went to a shallow pond, taking a net
    with him, to catch fish. He threw the net into
    the water. He saw movements inside the net
    which is under the water. He bent down and
    put one hand under the net to seize the fish.
    He held the fish tightly and brought it out of
    the water. Then, he realized that it was not a
    fish, but a poisonous snake with three stripes
    on its neck. He felt frightened. He wanted to
    discard it, but he could not simply drop it
    there. He felt fed up of holding it, so he took a
    deep breath. He held his hand very high,
    aimed well and then threw the snake to the
    farthest distance.</blockquote>
   
<P>
 Similarly, the yogi finds that his body is like a
 poisonous snake. The three stripes on the neck of-the
 snake are the three characteristics of composite things. At
 this nana stage, pains, aches, dukkha vedana appear
 again. However much he puts in his effort to concentrate,
 the yogi finds that he wishes to change position too often.
 His mind is restless, also his body is restless. It requires a
 lot of encouragement from the teacher. If the yogi 
 doggedly carries on his hard work, he will reach the 
 next nana soon.
<P>
<B>
 THE ELEVENTH INSIGHT<BR>
Knowledge of Equanimity of Formations<BR>
Sankarupekkha-Nana</B>
<P>

 Suddenly, the yogi who nearly felt that he was failing 
 finds that he can meditate again. All sense-objects as 
 well as the noting mind are doing their work 
 spontaneously again. As time goes on, notings become 
 very soft and subtle. The yogi can go on noting for a 
 stretch of two to three hours. He does not feel 
 frightened. He is not suffering. He can face all 
 phenomena cqually.
<P> 
 Some serious ailments of yogis when they reach this 
 nana, are discarded completely (see A Case of Healing through Vipassana).  
His vipassana is 
 recognized as of standard. This nana is explained as the 
 insight arising from equanimity.
<P> 
<b>
Does one have to go to all the stages?<BR></b>
<i>
Edited from<br> 
The 5 Controlling Faculties & Insight Meditation<br>
by Ven. Sujiva<br></i>

<P>
A question frequently asked is: Does one have to go to all the stages?
<P>
The answer will be in principle yes, but in experience one may not realise it. this is because at time the 
experience may be so brief that one may not realise it is even an insight knowledge. Some experience them 
clearly and because of the thinking that follows with regard to far reaching implications may become terrified 
(with unwholesome fear) instead. This brings up the point that one must have a proper attitude towards 
insight experiences�that these are only a means to an end, we must not be frightened or attached to them.
<P>
Secondly it has to borne in mind that insight is one thing and the objects are another. Pain for example is 
frequent object encountered in insight meditation. It also occurs abundantly in sick people. Some objects of 
experience are also shared by drug addicts and meditators. Obviously the states of mind are worlds apart. 
The emphasis is the maturity and power of mindfulness although the objects do imply how it is.
<P>
Another error is that some yogis become disappointed when they discover that they have dropped to lower 
insight knowledges even though they have been striving very hard.
<P>
Here we have to bear in mind that these knowledges occur when the faculties are strong and they are not so 
all the time. But if we strive hard, it will develop to a  higher level.
<P>
There is also a difference between the maturity of an Insight knowledge and the level of an insight knowledge. 
Though it needs a certain level of maturity to progress to the next, it must  be much more mature if it is to 
progress far enough for the crossing over. It is like a pyramid whose base has to be widened if the pinnacle 
is to reach a greater height.
<P>
The crossing over to the supramundane level is possible only when:<BR>

  <blockquote>1) The faculties are matured and strong enough.<BR>
   2) There are nothing obstructing the way. <BR></blockquote>

<font color="#800000"><h2 align="center">Some Common Altered States</h2>
<h3 align="center"><i>
Edited from A Path with Heart<br>
by Jack Kornfield<br>
Rider Books</i></h3></font>

<P>
Whenever powerful concentration and energy are evoked in spiritual
practice, a great variety of new and exciting sensory experiences can
begin to arise. They do not occur for everyone, nor are they necessary
for spiritual development.
<P>
<i> These new states are more like side effects of
meditation, and the better we understand them, the less likely we are
to get stuck in them or confuse them with the goal of spiritual life.
</i>
<P>
First to arise for many people is a whole array of altered physical
perceptions. Many of these are categorized in Buddhist texts as side
effects called the five deepening levels of <i>rapture.</I> 
<P>
In this context, rapture is a broad term used to cover the many kinds of 
chills, movements, lights,
floating, vibrations, delight, and more that open with deep concentration,
as well as the enormous pleasure they can bring to meditation.
<P>
<h4>Raptures</h4>
<P>
Rapture commonly arises during intensive periods of meditation or
spiritual practice. Sometimes rapture begins as subtle coolness or waves
of fine and pleasurable vibrations throughout the body. Through con-
centration or other techniques of practice one often experiences a buildup
of great energy in the body. When this energy moves, it produces feelings
of pleasure, and when it encounters areas of tightness or holding, it
builds up and then releases as vibration and movement. 
<P>
Thus, rapture
may lead to trembling or the powerful spontaneous releases of physical
energy which some yogic traditions refer to as kriyas. These are spon-
taneous movements that come in many different patterns. Sometimes
they arise as a single involuntary movement felt together with the release
of a knot or tension in the body. At other times they can take the form
of prolonged and dramatic movements that can last for days.
<P>
Beyond kriyas and spontaneous movement, many other kinds of rap-
ture can arise. These include pleasant kinds of thrills throughout the
body, tingling, prickles, waves of pleasure, and delightful sparkles. At
certain levels one may feel the skin vibrate or feel as if ants or small bugs
were crawling all over it, or as if the skin were being stuck by acupuncture
needles; at other levels one may feel hot, as if the spine were on fire.
This heat can alternate with feelings of cold, beginning with slight chills, and
turning to strong rapture with a profound deep cold. Sometimes these
experiences of temperature change are so tangible and strong that we
shiver on hot summer days.
<P>
<h4>Lights and Visions</h4>
<P>
Along with this kinetic rapture, one may see colored lights, initially
blues, greens, and purples, and then, as concentration gets stronger,
golden and white lights. Finally, many students will see very powerful
white lights as if looking into the headlight of an oncoming train or as if
the whole sky were illuminated by a brilliant sun. 
<P>
At still deeper states of concentration we may feel our entire body
dissolve into light. We may feel tingles and vibrations so fine that we
feel we are only patterns of light in space, or we may disappear into the
colors of very strong light. These lights and sensations are powerful effects
of the concentrated mind. They feel purifying and opening, and can show
us that on one level the mind and body and the whole of consciousness
is made of light itself.
<P>
A series of unusual sensory perceptions in addition to these forms
of light and power may also arise.  We may feel we have become very heavy,
or hard and solid like a stone, or feel as if we are being squashed under
a weight or a wheel. Our sense of weight may disappear and we may
sense ourselves floating and have to open our eyes and peek to make
sure we're still sitting in meditation. 
<P>
<h4>Raptures in Walking Meditation</h4>
<P>
Similar experiences can also arise
during walking meditation. When walking is concentrated, the whole
room can appear to sway as if we were on a ship in a storm, or we might
put our foot down and feel as if we were drunk. Sometimes everything
starts to sparkle, and it seems as if we could walk through the floor or
the wall itself. Our vision can swirl and create strange patterns and colors
around us. The shape of the body may seem to shift. Temperature,
solidity, and vibration may simultaneously change, with sensations of
heat, melting, and movement all occurring at once.
<P>
The body may seem to stretch out gigantically tall or become very
short. Sometimes it teels as if our head is located somewhere outside of
our body or we may experience strange breathing rhythms or breathing
in every cell of our body or feel that we are breathing through the soles
of our feet. A hundred other variations of these altered physical percep-
tions may arise during practice.
<P>
<h4>Heightened Senses</h4>
<P>
Similarly, other senses may open to new experiences. Our hearing
may become very acute, we may hear the softest sounds we have ever
heard or powerful inner sounds such as bells, notes, or choruses of sound.
Many people hear inner music. Sometimes voices will clearly speak. We
may hear words or specific teachings. Our senses of taste and smell may
open in ways never before experienced. 
<P>
One morning when I walked on
my monk's alms-rounds to collect food, my nose became like that of the
most sensitive dog. As I walked down the street of a small village, every
two feet there was a different smell: something being washed, fertilizer
in the garden, new paint on a building, the lighting of a charcoal fire in
a Chinese store, the cooking in the next window. It was an extraordinary
experience of moving through the world attuned to all the possibilities
of smell. In similar fashion, our senses of sight, sound, taste, and touch
can all reach profound new sensitivity.
<P>
<h4>Strong Emotions</h4>
<P>
Deep concentration can lead to all kinds of visions and visionary
experiences. Floods of memories, images of past lives, scenes of foreign
lands, pictures of heavens and hells, the energies of all the great arche-
types, can open before our eyes. We can sense ourselves as other crea-
tures, in other bodies, in other times and other realms. We can see and
encounter animals, angels, demons, and gods. When such visions arise
in the most compelling form, they become as real as our day-to-day
reality. While such visions often arise spontaneously, they can also be
developed through specific meditative exercises as a means to awaken
the beneficial energy of a particular realm.
<P>
Along with the openings of vision, hearing, and physical senses, we
can experience a release of the strongest kinds of emotions, from sorrow
and despair to delight and ecstasy. Meditation may feel like an emotional
roller coaster as we allow ourselves to be plunged into unconscious emo-
tions. Vivid and profound dreams and many varieties of fear frequently
appear. These are not just the emotions of our personal problems, but
the opening of the whole emotional body. 
<P>
One encounters soaring delights and the darkness of isolation and loneliness, 
 (see The Dark Night) 
each feeling very real as it fills our consciousness. These releases require 
the guidance of a skilled teacher to help us through them with a sense of balance.
<P>
<h4>All Experiences are Side Effects</h4>
<P>
Even with a teacher, there are principles to keep in mind in working
with these unfamiliar realms of our spiritual life. 
<P>
The first principle is
the understanding that <b>All Spiritual Phenomena Are Side Effects</b>. In the
Buddhist tradition, the Buddha often reminded students that the purpose
of his teaching was not the accumulation of special good deeds and good
karma or rapture or insight or bliss, but only the sure heart's release
a true liberation of our being in every realm. This freedom and awak-
ening, and this alone, is the purpose of any genuine spiritual path.

<P><HR width="50%"><P>

<font color="#800000"><h2 align="center">The Dark Night</h2>
<h3 align="center"><i>Edited from A Path with Heart<br>
by Jack Kornfield<br>
Rider Books</i></h3></font>
<P>
<P>

The spiritual description of death and rebirth as a "dark night" comes
from the writings of the great mystic St. John of the Cross. In an eloquent
way, he describes the dark night as a long period of unknowing, loss,
and despair that must be traversed by spiritual seekers in order to empty
and humble themselves enough to receive divine inspiration. He put it
this way: "The soul that is attached to anything, however much good
there may be in it, will not arrive at the liberty of the divine."
<P>
Traditionally the dark night arises only after we have had some initial
spiritual opening. 
<P>
In Insight Meditation, once we have abandoned the luminous state
of arising and passing, we open to a profound cycle of dissolution, death,
and rebirth.
<P>
As concentration increases and becomes yet more precise and fine.
We immediately feel the end of each moment, the
end of each experience. Life begins to feel like quicksand. Everything
we look at or feel is dissolving. In this stage, nothing around us seems
solid or trustworthy. On all levels, our consciousness becomes attuned
to endings and death.   We sense the dissolution of life moment to moment.
<P>
Now the dark night deepens. As our outer and inner worlds dissolve,
we lose our sense of reference. There arises a great sense of unease and
fear, leading students into a realm of fear and terror. "Where is there
any security?" "Wherever I look, things are dissolving." In these stages
we can experience this dissolution and dying within our own body. We
may look down and see pieces of our body seeming to melt away and
decay, as if we were a corpse. We can see ourselves dying, or having
died, in a thousand ways, through illness, battles, and misfortune. At
this point other powerful visions can arise, visions of the death of others,
visions of wars, dying armies, funeral pyres, or charnel grounds. Con-
sciousness seems to have opened to the realm of death to show us how
all creation moves in cycles, all ends in death. We experience how every
aspect of the world comes into being and inexorably passes away.
<P>
From this realm of terror and death arises a very deep realization of
the suffering inherent in life: the suffering of pain, the suffering of the
loss of pleasant things and, hanging over it all, the enormous suffering
of the death of whatever is created or loved by us. Out of this we can
experience tremendous sympathy for the sorrows of the world. It seems
that no matter where we look in the world at our community, our
family members and loved ones, our own self and body all of it is fragile,
all will be lost.
<P>
 As the realm of terror deepens, periods of paranoia may arise. In this
stage, wherever we look, we become fearful of danger. We feel that if
we walk outdoors, something could run us over. If we take a drink of
water, the microbes in it could kill us. Everything becomes a source of
potential death or destruction in this phase of the dark night. People
experience these feelings in many different ways: as pressure, claustro-
phobia, oppression, tightness, restlessness, or struggle, or as the un-
bearable endless repetition of experiences, one after another, dying all
the time. We can feel as if we are stuck in meaningless cycles of life.
Existence can seem flat, arid, and lifeless. It is as if there is no exit.
<P>
As you might expect, it is hard to meditate through these stages. But
continuing to sense these new levels of consciousness with clarity and
acceptance is the only way through them. We must name each one and
allow it to arise and pass. Any other reaction will keep us stuck. As we
learn to acknowledge each state, name each state, and meet it with
mindfulness, we discover that we are dying over and over again. What
we are being asked to do is to open to this death and become someone
who has entered the realm of death and awakened in the face of it.
<P>
In traversing these painful stages, there next arises a deep and pro-
found desire for freedom. In this state we long for release from the fear
and oppression of continued birth and death. We sense that there must
be a freedom that is not bound up in our seeing, hearing, smelling,
tasting, and touching, something beyond our plans and memories, our
body and mind, the whole identity we have taken to be ourselves. In
fact, in each level of the dark night, the increasing power of awareness
has been gradually unraveling our identity, releasing our grip on all that
we have held in life.

<P>
Even though we wish for freedom, there often arises a sense of im-
possibility, that we cannot go any further, that we just cannot let go any
more. We enter the stage of great doubt; we want to stop; we become
restless. In one text this is called the rolling-up-the-mat stage. Here the
world becomes too difficult; our spiritual practice asks too much of us;
we wish we could quit and go home to our bed or our mother.
<P>
Because the powerful stages of fear and dissolution touch such painful
chords in us, it is easy to get stuck in them or lose our way among them.
In this process, it is important to have a teacher; otherwise, we will get
lost or overwhelmed by these states and quit. 
<P>
When we can finally look at the horrors and joys, our birth and our
death, the gain and loss of all things, with an equal heart and open mind,
there arises the state of the most beautiful and profound equanimity.
We enter a realm where consciousness is fully open and awake, perfectly
balanced. This is a level of wonderful peace. We can sit at ease for hours,
and nothing that arises causes any disturbance in the space of conscious-
ness. Consciousness becomes luminous 
, because now everything is untangled, free, and we grasp at
nothing. 
<P>
This state of profound balance the Elders called high equanimity.
Our mind becomes like a crystal goblet or like the clear sky in which all
things appear unhindered. We become completely transparent, as if
every phenomenon just passes through our mind and body. We are
simply space, and our whole identity opens to reveal the true nature of
consciousness before we became identified with body and mind.

Translator's Preface:
<P>             
<blockquote>The translation is actually of an appendix compiled by the

late Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw in 1976. The reader will

soon discover that sandwiched between the apparently scholastic

introduction and conclusion, skilfully written by the late Venerable

Sayadaw, lies the appetizing main portion of the work which deals

with the almost miraculous healing of sicknesses, encountered in the

course of Dhamma-striving, as related either personally or as recorded

by widely experienced Meditation Teachers.</blockquote>

<B>A Layman Whose Large Tumour Disintegrated</B>
<P> 

54-year-old U Aung Shwe of Daing Wun Kwin, Moulmein, had a

large tumour in his abdomen. When he visited a doctor for a medical

examination, he was informed that it was necessary to operate on it.
<P>
So, with the intention of getting the Dhamma, which is a dependable

source of refuge, before going for the operation, he arrived at

M.T.Y., Rangoon, and started Dhamma-striving on the 5th waning of

Na Yone, 1330 B.E. (around June, 1968). 
<P>
One day, while thus striving-

in-mindfulness he experienced through insight, a sudden bursting of the

the tumour in his abdomen, followed by its disintegration and the

rapid discharge of blood gushing away. 
<P>
It was as if he was actually

hearing it with his ears and seeing it with his eyes. Since then

he had been completely rid of the tumour-ailment. Continuing Dhamma-

striving to the satisfaction of his Masters, he eventually attained

all the Vipassana insights to full completion. Even till this very

day he is healthily and happily rendering his services to the Sasana.

in both fields of pariyatti and patipatti.

<B>Yogi Cured of Arthritis of the Knee</B>
<P>
        On the 1st waning of Wa Gaung, 1313 B.E. (around August, 1951)

40-year-old Ko Mya Saung arrived at Myin Gyan Yeiktha, a Mahasi

Branch Centre, and commenced Dhamma-striving under the resident

Sayadaw. <P>

Ko Mya Saung has been suffering from arthritis of the knee

for 5 years. It seems that as the ailment was not cured, despite

treatment given by various doctors, he had been stirred by samvega

and had thus come to Myin Gyan Yeiktha to strive for the Dhamma.<P>

While striving, his knees swelled, and the more the pain was noted,

the more intense it grew. As the Sayadaw had instructed, he persisted

in noting it unrelently. The pain became so excruciating that tears

would roll down his cheeks and his body would be thrown forwards and

backwards or be suddenly jerked upwards in the most awkward manner.

This lasted for about 4 days. And while thus engaged in mindful

noting, he saw (in a vision) his knee together with the bones breaking

apart. In great alarm, he screamed, "Haw! It broke!

My big knee broke!"

<P>
After that incident hs was so scared he did not dare to be

mindful. However, with the Sayadaw's encouragement he resumed mindful

noting; eventually, the swelling and pain of the knee completely

disappeared, and Ko Mya Saung was never again troubled by it up till
