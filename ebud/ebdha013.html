    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When you hear the words &quot;nibbana for everyone,&quot;
    many of you will shake your heads. You'll think that I'm
    trying to &quot;dye cats for sale.&quot; [&quot;Dyeing cats
    for sale&quot; is a Thai expression similar to &quot;window
    dressing&quot;: to dress up something shabby and inferior in
    order to trick the customer. All notes are added by the
    translator.] Maybe you don't have any interest in the
    subject. This only happens because you understand the meaning
    of such words too narrowly and out of line with the truth. </p>
    <p>In the schools children are taught that nibbana is the
    death of an Arahant. The ordinary man in the street has been
    taught that it's a special city empty of pain and chock full
    of the happiness of fulfilled wishes, supposedly reached
    after death by those who store up perfections
    (&quot;parami&quot;) over tens of thousands of births. Modern
    social activists see it as an obstruction to progress that we
    shouldn't get involved with or even discuss. Students in
    general consider it a matter for devout old folks at the
    temple with nothing of relevance for them. Young men and
    women think it's bland and unexciting, awful and frightening.
    All the candidates for the monkhood merely mouth, &quot;May I
    go forth in order to awaken to nibanna&quot;. The old monks
    say nibbana can't happen anymore in this day and age, and
    that an Arahant cannot exist anymore either. So finally,
    nibbana has become a secret that no one cares about. They've
    turned it into something barren and silent, buried away in
    the scriptures, to be paid occasional service in sermons
    while no one really knows what it is. </p>
    <p>In fact, without this business of nibbana, Buddhism would
    be as good as dead. When nobody is interested in nibbana,
    then nobody is genuinely interested in Buddhism. When nothing
    about nibbana interests us, then we can't get any benefits at
    all from Buddhism. I feel that it's about time for us to get
    interested and bring about the highest benefit, as fits the
    words, &quot;Nibbana is the Supreme Thing&quot;--namely, the
    highest goal of living things, which is involved with our
    daily life at all times. NIBBANA HAS NOTHING IN THE LEAST TO
    DO WITH DEATH. The word &quot;nibbana&quot; means
    &quot;cool.&quot; Back when it was just an ordinary word
    which people used in their homes it also meant
    &quot;cool.&quot; When it is used as Dhamma language, in a
    religious context, it still means &quot;cool,&quot; but
    refers to cool from the fires of defilement (kilesa), while
    in the common people's usage it means cool from physical
    fires. </p>
    <p>Throughout the Pali scriptures, the word
    &quot;nibbana&quot; is never used in the sense of death. When
    death is discussed, the word &quot;marana&quot; is used.
    Otherwise, the word &quot;parinibbana&quot; is used, such as
    when the Buddha said, &quot;The parinibbana will occur three
    months from now. </p>
    <p>NIBBANA IS ONE OF THE DHATUS [natural conditions]. It is
    the coolness when the defilements are ended. Two types of
    this condition can be distinguished. In the first, the
    defilements are exhausted and cooled, but the sensory system,
    the organs that receive sensory stimuli, aren't yet cool. In
    the second, this sensory system is also cooled. A white hot
    charcoal illustrates the difference. When it first goes out,
    it is still too hot to be handled. We must wait a while
    longer until it is thoroughly cool and can be touched.
    Through the explanations of later generations the meaning of
    &quot;nibbana&quot; has changed to &quot;death.&quot; Such
    changes and lapses are commonplace in this world, so nowadays
    we Thais use this distorted meaning. I myself was taught this
    way when I was a child. When I first became a bhikkhu, I
    still understood it this way, and told my friends and
    students to understand it likewise. Only when I could study
    the original Pali texts did I discover that nibbana was a
    whole other matter than death. Instead, it's a kind of life
    that knows no death. Nibbana is the thing which sustains
    life, thus preventing death. It itself can never die,
    although the body must die eventually. </p>
    <p>As things are, other Indian religions contemporary with
    Buddhism also used the word &quot;nibbana&quot;. In the Pali
    texts there's a passage where the leader of another sect
    (from Southern India, around the Godavari River) sent sixteen
    students to ask the Lord Buddha about his version of nibbana.
    Their own understanding of nibbana may just as well have
    meant &quot;death.&quot; This story is well-known (in
    Theravada countries) under the name Solasapanha, the
    &quot;Sixteen Questions&quot; at the end of the Sutta-nipata
    [see the Parayanavagga in the Khuddakanikaya (Minor
    Anthologies) of the Pali Canon]. The point here is that the
    issue of nibbana was the highest concern of the Indian
    religions contemporary with Buddhism. There must have been at
    least one group that interpreted it as &quot;death&quot; and
    spread its teaching in the vicinity of Suvarnabhumi
    (&quot;The Golden Land,&quot; the ancient name of Siam)
    before Buddhism arrived here, leaving it behind as the
    general understanding of the common folk (similarly to what
    happened with atta (self) or atman (soul)). Now we had better
    return to our examination of nibbana as taught by Buddhism. </p>
    <p>When Prince Siddartha first took up the homeless spiritual
    life, he wandered in search of the nibbana which is the total
    quenching of all dukkha (rather than death). From the famous
    teachers of India at that time, he learned nothing higher
    than nevasannanasannayatana (the experience of neither
    perception nor non-perception), a degree of mental
    tranquility so deep that we cannot describe it either as
    &quot;death&quot; nor as &quot;non-death.&quot; He couldn't
    accept that as the supreme nibbana. So he went off to search
    on his own until he discovered the nibbana which is the
    coolness at the final end of defilement. He called it
    &quot;THE END OF DUKKHA,&quot; meaning the exhaustion of all
    the heat produced by defilement. However much the defilements
    are exhausted, there's that much coolness, until there is
    perfect coolness due to the defilements being finished
    completely. In short, to the degree that which defilements
    are ended, there will be that much coolness or nibbana. That
    is, NIBBANA IS THE COOLNESS WHICH RESULTS FROM THE QUENCHING
    OF DEFILEMENT, whether they quench on their own or someone
    quenches them. Whenever the defilements are quenched, then
    there is the thing called &quot;nibbana,&quot; always with
    the same meaning--&quot;coolness.&quot; </p>
    <p>Next, notice that the defilements are concocted things
    (sankharadhammas), that arise and cease. As it says in the
    Pali, <b><i>Yankinci samudayadhammaam sabbantam
    nirodhadhammam</i></b><i> (Whatever things are originated,
    all those will cease.) </i></p>
    <p>Any defilements which have arisen cease when their causes
    and conditions are finished. Although it may be a temporary
    quenching, merely a temporary coolness, it still means
    nibbana, even if only temporarily. Thus there's a temporary
    nibbana for those who still have some defilements they can't
    avoid. This indeed is the temporary nibbana that sustains the
    lives of beings who are still hanging onto defilement. Anyone
    can see that if the defilements exist night and day without
    any pause or rest, no life can endure it. If it didn't die,
    it would go crazy and then die in the end. You ought to
    consider carefully the fact that life can survive only
    because there are periods when the defilements don't roast
    it, which, in fact, outnumber the times when the defilements
    blaze. </p>
    <p>These periodic nibbanas sustain life for all of us,
    without exception, not even animals, who have their levels of
    nibbana, too. We are able to survive because this kind of
    nibbana nurtures us, until it becomes the most ordinary habit
    of life, or of the mind. Whenever there is freedom from
    defilement, then there is the value and meaning of nibbana.
    This must occur often enough for living things to survive.
    That we have some time to relax both bodily and mentally
    gives us the freshness and vitality needed to live. </p>
    <p>Why don't we understand and feel thankful for this kind of
    nibbana a little? We're lucky that the instincts can manage
    by themselves. See, things with minds naturally search for
    periods that are free from defilement or thirst. If there is
    unremitting thirst, life must die. Thus, infants know how to
    suck the breast and mosquitos know how to buzz around sucking
    blood to sustain their lives until they are slapped to death.
    Our instincts have this virtue built in: they search for
    periods of time sufficiently free from defilement or free
    from thirst to maintain life. Whenever there is freedom and
    voidness there is always this little nibbana, until we know
    how to make it into the permanent or perfect nibbana of the
    Arahant. It isn't death, but rather is deathlessness, in
    particular, spiritual deathlessness. If anyone sees this
    fact, they'll personally experience that we can survive only
    through this kind of nibbana. We don't survive just because
    of that rice and food which people are so infatuated about.
    We will realize that everybody must have this thing called
    &quot;nibbana&quot; and must depend on it as their lives'
    sustenance. So who can object to us talking about
    &quot;nibbana for everyone.&quot;? </p>
    <p>In order to better understand the meaning of the word
    &quot;nibbana,&quot; we ought to look at it from the
    perspective of linguistics. A material sense of the word is
    found in the words &quot;pajjotasseva nibbanam&quot; This
    &quot;nibbana&quot; refers to the ordinary quenching of fire.
    When the rice porridge is still hot, the cook yells out from
    the kitchen, &quot;wait a moment, let it nibbana a bit.&quot;
    When the goldsmith melts down gold and pours it into a mold,
    he sprinkles water on it to cool it down. The word used in
    Pali here is &quot;nibbapeyya&quot;, to first make it nibbana
    or cool before working it into some shape or form. </p>
    <p>Even the wild animals which are captured from the jungle
    and made tame like a pussycat are said to have been
    &quot;made nibbana.&quot; Sensual pleasures cool down foolish
    people in a way appropriate for them. The unwavering
    concentrations on material forms (rupajhanas) bring a
    coolness free from the fire of sensuality. Although
    temporary, these (the jhanas) are certain levels of nibbana.
    The &quot;experience of nothingness&quot; (Akincannayatana)
    and the other arupajhanas bring a coolness free from the fire
    that arises out of attractive material things. Nibbana due to
    the ending of all defilements brings the final coolness which
    is the ultimate in all respects. </p>
    <p>Certain groups of teachers have come up with the word
    &quot;sivamokkhamahanibbana,&quot; which they explain as some
    kind of town or city. Although no one can make any sense of
    it, they keep it around as something to bow to when this
    strange word is exclaimed from the pulpits of your run of the
    mill temples. </p>
    <p>There is also the word &quot;nibbuti&quot;, which means an
    ethical level of nibbana. It refers to a cool heart or cool
    life such as that which impressed a young woman on seeing
    Prince Siddhartha. She said, &quot;Whosever son this
    gentleman is, his mother and father are nibbuta (that is,
    cool); whosever husband he is, that woman is nibbuta (once
    again, cool).&quot; These have the meaning of nibbana, too.
    Nowadays the monks in Thailand chant the benefits of ethical
    behavior with &quot;silena nibbutim yanti,&quot; which means
    nibbuti is achieved through sila (ethics). This comes after
    the lesser benefits of sila, such as acquisition of wealth
    and getting to sugati (happy births). The purpose here is for
    nibbana to have a place in ordinary daily life. </p>
    <p>That coolness of heart and peace of mind which everyone
    desires is the meaning of nibbana. But people misunderstand
    it and aim only for sex, which is hot stuff. So they get a
    deceptive nibbana. People have clung to such an
    interpretation since, or even before, the Buddha's time, such
    as can be found among the sixty-two wrong views listed in the
    Brahmajala Sutta. </p>
    <p>Look for a moment. What is the history and basic meaning
    of the word &quot;nibbana&quot;? In all cases it points to
    coolness of heart and mind, according to the higher or lower
    feelings of each person. The essential meaning, however, is
    always in the nurturing and sustaining of life. It lessens
    the time when fires are burning the mind just enough for us
    to survive, and eventually develops to the highest level
    which absolutely quenches all fires. The highest degree of
    realization in Buddhism, according to the Buddha, is the end
    of lust, the end of hatred, and the end of delusion, which is
    the final quenching of all fires and the coolest cool which
    life can be. </p>
    <p>NIBBANA IS NOT THE MIND, BUT IS SOMETHING WHICH THE MIND
    CAN EXPERIENCE, or, as the Buddha put it, is a certain
    ayatana which wisdom can experience. Forms, sounds, odors,
    flavors, and tactile sensations are material or physical
    ayatana, things the body can experience. Akasanancayatana
    (the experience of endless space) up to and including
    nevasannanasannayatana are mental ayatana for the mind to
    experience. Then, nibbana is a spiritual ayatana for
    mindfulness and wisdom to contact or realize. It should be
    considered something which Nature has provided for human
    beings at the highest level. We should know it so that
    nibbana and our lives are not in vain. Every one of us has
    mindfulness and wisdom in order to touch nibbana. Don't let
    it go to waste! </p>
    <p>THE NIBBANA-ELEMENT EXISTS NATURALLY so that there will be
    realization of nibbana, like a precious medicine which ends
    all dukkha. There is the dukkha or disease which ordinary
    medicines cannot cure, namely, the disease of defilement
    which must be cured by the extinction of defilements, through
    which this nibbana-dhatu is realized. This highest spiritual
    illness lies deeply hidden in us and torments us secretly.
    Anyone who can quench it has come to the pinnacle of being
    human. </p>
    <p>THE WORDS &quot;THERE IS NO NIBBANA&quot; ARE MORE WRONG
    THAN WRONG because the nibbana-element exists naturally
    everywhere always, only nobody is interested enough to find
    it. The Lord Buddha discovered and revealed it to us through
    his enormous compassion, but we cut the story short thinking
    that in this era there is no nibbana anymore, when we should
    instead say that nobody understands or is interested in it.
    By merely becoming proper followers of the Buddha, nibbana
    will appear. It is already waiting for people to find it. </p>
    <p>WE CANNOT CREATE NIBBANA because it is beyond all causes
    and conditions, but we can create the conditions for
    realizing nibbana, namely, all actions which lead to the
    abandonment of the defilements. We won't speak as others do
    by saying &quot;doing good is a condition for nibbana.
    Condition (paccaya) implies causal necessity, but there is
    nothing which has such power over nibbana. The right words
    are &quot;it is a condition for realizing nibbana,&quot;
    which can be done in any age or period. Old folks like the
    words &quot;Stairway to Nibbana&quot; because they think it
    is a place or city. That's what they have been taught. Still,
    it is an acceptable enough phrase, meaning simply
    &quot;condition for the realization of nibbana.&quot; </p>
    <p>THERE ARE MANY SYNONYMS OF NIBBANA, dozens of them--for
    example, the Deathless, Permanence, Peace, Safety, Health,
    Diseaselessness, Freedom, Emancipation, Shelter, Refuge,
    Immunity, Island (for those fallen into water), Highest
    Benefit, Supreme Joy, the Other Shore, that which should be
    reached eventually, and the End of Concocting. All of these
    are thoroughly cool, because there aren't any fires to make
    them hot. Peaceful coolness is their meaning or
    value--unfortunately it is a value too subtle to interest
    people who are still overly enveloped in defilements. When
    brushing aside the defilements for the first time, you will
    be delighted by nibbana more than anything else. This is
    certain, and possible for everyone. May we take the word
    &quot;cool&quot; as the highest value. </p>
    <p>THE EXPRESSION WHICH BEST CONVEYS THE MEANING OF NIBBANA
    IS &quot;THE END OF DUKKHA.&quot; Although the Buddha used
    this term, it's of no interest for those people who don't
    feel that they have any dukkha. They don't feel they have
    dukkha: they want the things they want and there isn't any
    dukkha to quench. And so they don't care about quenching
    dukkha or about the end of dukkha. Even a large number of the
    many foreigners who come to Suan Mokkh have that feeling. But
    once we tell them there is a new life, or quenching of
    thirst, or life which is beyond positive and negative, they
    become extremely interested. This is the difficulty of
    language, which we must use to get people interested in
    nibbana. For each person, there must be one translation of
    the word &quot;nibbana&quot; especially for that person. This
    is not a small difficulty. Yet deep down, without being
    conscious of it or having any intention, everyone wants
    nibbana purely through the power of instinct. </p>
    <p>THE STUDY OF NIBBANA IN DAILY LIFE is possible in order to
    better understand and have greater interest in nibbana's
    meaning. When seeing a fire go out or something hot cooling
    down, look for the meaning of nibbana. When bathing or
    drinking ice water, when a breeze blows or rain falls, take
    notice of the meaning of nibbana. When a fever subsides, a
    swelling goes down, or a headache goes away, recognize the
    meaning of nibbana as being found in those things. When
    perspiring, sleeping comfortably, or eating one's fill, see
    the meaning of nibbana. When seeing an animal with all its
    fierceness and danger tamed out, see the meaning of nibbana.
    All of these are lessons to help us understand the nature of
    nibbana in every moment. The mind will regularly incline
    towards contentment with nibbana and this helps the mind to
    flow more easily along the path of nibbana. </p>
    <p>Whenever finding coolness in your experience, mark that
    coolness firmly in your heart, and breathe out and in.
    Breathing in is cool, breathing out is cool. In cool, out
    cool--do this for a little while. This is an excellent lesson
    which will help you to become a Nibbanakamo (Lover of
    Nibbana) more quickly. The instincts will develop in an
    enlightened (bodhi) way more than if you don't practice like
    this. Natural nibbana--the unconscious quenching of
    defilement--will occur more often and easily. This is the
    best way for the mind to help nature. </p>
    <p>In conclusion, nibbana is not death. It is the coolness
    and deathlessness which is full of life. In the Pali
    scriptures, the word &quot;nibbana&quot; is never used
    regarding death. Nibbana is a natural element always ready to
    make contact with the mind in the sense of being one kind of
    ayatana (sensible thing). If there were no nibbana, Buddhism
    would have no meaning. The genuine kind of nibbana, different
    from the nibbana of other sects, was discovered by the
    Buddha. Natural nibbana can happen simply because the
    defilements arise and end naturally because they are just
    another kind of concocted nature. Every time the defilements
    don't appear, nibbana is manifested to the mind. This kind of
    nibbana nourishes the lives of living things so they survive
    and don't go crazy. At least, it lets us sleep at night.
    Nibbana isn't any kind of special city anywhere. It is in the
    mind which is now void of besieging defilements. For the
    morality of ordinary people at home, its name is
    &quot;nibbuti.&quot; Nibbana isn't the mind, but it appears
    to the mind as a certain ayatana. We can experience nibbana
    here and now by breathing in cool and breathing out cool. It
    is the automatic quenching of heat, of thirst, of dukkha in
    ordinary life, without our being conscious of it. It is the
    eternal nourishment and sustenance of life. </p>
    <p>I hope that you all will begin to know that &quot;nibbana
    for everyone&quot; isn't just &quot;dyeing cats for
    sale,&quot; but is the genuine cat for catching rats--that
    is, dukkha and anxiety--according to the mindfulness and
    wisdom of each person!</p>
