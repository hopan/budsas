      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="6">T</FONT>he 
      population of Myanmar is around 45 million and about 80 per cent of the 
      people are of the Buddhist faith, with the rest consisting of Christians, 
      Muslims, Hindus and a handful of, maybe animists, in the remote regions. 
      But from the cultural aspect the people here, whether they are Buddhist, 
      Hindu, Christian or Muslim tend to be more devout and adhere to the 
      teachings of their respective religions, yet there is respect for each 
      other's faith. However, Buddhists being in the majority, their religious 
      activities seem to be more visible and prominent to the casual foreign 
      visitor who might very well misunderstand the situation and jump to the 
      conclusion that others of differing faiths have not much of a role to play 
      in society. They couldn't be more wrong. If you think seriously about it, 
      80% is a large segment of the population and if say, even only half of 
      them are truly devout Buddhists, then what can you expect? You'll see a 
      huge number of them thronging the pagodas for worship on any day of the 
      week, especially in large cities like Yangon and Mandalay. You will see 
      them making donations large and small for that is an important practice 
      known as <I>dana parami</I> or the virtue of giving as well as holding 
      other ceremonies such as novitiation ceremonies, consecration of pagodas 
      and Buddha images or at the very least offering the early morning meal to 
      a long line of Buddhist monks. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It should also be understood 
      that. Buddhism arrived in Myanmar since the time of the Pyu kingdoms and 
      that Theravada Buddhism has flourished in our country since it was first 
      introduced to King Anawrahta in the 11th century B.C. by the Venerable 
      abbot, Shin Arahan. So naturally you will see pagodas, temples and 
      monasteries new and old wherever you go in Myanmar. We are as a people 
      truly devout Buddhists. But what the stranger needs to know is that we are 
      also a very tolerant people and also have great respect for other faiths. 
      The Buddha Himself taught that it is necessary to have an open mind in his 
      Kalama Sutta and exhorted us not to deride another's belief but to find 
      out for ourselves what truth really is. We place great faith in our 
      religion but are not fanatic about it. There has always been mutual 
      respect and goodwill between Buddhists and those of other faiths. As 
      against the majority of Buddhists, according to facts and figures compiled 
      by the Ministry of Religious Affairs for 2002, the population of 
      Christians in the country is 2,264,884; those of the Islamic faith, 
      1,692,898 and Hindus, 228,654. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There are 3265 churches, 2266 
      mosques and 466 temples countrywide where people of these various faiths 
      can hold services and pray in peace. In addition successive Myanmar 
      governments have accorded respect and recognition to non-Buddhist faiths 
      in various ways. Christmas Day is an official holiday, with government 
      offices and schools closed. A Christmas message is broadcast by a 
      dignitary of the World Council of Churches or some other dignitary. Twelve 
      Christian denominational groups are always in contact with the Ministry of 
      Religious Affairs, which helps them to solve their difficulties and to see 
      that their rights are not infringed upon. Extended stay permits are made 
      available to foreign church dignitaries to enable them to complete their 
      projects, which they were permitted to initiate in the first place. 
      Thirteen leading Christian clerics have been granted permanent 
      complimentary tickets to travel first class by train or boat within the 
      country any time they wish. Import permits are easily obtainable for 
      equipment for use in religious services such as movie projectors, 
      videocassette recorders, pianos and so forth. The churches are free to 
      accept international donations in the way of clothes, toys and stationary 
      and other donations. The Christian community in Myanmar publishes six 
      monthly magazines, two bi-monthly journals, seven quarterly magazines, 
      prayer and hymn books and other religious books. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">With regard to religious 
      buildings, to date there has been construction of 15 new religious 
      buildings such as churches and two major renovations of old premises and 
      10 minor repairs. The Government has donated provisions of rice, oil and 
      foodstuff for the Catholic-run old age home in Kandawgalay and I would 
      like to add that many Buddhists frequently make donations for this aged 
      home because they feel it is in the minority. Buddhists are not forbidden 
      to donate their money towards people and institutions of other religions. 
      They pay obeisance to elders of other religions without a moment's 
      hesitation but respect the rights of people of other faiths who are 
      permitted to pay such homage only to their God and no one else. Like the 
      Christians, Bakri Id, which marks ms end of the Lenten period for Muslims 
      worldwide, is an official government holiday. Myanmar Muslims also freely 
      travel abroad. Myanmar Islamic representatives and observers regularly 
      attend the Asia and Pacific Regional Islamic Conference held every two 
      years at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Myanmar Muslims take part in Koran 
      Recitation Competitions that are held in Kuala Lumpur and Thailand. They 
      recently participated in the 8th Asean Koran Competition held in Paris.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Like the Christian clerics, 
      three Muslim religious leaders have complimentary passes to travel first 
      class by rail or boat anywhere in the country. Annual Haj pilgrimages to 
      Mecca in Saudi Arabia are arranged by the Government. Beginning from the 
      year 1980 a package tour was arranged for 150 pilgrims and from 1992 to 
      2002 the number was increased to 200 pilgrims every year and so far 3640 
      pilgrims have availed themselves of this programme.&nbsp; But there are 
      also pilgrims who travel to Mecca through private arrangements with tour 
      companies. No ban has ever been placed on such religious pilgrimages at 
      any time. Islamic literature and calendars are also freely published. 
      There is a Muslim Free Dispensary, which is free to render services which 
      it does, to both Muslim and non-Muslim alike. Secretary 1 General&nbsp; 
      Khin Nyunt regularly sends messages of salutations on important religious 
      days like the Prophet's Birthday and the Minister of Religious Affairs or 
      sometimes the deputy minister attends such religious ceremonies. The 
      various mosques have their own trust funds and trustees, and there is 
      special legislation whereby Muslims may freely settle any religious 
      disputes or civil suits that may arise between trustees or other religious 
      committees. Families of the Defence Services also donate rice, oil, salt. 
      beans and other foodstuff for needy Muslims every year.</FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Islamic community is free 
      to make renovations to religious buildings and schools and major repairs 
      have been carried on 12 large mosques and 10 smaller ones. Four new 
      religious schools have been built and seven others underwent minor 
      repairs. Four Islamic groups have official and regular contact with the 
      Religious Affairs Depart-ment whose responsi-bility it is to resolve any 
      difficulties or problems they may face. It goes without saying that there 
      is no ban on import of religious books and objects. Those of the Hindu 
      faith enjoy similar rights and freedoms. Government offices and schools 
      are closed when the Hindus celebrate the Dipvali Festival of Lights every 
      year, most recently on 4th November. Four Hindu religious leaders, like 
      their Christian and Islamic counterparts, have complimentary first class 
      tickets to travel by rail or boat anywhere in the country. They are 
      allowed to import religious images such as the goddesses Saraswati and 
      Lakshmi and the God Ganesha, and regularly publish a magazine <I>Thitsar 
      Yaungchi</I> and Hindu calendars. The Minister of Religious Affairs also 
      regularly attends important religious ceremonies The Hindu community has 
      been allowed to build two new temples and make major repairs to four large 
      temples and minor repairs to seven others. Myanmar citizens of the Hindu 
      faith are also tree to travel to foreign parts on pilgrimage or to attend 
      religious conferences. Thus every Myanmar citizen enjoys the right and 
      freedom to worship the religion of his choice, and there is firm evidence 
      everywhere. In large cities or small towns you will see many pagodas, Yes! 
      But you will also see churches, mosques and Hindu temples. </FONT></P>
      <P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Steven Martin, writing about 
      Mandalay in his essay &quot;Orwell's Burma&quot; in <I>Time</I>, Traveller, Fall 
      2002 issue, p.74, wrote: &quot;Steeples and minarets compete with stupas for 
      the skyline of Mandalay, the result of Indian immigration and Christian 
      missionizing, and from these houses of worship pour the noises of faith: 
      gongs, hymns, bells and the call of the muezzin,&quot; adding, &quot;These sounds 
      would have been familiar to Orwell.&quot; He was not writing about Mandalay of 
      the past but the present. Our leaders are also devout Buddhists, but they 
      attend religious ceremonies of other faiths. Secretary 1 General Khin 
      Nyunt attends some of these occasions despite his tight schedule like the 
      9th Christian Youth Day sponsored by the World Council of Churches and the 
      Minister and Deputy Minister of Religious Affairs regularly attend 
      important religious services of other faiths.&nbsp; The people also are 
      very tolerant. This is hardly surprising if you consider the fact that the 
      only great religion in the world that did not engage in a Holy war is 
      Buddhism. Buddha was a man of peace and our religion is a religion of 
      peace.</FONT></P>
