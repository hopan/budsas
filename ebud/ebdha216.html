        What is the general Buddhist view of death?</em></font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Bhante Gunaratana:</strong>&nbsp;
        First, the definition. When the life force -- heat and consciousness --
        ceases to exist, then that is called death. Death can occur: 1) when
        one's own kamma is exhausted, 2) when one's own life span is exhausted,
        that is, the span allotted for that particular life (one can only live
        so long and after that one has to die). 3) when both kamma and life span
        are exhausted together, or 4) when life ends due to accidental,
        unnatural causes. These are the ways that death can come.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So death in Buddhism is not the end of
        total existence. Death is just closing one chapter and the next chapter
        is opened immediately after that. These two always go immediately
        together-death and rebirth.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Sudhamma:</strong> People
        are always worried about how to prepare for death. Perhaps there are two
        levels to be addressed. One being how to prepare the ordinary mind for
        this, or what to do properly at the time of death.</font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The other, how to go beyond the whole
        cycle of birth and death. In other words, how to prepare for death by no
        longer being subject to death.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Bhante Gunaratana:</strong>&nbsp;
        I see. We want to talk about two types of death. One is conventional
        death and the other is final death. Conventional death also has two
        sides, one is moment-to-moment death, the other is the
        &quot;actual&quot; death that cannot be revived.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In moment-to-moment death, you seem to
        have survived. You still exist. But in fact everything in the body and
        mind is dying every given moment. And it is renewing -- being reborn.
        Repetitive death and renewal doesn't appear to be occurring. We seem to
        be alive. But you have to understand that death happens every moment.
        Understanding this truth is the most important step in preparing for
        death. That is understanding the meaning of death. If we understand
        this, we understand that &quot;actual&quot; death is just another
        moment. Up to that moment, I've died trillions of times. Each of those
        times was a momentary death.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>M.B</strong>. And that, I
        think, is what we realize in mediation?</font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Bhante G.</strong>&nbsp; Yes,
        that's what we realize in meditation. Actually, if you practice insight
        meditation and concentration meditation, one helps to understand the
        other. So if you gain insight, you understand what concentration is. If
        you gain concentration, you understand what insight is. In a
        concentrated, mindful state, you really feel, experience, and know this
        momentary death. You feel your palpitations, your heartbeat, your
        nervous vibrations, your sensations changing, your perception changing,
        and every thought changing.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Change, simply, means momentary death.
        When things change, they never can be revived. When a thought-moment is
        dead, that thought-moment will never, ever, appear again. The death of a
        cell means that when it dies, it's finished. That cell can never be
        revived. It should not remain in the body. It should be discarded,
        expelled from the body, in order for other cells to grow and develop. If
        they aren't discarded from the body, they can grow in the body, and we
        can develop cancer.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once the cell is dead, it must be
        discarded, just as when the human body dies, it must be discarded. It
        has to be gotten out of the house. It has to go somewhere to be buried
        or burned so that others can live a healthy, hygienic life.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This kind of thing is happening all the
        time. Through vipassana meditation we see moment-to-moment death, we
        experience it, we know it, we become fully aware, and that is the way to
        prepare for death. So we prepare for &quot;actual&quot; death on the
        experiential level.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We further prepare for
        &quot;actual&quot; death by looking at it logically. You just open your
        eyes and look around. Everything is dying all the time. You can see that
        trees, plants and insects die all the time. When you have lived forty
        years, for example, and count the number of friends, relatives, and so
        forth who have died, you have to one day sit down and think, &quot;In
        this way I must know that with the number of my friends, my relatives,
        my acquaintances -- with all these people dying, now it is my turn. So
        in this way I know that I must die. My friends, my classmates, one by
        one, one by one, one by one have died. Next is my turn.&quot; So that's
        another way to look at death.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another logical way to think of death is
        to think that all of us are made up of impermanent objects. For
        instance, we are made up of earth, water, fire, air. Yet tomorrow,
        they're not there. Therefore the elements can never remain permanent.
        The elements of which the body is made are subject to death,
        impermanence. Therefore the product is going to be impermanent, too.
        There's no way to stop it. Thus examining the elements of the body is
        another logical way of looking at death.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once we understand the truth of death,
        we should think, &quot;Now that I'm going to die, why should I be so
        proud of something? I'm intimidated by the thought of death; I don't
        have any reason to be proud of anything. I don't have any reason to hold
        a grudge against anybody. Sooner or later I will die, and I don't have
        any reason to try to hold on to anything. No matter how hard I try to
        hold on, it will slip away from my hand at the time of separation. So I
        don't need greed either. I think, that if I don't hold onto my greed, my
        death will be very peaceful.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next thing to think is, &quot;I know
        that I will die, I think it is good for me to die peacefully, so let me
        prepare for that. Let me have peace all the time.&quot; That doesn't
        mean that you lie on the road waiting for a truck to run over you, or
        that you take poison, or commit suicide. That is not the way to obtain
        peace. We have to live this life as long as it lasts. We have to do as
        we are doing. We must therefore think, &quot;Since I'm going to die
        anyway, I must die peacefully.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">To die peacefully, we must prepare our
        minds to remain peaceful. A peaceful death is a painless death.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>M.B.</strong>&nbsp; Can you
        talk a little about physical pain due to illness?</font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Bhante G.</strong>&nbsp; Yes,
        when we meditate, we have physical pain, for example, pain in the knee.
        We can use this pain to prepare for the pain of a final illness. The
        knee pain is like cancer pain. I think that if the cancer affects our
        nervous system, then we're always in pain. No matter what we do, the
        nerves are exposed and we have pain.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore, we must prepare our minds by
        learning to practice meditation on feelings. We determine to always look
        at our feelings, no matter what the feeling is, even a tiny little
        toothache, neck ache, any little, little ache. If we are experiencing
        pain, we meditate on that. When pain arises, we focus on it. We watch it
        as it arises, how long it remains, and then we watch it fall. Every
        time, a little pain has these three stages, its rising moment, its peak
        moment, and its passing away moment.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we condition our mind to be with that
        pain, or with that feeling, then our mind can get absorbed into the
        feeling and become one with the feeling. If we turn against the pain,
        then we try to dichotomize ourselves. But if we try to accept whatever
        comes, we absorb into it. Even when we have intense pain, we will come
        to a point where the mind cannot tolerate it any further and then the
        mind merges with the pain. After that it doesn't matter what happens.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So before death happens, we learn to
        willingly accept and stay with pain, watch the pain, and not get upset
        with the pain. The more upset we are with the pain, the more painful it
        is. The more we relax with the sensation, the less painful it will be. I
        know some friends who have died a physically very agonizing and painful
        death. They refused to take medication. Yet they even explained to
        visitors where the cancer was, how it developed, and what stage it was
        in now. Instead of the visitors trying to console the patient, it was
        rather the patient consoling the visitors.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The patient thinks the visitors come out
        of sympathy, out of compassion, to give him some encouragement, but when
        he can relax with the pain, it is he who gives sympathy, compassion and
        encouragement to the visitors. So physical pain in a last illness
        doesn't necessarily need to prevent a peaceful death.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>M.B.</strong>&nbsp; What
        about when someone has gone over the pain threshold where it's
        impossible to relax and soften into the pain?</font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Bhante G.</strong>&nbsp; You
        know, there is some pain that a person cannot handle, and then
        medication is necessary. But we can first try to increase the tolerance
        of pain by conditioning the mind and preparing it to accept the physical
        pain. We can condition the mind by very kindly and gently trying to
        advise the person to meditate. We can chant some soothing, comforting
        chants, play some soothing, comforting music to prepare the mind, to try
        to help the mind remain peaceful. Give them instructions in meditation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">You remember that women who are having
        labor pains are taught these days to concentrate on their breath. They
        keep the rhythm of breathing. When they push the baby out, they're
        focusing on their breath and on their body and on the pushing.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">That's a very beautiful thing for us to
        remember. We can use this information to teach people. And these mothers
        have babies with less pain because they are trained to do that. So we
        train the mind to accept the pain. We can use the information from
        mothers in labor to teach dying people how to manage pain.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So therefore we have to train the mind.
        Instead of dealing with the physical pain first, we learn how to treat
        the mind first. Because these two are always cooperating. When the body
        becomes calm, the mind becomes calm. They're always complementary to
        each other.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>M.B.</strong>&nbsp; How do
        you feel about painkillers?</font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Bhante G.</strong>&nbsp; I think
        that they have side effects. They can drop your blood pressure. Some
        people can't take them and they can be very dangerous. A person has to
        keep only a certain amount of them in his blood stream.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">But meditation was invented long before
        medication was discovered. Now people don't pay attention to that
        spiritual training and they go straight away to narcotics or
        painkillers. Now we want to reverse the order again because the
        spiritual treatment is more healthy than chemical treatment.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">People take all kinds of pills, you
        know, and they all have side effects, especially after long usage. But
        spiritual training will never have side effects. It always builds up. It
        always prolongs your life. And any side effects it may have improve your
        life, give a better taste to life. When you come out of a painful state,
        when you do these things when you're sick, they have a peaceful effect
        that last long after you have recovered from the painful state.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, to get back to death. Actually, we
        haven't digressed, because illness is the cause of death and illness has
        pain. To die very quickly without any pain is no problem. So I think
        talking about pain is quite fundamental for any discussion of death.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Sudhamma</strong>:&nbsp;
        We've talked about two kinds of death -- moment-to-moment and
        &quot;actual.&quot; At one point you were talking about letting go of
        grudges and greed and having a peaceful mind. Where were you headed with
        that?</font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Bhante G:</strong>&nbsp; I'd
        like to talk about permanent death, that is, dying never to be reborn
        again. You are tired of this birth and death, moment by moment and life
        by life. So one moment begins and ends and another begins and ends. One
        life begins and ends and another begins and ends. We get tired of all
        that. Then we want death, never to be born again.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Death causes birth because there's a
        desire to be reborn. As long as you have that desire, you will be
        reborn. When the desire to be reborn is exhausted, then you won't be
        reborn.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">And that leads us to the last stage of
        Enlightenment.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Sudhamma:</strong> When you
        were talking about death, you were talking about making the mind
        peaceful and you said something about &quot;Let me have a peaceful mind.
        Let me have a peaceful death.&quot; Were you done with that?</font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Bhante G:</strong>&nbsp; Yes,
        but I do want to mention something else. When death is approaching, a
        person often has remorse, regret and guilt. That is another reason for
        fear. Since he knows that he's going to be reborn, since he's done a lot
        of wrong things, at the time of death, he remembers them. This is called
        &quot;death-proximate thought.&quot; In death-proximate thought, in that
        split-second time of death, he remembers very vividly, like a flashing
        light, certain things that have happened. Death is still painful
        psychologically.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore, very compassionate people,
        when a person is going to die, help him to have a peaceful death by
        first telling him the good things he's done. For instance, if he's
        brought up children, the compassionate person can tell the dying person
        how much he's done for the children and about all the other good things
        he's done for others. They need to remind him of the good things he's
        done. If he has brothers and sisters, they also can say the good things
        he's done. Anything he's done, planting trees, cleaning the road, they
        can remind him of, with conviction.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Secondly, they can ask him to think of a
        peaceful object, like the Buddha, a heavenly light, tranquillity and
        peace, the joy he's had in his life, to try to block off all the
        negative thoughts. Thirdly, if you have access to a religious person, a
        monk or a priest or someone like that, call him immediately to come and
        ask him to give a sermon. Although the dying person before that may have
        hated sermons, now he will listen to sermons, even willingly, because
        there's nothing else to do.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So These are things for the dying person
        to do and for other people to do to help him die peacefully.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>M.B.:</strong>&nbsp; I've
        been reading Philip Kapleau [1]. He talks in a way that made me wonder
        about the self and the &quot;no-self&quot; and death. After reading him
        I thought, &quot;How can death exist, if there's nothing to die?&quot;</font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Bhante G:</strong>&nbsp; That
        sounds very abstract -- to say that there's nothing to die. That is the
        philosophical basis of what we're doing. In the final analysis, nothing
        exists. And when nothing exists, there's nothing to die.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">But you have to have a very powerful
        state of mind to have that thought at the moment of death. Long before
        death, when you're healthy, you can have these sorts of thoughts, but at
        the moment of death, all your senses are weak. Your thinking capacity is
        weak. When you're on the verge of death, everything is weak.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the Abhidhamma [classical
        compilation of Buddhist psychology], there's a weak stream of thought.
        The conscious stream of thought is the shortest stream of thought. At
        other times, the stream of thought has seventeen moments. When death
        comes, the stream of thought has fifteen or twelve or thirteen moments.
        Because everything is weak, when you're almost dead, what is left is
        only a very little bit of your consciousness. You have no interest in
        anything at that stage. I don't think philosophy would work.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>M.B.:</strong> I've also
        been reading Stephen Levine [2], and he says that if you can realize
        that there's nothing to hold onto anyway, you won't have such trouble
        letting go at the end. In his book he has many meditations about letting
        go.</font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Bhante G.:</strong> That is a
        good idea. The person must be reminded of the fact that he has eaten so
        many times in his life and all those meals are gone. What of them is
        left now? All his activities, all of his thoughts, all of his material
        possessions are gone.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So no matter how hard we try to hold
        onto something, it slips away from our grip. And it is a very good idea
        to make a person aware of this. The longer you mentally cling, the more
        painful it will be. It is just like tightening a fist. The harder you
        tighten your fist, the more painful it is. When you open your fist and
        loosen it you feel comfort and relief.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Similarly, at this moment, if you
        released your anxiety, your tension, your tightening, you would feel the
        relief of pain, an easing. That's a good thought -- to let go of things.
        And that's another thing we do in Vipassana meditation. We let go. We
        enjoy when we enjoy, but we don't hang on. Eat, if it's tasty and enjoy
        the taste! But if it's not tasty, it's distasteful, don't hold onto
        that!</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Sudhamma:</strong>&nbsp;
        When you first talked about death, you said that there was conventional
        death and final death. Tell me about the final death!</font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Bhante G:</strong> The final
        death is the death of the enlightened person. An enlightened person has
        these thoughts. First, he thinks, &quot;Well, I have done what was to be
        done. There's nothing more to do.&quot; This is the most exquisite,
        wonderful thought to have in mind. We can die at any moment. We don't
        have to wait to have this thought. Any moment we can think, &quot;I have
        done so many things in my life. Those are the things I was supposed to
        do, and I have done them. What I'm doing now may be extra, extra duties
        in addition to my original duties. I can go very easily without these
        extra duties.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Extra duties are an enlightened person's
        service to the world. They are not necessary for him, but the body and
        mind are there, and there are beings who support the body and mind, so
        why not live usefully and mindfully for their benefit, to support them.
        So he says, &quot; For me there is nothing more to do. I have done
        everything.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Secondly, and this is the enlightened
        person's rational thinking. It is based on the enlightened person's
        release of mind. He thinks, &quot;I am liberated.&quot; This kind of
        thought appears in his mind without any effort, naturally.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the other hand, whenever he thinks of
        his body, he knows the nature of it and has no clinging. He's in a state
        of letting go of all things. Therefore he has nothing personal to hold
        onto -- no beings or thoughts or things like that. That also comes to
        him very naturally.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">But in some cases, in spite of all that
        letting go, a person still has the desire to be reborn. Perhaps he wants
        to be reborn in a better place or, if he's lived this life serenely, had
        an ideal life with an ideal wife, he might say, &quot;I'd like to have
        this wife even in my next life. I want to be reborn to have the same
        kind of life I've had, to have the same comfort, the same emotional,
        spiritual satisfaction that made this life very peaceful. Therefore let
        me have this life again.&quot; Then no matter how noble the person is,
        the person will have the same life again. He will be reborn because, no
        matter how noble he is, he still has the desire.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">But an enlightened person is nobler than
        that. One who is liberated doesn't even have that desire. He knows that
        even that is mentally created. That is <strong><em>sankara</em></strong>
        [a mental formation, conditioned and impermanent].</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Any sankara, no matter how wholesome it
        appears, is impermanent. Moreover, an enlightened person knows that his
        death is exhausted, that is, he will never die again. To die again, you
        have to be born again. &quot;So this is my final death. This is my final
        birth. There is no more birth, no more death for me. There is nothing
        beyond this.&quot; He comes to this realization. So that is what is
        called the final death.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the enlightened person approaches
        his final death, he doesn't need any of those other consoling agents
        around him to help him, teachers and so forth to console his body and to
        console his mind.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">That person also doesn't have any of the
        memories of those death-proximate thoughts. An ordinary person remembers
        the things he's done, his kamma, and he has fears about where he'll be
        reborn. This is called a &quot;sign.&quot; He will have a sign of the
        place where he is going to be born. This means that if at the moment of
        death, you're going to be reborn, you may see the human mother. If
        you're going to be reborn as an animal, you'll see the animal.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Sudhamma</strong>:&nbsp;
        Like a face?</font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Bhante G.:</strong> Like a
        vision.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Sudhamma:&nbsp;</strong> A
        person? A womb?</font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Bhante G:</strong>&nbsp; If it's
        a human rebirth, maybe moisture, as in a womb. You might see a uterus
        and feel what it's like inside a uterus. If you're going to be reborn as
        a human you'll see that. If you're going to be reborn as a divine being,
        you'll see a peaceful place.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">But when final death is approaching, you
        don't see any of those signs. That's why it is called
        &quot;Signless.&quot; There's no sign at that moment. And that is the
        Buddhist view of birth, death, and liberation.</font></p>
