      [2]<br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      The change of anything new is always a time of great ferment and great
      expectations, and when the new century also marks the dawn of a new
      millennium our expectations are likely to be especially intense. Optimism
      makes us thinks that the new is always bound to be better than the old,
      that the arrival of the new year or century will inevitably bring our
      deepest dreams to fulfillment. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">New millennium marks the change of time
      and calendar. Similarly, the state of youth [3] marks the change in human
      life. Youth is the period of Human life that has tremendous potentialities
      for its impact, good or bad, on modern societies. According to Oxford
      English Dictionary a youth not only indicates the changing period of
      childhood and adult age but also means new, freshness, vigour, wantonness,
      rashness, etc. which are the typical characteristics of a youth. Youth is
      a time when most drastic changes take place in human life both physically
      and psychologically. Youth is not only a crucial period of human life but
      they are also the future builders of a society. They are future
      administrators, planners, engineers, doctors, teachers, artists, religious
      leaders and so on. Youth are full of energy and they are the real force of
      changes in a society. Therefore, youth itself designates a changing force
      in society both progress and regress.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Prince Siddhartha who was born here at
      Lumbini twenty-six centuries ago renounced the life of the palace and
      entered the forest as a hermit seeking a solution to the problem of
      suffering when he was youth. Later he was enlightened and he founded
      Buddhism when he was still in his youthful age. It is clear from the
      teachings of the Buddha that he always emphasizes on the potentiality of
      youth. For example, Buddha says, 'Having led neither a good life nor
      acquired wealth (spiritual) in youth, they pine away as aged herons around
      a fish less pond or they lie about like broken bows sighing about the
      past' (Dhammapada 155/156).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Pali texts there are at least four
      synonyms for 'youth' viz. dahara, taruna, yuva and bala but the most
      frequently used term is bala. In linguistics, the term bala (in Pali) can
      mean two different meanings: bala as a young age or ignorant (often with
      reference to ignorance in a moral sense) and bala as a foolish, lacking in
      reason, devoid of the power to think and act right. It is contrasted with
      pandita which means wise, skilled, intelligent, etc. In a similar vein,
      the English term youth can also mean young in age as well as rashness or
      wantonness. In both language of Buddhism or English 'youth' has an
      ambivalent meaning, referring either to ignorance or foolish. By ignorance
      it means one who is destitute of knowledge or unlearned but by foolish it
      means intellectually deficiency or one deficient in judgment or sense. The
      difference between intellectual (pandita) and foolish (bala) youth is
      sikkha, or education, namely learning, training and development. Youth who
      have been trained, educated or developed are called pandita, or 'noble
      youth.' They know how to conduct a good life for themselves and also help
      their society in peace and happiness. Youth who have been not train,
      educated or developed are called bala, or 'foolish youth.' They are always
      foolish youth intellectually and in behavior regardless of their worldly
      qualifications.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddha advised (Samyuttanikaya V: 29-31)
      that to be truly involved in this education, youth, who are the new
      members of the human race, should acquire the seven fundamental qualities
      known as the auroras of a good life, or the dawn of education. These are
      the guarantees of a life moving towards full human development, to become
      truly noble youth and noble beings. They are: (1) Kalyanamittata (having a
      'good friend'), seeking out sources of wisdom and good examples; (2)
      Sila-sampada (perfection of morality), having discipline as a foundation
      for one's life development; (3) Chanda-sampada (perfection of aspiration),
      having a heart that spires to learning and constructive action; (4)
      Atta-sampada (Perfection of oneself), dedicating oneself to training for
      the realization of one's full human potential; (5) Ditthi-sampada
      (Perfection of view), adhering to the principle of conditionality, seeing
      things according to cause and effect; (6) Appamada-sampada (perfection of
      heedfulness; establishing oneself in heedfulness; and (7)
      Yonisomanasikara-sampada (perfection of wise reflection), thinking wisely
      so as to realize benefit and see the truth.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Today, as we stand at the threshold of the
      new millennium, our world has become a living paradox. It is a world of
      immense wealth, but also of grinding poverty where many live in constant
      want. A world has achieved tremendous advances in medicine, health care
      and technology, whereas a large number of people also die annually from
      diseases that are easily curable, A world where the daily trade in lethal
      weapons numbers in the millions of dollars yet where many millions of
      children die of hunger each year and many millions are severely
      undernourished. A world where information technology disseminates
      information around the globe in a second while many millions of people are
      still illiterate and uneducated. In the religious field, there are many
      beautiful and huge churches, monasteries, religious buildings, icons and
      centers but at the same time people are morally degrading. And perhaps
      most alarming of all, a world bent on unlimited economic growth on a
      planet whose finite resources are rapidly dwindling. Thus our bold strides
      towards the future, our world still suffers from painful wounds, and the
      need for a solution, for a cure, has become ever more insistent of
      humanity is to survive intact through to the end of the coming millennium.
      Needless to say that the changes are efficient when it is done in time,
      when people are still youth both in energy and intellectual.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Psychologists regard youth period as a
      critical or turning point in life. At this stage, traditions are made and
      lost quickly. Psychological need also change and these changes affect
      attitudes towards life and understanding. Most socio-political problems
      like drug abuse, prostitution, AIDS, unemployment, education, theft,
      robbery, crime, vandalism, terrorism, political demonstration, etc. are
      all mostly related to youth. If we look around us all good and bad like
      military force, working force, students, demonstrators, thieves, sex
      abuser and so on are mostly youth of society. They are our sons and
      daughters. One who has adequate wisdom became good force of the society
      while one who lack such moral guidance developed to be a social problem.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Youth are foundations of human beings,'
      Buddha declared twenty-five hundred years ago. At present, we also say
      that youth are the pillars of a nation and in a similar vein; Buddhist
      youth are the pillars of Buddhism. Nevertheless, the questions are hanging
      upon the air in every society that have we done enough for the benefit of
      youth? How to develop youth resources to be the efficient force of the
      society? And how to solve the youth problem in every society?
      Unquestionably, the answer to these questions is to build a good,
      righteous and strong youth, the foundation of all human beings, for
      betterment of mankind and society. That is to transform and change every
      youth to be a good, intellectual, wise and righteous youth. This is where
      Buddhist teachings come to alive and help to develop youth.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the course of this paper I wish to
      formulate a Theravada Buddhist response to build and improve the youth
      looking through a magnifying glass of Triple Gem, the main Buddhist
      pillars. In Buddhist teachings, if we carefully examine the discourse of
      the Buddha, we would see that Buddha was keenly aware of the problems we
      confront in the social dimensions of human life, and he designed his
      teachings to address these problems just as much as to show the way to
      final liberation. Although these teachings remain in the background,
      hidden behind the more numerous texts dealing with personal ethics, mental
      development, and philosophical understanding, I feel they can be drawn
      upon for clear-cut practical guidelines for youth of today addressing the
      weighty problems we face today.<br>
      Buddha and youth.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The youth life of the Buddha can be an
      inspirational virtue for youth of today. How Buddha spent his youth period
      and what was the Buddha's youth spirit at his time are relevant issues for
      youth today to think about and take it as a model. Little detail is said
      in the Pali Canon about the Buddha's childhood and youth, but the given
      text gives an impression that he lived a life of luxury within the wall of
      three palaces used for each of the three seasons of Kapilavasthu in
      southern Nepal. The young prince wore fine garments,was perfumed with
      fragrances and surrounded by musician and attendants who ministered to his
      every need. Although these conditions might be calculated to produce the
      archetypal 'spoilt youth' the Buddha's character does not seem to have
      suffered unduly, and he is depicted as a precocious but considerate youth
      with a keen intelligence.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">As a nature of youth he was not satisfied
      with what he had and what he was given by his elders. Although palace life
      was comfortable it was unfulfilling, and the young Buddha yearned for a
      deeper and more spiritually satisfying way of life. The legends represent
      this disaffection in a story in which the Buddha made four visits outside
      the place in a chariot where he happened to encounter unpleasant sights of
      an old man, a sick man, a corpse and a peaceful religious mendicant.
      Theses four signs experiences impressed upon him above all the transient
      nature of human existence and he realized that not even the palace walls
      could keep suffering and death at bay and made up his mind to leave the
      palace. Taking a last look at his sleeping wife and child, he departed to
      become a homeless mendicant while he was still young to do so.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The simple, touching story is hard to
      believe in he literal sense. It is hard to believe that the Buddha was as
      naive as the story portrays him, or that his disenchantment with palace
      life was nearly as sudden. If we read it as a parable in which palace life
      represents complacency and self-delusion, and the vision of the four signs
      the dawning of a realization about the nature of human life. If the Buddha
      were alive today he would see the four signs all around: every elderly
      person,every hospital, and every funeral would bespeak the brevity and
      fragility of life, while every temple and religious minister would be
      testimony to the belief that a religious solution to these problems can be
      found. The parable seems to suggest that although the signs are all
      around, most people-like the youth Buddha-construct mental barriers (the
      palace walls) to keep unpleasant realities at bay. Even then, there are
      times when the unwelcome facts of life thrust themselves upon us in a
      manner it is impossible to ignore, such as in sickness or bereavement,
      just as they did when the Buddha went forth in his chariot. For youth of
      every period and country such mental barriers blocks 'right path' and
      opens wrong path instead.<br>
      Shaken from its complacency the Buddha made the radical decision to turn
      his back on family life and go in search of spiritual knowledge. This
      decision was not unprecedented because it is a nature of youth to take
      such radical decision. We are witnessing everyday around us that the
      today's youth takes such radical decision too but sadly the wrong decision
      mostly. the examples of youth today taking such radical decision are to
      enter cult, political arena, drug addiction, sexual crime and so on.
      Rightly, modern psychologists regarded youth period as a turning point in
      life.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha's life story portrays that the
      Buddha was a good student and a quick learner. For six years he wondered,
      studied and mastered many subjects and fields including
      self-mortification. Nevertheless, it is natural that the younger
      generation with some education should question the decision of their
      elders, since policies in almost every sphere of life will affect both
      their present and future lives. In similar vein, the Buddha questioned all
      his teachers and unsatisfied with all techniques he had studied and
      mastered. Still the Buddha did not give up his determination. Evaluating
      his earlier live of self-indulgence and experience of self-mortification
      he came out with a 'middle way' between extreme of this kind. Channeling
      his youth force properly to the practice of meditation in the course of
      one night he attained the complete state of awakening which he sought. He
      became the Buddha, the Awakened One while he as a youth spirit.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Little biographical detail is available
      concerning the latter half of the Buddha's life. It is clear, however,
      that his time was taken up traveling on foot through the towns and
      villages addressing audiences of many kinds form different religious,
      social, and economic backgrounds.<br>
      Dhamma and youth</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Numerically, it is said that there are
      84,000 Dhammas or the teachings of the Buddha in the Pali Canon. Those
      teachings were taught by the Buddha to different people who have abilities
      to understand his teachings in different occasions and places. Those
      teachings of the Buddha can be used and practiced by both adults and youth
      alike according to an individual's capabilities not only to achieve the
      supreme liberation, Nibbana, but also to lead happy life and peaceful
      society. Nevertheless, there are some teachings that Buddha taught aiming
      directly to children and youth. Buddha taught these groups in a way that
      his listeners could understand it. For example, there is a story in the
      Dhammapada commentary which the Buddha taught a group of youth on the
      virtue of not to harm any life:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">On one morning, Buddha went out for alms
        round the city street. Buddha saw a group of youth beating a snake with
        a stick. Buddha asked those youth: 'what are you doing?' 'A snake,
        venerable sir, beating with a stick.' 'Why ?' 'Because we were scared
        that it will bite us, venerable sir.' Buddha then advised them, 'he who
        search for his own happiness by beating animals who love happiness with
        a stick will never be happy. Whereas he who search for his own happiness
        by not beating animals who love happiness with a stick will always be
        happy.' listening to the Buddha, the group of youth understood and
        stopped afflicting any animal's life.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The most common and widely known
      formulation of the Buddha's teaching is that which the Buddha himself
      announced in the First Sermon at Benaras, the formula of the Four Noble
      Truths. The Buddha declares that these truths convey in a nutshell all he
      essential information that we need to set out on the path to liberation.
      He says that just as the elephant's footprint, by reason of its great
      size, contains the footprints of all other animals, so the Four Noble
      Truths, by reason of their comprehensiveness, contain within themselves
      all wholesome and beneficial teachings. The Four Noble Truths can be
      deducted into a pragmatic approach of the Threefold Training viz. morality
      (sila), cultivation of mind (samadhi), and wisdom (panna). Therefore, in
      Buddhist training morality, cultivation of mind and wisdom have
      significant roles. It is a procedure formula for training in Buddhism as
      Buddha himself used in the case of his own son Ven. Rahula.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080"><b>The Threefold Training
      as a Systematic Training for Youth</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Looking at the training profile of Ven.
      Rahula, the Buddha's son, who was ordained at the age of seven it is clear
      that Buddha taught him different teachings and training according to his
      physical and mental growth. However, Ven. Rahula was able to attain an
      Arhant when he was just about 21 years old. Obviously, there were numerous
      teachings which Ven. Rahula might lean from the teachings that were given
      one-to-one basis to Ven. Rahula by the Buddha it is clear that Buddha has
      developed the Threefold Training-morality, cultivation of mind and
      wisdom-as a systematic training for youth according to their growth of
      age. For younger youth Buddha emphasized the virtue of morality and
      gradually trained them to cultivate their mind and wisdom. In the like
      manner, we should reconsider this ancient educational system to apply with
      youth of today because Buddhism is akaliko, the timeless teachings.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font color="#000080">The training
      profile of Ven. Rahula according to his age <br>
      </font></b><br>
      According to discourses in the Majjhimanikaya the Buddha exhorted his son
      Ven. Rahula novice who was about 7-10 years old, on the necessity of
      observing the fundamental moral precept of truthfulness, and of practicing
      mindfulness, by giving the similes of the upturned water pot, the royal
      elephant and the mirror (see Amballatthikarahulovada sutta). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the second stage, when Ven. Rahula was
      18 years old he was taught on breathing meditation by Ven. Sariputta. The
      Buddha further explained to him the advantages of breathing meditation
      (Anapana) and gave him another discourse on the four great elements
      followed by many other meditation techniques (e.g. loving-kindness
      meditation) (see Maharaulovada Sutta).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the final stage, when Ven Rahula
      reached the age of 20 years old who was then a Bhikkhu of the Order fully
      mature to receive the highest Dhamma the Buddha exhorted him on the
      cultivation of wisdom in the form of questions and answers on the nature
      of the Three Common Characteristics: impermanence (aniccata), suffering
      (Dukkhata and not-self (anattata). Consequently, Ven. Rahula attained to
      Arhatship after he had completed with the Threefold Training (see
      Cularahulovada Sutta). <br>
      In this way, the Buddha fulfilled his duty towards his son not only as a
      biological father alone by showing him the right path to lead his life but
      also as a spiritual father who trained him step by step till he was
      enlightened. Ven Rahula himself also behaved as a good son of the Buddha
      and a good youth of the society. he obediently listened to his father's
      instructions and practiced accordingly and he was always eager for study.
      Later Buddha himself praised Ven. Rahula as the young monk who is eager of
      study (Sikkhakama) whom every youth should take as a model.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Youth is the changing period form physical
      and psychological perspectives and it is the period of learning and
      studying. Therefore, every youth should try to be a Sikkhakama or an eager
      person of studying as Ven. Rahula. Every youth should train to use a
      reflecting mirror of the Buddha, the mind mirror. Use it to reflect and
      examine one's acts or kamma. Seeing it one should purity it like we take
      bath to clean our bodies and look at a mirror to spot the one's cleanness.
      therefore, youth should purify one's mind as we clean our bodies and
      should multiply happiness as age increases.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another popular example of Dhamma for
      youth widely referred in Buddhism is the teaching given by the Buddha on
      the laymen's ethics of discipline to a householder youth named Sigala. It
      is described by Emperor Asoka as the code of discipline (Vinaya) for the
      laity, paralleling that for monks and nuns. In it, Sigala represents a
      typical youth not only of the past but also of today.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sigala was the son of a Buddhist family
      residing at Rajagaha. His parents were devout followers of the Buddha, but
      the son was indifferent to religion. the pious father and mother could not
      by any means persuade their son to accompany them to visit the Buddha or
      his disciples and hear the noble Doctrine. The son thought it practically
      useless to pay visits to the Sangha, as such visits may entail material
      loss. He was only concerned with material prosperity; to him spiritual
      progress was of no avail. Constantly he would say to his father : &quot;I
      will have nothing to do with monks. Paying homage to them would make my
      back ache, and my knees stiff. I should have to sit on the ground and soil
      and wear out my clothes. And when, at the conversations with them, after
      so sitting, one gets to know t em, one has to invite them and give them
      offerings, and so one only loses by it.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Finally as the father was about to die, he
      called his son to his deathbed, and inquired whether he would at least
      listen to his parting advice. &quot;Most assuredly, dear father, I shall
      carry out any order you may be pleased to enjoin on me,&quot; he replied.
      &quot;Well then, dear son, after your morning bath worship the six
      quarters.&quot; The father asked him to do so hoping that one day or
      other, while the son was so engaged, the Buddha or his disciples would see
      him, and make it an occasion to preach an appropriate discourse to him.
      And since deathbed wishes are to be remembered, Sigala carried out his
      father's wish, not, however, knowing its true significance.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">One morning Sigala was caught in the net
      of the Buddha's compassion; and with his vision the Buddha, seeing that
      Sigala could be shown a better channel for his acts of worship, decided:
      &quot;This day will I discourse to Sigala on the layman's Vinaya (code of
      discipline). That discourse will be of benefit to many folk. There must I
      go.&quot; T he Buddha thereon came up to him on his way for alms to
      Rajagaha; and seeing him engaged in his worship of the six quarters,
      delivered this great discourse which contains in brief, the whole domestic
      and social duty of the layman. In the Buddha's interpretation, the six
      directions become metaphors for different social relationship.</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>The discourse of
        Sigala in brief (Digha-nikaya III. 180) </b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The youth Sigala used to worship the six
        cardinal points, named the East, the South, the West, the North, the
        nadir and the Zenith in obedience to the last advice given by his dying
        father. the Buddha explained to the young man that according to his
        Teaching, the six directions were: the East standing for parents; the
        South for teachers; the West standing for the wife and children; the
        North standing for friends and associates; the Nadir standing for
        servants, employees; the Zenith standing for brahmans and mendicants. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha explained further that the
        six social groups mentioned in the discourse were to be regarded as
        sacred and worthy of respect and worship. One worshiped them by
        performing one's duties towards them. Then these duties were explained
        to the youth Sigala. (see Sigalovada Sutta) .</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Commenting on this discourse, the
      Venerable Buddhaghosa says, &quot;Nothing in the duties of a householder
      is left unmentioned. This discourse is called the Vinaya of the
      householder. Hence one who practices what he has been taught in it, growth
      is to be looked for, not decay.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><b><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Sangha and youth</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The social nucleus of Buddhism is the
      order of monks and nuns (sangha) founded by the Buddha. while the Buddhist
      Order is the central social institution, however, Buddhism is not just a
      religion for monks. Early sources offer a sociological classification of
      Buddhism as 'The Fourfold Order', consisting of monks, nuns, and devout
      male and female lay disciples (Upasaka/upasika). Over centuries, and in
      many lands, Buddhist monks and nuns have acted as 'good friends' to the
      laity in a variety of ways, starting with being good examples and thus
      fruitful 'field of merit.' The main traditional role of Buddhist monks is
      to give sermons and to teach to the laity on Buddhist teachings and
      meditation. However, in terms of responsibility over Buddhism it falls
      over all the Fourfold Order.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">As I have discussed above, youth as a
      changing force of the society. Such change is not only limited within the
      laity but also to the Sangha, the Order. Looking at Buddhist history, it
      is clear that most radical changes took place by the initiation taken by
      youth monks. For obvious examples in Nepal, they were Nepalese monks in
      their youth spirit who revived the Theravada Buddhism eight decades ago.
      Reading autobiographies of elder Buddhist monks of Nepal and struggled to
      establish the Theravada Buddhism. Although they were objected by the
      governmnert of the time they were succeeded in winning the hearts of laity
      and able to make a prosperous as we are witnessing at present. One of the
      hidden truths behind their success over such radical and daring
      transformation and change of the Theravada Buddhism in Nepal is their
      youth spirit and youth force. For examples, the late Ven. Pragyananda,
      Ven. Mahapragya, Ven. Amritananda, etc. on male side and Ven. Dhammawati
      and others on female side all were quite young when they begun to revive
      Buddhism in Nepal. They took a bold and daring decision to join the
      religious group against their families' will which was possible because of
      their youth blood. Similarly, an introduction of practicing meditation
      among laity was first introduced by youth monks of the time. Not only they
      themselves were youth they were also able to attract many new laity youth
      to join the Order and become a devout Buddhist and became pillars of the
      Therevada Buddhism in Nepal.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, in dawn of this new millennium,
      it can be heard that there is an increasing apathy among youth, a part of
      the Fourfold Order, that they are running away from religion and more
      inclined towards materialism, culture of consumerism rather than
      spiritualism. We can always hear youth complain about visiting to a
      monastery for religious purpose as an outmoded act and it is a culture of
      the old people of other excuses like the youth Sigala of the Buddha's
      time. Listening to these critiques it sounds like Buddhism is outmoded
      amongst youth of today and Buddhist institutions need some transformations
      in its application of teachings in a way that youth can accept it and
      involve in it. I discuss below on the roles of both youth monks and youth
      laity on reinterpretation and application of Buddhism among youth of
      today.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000080"><b>Role of youth in
      Socially Engaged Buddhism for the new millennium</b></font> [4]</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Religious traditions are not static. they
      respond to social, economic, and political change; indeed, they help shape
      such change. for Buddhists and practitioners of the other world faiths, it
      is no longer possible to measure t he quality of human life primarily in
      terms of an individual's observance of traditional rites, such a prayer or
      temple ritual. Now there are widespread forces at work, many of them
      humanly created, that separate the world into sectors of relative safety
      and comfort, and much larger, regions of poverty, oppression and war. Even
      within the borders of &quot;the West,&quot; as the comfort zone is called,
      the number of citizens who face poverty, marginalization, and the denial
      of hula rights continues to increase.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">To encounter with modern social problems
      the socially engaged Buddhism [5] --&nbsp; the application of the Buddhist
      teachings, to the resolution of social problems --has emerged in the
      global context of conversation on economy, development, technology, human
      rights, distributive justice, ecology and social progress. These
      reinterpretation and application of an ancient path to solve modern
      problems are getting very efficient, success and popular among Buddhist
      societies. Moreover, these innovations and changes were in hands of youth
      as they are the one who is encountering with the consequence of so called
      development. It is their future that needs reshaping. It is their future
      that needs balancing between material and spiritual development. In modern
      Buddhist societies there are a strong urge and feeling among both Buddhist
      leaders and practitioners that religion should not be limited only within
      the wall of a temple, a monastery or in books but rather socially engaged
      as Buddha himself engaged at his time. Buddha's teachings are not only
      relevant to monks but equally to householders and youth. the Buddhist
      teachings are not only aiming for the final liberation of Nibbana but also
      for happiness and peace of this very life. There are numbers of teachings
      aiming directly for the happiness and prosperity of a householder that can
      apply modern economy, development and technology. In modern societies, the
      roles of monks and laity have changed. For monks despite being a religious
      leader who promotes spiritual development now there is a constant need for
      changes in their traditional values. Similarly, laity needs to engage
      himself not only in donation and ritual performances but engage himself
      with the application of Dhamma in his everyday life. This changing and
      improvising of the roles of the Fourfold Order are most efficient when it
      is done by the youth of the society because they are the one who can make
      and break the traditions.</font></p>
      <p><b><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">The Changing Role of
      Youth Monks</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is into such a world that socially
      engaged Buddhism began to make its appearance in the last century. A major
      aspect of the changing place of the monks and laity in Theravada countries
      has been the active leadership role taken by men and women in the
      formation of various movements and associations devoted to education,
      public welfare, social service, and political activism.<br>
      In one of the Majjhimanikaya of Pali scripture provides relevant
      background information about the place and role of the Buddhist monk in
      the society of the Buddha's time. The Buddha's blessed disciple Ananda had
      a dialogue with a military general. The general expresses his appreciation
      for the presence of the sangha; Ananda, in turn, thanks the general for
      his protection, which enables monks to pursue their practice in a peaceful
      society. The picture that emerges from this selection of canonical
      references is that the practice of Buddhism depends on peaceful,
      prosperous social conditions. The monk's involvement in politics was on
      the personal level, advising individual rulers to promote more enlightened
      policies. In short, the Theravada scriptures provide us with a picture of
      he monks actively involved in the social, economic, and political life of
      its day, not merely an institution pursuing narrowly construed religious
      ends.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">From modern histories of Buddhist
      countries, it is certainly the case that youth monks are engaging in a
      range of activities previously seen as being outside the realm of
      legitimate monastic activity. They provided leadership in the independence
      movements in Myanmar and Sri Lanka in the early twentieth century.
      Vietnamese monks protested against the corrupt Diem regime in the late
      1960s through dramatic acts of elf-immolation. In the mid-1970s Thai monks
      became active on both political left and the right. Theravada monks
      (mostly youth) in South and Southeast Asia are speaking out on a variety
      of contemporary social and economic issues, including the increasing gap
      between the rich and the poor in the developing world, the exploitation of
      women in the workplace and as prostitutes, the scourge of AIDS, and the
      destruction of the natural environment.<br>
      There are many examples in Buddhist countries (Thailand, Myanmar, and and
      Sri Lanka) where youth Buddhist monks have been and continue to
      participate in programs of rural and urban uplift and social welfare.
      Despite many monks working closely for economic uplift, community
      development, ecological preservation and social welfare there are also
      numbers of Buddhist monks in their youth who are trying to deal with the
      most dangerous and crucial social problems of today i.e. drug addict and
      AIDS. In Thailand, there is a world-renowned Buddhist monastery where a
      treatment for drug addicts are given by applying Buddhist teachings,
      disciplines together with herbal remedies. Similarly, there is a Buddhist
      monastery where monks give refuge to AIDS patients bay taking care of them
      and teaching them to cope with it with the help of Buddhist teaching and
      meditation together with modern medicine and heal remedies. This might be
      a coincident that these changes of roles initiated by monks were all in
      their youth.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here, I would like to present with an
      example of a youth monk who has successfully socially engaged in applying
      the Buddhist teachings to youth prisons in Great Britain as how one can
      re-channel the role of youth in today's need. He is a British monk Van.
      Khemadhammo, the founder and spiritual director of 'ANGULIMALA,' the
      Buddhist Prison Chaplaincy Organization founded in February 1985. He was a
      youth of 27 years old when he took drastic change from an actor to a peace
      loving Buddhist monk in Thailand in 1971. In pursuit of the story of the
      Angulimala in Buddhism where the Buddha compassionately changed the
      murderer Angulimala to be a successful Buddhist monk Ven. Khemadhammo
      initiated to preach Buddhist teachings and meditation to prisoners in
      different prisons of Great Britain from 1977.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Writing about its establishment, Ven.
      Khemmadhamma writes, &quot;The story of Angulimala teaches us that the
      possibility of Enlightenment may be awakened in the most extreme of
      circumstances, that people can and do change and that people are best
      influenced by persuasion. The Buddha explained his teaching in its
      simplest and most universal form as, 'Give up what is unwholesome and
      wrong, cultivate what is skillful and good and purify your mind-this is
      the Teaching of all the Buddhas.' It reminds us that behind the exoticism
      and intellectualization, the need for practical application lies at the
      core of everything the Buddha said.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The story on how the youth Ven.
      Khemmadhammo, a monk of meditation came about to apply the Dhamma to
      prisoners in UK is an inspirational story for all youth in itself. He
      changed the role of a temple from waiting for people to come to the
      temple, for prisoners he took the temple to them in prison. This is an
      example of how a role of youth can bring a big change in society. He
      recalls:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">When I decided to respond to those
        original requests back in 1977, I had to consider what I had to offer
        people locked up in prison. I, after all, had never been incarcerated, I
        had never been in a prison, I didn't know where they were and I wasn't
        even sure I had ever seen one. When I sat down to think about it I
        realised that I had also spent quite a lot of my time shut away in small
        spaces and I too had had to face myself in that solitude. There were
        differences of course. I had made that forest monastic seclusion my
        choice and as I sat and faced myself I had had at my disposal an armoury
        of meditation techniques as well as the guidance, the example, the
        wisdom and the support of those who taught me. I had also been
        purposefully seeking to understand my life. There were differences but
        there were similarities. I too had been uncomfortable and it was my
        sense of unease that had led me to look beyond the then narrow confines
        that restricted me for answers. Yes, I realised, I did understand
        something about imprisonment. And after all, aren't we all imprisoned by
        our greed and aversion, by our ignorance, and our prejudices and
        attachments. And it was my belief then, as it is now, that while I have
        yet to pass through the gate that is Liberation, Buddhist techniques
        equip me with the means to do so. Thinking along these lines, I decided
        that I did have something to offer those in prison.</font></p>

      <p><b><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">The Changing Role of
      Youth Laity</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">As a part of the Fourfold Order in
      Buddhism it is not only monk who actively played role in disseminating,
      reinterpreting and applying Buddhist teachings to solve today's problems.
      Equally there are laity who have played such significant roles. These
      stories not only tell us the role of youth for the new millennium but
      those activities can inspire youth of today . The contributions and roles
      played by the traditional Buddhist youth groups and modern applications of
      Buddhist youth groups in many Buddhist societies are praiseworthy. They
      are also models for youth of today to take further steps and take equal
      share in Buddhism. Each story of Buddhist youth group tells us not only
      the traditional roles of youth in propagating Buddhism but succeeded in
      re-channelling the efficient Buddhist youth force for political awareness
      and social uplifts.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">At a time when all the national races were
      engaged in armed resistance against the imperialist British, religious
      associations were established in major cities in Myanmar beginning in
      1897. In 1906 Young Men's Buddhist Association (YMBA) was formed in
      Yangon. Perhaps this is the first of its kind for Buddhist communities.
      Though it was a Buddhist association, it took part in political movement,
      organizational matters and struggle to set the nation free from the
      British rule. It also protested the British imperialists' scheme to
      prolong the enslavement. Fighting against the British imperialists changed
      from armed struggle to political tactics.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Eighth Conference of YMBA was held in
      Pyay in 1920. At that time, national spirit was aroused in the whole
      country. Branches of YMBA and kits members were increasing day after day.
      Naticnalist farmers in rural areas, merchants and brokers in urban areas,
      teachers, lawyers and small industrialists began to support YMBA. Members
      of the Sangha also supported it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Likewise, in 1919, Young Men's Buddhist
      Association was established in Colombo. the YMBA in Sri Lanka played
      another role in establishing Buddhist educational centers throughout the
      island of Sri Lanka from the beginning of twenty-seven schools in 1919 to
      more than 3,000 by 1966. Later this kind of organizations playing
      significant roles in disseminating, promoting and applying Buddhist
      teachings for social benefit among youth are developed and established in
      every country where the Buddhist population exist. This kind of groups
      were also emerged among youth in universities.<br>
      Moreover, the role of Buddhist youth has widespread into different fields
      of society. The famous examples are the founding of the Sarvodaya
      Shramadana movement of volunteer work-camps in Sri Lanka in the late
      1985s, which applied traditional Buddhist principles to the alleviation of
      rural poverty; and the founding of the School of Youth for Social Service
      and the Tiep Hien Order (Order of Interbeing) by the Vietnamese Buddhist
      monk Thich Nhat Hanh and nun Chan Khong, who responded to the ravages of
      the war in their country by organizing volunteers in the rebuilding of
      bombed villages, starting farmers' cooperatives, establishing clinics,and
      lobbying in the West for an end to the war.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The most radical and renown example of
      socially engaged Buddhism of he twentieth century is the Sarvodaya
      Shramadana, a rural self-help program. It has developed the most ambitious
      volunteer service organization and work projects in over 10,000 villages.
      the projects have included agriculture, village infrastructure, health,
      pre-school education, and women's health and welfare. To date the
      Sarvodaya movement has involved over 800,000 volunteers in its programs.
      Its founder, A. T. Ariyaratne when he was a youth, claims that his efforts
      are inspired by the Buddha's teaching to strive for awakening. For
      Ariyaratne the primary meaning of sarvodaya is liberation, first form
      &quot;the defilements within one's own mind... and secondly, form unjust
      and immoral socio-economic chains.&quot; Ariyaratne grounds awakening or
      liberation in individual transformation, but expands the concept to a
      universal utopian vision that moves form individual to village, and form
      community to nation and finally encompass the world.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The philosophy of Sarvodaya is grounded in
      basic Theravada teachings: the three characteristics of existence
      (impermanence, suffering, not-self), the mutually interdependent and
      coarising nature of reality, the Nobel Eightfold Path encompassing morel
      virtue, meditation, and wisdom, the mental perfections of loving-kindness,
      compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity, and the moral precepts
      (Sila). However, Ariyaratne extrapolates classical Buddhist teachings as
      practical action guides to meet current needs. The Four Noble Truths are
      given social correlates: (1) there is an unproductive village; (2) there
      is a cause for this lack of productivity; (3) there is a hope that the
      village can renewed; and (4) there is a way to the renewal of all. In
      short, Ariyaratne's view of Buddhism is consistent with the modern,
      reformist tendency to interpret the tradition in pragmatic, ethical terms
      suitable for youth of today and future.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Nepalese perspective, there are several
      examples of Buddhist youth groups (Young Men's Buddhist Association
      (YMBA), Buddhist Youth Group (BYG), etc.) continue playing significant
      roles in disseminating the Buddhist teachings. Whereas the YMBA of
      Nepalese chapter is popular for their traditional role of propagating
      Buddhism by organising public talks, arranging pilgraimge, printing
      magazines, social services, etc. The BYG, in addition, have played
      significant role to be a instrumental for the awareness of
      religio-politics in Nepal by organizing peace demonstration, initiate
      Buddhist awareness among different ethnic groups of Nepal, etc. Similar
      Buddhist youth groups have emerged in major regional centers (e.g.
      Pokhara, Dharan) and district centres (e.g. Butwal, Palpa, Bhaktaput).</font></p>
      <p><b><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">Youth: The vital link</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">While Buddhism has begun to gain a firm
      foothold in the West, its fate in its traditional Buddhist homelands has
      been moving, sadly, in the opposite direction, towards atrophy and
      decline. Even among many Buddhists countries where majority of population
      profess Buddhism, the Buddhist teachings no longer occupy the same
      sovereign place in people's hearts that it held in the last millennium.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Among the changes taking place in current
      patterns of thinking, perhaps the most detrimental to Buddhist teachings
      has been the rise to prominence of a materialistic world view and
      consumerism. Often a curious ambivalence prevails in our minds, where with
      one part of the mind we profess our confidence in the lofty principles of
      the Buddhist teachings, while with the other we think the achievement of
      worldly success were the true mark of the accomplished individual.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The rapid spread of the materialistic
      world view has in turn brought about a far-ranging secularization of
      values that invades every nook and cranny of our lives. this
      transformation of values gives precedence to goals and attitudes
      diametrically opposed to those advocated by the Buddhist teachings, and
      under its impact the scales have tipped far away even from a reasonable
      balance between material and spiritual goods. Now we see acquisitiveness
      replacing contentment as the reigning ideal, competition taking the place
      of cooperation, fast efficiency the place of compassionate concern, and
      selfish indulgence the place of abstinence and self-control.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The attempt to live simultaneously by two
      conflicting sets of principles-- those being ushered in by secular
      materialism and those grounded in the Buddhist teachings--generates a
      tension that contains within it a seed of very destructive potential.
      Often the tension is only dimly felt by those in the older generation, who
      accept the new out look and values without clearly perceiving the
      challenge they pose to traditional Buddhist ideals. It is when the
      contradiction is pushed down to the next generation, to the Buddhist youth
      of today, that inherent incompatibility of the next generation, to the
      Buddhist youth of today, that the inherent incompatibility of the two
      perspectives comes into the open as a clear-cut choice between two
      alternative philosophies of life--one proposing a hierarchy of values
      which culminates in the spiritual and sanctions restraint and
      renunciation, the other holding up the indulgence and gratification of
      personal desire as the highest conceivable goal. Since the later appeals
      to strong and deep- seated human drives, it is hardly puzzling that so
      many young people today have turned away from the guidance of he Buddhist
      teachings to pursue the new paths to instant pleasure opened up by the
      consumer society or, in their frustration at missed opportunities, to take
      to the path of violence.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since it is the youth that forms the vital
      link in the continuity of Buddhism and society, connecting its past with
      its future, it is of paramount importance that the Buddhist youth of today
      should retain their fidelity to the Buddhist teachings. The Buddhist
      teachings should be for them not merely a symbol of cultural and ethnic
      identity, not merely focus point of sentimental piety, but above all a
      path to be taken to heart, personally applied, and adhered to in those
      critical choices between present expediency and long-range spiritual gain.
      The problem, however, is precisely how to inspire the young to look to the
      Buddhist teachings as their guide and infallible refuge.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">It must be stressed that our present
      dilemma goes far deeper than a breakdown of moral standards, and thus that
      it cannot be easily rectified by pious preaching and moral exhortation. If
      conduct deviating from the Buddhist teachings has become widespread among
      today's youth this is because the Buddhist vision has ceased to be
      meaningful to them, and it has ceased to be meaningful not because it has
      lost its relevance but because it is not being presented in ways which
      highlight its timeless and ever-immediate relevance.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The most urgent task facing those
      concerned with the preservation of Buddhism must be the attempt to
      communicate to the young the central vision at the heart of the Buddhist
      teachings, the vision from which all the specific doctrines and practices
      of Buddhism issue forth. This does not require a mastery of the technical
      details of the Buddhist teachings, but it does require that we ourselves
      understand the Dhamma's essence and are actively striving to make that
      understanding the foundation of out lives. Both by precept and example we
      must show that true freedom is to be found not in uncontrolled license,
      but in the control and mastery of desire; that true happiness lies not in
      a proliferation of goods, but in peace and contentment; that our relations
      with others are most rewarding when they are governed not by conflict and
      competition, but by kindness and compassion, and that true security is to
      be achieved not by the acquisition of wealth and power, but by the
      conquest of self with all its ambitions and conceits.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">As religious leaders, what role should
      they now play? Should the religious institution remain a conservative and
      abhorring change, or should it revert to a socially engaged religious
      institution for to achieve their ideals. A conference such as this would
      be a very good platform discussion of this crucial question. Can the
      religious force effect a creative tension between imagination and
      tradition, between innovation and the status quo?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">What we have to consider now is how to
      review, refine and strengthen the role of youth in the creation of a new
      and different world. This may mean institutional changes; making it
      possible for youth to assume greater responsibility earlier in life. We
      must recognise and encourage thoughtful young people to build more
      networks or relationships nationally, inter-regionally, inter-regionally
      and internationally. The problems of youth are our problems, and we must
      think of them in terms of the totality of our communities and our
      societies.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lumbini is recognised by the world as the
      fountain of peace and Buddha himself as apostle of peace who dedicated his
      life to promote peace and happiness to mankind. Lumbini echoes the essence
      of the Buddha's message to this world. However, we should not forget that
      Lumbini also represents the Buddha's youth. It is in the areas of Lumbini
      and Kapilavatthu where the Buddha spent his 29 years of his youth as
      Prince Siddhattha. He gained, prepared and developed his mind for his
      enlightenment from the social conditions he lived during his youth in this
      very land. With the right view and right channelling of youth force Prince
      Siddhattha succeeded in Becoming the Buddha, the apostle of world peace.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">In addition to Lumbini being the fountain
      of peace we should also consider to develop it as the international youth
      centre for disseminating the message of peace and happiness. Drawing
      inspirations from the Buddha youth we could develop Lumbini as the
      training centre of peace related activities for international youth. We
      could develop this very Lumbini as the centre for promoting and
      strengthening among the younger generations observance and practice of the
      teachings of the Buddha; inclucating piety towards the Triple Gem,
      parents, and elders; securing unity, solidarity and brotherhood among
      Buddhist youth; organizing and carrying an activities in the field of
      social, economic, educational, recreational, cultural, ecological and
      religious and other humanitarian services; working for securing peace and
      harmony among youth, etc. This will not only fit with the historical
      significance of Lumbini but it will also serve the global community for
      present and future needs.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha said, &quot;Youth are
      foundations of all human being.&quot; What better place can Lumbini be
      than the center for youth, the foundations of all human being?</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman">[1] Bhikkhu Sugandha (Anil Sakya),
      Assistant Secretary to His Holiness Somdet Phra Nyanasamvara, the Supreme
      Patriarch of Thailand, graduated MPhil from Cambridge University and Ph.
      D. in social anthropology from Brunel University, United Kingdom.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">[2] I would like to thank O. P Gauchan, L.
      D. Bajracharya, G. Chitrakar, Prof. T. C. Majupuria, Dr. D. N. Gellner and
      Dr. K. M. Shakya for helpful comments on the process of writing this
      paper. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">[3] Socio-biologists usually divide human
      life into the following stages viz. infancy, babyhood, childhood,
      adolescence and adulthood. For purpose of this paper, the term 'youth'
      here refers to marginal men who stand somewhere between childhood and
      adulthood going through a period of apprenticeship to assume adult roles.
      Between childhood and adulthood, there stretches a longish period in a
      person's life. In many socio-religious context youth age generally ranges
      from age 14 to 40 although socio-biologically youth age is ranged from 12
      to 21. In this paper I imply the former sense of youth, i.e. the
      socio-religious context. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">[4] Thich Nhat Hanh first introduced the
      term &quot;engaged Buddhism&quot; in the 1960s. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">[5] When people ask me, as they quite
      often do, What is an engaged Buddhist? I feel awkward. The phrase seems to
      imply that there are, can be, disengaged Buddhists. That is not something
      I feel it is polite, or politic, to admit. This becomes clearer if we use
      the Dalai Lama's alternative expression, &quot;Universal
      responsibility.&quot; Would it sound okay to say, &quot;We are the
      responsible Buddhists, they are the irresponsible ones&quot;?</font></p>
