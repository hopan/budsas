    <p>Once the Buddha told his monks the following story
    (Satipatthana Samyutta, No. 19): </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>There was once a pair of jugglers who performed their
        acrobatic feats on a bamboo pole. One day the master said
        to his apprentice: &quot;Now get on my shoulders and
        climb up the bamboo pole.&quot; When the apprentice had
        done so, the master said: &quot;Now protect me well and I
        shall protect you! By protecting and watching each other
        in that way, we shall be able to show our skill, make a
        good profit and safely get down from the bamboo
        pole.&quot; But the apprentice said: &quot;Not so,
        master! You, O master, should protect yourself, and I too
        shall protect myself. Thus self-protected and
        self-guarded we shall safely do our feats.&quot; </p>
        <p>This is the right way,&quot; said the Blessed One and
        spoke further as follows: </p>
        <p>&quot;It is just as the apprentice said: 'I shall
        protect myself'--in that way the foundations of
        mindfulness (satipatthana) should be practiced. 'I shall
        protect others'--in that way the foundations of
        mindfulness should be practiced. Protecting oneself, one
        protects others; protecting others, one protects oneself.
        </p>
        <p>&quot;And how does one, in protecting oneself, protect
        others? By the repeated and frequent practice of
        meditation <i>(asevanaya bhavanaya bahulikammena).</i> </p>
        <p>&quot;And how does one, in protecting others, protect
        oneself? By patience and forbearance, by a non-violent
        and harmless life, by loving kindness and
        compassion.&quot; </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This sutta belongs to the considerable number of important
    and eminently practical teachings of the Buddha which are
    still hidden like buried treasure, unknown and unused. Yet
    this text has an important message for us, and the fact that
    it is stamped with the royal seal of satipatthana gives it an
    additional claim to our attention. </p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Individual and Society</b></font></p>
    <p>The sutta deals with the relations between ourselves and
    our fellow beings, between individual and society. It sums up
    in a succinct way the Buddhist attitude to the problems of
    individual and social ethics, of egoism and altruism. The
    gist of it is contained in those two concise sentences: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;Protecting oneself, one protects others.&quot; <i>(Attanam
        rakkhanto param rakkhati.)</i> <br>
        &quot;Protecting others, one protects oneself.&quot; <i>(Param
        rakkhanto attanam rakkhati.)</i> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>These two sentences are supplementary and should not be
    taken or quoted separately. Nowadays, when social service is
    so greatly stressed, people may be tempted to support their
    ideas by quoting only the second sentence. But any such
    one-sided quotation would misrepresent the Buddha's
    standpoint. It has to be remembered that in our story the
    Buddha expressly approved the words of the apprentice, that
    one has first to watch carefully one's own steps if one
    wishes to protect others from harm. He who himself is sunk in
    the mud cannot help others out of it. In that sense,
    self-protection forms the indispensable basis for the
    protection and help given to others. But self-protection is
    not selfish protection. It is self-control, ethical and
    spiritual self-development. </p>
    <p>There are some great truths which are so comprehensive and
    profound that they seem to have an ever-expanding range of
    significance that grows with one's own range of understanding
    and practicing them. Such truths are applicable on various
    levels of understanding, and are valid in various contexts of
    our life. After reaching the first or second level, one will
    be surprised that again and again new vistas open themselves
    to our understanding, illumined by that same truth. This also
    holds for the great twin truths of our text which we shall
    consider now in some detail. </p>
    <p>&quot;Protecting oneself, one protects others&quot;--the
    truth of this statement begins at a very simple and practical
    level. This first material level of the truth is so
    self-evident that we need say no more than a few words about
    it. It is obvious that the protection of our own health will
    go far in protecting the health of others in our environment,
    especially where contagious diseases are concerned. Caution
    and circumspection in all our doings and movements will
    protect others from the harm that may come to them through
    our carelessness and negligence. By careful driving,
    abstention from alcohol, self-restraint in situations that
    might lead to violence--in all these and many other ways we
    shall protect others by protecting ourselves. </p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>The Ethical Level</b></font></p>
    <p>We come now to the ethical level of that truth. Moral
    self-protection will safeguard others, individuals and
    society, against our own unrestrained passions and selfish
    impulses. If we permit the &quot;three roots&quot; of
    evil--greed, hate and delusion--to take a firm hold in our
    hearts, then their outgrowths will spread far and wide like a
    jungle creeper, suffocating much healthy and noble growth all
    around. But if we protect ourselves against these three
    roots, our fellow beings too will be safe. They will be safe
    from our reckless greed for possessions and power, from our
    unrestrained lust and sensuality, from our envy and jealousy;
    safe from the disruptive consequences of our hate and enmity
    which may be destructive or even murderous; safe from the
    outbursts of our anger and from the resulting atmosphere of
    antagonism and conflict which may make life unbearable for
    them. </p>
    <p>The harmful effects our greed and hate have upon others
    are not limited to the times when they become passive objects
    or victims of our hate, or when their possessions become the
    object of our greed. Both greed and hate have an infectious
    power which vastly multiplies their evil effects. If we
    ourselves think of nothing else than to crave and to grasp,
    to acquire and possess, to hold and to cling, then we may
    rouse or strengthen these possessive instincts in others. Our
    bad conduct may become the standard of behavior for those
    around us--for our children, our friends, our colleagues. Our
    own conduct may induce others to join us in the common
    satisfaction of rapacious desires; or we may arouse in them
    feelings of resentment and competitiveness. If we are full of
    sensuality, we may also kindle the fire of lust in them. Our
    own hate may provoke them to hate and vengeance. We may also
    ally ourselves with others or instigate them to common acts
    of hate and enmity. Greed and hate are, indeed, like
    contagious diseases. If we protect ourselves against these
    evil infections, we shall to some extent at least also
    protect others. </p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Protection through Wisdom</b></font></p>
    <p>As to the third root of evil, delusion or ignorance we
    know very well how much harm may be done to others through
    the stupidity, thoughtlessness, prejudices, illusions and
    delusions of a single person. </p>
    <p>Without wisdom and knowledge, attempts to protect oneself
    and others will usually fail. One will see the danger only
    when it is too late, one will not make provision for the
    future; one will not know the right and effective means of
    protection and help. Therefore, self-protection through
    wisdom and knowledge is of the greatest importance. By
    acquiring true wisdom and knowledge, we shall protect others
    from the harmful consequences of our own ignorance,
    prejudices, infectious fanaticism and delusions. History
    shows us that great and destructive mass delusions have often
    been kindled by a single individual or a small number of
    people. Self-protection through wisdom and knowledge will
    protect others from the pernicious effect of such influences.
    </p>
    <p>We have briefly indicated how our own private life may
    have a strong impact on the lives of others. If we leave
    unresolved the actual or potential sources of social evil
    within ourselves, our external social activity will be either
    futile or markedly incomplete. Therefore, if we are moved by
    a spirit of social responsibility, we must not shirk the hard
    task of moral and spiritual self-development. Preoccupation
    with social activities must not be made an excuse or escape
    from the first duty, to tidy up one's own house first. </p>
    <p>On the other hand, he who earnestly devotes himself to
    moral self-improvement and spiritual self-development will be
    a strong and active force for good in the world, even if he
    does not engage in any external social service. His silent
    example alone will give help and encouragement to many, by
    showing that the ideals of a selfless and harmless life can
    actually be lived and are not only topics of sermons. </p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>The Meditative Level</b></font></p>
    <p>We proceed now to the next higher level in the
    interpretation of our text. It is expressed in the following
    words of the sutta: &quot;And how does one, by protecting
    oneself, protect others? By the repeated and frequent
    practice of meditation.&quot; Moral self-protection will lack
    stability as long as it remains a rigid discipline enforced
    after a struggle of motives and against conflicting habits of
    thought and behavior. Passionate desires and egotistic
    tendencies may grow in intensity if one tries to silence them
    by sheer force of will. Even if one temporarily succeeds in
    suppressing passionate or egotistic impulses, the unresolved
    inner conflict will impede one's moral and spiritual progress
    and warp one's character. Furthermore, inner disharmony
    caused by an enforced suppression of impulses will seek an
    outlet in external behavior. It may make the individual
    irritable, resentful, domineering and aggressive towards
    others. Thus harm may come to oneself as well as to others by
    a wrong method of self-protection. Only when moral
    self-protection has become a <i>spontaneous</i> function,
    when it comes as naturally as the protective closing of the
    eyelid against dust--only then will our moral stature provide
    real protection and safety for ourselves and others. This
    naturalness of moral conduct does not come to us as a gift
    from heaven. It has to be acquired by repeated practice and
    cultivation. Therefore our sutta says that it is by repeated
    practice that self-protection becomes strong enough to
    protect others too. </p>
    <p>But if that repeated practice of the good takes place only
    on the practical, emotional and intellectual levels, its
    roots will not be firm and deep enough. Such repeated
    practice must also extend to the level of meditative
    cultivation. By meditation, the practical, emotional and
    intellectual motives of moral and spiritual self-protection
    will become our personal property which cannot easily be lost
    again. Therefore our sutta speaks here of bhavana, the
    meditative development of the mind in its widest sense. This
    is the highest form of protection which our world can bestow.
    He who has developed his mind by meditation lives in peace
    with himself and the world. From him no harm or violence will
    issue. The peace and purity which he radiates will have an
    inspiring, uplifting power and will be a blessing to the
    world. He will be a positive factor in society, even if he
    lives in seclusion and silence. When understanding for, and
    recognition of, the social value of a meditative life ceases
    in a nation, it will be one of the first symptoms of
    spiritual deterioration.</p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Protection of Others</b></font></p>
    <p>We have now to consider the second part of the Buddha's
    utterance, a necessary complement to the first:
    &quot;Protecting others one protects oneself. And how? By
    patience and forbearance, by a non-violent and harmless life,
    by loving-kindness and compassion (khantiya avihimsaya
    mettataya anuddayataya).&quot; </p>
    <p>He whose relation to his fellow-beings is governed by
    these principles will protect himself better than he could
    with physical strength or with any mighty weapon. He who is
    patient and forbearing will avoid conflicts and quarrels, and
    will make friends of those for whom he has shown a patient
    understanding. He who does not resort to force or coercion
    will, under normal conditions, rarely become an object of
    violence himself as he provokes no violence from others. And
    if he should encounter violence, he will bring it to an early
    end as he will not perpetuate hostility through vengeance. He
    who has love and compassion for all beings, and is free of
    enmity, will conquer the ill-will of others and disarm the
    violent and brutal. A compassionate heart is the refuge of
    the whole world. </p>
    <p>We shall now better understand how those two complementary
    sentences of our text harmonize. Self-protection is the
    indispensable basis. But true self-protection is possible
    only if it does not conflict with the protection of others;
    for one who seeks self-protection at the expense of others
    will defile as well as endanger himself. On the other hand,
    protection of others must not conflict with the four
    principles of patience, non-violence, loving-kindness and
    compassion; it also must not interfere with their free
    spiritual development as it does in the case of various
    totalitarian doctrines. Thus in the Buddhist conception of
    self-protection all selfishness is excluded, and in the
    protection of others violence and interference have no place.
    </p>
    <p>Self-protection and protection of others correspond to the
    great twin virtues of Buddhism, wisdom and compassion. Right
    self-protection is the expression of wisdom, right protection
    of others the expression of compassion. Wisdom and
    compassion, being the primary elements of Bodhi or
    Enlightenment, have found their highest perfection in the
    Fully Enlightened One, the Buddha. The insistence on their
    harmonious development is a characteristic feature of the
    entire Dhamma. We meet them in the four sublime states
    (brahmavihara), where equanimity corresponds to wisdom and
    self-protection, while loving-kindness, compassion and
    sympathetic joy correspond to compassion and the protection
    of others. </p>
    <p>These two great principles of self-protection and
    protection of others are of equal importance to both
    individual and social ethics and bring the ends of both into
    harmony. Their beneficial impact, however, does not stop at
    the ethical level, but leads the individual upwards to the
    highest realization of the Dhamma, while at the same time
    providing a firm foundation for the welfare of society. </p>
    <p>It is the writer's belief that the understanding of those
    two great principles of self-protection and protection of
    others, as manifesting the twin virtues of wisdom and
    compassion, is of vital importance to Buddhist education, for
    young and old alike. They are the cornerstones of character
    building and deserve a central place in the present world
    wide endeavour for a Buddhist revival. </p>
    <p>&quot;I shall protect others&quot;--thus should we
    establish our mindfulness, and guided by it devote ourselves
    to the practice of meditation, for the sake of our own
    liberation. </p>
    <p>&quot;I shall protect others&quot;--thus should we
    establish our mindfulness, and guided by it regulate our
    conduct by patience, harmlessness, loving-kindness and
    compassion, for the welfare and happiness of many. </p>
