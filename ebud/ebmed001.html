<P>
The rainy season retreat has begun.  It is a time for offering robes to
monks and for making special efforts toward gaining a better
understanding of Buddhist values.  In Burma, we look upon members of the
sangha (the Buddhist religious order) as teachers who will lead us along
the noble eightfold path.  Good teachers not merely give scholarly
sermons, they show us how we should conduct our daily lives in
accordance with right understanding, right thought, right speech, right
action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness and right
concentration.<P>


Not long ago before my house arrest in 1989, I was granted an audience
with the venerable U Pandita, an exceptional teacher in the best
tradition of great spiritual mentors whose words act constantly as an
aid to a better existence.  U Pandita, the hole teacher, spoke of the
importance of right speech.  Not only should one speak only the truth,
one's speech should lead to harmony among beings, it should be kind and
pleasant and it should be beneficial.  One should follow the example of
the Lord Buddha who only spoke words that were trustful and beneficial,
even if at times such speech was not always pleasing to the listener.<P>


The holy teacher also urged me to cultivate mindfulness.  Of the five
spiritual faculties (ie, faith, energy, concentration, wisdom, and
mindfulness), it is only mindfulness that can never be in excess.
Excessive faith without sufficient wisdom leads to blind faith, while
excessive wisdom without sufficient energy leads to undesirable cunning.
Too much energy combined with weak concentration leads to indolence.
But as for mindfulness, it is in excess, but always in deficiency.  The
truth and value of this Buddhist concept that holy teacher U Pandita
took such pains to impress on me became evident during my years of house
arrest.  Like many of my Buddhist colleagues, I decided to put my time
under detention to good use by practicing meditation.  It was not an
easy process.  I did not have a teacher and my early attempts were more
than a little frustrating.  There were days when I found my failure to
discipline my mind in accordance with prescribed meditation practices so
infuriating I felt I was doing myself more harm than good.  I think I
would have given up but for the advice of a famous Buddhist teacher,
that whether or not one wanted to practice meditation, one should do so
for one's own good.<P>


So, I gritted my teeth and kept at it, often rather glumly.  Then my
husband gave me a copy of Sayadaw U Pandita's book, "In this Very Life,
the Liberation Teachings of the Buddha."<P>


By studying this book carefully, I learned how to overcome difficulties
of meditation and to realize its benefits.  I learned how practicing
meditation led to increased mindfulness in every day life and again and
again.  I recalled the holy teacher's words on the importance of
mindfulness with appreciation and gratitude.<P>


In my political work, I have been helped and strengthened by the
teachings of members of the sangha.  During my very first campaign trip
across Burma, I received invaluable advice from monks in different parts
of the country.  I Prome, a holy teacher told me to keep in mind the
hermit Sumedha, who sacrificed the possibility of early liberation for
himself alone and underwent many lives of striving that he might save
others from suffering.  So must you be prepared to strive for as long as
might be necessary to achieve good and justice, exhorted the holy
teacher.<P>


In a monastery at Pakokku, the advice that an abbot gave to my father
when he went to that town more than 40 years ago was repeated to me: "Do
not be frightened every time there is an attempt to frighten you, but do
not be entirely without fear.  Do not become elated every time you are
praised, but do not be entirely lacking in elation."<P>


In other words, while maintaining courage and humility, one should not
abandon caution and healthy self-respect.<P>


When I visited Natmauk, my father's home town, I went to the monastery
where he studied as a boy.<P>


There the abbot gave a sermon on the four causes of decline and decay:
failure to recover that which had been lost; omission to repair that
which had been damaged; disregard of the need for reasonable economy;
and the elevation to leadership of those without morality and learning.
The abbot went on to explain how these traditional Buddhist views should
be interpreted to help us build a just and prosperous society in the
modern age.<P>


Of the words of wisdom I gathered during that journey across central
Burma, those of a 91-year-old holy teacher of Sagaing are particularly
memorable.  He sketched out for me how it would be to work for democracy
in Burma.<P>


"You will be attacked and reviled for engaging in honest politics,"
pronounced the teacher, "But you must persevere.  Lay down an investment
in suffering and you will gain bliss."<P>
