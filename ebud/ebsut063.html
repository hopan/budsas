      <FONT SIZE="6">T</FONT>he Dialogues of the Buddha, constituting, in the 
      Pàli text, the Digha and Majjhima Nikàyas, contain a full exposition of 
      what the early Buddhists considered the teaching of the Buddha to have 
      been. Incidentally they contain a large number of references to the 
      social, political, and religious condition of India at the time when they 
      were put together. We do not know for certain what that time exactly was. 
      But every day is adding to the number of facts on which an approximate 
      estimate of the date may be based. And the ascertained facts are already 
      sufficient to give us a fair working hypothesis. </FONT></SPAN>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-GB"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the first place the 
      numerous details and comparative tables given in the Introduction to my 
      translation of the Milinda show without a doubt that practically the whole 
      of the Pàli Pitakas were known, and regarded as final authority, at the 
      time and place when that work was composed. The geographical details given 
      on pp. xliii, xliv tend to show that the work was composed in the extreme 
      North-West of India. There are two Chinese works, translations of Indian 
      books taken to China from the North of India, which contain, in different 
      recessions, the introduction and the opening chapters of the Milinda<A TITLE NAME="_ftnref1" HREF="#_ftn1"></A><![IF !supportFootnotes]><A TITLE NAME="_ftnref1" HREF="#_ftn1">[1]<![ENDIF]></A> 
      For the reasons adduced <I>(loco citato) </I>it is evident that the work 
      must have been composed at or about the time of the Christian era. Whether 
      (as M. Sylvain Levy thinks) it is an enlarged work built up on the 
      foundation of the Indian original of the Chinese books; or whether (as I 
      am inclined to think) that original is derived from our Milinda, there is 
      still one conclusion that must be drawn-the Nikàyas, nearly if not quite 
      as we now have them in the Pàli, were <I>known at a very early date in the 
      North of India.</I></FONT></SPAN> </P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-GB"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Then again, the Kathà 
      Vatthu (according to the views prevalent, at the end of the fourth century 
      A. D., at Kàñcipura in South India, and at Anuràdhapura in Ceylon; and 
      recorded, therefore, in their commentaries, by Dhammapàla and Buddhaghosa) 
      was composed, in the form in which we now have it, by Tissa, the son of 
      Moggali, in the middle of the third century B. C., at the court of Asoka, 
      at Pàtaliputta, the modern Patna, in the North of India.</FONT></SPAN> </P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-GB"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is a recognised rule 
      of evidence in the courts of law that, if an entry be found in the books 
      kept by a man in the ordinary course of his trade, which entry speaks <I>
      against </I>himself, then that entry is especially worthy of credence. Now 
      at the time when they made this entry about Tissa&#39;s authorship of the 
      Kathà Vatthu the commentators believed, and it was an accepted tenet of 
      those among whom they mixed -- just as it was, <I>mutatis mutandis, </I>
      among the theologians in Europe, at the corresponding date in the history 
      of <I>their </I>faith -- that the whole of the canon was the word of the 
      Buddha. They also held that it had been actually recited, at the Council 
      of Ràjagaha, immediately after his decease. It is, I venture to submit, 
      absolutely impossible, under these circumstances, that the commentators 
      can have invented this information about Tissa and the Kathà Vatthu. They 
      found it in the records on which their works are based. They dared not 
      alter it. The best they could do was to try to explain. it away. And this 
      they did by a story, evidently legendary, attributing the first scheming 
      out of the book to the Buddha. But they felt compelled to hand on, as they 
      found it, the record of Tissa&#39;s authorship. And this deserves, on the 
      ground that it is evidence against themselves, to have great weight 
      attached to it.</FONT></SPAN> </P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-GB"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The text of the Kathà 
      Vatthu now lies before us in a scholarly edition, prepared for the Pàli 
      Text Society by Mr. Arnold C. Taylor. It purports to be a refutation by 
      Tissa of 250 erroneous opinions held by Buddhists belonging to schools of 
      thought different from his own. We have, from other sources, a 
      considerable number of data as regards the different schools of thought 
      among Buddhists -- often erroneously called &quot;the Eighteen Sects&quot;
      <A TITLE NAME="_ftnref2" HREF="#_ftn2"></A><![IF !supportFootnotes]>
      <A TITLE NAME="_ftnref2" HREF="#_ftn2">[2]</A>. We are beginning to know 
      something about the historical development of Buddhism, and to be familiar 
      with what sort of questions are likely to have arisen. We are beginning to 
      know something of the growth of the language, of the different Pàli 
      styles. In all these respects the Kathà Vatthu fits in with what we should 
      expect as possible, and probable, in the time of Asoka, and in the North 
      of India.</FONT></SPAN> </P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-GB"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Now the discussions as 
      carried on in the Kathà Vatthu are for the most part, and on both sides, 
      an appeal to authority. And to what authority? Without any exception as 
      yet discovered, to the Pitakas, and as we now have them, in Pàli. Thus on 
      p. 339 the appeal is to the passage translated below, on p. 278,? 6 ; and 
      it is quite evident that the quotation is from our Suttanta, and not from 
      any other passage where the same words might occur, as the very name of 
      the Suttanta, the Kevaddha (with a difference of reading found also in our 
      MSS.), is given. The following are other instances of quotations: </FONT>

      quotations from the older Pitaka books in the Kathà Vatthu, about three or 
      four times as many as are contained in this list. But this is enough to 
      show that, <I>at the time when the Kathà Vatthu was composed, all the Five 
      Nikàyas were extant; and were considered to be final authorities in any

      and Dr. Hultsch have called attention<A TITLE NAME="_ftnref3" HREF="#_ftn3">[3]</A> 
      to the fact that in inscriptions of the third century B.C we find, as 
      descriptions of donors to the dàgabas, the expressions &quot;dhammakathika, 
      petaki, suttantika, suttantakini, and pañca-nekà-yika&quot;. The Dhamma, the 
      Pitakas, the Suttantas, and the five Nikàyas must have existed for some 
      time before the brethren and sisters could be described as preachers of 
      the Dhamma, as reciters of the Pitaka, and as guardians of the Suttantas 
      or of the Nikàyas (which were not yet written, and were only kept alive in 
      the memory of living men and women).</FONT></SPAN> </P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-GB"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Simple as they seem, 
      the exact force of these technical designations is not, as yet, 
      determined. Dr. K. Neumann thinks that Petaki does not mean &#39;knowing the 
      Pitakas,&#39; but &#39;knowing the Pitaka,&#39; that is, the Nikàyas -- a single 
      Pitaka, in the sense of the Dhamma, having been known before the 
      expression &#39;the Pitakas&#39; came into use<A TITLE NAME="_ftnref4" HREF="#_ftn4">[4]</A>. 
      As he points out, the title of the old work Petakopadesa, which is an 
      exposition, not of the three Pitakas, but only of the Nikàyas, supports 
      his view. So again the Dialogues are the only parts or passages of the 
      canonical books called, in our MSS., &quot;suttantas&quot;. Was then a suttantika 
      one who knew precisely the Dialogues by heart? This was no doubt the 
      earliest use of the term. But it should be recollected that the Kathà 
      Vatthu, of about the same date, uses the word suttanta also for passages 
      from other parts of the scriptures.</FONT></SPAN> </P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-GB"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">However this may be, 
      the terms <I>are conclusive proof of the existence, some considerable time 
      before the date of the inscriptions, of a Buddhist literature called

      Five Nikàyas.</I></FONT></SPAN> </P>

      regarded certain, for the reasons I have set out elsewhere<A TITLE NAME="_ftnref5" HREF="#_ftn5">[5]</A>. 
      No. 2 also occurs in the tenth book of the Anguttara. It is clear that in 
      Asoka&#39;s time there was acknowledged to be an authoritative literature, 
      probably a collection of books, containing what was then believed to be 
      the words of the Buddha: and that it comprised passages already known by 
      the titles given in his Edict. Five out of the seven having been found in 
      the published portions of what we now call the Pitakas, and in the portion 
      of them called the Five Nikàyas, raises the presumption that when the now 
      unpublished portions are printed the other two will also, probably, be 
      identified. We have no evidence that any other Buddhist literature was in 
      existence at that date.</FONT></SPAN> </P>

      more important is the point to which M. Senart<A TITLE NAME="_ftnref6" HREF="#_ftn6">[6]</A> 
      has called attention, and supported by numerous details: - the very clear 
      analogy between the general tone and the principal points of the moral 
      teaching, on the one hand of the Asoka edicts as a whole, and on the other 
      of the Dhammapada, an anthology of edifying verses taken, in great part, 
      from the Five Nikàyas, The particular verses selected by M. Senart, as 
      being especially characteristic of Asoka&#39;s ideas, include extracts from 
      each of the Five.</FONT></SPAN> </P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-GB"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Fifthly, the four great 
      Nikàyas contain a number of stock passages, which are constantly 
      recurring, and in which some ethical state is set out or described. Many 
      of these are also found in the prose passages of the various books 
      collected together in the Fifth, the Khuddaka Nikàya. A number of them are 
      found in each of the thirteen Suttantas translated in this volume. There 
      is great probability that such passages already existed, as ethical 
      sayings or teachings, not only before the Nikàyas were put together, but 
      even before the Suttantas were put together.</FONT></SPAN> </P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-GB"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There are also entire 
      episodes, containing not only ethical teaching, but names of persons and 
      places and accounts, of events, which are found, in identical terms, at 
      two or more places. These should be distinguished from the last. But they 
      are also probably older than our existing texts. Most of the parallel 
      passages, found in both Pàli and Sanskrit Buddhist texts, come under one 
      or other of these two divisions.</FONT></SPAN> </P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-GB"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Sixthly, the Samyutta 
      Nikàya (III, 13) quotes one Suttanta in the Dialogues by name; and both 
      the Samyutta and the Anguttara Nikàyas quote, by name and chapter, certain 
      poems now found only in a particular chapter of the Sutta Nipàta. <I>This 
      Suttanta, and these poems, must therefore be older, and older in their 
      present arrangement, than the final settlement of, the text of these two 
      Nikàyas.</I></FONT></SPAN> </P>

      the Dialogues purport to relate conversations that took place between 
      people, contemporaries with the Buddha, but <I>after the Buddha&#39;s death.
      </I>One Sutta in the Anguttara is based on the death of the wife of Munda, 
      king of Magadha, who began to reign about forty years after the death of 
      the Buddha. There is no reason at all to suspect an interpolation. It 
      follows that, not only the Sutta itself, but th<I>e date of the

      lived two hundred years after the Buddha. It follows that this poem, and 
      also the Peta Vatthu in which it is found, and also the Vimàna Vatthu, 
      with which the Peta Vatthu really forms one whole work, are later than the 
      date of Pingalaka. And there is no reason to believe that the 
      commentator&#39;s date, although it is evidently only a round number, is very 
      far wrong. These books are evidently, from their contents, the very latest

      . And the catalogues in which the names occur give us a considerable 
      amount of detailed information as to their contents. No one of them is a 
      translation, or even a recession, of any one of the twenty-seven canonical 
      books. They are independent works; and seem to bear. to the canonical 
      books a relation similar, in many respects, to that borne by the works of 
      the Christian Fathers to the Bible. But though they do not reproduce any 
      complete texts, they contain numerous verses, some whole poems, numerous 
      sentences in prose, and some complete episodes, found in the Pàli books. 
      And about half a dozen instances have been already found in which such 
      passages are stated, or inferred, to be from older texts, and are quoted 
      as authorities. Most fortunately we may hope, owing to the enlightened 
      liberality of the Academy of St. Petersburg, and the zeal and scholarship 
      of Professor d&#39;Oldenbourg and his co-workers, to have a considerable 
      number of Buddhist Sanskrit Texts in the near future. And this is just

      construct, in accordance with these facts, a working hypothesis as to the 
      history of the literature. It is also possible to object that the evidence 
      drawn from the Milinda may be disregarded on the ground that there is 
      nothing to show that that work, excepting only the elaborate and stately 
      introduction and a few of the opening chapters, is not an impudent 
      forgery, and a late one, concocted by some Buddhist in Ceylon. So the 
      evidence drawn from the Kathà Vatthu may be disregarded on the ground that 
      there is nothing to show that that work is not an impudent forgery, and a 
      late one, concocted by some Buddhist in Ceylon. The evidence drawn from 
      the inscriptions may be put aside on the ground that they do not 
      explicitly state that the Suttantas and Nikàyas to which they refer, and 
      the passages they mention, are the same as those we now have. And the fact 
      that the commentators point out, as peculiar, that certain passages are 
      nearly as late, and one whole book quite as late, as Asoka, is no proof 
      that the rest are older. It may even be maintained that the Pàli Pitakas 
      are not therefore Indian books at all: that they are all Ceylon forgeries,

      (according to the education current at the time), speaking constantly to 
      men of similar education, he followed the literary habit of his time by 
      embodying his doctrines in set phrases, satras, on which he enlarged on 
      different occasions in different ways. In the absence of books-for though 
      writing was widely known, the lack of writing materials made any lengthy 
      written books impossible<A TITLE NAME="_ftnref11" HREF="#_ftn11">[11]</A> 
      such satras were the recognised form of preserving and communicating

      these sayings were collected together by his disciples into the Four Great

      afterwards. Other sayings and verses, most of them ascribed not to the 
      Buddha himself, but to the disciples, were put into a supplementary 
      Nikàya. We know of slight additions made to this Nikàya as late as the 
      time of Asoka. And the developed doctrine found in certain short books in 
      it -- notably in the Buddhavamsa and Cariyà Pitaka, and in the Peta- and

      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-GB"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">For a generation or two 
      the books as originally put together were handed down by memory. And they 
      were doubtless accompanied from the first, as they, were being taught, by 
      a running commentary. About 100 years after the Buddha&#39;s death there was a 
      schism in the community. Each of the two schools kept an arrangement of 
      the canon -- still in Pàli (or possibly some allied dialect). Sanskrit was 
      not used for any Buddhist works till long afterwards, and never used at 
      all, so far as we know, for the canonical books. Each of these two schools 
      broke up, in the following centuries, into others; and several of them had 
      their different arrangements of the canonical books, differing also no 
      doubt in minor details. Even as late as the first century after the 
      Christian Era, at the Council of Kanishka, these books, among many others 
      then extant, remained the only authorities<A TITLE NAME="_ftnref12" HREF="#_ftn12">[12]</A>. 
      But they all, except only our present Pàli Nikàyas, have been lost in 
      India. Of the stock passages of ethical statement, and of early episodes, 
      used in the composition of them, and of the Suttas now extant, numerous 
      fragments have been preserved in the Hinayàna Sanskrit texts. And some of 
      the Suttas, and of&#39; the separate books, as used in other schools, are 
      represented in Chinese translations of the fourth and fifth centuries A.D. 
      A careful and detailed comparison of these remains with the Pàli Nikàyas, 
      after the method adopted in Windisch&#39;s &quot;Màra und Buddha&quot;, cannot fail to 
      throw much light on the history, and on the method of composition, of the 
      canonical books, which in style and method, in language and contents and 
      tone, bear all the marks of so considerable an antiquity.</FONT></SPAN>
      </P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-GB"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Hofrath Dr. Buhler, in 
      the last work he published, expressed the opinion that these books, as we 
      have them in the Pàli, are good evidence, certainty for the fifth, 
      probably for the sixth, century B.C. Subject to what has been said above, 
      that will probably become, more and more, the accepted opinion. And it is 
      this which gives to all they tell us, either directly or by implication, 
      of the social, political, and religious life of India, so great a value<A TITLE NAME="_ftnref13" HREF="#_ftn13">[13]</A>.</FONT></SPAN>
      </P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-GB"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is necessary, in 
      spite of the limitations of our space, to add a few words on the method 
      followed in this version. We talk of Pàli <I>books. </I>They are not books 
      in the modern sense. They are memorial sentences intended to be learnt by 
      heart ; and the whole style, and method of arrangement, is entirely 
      subordinated to this primary necessity. The leading ideas in any one of 
      our Suttantas, for instance, are expressed in short phrases not intended 
      to convey to a European reader the argument underlying them. These are 
      often repeated with slight variations. But neither the repetitions nor the 
      variations-introduced, and necessarily introduced, as aids to memory-help 
      the modern reader very much. That of course was not their object. For the 
      object they were intended to serve they are singularly well chosen, and 
      aptly introduced.</FONT></SPAN> </P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-GB"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Other expedients were 
      adopted with a similar aim. Ideas were formulated, not in logically 
      co-ordinated sentences, but in numbered groups; and lists were drawn up 
      such as those found in the tract called the Silas, and in the passer on 
      the rejected forms of asceticism, both translated be-low. These groups and 
      lists, again, must have been accompanied from the first by a running 
      verbal commentary, given, in his own words, by the teacher to his pupils. 
      Without such a comment they are often quite unintelligible, and always 
      difficult.</FONT></SPAN> </P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-GB"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The inclusion of such
      <I>memoria technica </I>makes the Four Nikàyas strikingly different from 
      modern treatises on ethics or psychology. As they stand they were never 
      intended to be read. And a version in English, repeating all the 
      repetitions, rendering each item in the lists and groups as they stand, by 
      a single English word, without commentary, would quite fail to convey the 
      meaning, often intrinsically interesting, always historically valuable, of 
      these curious old documents.</FONT></SPAN> </P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-GB"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is no doubt partly 
      the result of the burden of <I>such memoria technica, </I>but partly also 
      owing to the methods of exposition then current in North India, that the 
      leading <I>theses </I>of each Suttanta are not worked out in the way in 
      which we should expect to find similar theses worked out now in Europe. A 
      proposition or two or three, are put forward, re-stated with slight 
      additions or variations, and placed as it were in contrast with the 
      contrary proposition (often at first put forward by the interlocutor). 
      There the matter is usually left. There is no elaborate logical argument. 
      The choice is offered to the hearer; and, of course, he usually accepts 
      the proposition as maintained by the Buddha. The statement of this is 
      often so curt, enigmatic, and even -- owing not seldom simply to our 
      ignorance, as yet, of the exact force of the technical terms used -- so 
      ambiguous, that a knowledge of the state of opinion on the particular 
      point, in North India, at the time, or a comparison of other Nikàya 
      passages on the subject, is necessary to remove the uncertainty.</FONT></SPAN>
      </P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-GB"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It would seem therefore 
      most desirable that a scholar attempting to render these Suttantas into a 
      European language -- evolved in the process of expressing a very 
      different, and often contradictory, set of conceptions -- should give the 
      reasons of the faith that is in him. He should state <I>why </I>he holds 
      such and such an expression to be the least inappropriate rendering: and 
      quote parallel passages from other Nikàya texts in support of his reasons. 
      He should explain the real significance of the thesis put forward by a 
      statement of what, in his opinion, was the point of view from which it was 
      put forward, the stage of opinion into which it fits, the current views it 
      supports or controverts. In regard to technical terms, for which there can 
      be no exact equivalent, he should give the Pàli. And in regard to the 
      mnemonic lists and groups, each word in which is usually a <I>crux, he </I>
      should give cross-references, and wherever he ventures to differ from the 
      Buddhist explanations, as handed down in the schools, should state the 
      fact, and give his reasons. It is only by such discussions that we can 
      hope to make. progress in the interpretation of the history of Buddhist 
      and Indian thought. Bare versions are of no use to scholars, and even to 
      the general reader they can only convey loose, inadequate, and inaccurate 
      ideas.</FONT></SPAN> </P>
      <P><SPAN LANG="EN-GB"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">These considerations 
      will, I trust, meet with the approval of my fellow workers. Each scholar 
      would of course, in considering the limitations of his space, make a 
      different choice as to the points he regarded most pressing to dwell upon 
      in his commentary, as to the points he would leave to explain themselves. 
      It may, I am afraid, be considered that my choice in these respects has 
      not been happy, and especially that too many words or phrases have been 
      left without comment, where reasons were necessary. But I have, 
      endeavoured, in the notes and introductions, to emphasise those points on 
      which further elucidation is desirable; and to raise some of the most 
      important of those historical questions which will have to be settled 
      before these Suttantas can finally be considered as having been rightly 
      understood.</FONT></SPAN> </P>
