        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is the third, further revised 
        version of the original Sangha Guide on Buddhism and Sex published by 
        the English Sangha Trust, Dhammpadipa, London NW3. The greater part of 
        it also appeared in the journal Sangha. As one of the older generation, 
        I have felt very conscious of my temerity in trying to write something 
        on this subject which younger people might be willing to read. In this 
        connection, I am very grateful to Alan and Jacqui James for giving me 
        the benefit of their criticism, a task for which they are doubly 
        qualified, being both wise in the Dhamma and at the same time much 
        closer in age to the younger generation who may read this. But the 
        opinions expressed here are, of course, my own. -- <I><B>M.O&#39;C. Walshe,

      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Buddhism and Sex</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is an age in which sexual matters are 
      discussed with great openness. There are many who are puzzled to know what 
      the Buddhist attitude towards sex is, and it is therefore to be hoped that 
      the following guidelines may be found helpful towards an understanding. It 
      is, of course, true to say that Buddhism, in keeping with the principle of 
      the Middle Way, would advocate neither extreme puritanism nor extreme 
      permissiveness, but this, as a guiding principle without further 
      specification, may not seem sufficiently helpful for most people.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the first place, we must distinguish 
      between the rules undertaken by Buddhist monks for their own conduct, and 
      any guiding principles for lay people.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Bhikkhu</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A bhikkhu, or fully-ordained monk in the 
      Theravada tradition, has taken upon himself a set of 227 rules of conduct. 
      The aim of all of these is to enable him to conduct himself in such a way 
      as is most conducive to the attaining of Enlightenment. The rules are 
      voluntarily undertaken, and if a monk feels unable to live up to them, he 
      is free to leave the Order, which is considered much more honorable than 
      hypocritically remaining in the robe while knowingly infringing the rule. 
      There are four basic rules, infringement of which is termed <I>Parajika
      </I>or &quot;Defeat,&quot; and involves irrevocable expulsion from the Order. The 
      only one we are concerned with here is the first, which deals with sexual 
      intercourse.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Complete sexual continence is considered 
      an essential feature of the monastic life. Intercourse of a heterosexual 
      or homosexual character is automatically a Parajika offense. A monk who 
      performs such an act is considered to have expelled himself from the 
      Order, and is no longer in communion with the other monks. Any acts of a 
      sexually unbecoming nature falling short of intercourse result in 
      suspension and require expiation. <I>Samaneras,</I> or novice monks, who 
      break their training in this respect are disrobed.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The same principle applies to the Mahayana 
      schools and of course, to nuns in those schools where they exist. There is 
      no such thing as a &quot;married monk,&quot; though in certain schools, especially 
      in Japan, a form of &quot;quasi-monasticism&quot; with married teachers who retain a 
      form of ordination is permitted under certain conditions. But all this has 
      no relevance to the Theravada Sangha.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Ancient India</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Before turning to our main theme, it is as 
      well to have some idea of the sexual mores of ancient India in the 
      Buddha&#39;s time. Gotama himself, as a prince, was brought up surrounded by 
      concubines and dancing-girls as a matter of course. Polygamy was common. 
      Ambapali, the courtesan from whom the Buddha accepted gifts, was a person 
      of some consequence. It was not expected that young men would lead a life 
      of much restraint, and the Buddha with his profound understanding of human 
      nature knew well what demands to make of people in this respect. Thus we 
      find the following formulation of what a man should avoid:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">He avoids unlawful sexual intercourse, 
      abstains from it. He has no intercourse with girls who are still under the 
      protection of father or mother, brother, sister, or relative; nor with 
      married women, nor female convicts; nor lastly with betrothed girls.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If a man could observe greater restraint 
      than this, so much the better. The Buddha&#39;s outlook on this question was, 
      then, realistic for his age, and we should endeavor to view the subject as 
      realistically as possible in the light of modern conditions.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Lay Buddhist</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The third of the Five Precepts undertaken 
      by lay Buddhists runs: <I>Kamesu micchacara veramani sikkhapadam 
      samadiyami</I>, &quot;I undertake the course of training in refraining from 
      wrong-doing in respect of sensuality.&quot; Some lay people who, usually for a 
      specified period, undertake more than the usual five precepts, take this 
      one in the stricter form: <I>Abrahmacariya veramani...</I>, which commits 
      them, for the duration of the undertaking, to observe the same restraint 
      as the monks. With these, too, we are not further concerned, as their 
      position is now obvious.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">For the average lay person, the Third 
      Precept is on exactly the same footing as the other four. There is, in the 
      Buddhist view, nothing uniquely wicked about sexual offenses or failings. 
      Those inclined to develop a guilt-complex about their sex-life should 
      realize that failure in this respect is neither more, nor, on the other 
      hand, less serious than failure to live up to any other precept. In point 
      of fact, the most difficult precept of all for nearly everybody to live up 
      to is the fourth -- to refrain from all forms of wrong speech (which often 
      includes uncharitable comments on other people&#39;s real or alleged sexual 
      failings!).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What precisely, then, does the Third 
      Precept imply for the ordinary lay Buddhist? Firstly, in common with all 
      the other precepts, it is a rule of training. It is not a &quot;commandment&quot; 
      from God, the Buddha, or anyone else saying: &quot;Thou shalt not...&quot; There are 
      no such commandments in Buddhism. It is an undertaking by you to yourself, 
      to do your best to observe a certain type of restraint, because you 
      understand that it is a good thing to do. This must be clearly understood. 
      If you don&#39;t think it is a good thing to do, you should not undertake it. 
      If you do think it is a good thing to do, but doubt your ability to keep 
      it, you should do your best, and probably, you can get some help and 
      instruction to make it easier. If you feel it is a good thing to attempt 
      to tread the Buddhist path, you may undertake this and the other precepts, 
      with sincerity, in this spirit.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Secondly, what is the scope and purpose of 
      this precept? The word <I>kama </I>means in Pali &quot;sensual desire,&quot; which 
      is not exclusively sexual. It is here used in a plural form which comes 
      close to what is meant by the Biblical expression &quot;the lusts of the 
      flesh.&quot; Greed for food and other sensual pleasure is also included. Most 
      people who are strongly addicted to sexual indulgence are also much drawn 
      to other sense-pleasures. Though we are here only concerned with the 
      sexual aspect, this point should be noted. For those with any grasp at all 
      of Buddhist principles, the basic reason for such an injunction should be 
      immediately obvious. Our <I>dukkha</I> -- our feeling, of frustration and 
      dissatisfaction with life -- is rooted in our desires and cravings. The 
      more these can be brought under control, the less dukkha we shall 
      experience. It is as simple as that. But of course, that which is simple 
      is not necessarily easy.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Thus while there is, so to speak, a 
      considerable overlap in the content of the Third Precept with the Jewish 
      and Christian commandment, &quot;Thou shalt not commit adultery,&quot; there is a 
      big difference in the spirit and approach. Since most people in the West 
      have some Christian conditioning -- even if only indirectly -- it is as 
      well to be clear about this. The traditional Christian view is that sexual 
      intercourse is permissible solely within the marriage-bond. Even then the 
      implication is that, except as a necessary means for the procreation of 
      children, it is really rather a bad thing, and should be restricted as far 
      as possible -- hence the debate about &quot;the pill&quot; and the like. Certain 
      things such as contraception, homosexual activity, and so on are often 
      looked on with horror and declared &quot;unnatural&quot; (which cannot be entirely 
      correct since, after all, they <I>happen</I>!). Some of these prohibitions 
      may today be more honored in the breach than the observance, but there is 
      no doubt that rigid views of this sort are still widely held and 
      officially propagated. The inevitable reaction, encouraged by some real or 
      alleged psychological experts, is towards an attitude of total 
      permissiveness, in which &quot;anything goes.&quot; As was said earlier, rigid 
      puritanism and total permissiveness are extreme views, to neither of which 
      the Buddhist teaching subscribes. The one is merely an inadequate reaction 
      against the other. What we have to do -- what Buddhism in fact teaches us 
      to do -- is to map out a sane course between the two.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Sexual Pleasure and the Concept of 
      &quot;Sin&quot;</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Reduced to essentials, the great debate 
      about sex revolves, for many people, around the concept of sin. To the 
      puritan, indulgence in sexual activity for the sake of pleasure is evil, 
      wicked, or, as he tends to say, &quot;sinful&quot; (i.e., displeasing to God). To 
      the permissivist (to coin an awkward but convenient term), this is 
      nonsense. He probably rejects the term &quot;sin&quot; as meaningless, and not only 
      sees nothing evil in sexual pleasure but regards it as, highly legitimate, 
      perhaps as the highest pleasure there is and certainly as something to 
      which, in principle at least, everybody has a right. Many people, coming 
      from a more or less Christian background with at least some puritanical 
      overtones, find the true Buddhist attitude to this problem rather 
      difficult to see. Perhaps they have never even been given a clear 
      explanation of it or, if they have, it may have seemed too technical for 
      them, and they have not grasped the point. The point, in fact, is of 
      considerable importance, so it is worthwhile attempting to make it clear. 
      It involves a proper elementary grasp of what is meant by <I>kamma</I> -- 
      something which many people, who may have been &quot;Buddhists&quot; for years, have 
      never had.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We may, however, perhaps begin more 
      profitably by considering the word &quot;sin.&quot; &quot;Sin&quot; to a Christian is 
      primarily thought of as a breach of God&#39;s commandments. This explanation 
      is of course not wrong in terms of Christian theology, but is not 
      applicable in Buddhism, where there are no such commandments that one can 
      infringe. As already indicated, the so-called precepts are in fact 
      undertakings to oneself, which is something different. They are more on a 
      par with the instruction &quot;Look both ways before you cross the road.&quot; Still 
      there is much agreement between the content of the Five Precepts and some 
      of the Ten Commandments, so it may be wise in many cases to behave 
      accordingly, whichever formulation one follows. However, there is another 
      rendering of the word sin itself which in fact (though less well-known) 
      comes much closer to the Buddhist view of things. In the Bible, &quot;sin&quot; 
      actually renders Hebrew and Greek words which literally mean &quot;missing the 
      mark,&quot; i.e., behaving inadequately or unskillfully. The sinner, then, is 
      like an unskillful archer who misses his aim (could this be the real 
      meaning of <I>Zen and the Art of Archery</I>?). But this comes, surely, 
      very close to the idea of <I>akusala kamma</I> or &quot;unskilled action&quot; in 
      Buddhism.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Pali word <I>kamma</I> (Sanskrit <I>
      karma</I>) literally means &quot;action&quot; (i.e., volition: <I>cetana</I>), which 
      can be either skilled (<I>kusala</I>) or unskilled (<I>akusala</I>). The 
      results of action (kamma) accrue to the doer as <I>vipaka,</I> which is 
      pleasant when the action was skilled, unpleasant when it was unskilled (if 
      I look before I cross the road, I shall get across safely, which is 
      pleasant; if I don&#39;t look I may get run down, which is unpleasant). The 
      feelings we experience are in fact of the nature of vipaka -- they are 
      dependent on past kamma. And of course we are continually creating fresh 
      kamma for a good part of our time. It should therefore be noted that the 
      feeling of pleasure (sexual or otherwise) is not an action, but a result. 
      There is, therefore, nothing either &quot;skillful&quot; or &quot;unskillful&quot; about 
      experiencing such a feeling. We should therefore not regard it as either 
      &quot;virtuous&quot; or &quot;sinful.&quot; So far, so good. Such pleasant feelings can be 
      enjoyed with a clear conscience and no guilt feeling. If this were all, 
      there would be no problem. The puritans would be routed and the 
      permissivists justified. Unfortunately, there is another side to the 
      matter. We may recall that a few years ago there was a song &quot;Money is the 
      Root of all Evil&quot; Some people pointed out that not money, but the love for 
      money is the root of all evil (well, of a lot of evil, anyway). And here 
      is the snag. Sexual pleasure (like money) is not &quot;evil&quot; (or unskilled), 
      but attachment to sexual pleasure (like the love of money) is. If we can 
      experience the pleasure without attachment we are all right; if we become 
      attached to it, we are not &quot;hitting the mark.&quot; Now of course it is rather 
      difficult (to put it mildly) to experience pleasure of any sort without 
      feeling attached to it. But attachment is kamma, and unskilled kamma at 
      that. And the results of that will inevitably, according to Buddhism, be 
      something unpleasant in the future.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Many people will find this explanation 
      novel. Some will find it puzzling. Some will undoubtedly reject it -- with 
      or without investigation -- with the excuse that it is overly subtle, or 
      arbitrary, or something of the sort. What they mean is, of course, that 
      they find it inconvenient. But it will repay a lot of consideration and 
      mindful investigation. Careful study, in fact, should show that it is the 
      key to the whole problem. The matter can also be considered in terms of 
      the law of Dependent Origination: &quot;Contact is the basis for the arising of 
      feeling; feeling... of craving; craving... of clinging;&quot; etc., the 
      ultimate outcome being of course the continued process of becoming, with 
      all the sufferings entailed.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Thus, if we wish to adjudicate between the 
      puritans and the permissivists, we cannot say that either side is entirely 
      right. We might, however, suggest that the puritans are partly right for 
      the wrong reasons. Sexual indulgence is not wicked, but it may be in some 
      degree inadvisable. Most people will not feel able to refrain altogether 
      (nor are they being urged to), but there is merit in moderation.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Marriage</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Setting aside all ideas derived from other 
      sources, other religions and philosophies of life, what is the Buddhist 
      attitude towards marriage? For many Buddhists, in the East or the West, 
      there is no great problem. They live a reasonably normal married life just 
      as do many Christians, humanists, and others. We may say they are lucky, 
      or enjoy the results of favorable kamma in this respect. For others, of 
      all creeds or none, serious problems arise and must be somehow faced.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the Christian tradition, marriage is 
      usually termed a &quot;sacrament.&quot; In some branches of Christianity it is 
      treated as an indissoluble bond, though usually there are a few loopholes. 
      Other branches of Christianity permit divorce in certain rather narrowly 
      defined circumstances, and of course in most (though by no means all) 
      countries the state permits divorce and the remarriage of divorced 
      persons, with or without the approval of the Church.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In Buddhism, marriage is not a 
      &quot;sacrament,&quot; as such a concept does not exist. And it is not any part of 
      the functions of Buddhist monks to join lay people together in holy 
      wedlock (or deadlock). If it is occasionally done today in Japan, this is 
      just a modern idea in conformity with a general tendency among Japanese 
      Buddhists to imitate (often perhaps unwisely) Christian institutions. In 
      the Buddhist tradition it is often the custom for bhikkhus to give their 
      &quot;blessing&quot; after the civil wedding-ceremony has been performed. But even 
      this is really more of a concession to the laity than anything else. And 
      if the marriage does not turn out a success, no bhikkhu has any authority 
      to say that that marriage shall not be dissolved. Divorce, like marriage, 
      is a civil affair. Likewise, if a married couple decide to practice 
      contraception, that is entirely their business. The Sangha will not feel 
      called upon to interfere or object. It must be admitted that certain 
      bhikkhus have been heard to declare that contraception is wrong and should 
      be banned -- but that is their private opinion. It is no part of the 
      Buddhist teaching.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Abortion is of course a different matter. 
      Since this involves the taking of life, it contravenes the First Precept. 
      It can only be condoned in cases of serious health hazards, where it may 
      represent the lesser evil.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In getting married, people obviously take 
      on a responsibility, both towards each other and towards whatever children 
      they have. Any form of irresponsible behavior is clearly reprehensible by 
      any reasonable standards, whether we call ourselves Buddhists or anything 
      else. If we bear in mind, and try to observe, all the five precepts, the 
      chances of a successful marriage are obviously increased. Excessive 
      drinking, for instance (in breach of the Fifth Precept), is a potent 
      source of unhappy marriages.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What, it may be asked, of &quot;adultery,&quot; 
      i.e., extra-marital sexual relations? The short answer is that, quite 
      obviously, this is something to be avoided. But the point should be made 
      that Buddhism does not regard this, or any other sexual irregularities and 
      deviations, as somehow uniquely wicked. In countries nominally Christian 
      the special kind of horror with which such things are, or recently were, 
      regarded can be pushed to grotesque extremes. Not many years ago a certain 
      politician was solemnly declared by some to be unfit to become Prime 
      Minister because he had been the innocent partner in a divorce case! More 
      recently still, another politician was hounded from office because of acts 
      of adultery of which his wife forgave him! Yet many politicians in all 
      countries have got away with far worse things of a non-sexual character 
      without a word being said. Buddhists should try to behave themselves 
      sexually, as in other respects, to the best of their ability -- but they 
      should learn to exercise the maximum of charity towards the lapses of 
      others. If a marriage has irretrievably broken down, even though it may 
      continue in name, the situation is of course quite different. In such 
      circumstances one may well feel that complete abstinence is a burden 
      greater than one can reasonably be expected to bear.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The things that can go wrong with a 
      marriage are legion. A partner can be impotent, ill, irresponsible, 
      jealous, drunken, a compulsive gambler, deranged, promiscuous, miserly, 
      unemployable, or several of these things. Or both partners can be 
      perfectly charming people and yet utterly unsuited to each other. It may 
      be that only the children -- poor wretches -- hold the &quot;marriage&quot; 
      together. At the same time, there may be many reasons which make a 
      dissolution impossible or impracticable. An extra-marital relationship in 
      such circumstances may serve to make the situation tolerable. Those who 
      find themselves in such a situation must make the best job of it they can. 
      It is not for others, more fortunate or more timid, to be excessively 
      censorious.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Sex Outside Marriage</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Here again, we should try to look at 
      things calmly and clearly, and, above all, responsibly. Nowadays there is 
      pretty frank acceptance of what has always been the case, that a lot of 
      people in fact have sexual intercourse without going through the formality 
      of getting married. No doubt there is more of it now than there used to be 
      because, for one thing, contraception is a lot more efficient than 
      formerly, and also because religious prejudices are fast breaking down. 
      This is a simple statement of fact, not of what ought or ought not to be 
      the case. In the case of engaged couples, it is probably by now the usual 
      thing, and is not very heavily frowned upon by most people. But it cannot 
      be termed exactly rare among couples who have not the slightest intention 
      of getting engaged.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the past, it was widely considered (and 
      almost openly admitted) that pre-marital sex was a good thing for young 
      men, but a bad thing for girls. Now sex-equality has caught up on this, as 
      on so many other things. In any case, we may as well accept the fact that, 
      whatever we may think about it, preaching by the older generation will, by 
      and large, have precious little effect on the young. This is probably one 
      thing most parents are worried about.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The young people of today are not, 
      usually, notably impressed by the wisdom of their elders. They may quite 
      often be perfectly right in this skepticism, but of course it does not 
      follow that they themselves are really any wiser. It may be that their 
      folly merely takes on a different form. Let us remember that basically, if 
      Buddhism teaches us anything at all, it is that almost all human beings 
      are pretty dim-witted, on the whole. That after all is why we are here at 
      all. But still, if those who are parents can succeed in inculcating a 
      sense of responsibility into their young, that in all probability is about 
      all they can do. There are no easy answers.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Queen Victoria reigned for sixty glorious 
      years, and even despite the pioneering efforts of her son and successor 
      Edward VII, it still took England a further sixty years (including two 
      major wars) to cast off the last shreds of Victorian respectability. Now 
      at last the deed has been done, and naked young men can stand on the stage 
      and utter naughty words without a Lord Chamberlain to say them nay. Is 
      this progress, or was Victorian prudery preferable to modern rudery? We 
      are back with the two extremes once again. We must seek the middle way.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Of course, if the young would only listen, 
      there is no doubt we older ones could give them all sorts of quite 
      genuinely good advice. And there is just one chance that they will listen: 
      if we can somehow avoid being patronizing. But the heavy father act is now 
      definitely out, and the establishment line cuts no ice. If we tell the 
      youth of today they stink (even though some of them do), they will simply 
      turn round and tell us our ideas stink.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">However, if we can succeed in getting 
      across to them at all, we may be able, humbly to suggest certain things 
      for their consideration. Sex is something the younger generation of today 
      are intensely aware of. In fact, they would have to be born blind and deaf 
      not to be. It is exploited commercially today in every conceivable way. 
      Our entire commercial civilization is founded on the principle of 
      stimulating bigger and better desires in all of us, all the time. And at a 
      conservative estimate, about 75% of all advertising at the present time 
      includes an element of sexual titillation (sometimes cunningly disguised, 
      at other times blatantly obvious). It has been found, quite clearly, that 
      sex stimulates the sales of anything and everything from typewriters to 
      weed-killers. That it is the mainstay of virtually every conceivable kind 
      of &quot;entertainment&quot; to which we are voluntarily or involuntarily subjected, 
      goes without saying. In other words, our desires in general, and our 
      sexual desires in particular, are being consistently and grossly 
      over-stimulated the whole time of set purpose, and the bland assumption is 
      that if it all suddenly stopped, the country&#39;s entire economy would be in 
      ruins. (Parenthetically, it might be quite feasible to organize our 
      economy on a different basis -- but that is not our concern here.) We all, 
      young and old, have to live with this situation and, to put it mildly, it 
      doesn&#39;t make self-restraint any easier. So before we start lecturing the 
      young, we should realize this fact. In this game, the dice are loaded 
      against us.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Still, we may manage to get through to 
      them. After all, many young people are themselves against the 
      establishment, and among other things they rebel against the sheer 
      tawdriness of our lives. Their ideas may quite frequently be all wrong, 
      and badly mixed up, but at least they sincerely yearn for something 
      better, and in fact they are desperately even if often incoherently trying 
      to bring about a better state of affairs. They are by no means lacking in 
      idealism, and they have a keen eye for those who seek to exploit their 
      idealism for dubious ends. We can latch on to them if we can only convince 
      them that we are at least sincere.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Let us just take a cold, hard look at this 
      question of premarital intercourse among the young. In the first place, it 
      happens. And there are just two ways, in principle, by which it can cease 
      to happen. Either young people can exercise self-restraint, or they can 
      get married. A few do the former, and quite a lot do the latter. Now of 
      course, very early marriages can turn out well. But the fact is that they 
      quite often don&#39;t for obvious reasons. It is therefore not an entirely 
      self-evident fact that early marriage, as such, is preferable to a little 
      &quot;experimentation.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is, of course, very hard for parents to 
      stand back and silently watch their own children embarking on a course 
      which may seem to them, and indeed may actually be unwise. Some young 
      people today are only prepared, and able, to learn by trial and error. 
      They are unwilling to ask for advice, or even to accept it if given 
      unasked. They should, however, be aware that there are serious dangers in 
      experimentation, if too rashly undertaken, and the trouble is that, while 
      parents may hold back with advice on restraint, there are others who are 
      only too ready (out of misguided &quot;idealism&quot; or, frequently, because they 
      find it highly profitable) to offer &quot;permissive&quot; advice without drawing 
      attention to the risks. It is the duty of somebody, whether parents or 
      teachers, to ensure that young people are aware of some of the less 
      comfortable &quot;facts of life&quot; as well as those they want to know about. 
      Venereal disease is rampant today, and on the increase. And it is by no 
      means always the &quot;minor inconvenience&quot; it is made out to be in some 
      quarters. It can still cause sterility, serious illness, or even death. 
      That &quot;the pill&quot; is not, and is not meant to be, any protection against 
      V.D. would seem obvious, but many girls seem unaware of this -- till it is 
      too late. Nor is &quot;the pill&quot; itself as harmless as all that. It can have 
      unpleasant and sometimes quite serious side-effects, and one recent 
      (probably conservative) estimate is that 25% of the women who use it ought 
      not to do so, on medical grounds. Even common sense might suggest that 
      prolonged chemical interference with hormone functioning could cause 
      trouble. These are just some of the more obvious physical dangers. There 
      are plenty of emotional problems and dangers, too. To take just one 
      example: genuine misunderstandings can arise because teen-age lads want, 
      and expect, to go &quot;all the way&quot; whereas often the girls only want to 
      flirt. This situation is by no means uncommon: at best it is embarrassing, 
      and at worst it can lead to very ugly incidents.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The way of self-restraint is not 
      necessarily an easy one for all to follow and, under present conditions 
      especially, it is almost more than we can reasonably expect. And it too 
      can be undertaken for the wrong reasons, and in the wrong way. The English 
      public school system was based on the segregation of the sexes and an 
      ideal of sexual restraint, and to a certain extent it worked. It produced 
      the predictable crop of homosexuals as well as quite a few inhibited young 
      men, but it inculcated a genuine respect for women, which was not always 
      quite as ludicrous as some would have us believe. On balance, it may have 
      done more good than harm, from the sexual point of view, to the majority 
      of those who were subjected to it. But it was based on an over-simplified 
      idea. Life is more subtle than Arnold of Rugby allowed for (even if we 
      overlook the &quot;class&quot; aspect of the whole thing). And yet, the best 
      products of this system of education are in many respects admirable. They 
      have a deep sense of self-discipline and responsibility, qualities in 
      rather short supply today.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Of course, many of the young people of 
      today actually have such a sense, quite strongly in some ways. They do 
      feel responsible -- they feel deeply &quot;committed&quot; -- about apartheid or 
      other social questions. And even the hairiest types quite often endure 
      surprising hardships in the way of sleeping rough and the like, with a 
      kind of self-discipline which may appear strangely ill-directed but is 
      nevertheless there.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Sex, Religion, and Anti-Religion</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The present age has been justly called the 
      Post-Christian Age. Traditional Christian teachings are crumbling 
      everywhere. It is not, perhaps, very difficult to find arguments in 
      support of the view that this is a good thing, or that it is a bad thing. 
      It largely depends on what we want to put in place of the dear departed. 
      But in any case, one can scarcely avoid feeling a pang of sympathy for the 
      Christians, especially perhaps the Christian clergy. Most Christian 
      ministers of all denominations are, after all, decent, upright, 
      hard-working and conscientious men who are desperately striving to do a 
      good job and at least save <I>something</I> worth-while from the wreckage. 
      They are usually desperately under-paid, they preach to their dwindling 
      flock to the best of their ability, and they are stuck with an impossible 
      situation. They may often be ignorant and sometimes bigoted, but they find 
      themselves mocked by those who are often enough equally ignorant and 
      bigoted, and whose sole aim is frequently to replace their creed, however 
      inadequate, by something ever more negative and destructive. If the 
      Church, even in its present enfeebled state, were to disappear totally 
      from the scene, the loss, despite all doctrinal inadequacies and 
      absurdities, would certainly be greater than any conceivable gain. It is 
      not quite true that any religion is better than no religion, for some 
      forms of religion (including some Christian sects) are unbelievably awful. 
      But the best, or even the second-best, of Christianity is assuredly a lot 
      better than most of the purely secular substitutes for it. This, as 
      Buddhists, we should be freely prepared to admit, without thereby in the 
      least falling into the trap of saying, &quot;Well, it&#39;s all the same thing 
      really,&quot; when it quite obviously isn&#39;t. The basic Christian attitude to 
      sex is well enough known, and has been briefly outlined above. It can 
      assume thoroughly unhealthy forms, but in its more moderate aspects it can 
      perhaps still serve as a fairly useful basis for decent behavior. At least 
      it does provide some reasons which a good many people can accept as a 
      basis for morality.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Now of course one can have morals without 
      religion. It is not too difficult to produce purely social reasons for a 
      lot of moral conduct, sexual or otherwise, and the best of the 
      anti-religious propagandists today are at pains to do this. But some 
      others do not. Their policy is simply to controvert anything and 
      everything the Churches teach and stand it on its head. Sensuality and 
      aggression, it is argued, are basic drives in man which it is dangerous to 
      dam up and which should, accordingly, be allowed free play. In the case of 
      aggression, the fallacy is so obvious that there are few who would 
      literally subscribe to this, though some societies in practice seem to 
      allow it plenty of scope. But in the case of sex, complete permissiveness 
      really is openly preached in some quarters, and in fact a Swedish doctor 
      has even announced that he wants to organize a corps of volunteers to 
      provide everybody with sexual intercourse. This would apparently make 
      everybody happy and the millennium would have arrived.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What Sex is Really All About</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The sexual drive is, in most 
      circumstances, just about the strongest urge there is in man and in the 
      other animals. This is so whether we think (with some) that it was 
      implanted in us by God or (with others) by the devil. It can be denied all 
      direct expression, quite obviously, and whether this is or is not a good 
      thing to do depends very much indeed on how -- and why -- this is done. 
      When we come to consider sex and religion, we find that in fact this is 
      often done, in the Buddhist Sangha and the Roman Catholic Church, to take 
      the two most obvious examples. The ostensible reasons for such a course in 
      these two bodies may be quite different, but it is surely not without 
      significance that they both -- and some others -- consider it important to 
      even attempt such a seemingly unnatural exercise. But there is no doubt 
      that a good deal of the enormous respect shown to members of both 
      communities stems directly from the knowledge of their celibate way or 
      life. In some parts or the world, indeed, such men are regarded as either 
      supermen or hypocrites, since no normal man could be expected to endure 
      such a life. And of course both communities do include quite a few 
      hypocrites and, probably, a few supermen.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">For the vast majority or people, of 
      course, there is no question of their attempting such a thing except 
      perhaps, for relatively short periods. The lady who once asked in a class, 
      &quot;If everybody became a bhikkhu, what would happen to the world?&quot; could 
      safely be told not to worry.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The biological function of sex is obvious 
      and requires no discussion here. But the interesting thing for us to note 
      is how sex -- like everything else -- is a purely impersonal force. We 
      tend to think of it in intensely personal terms, but in actual fact it is 
      a force that just flows through us and uses our most wonderful and 
      inspiring emotions for its own ends, which are totally concerned with the 
      continuance of the race as a whole. The idea that it is just a private and 
      wonderful thing between you and me is merely a part of our general 
      illusion. Altogether, it is a prolific breeder of illusions. It can lead a 
      man to think he has found the most wonderful woman in the whole world 
      while everybody else is thinking, &quot;What on earth can he possibly see in 
      her?&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">To the Buddhist, of course, sex is an 
      expression -- perhaps the chief expression -- of that <I>tanha </I>or 
      craving which brings dukkha in its train. It is therefore quite logical 
      that we should seek to bring it under control. In a sense, that is all 
      there is to the whole question. The aim of the true Buddhist is to bring 
      about the cessation of craving, and from the individual point of view 
      there is no other reason for sexual restraint than this. But from the 
      broader ethical point of view there are, of course, other reasons which 
      are no less important: if we behave recklessly and irresponsibly in sexual 
      matters, we can cause untold harm to others; we can trifle with other 
      people&#39;s emotions in a quite devilish way, bring unwanted children into 
      the world, and so on and so forth. But none of these things would, of 
      course, happen if we were able to control &quot;our own&quot; sexuality: &quot;our own&quot; 
      in quotes because it is, as we have to remember, an impersonal force 
      working through us, which is precisely why it is so difficult to control.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Total sexual control in the sense of 
      perfect abstinence is quite obviously only for the few. It is perhaps one 
      mistake of the Roman Catholic Church that it seeks to impose this 
      discipline on too many people and too absolutely, as some Catholics now 
      recognize. But in fact there will always be more than sufficient people 
      willing and even determined to keep the human race going. Society&#39;s 
      problem is rather to prevent the population explosion from getting 
      completely out of hand -- hence all the rather dreary arguments about &quot;the 
      pill.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Now there are various possible ways of 
      controlling the sex-urge, some bad, some good. One is through fear: fear 
      of hell fire, fear of venereal diseases, and so on. This is of course not 
      a particularly good way, though it can certainly work, and is perhaps not 
      always wholly harmful. After all, there can be various unfortunate 
      consequences of intercourse and we should be aware of them. Even rebirth 
      in some very unpleasant &quot;hell-state&quot; is not necessarily a complete 
      fantasy. But of course an exaggerated fear of dreadful penalties for minor 
      transgressions is not psychologically very helpful.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Another way is the way of repression. This 
      is of course not a conscious process. It is a form of successful self 
      deception, as a result of which we are not consciously aware of a thing. 
      Repression, as ought to be better known than in fact seems to be the case, 
      is by no means the same thing as voluntary &quot;suppression.&quot; Very few people 
      in actual fact have really &quot;transcended sex&quot; -- though quite a lot of 
      people seem to think they have. They never connect their resultant 
      psychological troubles with the root-cause -- repressed sex. But it should 
      be firmly stated that, if we can do it, suppression with awareness does 
      little or no harm.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A great deal of sexual energy can, of 
      course, be canalized or &quot;sublimated&quot; into other things: art, music, 
      intense religious faith, and so on. People -- especially but by no means 
      only women -- are well known in all religious groups who have done this 
      with more or less success. And those who have attained the meditative 
      absorptions known as the <I>jhanas</I> may find therein an emotional 
      outlet which is superior to that of sex. All this is fine, and very much 
      to the good. But even these things do not in themselves entirely solve the 
      problem, at least in the ultimate sense.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Sex and Rebirth</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As long as there remains even a latent 
      craving (including that for sex), according to the Buddhist teaching 
      rebirth will inevitably continue to take place. For we are reborn, not 
      merely because of the sexual drive which brought about the union of our 
      parents, but also because of that same sexual drive in &quot;ourselves,&quot; i.e., 
      in that stream of consciousness which produces the changing series of 
      patterns of our own particular individuality. And this is in fact the 
      deeper significance of the Oedipus complex and other such matters 
      unearthed by Freud. According to the &quot;Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot; those 
      whose karmic predispositions destine them for rebirth in human form see 
      couples in sexual union and experience desire for an attractive member of 
      the opposite sex among those couples. By this desire they thereupon find 
      themselves drawn into the womb and reborn -- which was not at all what 
      they wanted! The Theravada scriptures do not specifically describe the 
      process, and it may be rather symbolic than literal, but psychologically 
      at least something like this is what happens.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Quite obviously, the average Buddhist lay 
      person has no present intention of living a celibate life -- nor is this 
      being urged here. But some knowledge of the nature of sexuality and of how 
      it can be transcended can help him to solve his sexual problems, if only 
      by helping him to avoid self-deception.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Sex and the Stages on the Path</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">According to the Buddhist teaching, the 
      path to Full Enlightenment is marked by the successive attainment (and 
      fruition) of four stages. The first of these is that of the stream-winner 
      (<I>sotapanna</I>), who has broken three of the ten fetters and &quot;glimpsed 
      Nibbana.&quot; The essential factor here is the clear realization of 
      impersonality (<I>anatta</I>). This realization at the same time 
      eliminates skeptical doubt and belief in rites and rituals. In our present 
      connection the important point to note is this: in the moment when anatta 
      is realized -- when, that is, the spurious nature of &quot;self &quot; is clearly 
      seen -- there can, obviously, be no desire of any sort for that &quot;self&quot; and 
      its gratification.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">True, this moment of deep insight passes, 
      but its profound effects remain. Desires return, but their root has been 
      irreparably broken, so that they must eventually die away. In fact at this 
      stage -- and this should be realized -- sexual desire, and aggression, may 
      still be quite strong in some types of character. But of course they will 
      never result in the grosser forms of misconduct. However, craving 
      (including the sexual drive) in its more latent form may still be powerful 
      enough to lead to repeated rebirths -- up to seven times, it is said.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The second stage, that of the 
      once-returner (<I>sakada-gamin</I>), when &quot;Nibbana has been glimpsed&quot; a 
      second time, results in a dramatic reduction of both these urges. 
      Henceforth, they have at most only &quot;nuisance-value,&quot; and rebirth in the 
      world of sensuality cannot, it is said, take place more than once. Only at 
      the third stage, that of the non-returner (<I>anagamin</I>), are they 
      quite eliminated. Such a person has no more ties with this world, and so 
      will not be reborn here, though he may be reborn in another sphere before 
      attaining Full Enlightenment.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">From all this the conclusion may be drawn 
      that, while it is indeed possible to &quot;transcend sexuality&quot; in this life, 
      it is not by any means as simple as some suppose, and many who think they 
      have done it are deceiving themselves. Nevertheless there are many in the 
      robe and out of it who, without having reached this stage, have in 
      practice gained complete control of the sex impulse.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Gaining Control</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">How, then, can control of sexuality be 
      achieved? A large measure of control can certainly be gained by 
      concentrative (<I>samatha</I>) meditation practice, which stills the mind 
      and can lead to the jhana states. In non-Buddhist systems this is probably 
      the best that can be hoped for, and it is not to be despised. Indeed, many 
      people, especially in the West (and probably also, e.g., in modern Japan), 
      are so disturbed that some such calming practice is almost essential, 
      perhaps for a very long time. But the other way, and the truly Buddhist 
      way, which can lead right to the goal, is the way of Insight. The main 
      scriptural basis for this is the Satipatthana Sutta.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The four foundations of mindfulness as set 
      forth there are: mindfulness as to body, feelings, states of mind, and 
      mind-contents. With reference to &quot;states of mind,&quot; it is said: &quot;He knows 
      lustful mind and the mind that is free from lust. He knows how lust arises 
      and how it ceases.&quot; This is not a manual of meditation, and it must 
      suffice here just to indicate how by mindfulness one comes to discover how 
      mental and physical phenomena arise and cease, and therefore, ultimately, 
      how to bring about their cessation.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In this method, there is no forcing. Rigid 
      suppression by an act of will is not required -- and will not anyway lead 
      to the goal. When even quite intractable-seeming personal problems are 
      fully seen in their true nature, they will dissolve. It may take time and 
      much perseverance, but it is a way of gentleness, which does no violence 
      to one&#39;s nature. Eventually, if steadfastly pursued, it can lead to the 
      solution of all our problems, not only those connected with sex. Slowly 
      and patiently, we can disentangle by mindfulness all the guilt feelings 
      and other complications which may have developed. And we come to realize, 
      probably to our surprise, that the seeing is the cure, when the seeing is 
      deep enough.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Conclusion</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Sex is a powerful force in us all. In 
      itself it is neither &quot;good&quot; nor &quot;bad.&quot; But it can certainly create 
      problems. And modern Western man is particularly prone to such problems, 
      partly because of the sheer hectic pace and pressure of modern life, which 
      exaggerates all our troubles, and more specifically because of his 
      background. A puritanical Church tradition (one extreme) has now been 
      vigorously challenged by a secular spirit of permissiveness (the other 
      extreme). For many people it is not at all easy to find the middle way 
      between these two extremes.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There is nothing &quot;sinful&quot; about sex. If we 
      make mistakes, we should recognize them and try to avoid repeating them, 
      but we should not develop guilt-complexes about them. Sexual lapses are 
      not uniquely wicked, and in fact all but the grosser forms of sexual 
      misconduct are probably on the whole less harmful socially than a lot of 
      other things many people do. But it should be borne in mind that sex does 
      usually involve at least one other person, and potentially the next 
      generation. In this respect it is strictly incumbent on us at all times to 
      act responsibly which means compassionately. Otherwise, the physical and 
      emotional consequences for somebody may be very serious.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The ideal of sex only within monogamous 
      marriage should be just as valid for Buddhists as for Christians. It 
      should, at least, not be lightly departed from.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The way of mindfulness has been 
      recommended above. Admittedly, not everybody is prepared to practice 
      intensive mindfulness, whatever benefits may be urged for it. But even a 
      moderate degree of habitual mindfulness can produce surprising results. If 
      we learn, with detachment, to watch our desires at play, it is often quite 
      astonishing how they seem to &quot;drop away,&quot; almost of their own accord. To 
      take as an example a related problem: many people, when they first come to 
      Buddhism, are worried about the Fifth Precept, which deals with 
      intoxication. &quot;Can&#39;t I have a drink occasionally?&quot; they ask, often rather 
      anxiously. The answer is, of course: &quot;It&#39;s up to you.&quot; But in this case, 
      too, having tried a little mindfulness, they are frequently surprised to 
      find that they want a drink less and less. As a matter of fact, the same 
      principle applies here too. Having discovered the principle, applied it 
      and found that it works, we can decide for ourselves how far we wish to 
      take it. It will take us as far as we are prepared to go.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Some readers may wonder that there has 
      been no mention of the word &quot;love&quot; in the foregoing. To have discussed 
      this question would have led too far. So I will merely quote the following 
      two phrases from a newspaper advice-column:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;I am in love&quot; means &quot;I want me to be 
      happy&quot;; &quot;I love&quot; means &quot;I want to make you happy.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Buddhists might reflect, and even 
      meditate, on these two statements -- at various levels.</FONT></P>
