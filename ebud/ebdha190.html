    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now there comes a time, Vasettha, when after a long period
    of time this world expands. When the world expands beings for the most part fall from the
    realm of Radiance and come here [to this realm]; and they exist made of mind, feeding on
    joy, self-luminous, moving through the air, constantly beautiful; thus they remain for a
    long, long time. (1) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This striking and evocative passage introduces the
    well-known account of the evolution of the world and human society found in the
    Agganna-sutta of the Pali Digha Nikaya. (2) It marks the beginning of a particular line of
    thought within Buddhist tradition concerning the world and its cycles of expansion and
    contraction. It is this line of thought that I wish to investigate in the present article.
    It can sometimes seem that, as &quot;literate, demythologized and Aristotelianized
    academics&quot;--to borrow a characterization from G. S. Kirk (3)--we become peculiarly
    insensitive to the kind of poetic and imaginative world which, for perhaps most human
    beings for most of human history, has constituted &quot;reality.&quot; It is perhaps not
    an accident then that, despite the fact that certain studies of contemporary Buddhism in
    Sri Lanka, Burma, and Thailand have drawn attention to the importance of the traditional
    cosmology to the worldview of present-day Theravada Buddhists, (4) the subject of Buddhist
    cosmology has received relatively little attention from textual scholars. (5)
    Significantly, one of the few works devoted to Buddhist cosmology to be published in more
    recent years is not a study of ancient Pali or Sanskrit sources but a translation of a
    fourteenth-century Thai classic, Phya Lithai's Traibhumikatha or Thrai Phum Phra Ruang
    (&quot;Three Worlds according to King Ruang&quot;). (6) The overall paucity of scholarly
    materials dealing with Buddhist cosmology would seem to reflect a reluctance on the part
    of modern scholarship to treat this dimension of Buddhist thought as having any serious
    bearing on those fundamental Buddhist teachings with which we are so familiar: the four
    noble truths, the eightfold path, no-self, dependent arising, and so on. The effect of
    this is to divorce the bare doctrinal formulations of Buddhist thought from a traditional
    mythic context. This can result in serious distortions: the picture that has sometimes
    been painted of especially early Buddhism and Theravada Buddhism is somewhat
    one-dimensional and flat. However, the principle that the study of the imagery employed in
    early Buddhist texts is a useful way of deepening our understanding of the more overtly
    conceptual teachings of the Nikayas has already been used to good purpose by Steven
    Collins in his discussion of house imagery, vegetation imagery, and water imagery in the
    context of the Nikayas' presentation of the teaching of &quot;no-self.&quot; (7)
    Advocating an approach not dissimilar to Collins's, Stanley Tambiah has commented that the
    traditional Buddhist cosmological scheme &quot;says figuratively and in terms of
    metaphorical images the same kind of thing which is stated in abstract terms in the
    doctrine. The basic doctrinal concepts of Buddhism . . . which are alleged to explain
    man's predicament and to direct his religious action, are also embedded in the cosmology
    (and its associated pantheon).&quot; (8) It seems to me that in this he can only be right,
    and one of the things I will do in this article is to explore further the relationship in
    Buddhist thought between the realms of abstract theory, on the one hand, and cosmological
    myth, on the other. To ignore the mythic portions of ancient Buddhist texts is to fail in
    a significant way to enter into their thought-world. My particular focus will be certain
    cosmological ideas concerning the expansion and contraction of the universe and their
    implications for our understanding of the nature and significance of the fourth
    &quot;meditation&quot; (jhana/dhyana) in the account of the stages of the Buddhist path as
    presented in the Nikayas and Abhidharma. What also emerges, I will argue, is a clearer
    perspective on the development of certain ideas usually considered characteristic of
    certain strands of Mahayana Buddhist thought: the tathagatagarbha and an idealist
    ontology. </font></p>
    <p><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">COSMOLOGY IN THE NIKAYAS AND ABHIDHARMA </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Nikayas and Agamas contain very many cosmological
    details, but it is not until the period of the Abhidharma that we get attempts to organize
    these details into a systematic whole. Yet what Masson's and Marasinghe's studies of
    &quot;gods&quot; in the Nikayas reveal is that, notwithstanding the fact that the Nikayas
    nowhere give a systematic exposition of their cosmology, (9) all the basic principles and
    not a few of the details of the developed cosmology of the Abhidharma are to be found
    scattered throughout the Nikayas. (10) I reckon the basic principles to be three. First,
    there are a number of different realms of existence that constitute a hierarchy; there are
    lower realms--the realms of animals (tiracchanayoni) and of hungry ghosts (pettivisaya)
    and various hells (niraya); there is the realm of men (mantissa) and, above, the various
    heaven realms of the devas and brahmas. (11) Second, beings are continually reborn in
    these various realms in accordance with their actions-the ten unskillful (akusala) courses
    of action (kammapatha) lead to rebirth in one of the lower realms, and the ten skillful
    (kusala) courses of action lead to rebirth as a human being or in the lower heavens, while
    meditation attainments (jhana) lead to rebirth in the higher heavens as a brahma. (12) The
    third principle is that which is inherent in the formula from the Agganna-sutta that I
    quoted above. The various levels of existence arrange themselves in
    &quot;world-systems&quot; (loka-dhatu); there are innumerable world-systems which all
    expand and contract across vast expanses of time. (13) This basic cosmological scheme is
    not confined to one isolated Nikaya context; it is something alluded to and assumed by
    very many of the Nikaya formulas. It is perhaps most conveniently summed up in the
    well-known formula which states that the Buddha, &quot;having himself fully understood and
    directly experienced this world with its devas, its Mara and Brahma, this generation with
    its samanas and brahmanas, with its princes and peoples, makes it known.&quot; (14) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What I want to argue below does not hinge on establishing
    that the Buddha himself or the earliest phase of Buddhist thought subscribed to this
    specific cosmological view; I am concerned with how the tradition read the texts as a
    coherent whole rather than with their relative chronology and evolution. But I would add
    that I can see no particular reason for thinking that this basic conception of the
    universe does not belong to the earlier strata of the Nikayas. There are no a priori
    historical grounds for regarding the principles of this cosmology as improbable in the
    mouth of the Buddha; as Marasinghe has commented, &quot;From a study of the Jain, Ajivika,
    and the Buddhist ideas of cosmological thinking, it may be surmised that, by the time of
    the Buddha, there was a rich floating mass of cosmological ideas in the Gangetic regions
    from which most religious teachers drew quite freely.&quot; (15) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the evidence of the Rg-Veda, Upanisads, and Jain
    sources such cosmological ideas might easily have been borrowed and adapted from the
    cultural milieu in which we understand the Buddha to have formulated his teachings. But
    this is perhaps to put it too negatively. In many respects the kind of cosmology that I
    have indicated above seems actually fundamental to Buddhist thought. On the evidence of
    the Nikayas (and apparently the Chinese Agamas) we know of no Buddhism or Buddha that did
    not teach a belief in rebirth, or conceive of rebirth as fluid among different realms,
    whether animal, hellish, human, or heavenly. (16) While certain of the details of the
    Agganna-sutta's account of the evolution of human society may be, as Gombrich has
    persuasively argued, satirical in intent, there is nothing in the Nikayas to suggest that
    these basic cosmological principles that I have identified should be so understood; there
    is nothing to suggest that the Agganna-sutta's introductory formula describing the
    expansion and contraction of the world is merely a joke. (17) We should surely expect
    early Buddhism and indeed the Buddha to have some specific ideas about the nature of the
    round of rebirth, and essentially this is what the cosmological details presented in the
    Agganna-sutta and elsewhere in Nikayas constitute. They represent a concretized and mythic
    counterpart to the more abstract formulation of, say, dependent arising
    (paticcasamuppada). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What functions do the various levels of existence and the
    gods play in the Nikayas? There is no one simple answer to this question, but I shall
    answer initially by stating more fully what I identified above as the second principle of
    Buddhist cosmology, namely, that particular kinds of action of body, speech, and mind lead
    to certain kinds of rebirth. The passages I referred to in this connection effectively
    draw up a hierarchy of kamma that corresponds very closely to the hierarchy of levels of
    existence. At the bottom of this hierarchy we have unskillful kammas leading to rebirth in
    the realms of hell, hungry ghosts, and animals; next we have the skillful kammas of
    generosity (dana) and the precepts (sila) practiced to various degrees and leading to
    rebirth as a human being or as a deva in one of six realms of heaven; finally the practice
    of meditation (bhavana) and the development of the various jhanas leads to rebirth among
    &quot;the gods of Brahma's retinue&quot; (brahmakayika deva) and beyond. At this point we
    should remind ourselves that kamma is for the Nikayas--as for Buddhist thought
    generally--at root a mental act or intention; acts of body and speech are performed in
    response to and conditioned by the quality of the underlying intention or will (cetana);
    they are unskillful or skillful because they are motivated by unskillful or skillful
    intentions. (18) Acts of body and speech are, as it were, the epiphenomena of particular
    kinds of mentality; they are driven by specific psychological states. In a very real sense
    acts of body and speech are acts of will. Thus the hierarchy is essentially one of certain
    kinds of mentality (understood as kamma) being related to certain levels of existence;
    this is most explicit in the case of the various jhanas and Brahma realms. This way of
    thinking demonstrates the general principle of an equivalence or parallel in Buddhist
    thought between psychology on the one hand and cosmology on the other. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many of the stories about devas from different heavens in
    the Nikayas lend themselves very readily to a kind of &quot;psychological&quot;
    interpretation, that is, to interpretation in terms of certain mental states; in certain
    contexts this interpretation is explicit in the texts themselves. In the vana-samyutta of
    the Samyutta Nikaya there is a whole series of accounts of devas visiting bhikkhus
    dwelling in the forest in order to admonish the bhikkhus for their laziness. (19) Here the
    devas serve to arouse skillful states of mind in the bhikkhu that spur him on in his
    practice. Similarly in the Mara- and Bhikkhuni-samyuttas Mara is represented as appearing
    on the scene and tempting bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, and the Buddha, with the world of the five
    senses. (20) Here then Mara appears to act as the five hindrances (nivarana) which are
    precisely the mental states that one must overcome in order to attain jhana, and it is
    precisely jhana that--at least according to a later understanding--takes one temporarily
    beyond the world of the five senses and out of Mara's reach. (21) To read these texts in
    loosely psychological terms is not, I think, to engage in acts of gratuitous
    &quot;demythologizing&quot;; the Buddhist tradition itself at an early date was quite
    capable of demythologizing--so much so that one hesitates to use such a term in this
    context. It is rather, I think, that this kind of psychological interpretation was for the
    Nikayas inherent in the material itself. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When questioned as to the nature of Mara, the Buddha
    responds in abstract terms that have to do with general psychological experience:
    &quot;One says, `Mara! Mara!' lord. Now to what extent, lord, might Mara or the
    manifestation of Mara exist?' `Where the eye exists, Samiddhi, where visible forms, eye
    consciousness and dhammas cognizable by the eye exist, there Mara or the manifestation of
    Mara exist.'&quot; (22) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Again the Suttanipata defines the armies of Mara that
    assault the Bodhisatta in what are essentially psychological terms: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">435. Dwelling thus having attained the highest experience,
      my mind has no regard for sensual desires. See the purity of a being. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">436. Sensual desire is called your [Mara's] first army,
      discontent your second; your third is called hunger and thirst, your fourth craving. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">437. Your fifth is called tiredness and sleepiness, your
      sixth fear. Your seventh is doubt, deceit and obstinacy your eighth . . . </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">439. Namuci, this is your army-the attacking (force) of
      the Dark One [Mara]. Not being a hero one does not conquer it, but having conquered it one
      gains happiness. (23) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Samyutta Nikaya, the daughters of Mara too are
    presented as having a similar psychological reality: &quot;Then Craving, Discontent, and
    Lust, the daughters of Mara, approached the Blessed One [the Buddha]. Having approached
    they spoke thus to the Blessed One: 'Ascetic, we would serve at your fees.' Now the
    Blessed One paid no attention, since he was freed in the unsurpassable, complete
    destruction of attachments.&quot; (24) It is surely to read nothing into these texts to
    say that the descriptions of the Bodhisatta's/Buddha's encounter with Mara's armies and
    daughters represent vivid descriptions of the psychology of the Buddha before and after
    his awakening. The Bodhisatta/Buddha has wrestled with certain mental states--Mara, his
    armies, his daughters--and defeated them. That is to say, particular psychological states
    are described in terms of an encounter with beings with cosmological significance--or vice
    versa. (25) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I do not wish, however, to suggest that a psychological
    interpretation of such figures as Mara is the whole story. I am not claiming that all
    ancient readers or hearers of these &quot;texts&quot; would have conceived of Mara's
    daughters and armies simply as mystic symbols of particular mental states. No doubt for
    many, Mara, his daughters, and his armies would have had a reality as autonomous beings
    apart from their own mental states. I do want to claim, however, that a psychological
    interpretation would have made sense to the authors and readers of these texts. Yet in
    making such a claim I do not wish to imply that a psychological reading somehow reveals
    the &quot;true&quot; and &quot;real&quot; significance of the various cosmological
    beings--the significance intended by the Buddha but which the Buddhist tradition had to
    compromise in the face of popular belief, and which we in the late twentieth century are
    at last privileged to access. The Buddhism of the Nikayas embraces the notion of rebirth,
    and the account of different realms of existence occupied by a variety of beings is
    integral to that. The categories of &quot;mythic symbol&quot; and &quot;literally
    true&quot; are modern and are bound up with a complex ontology that has been shaped by a
    particular intellectual and cultural tradition. Thus to approach what, for the want of a
    better term, we call the mythic portions of the Nikayas with the attitude that such
    categories as &quot;mythic symbol&quot; and &quot;literally true&quot; are absolutely
    opposed is to adopt an attitude that is out of time and place. It seems to me that in some
    measure we must allow both a literal and a psychological interpretation. Both are there in
    the texts. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The equivocation between cosmology and psychology is
    particularly clear in a passage of the Kevaddha-sutta. (26) The Buddha tells of a certain
    bhikkhu who wished to discover where the four great elements (mahabhuta) ceased without
    remainder (aparisesa nirujjhanti). It seems that we must understand this as wishing to
    know the full extent of the conditioned world-both physical and mental. The bhikkhu
    appears to have been a master of meditation, for we are told that he attained a state of
    concentration in which the path leading to the gods appeared to his concentrated mind
    (&quot;tatharupam samadhim samapajji yatha samahite citte deva-yaniyo maggo
    paturahosi&quot;). He then proceeds to approach the gods of ever higher levels to pose his
    question until eventually he finds himself in the presence of Mahabrahma himself, who
    confesses that he cannot answer the question and suggests that he return to the Buddha to
    put this question to him. The Buddha answers that the four elements cease, not &quot;out
    there&quot; in some remote outpost of the universe, but in &quot;consciousness&quot;
    (vinnana). (27) This account states very clearly how specific psychological states--in
    this instance, the mind concentrated in the various levels of meditation--give access to
    particular cosmological realms. Thus the bhikkhu is explicitly described as at once making
    a journey through various levels of the cosmos and making an inner, spiritual journey--a
    journey of the mind. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the light of an extremely suggestive article by Peter
    Masefield, it seems that instead of being misled into searching for meaning in terms of
    the categories of literal truth and mythic symbol, we should understand the Nikayas'
    reference both to a cosmic hierarchy of beings (humans, devas and brahmas) and to a
    psychological hierarchy of mental states (levels of jhana) as paralleling the Upanisadic
    categories of &quot;with reference to the gods&quot; (adhidaivatam) and &quot;with
    reference to the self&quot; (adhyatmam): that is, &quot;reality&quot; may be viewed either
    from the perspective of an exterior world (brahman) or from the perspective of an interior
    world (atman) that are in some sense--though, in the case of Buddhist thought, not an
    absolutist metaphysical one--the same. (28) Thus Masefield suggests that to talk or
    conceive of Mara as a cosmic entity on the one hand and as psychological forces on the
    other is essentially to shift from the adhidaivatam to the adhyatmam perspective. (29) I
    am persuaded that Masefield has indeed identified here a way of thinking that runs very
    deep in the Indian philosophical tradition, and while the importance of this way of
    thinking may be acknowledged in the context of the Vedas and Hindu and Buddhist tantra, it
    is insufficiently understood in the context of early Buddhism. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Turning from the Nikayas to the Abhidharma, two full
    systematic accounts of Buddhist cosmology survive: that of the Theravadin Abhidhamma and
    that of the Sarvastivada-Vaibhasika Abhidharma. These two accounts are remarkably similar
    in broad outline and in fact also agree on many points of detail. This again suggests that
    the basic cosmology should be regarded as having been formulated relatively early since it
    forms part of the common heritage of ancient Buddhism. In what follows, I shall be drawing
    on both the Pali Theravadin traditions and also, at points, Vasubandhu's Abhidharmakosa
    for the traditions of the Sarvastivadins. One of the general concerns of the Abhidharma is
    to provide a detailed and complex hierarchy of consciousness. The classic Theravada scheme
    of eighty-nine or 121 &quot;consciousnesses&quot; (citta) begins with unskillful
    consciousnesses at the bottom, followed by consciousnesses that concern the mechanics of
    bare awareness of the objects of the five senses, and then by skillful sense-sphere
    consciousnesses; next come the various formsphere and formless-sphere consciousnesses that
    constitute the jhanas, or meditation attainments; finally, we have the world-transcending
    (lokuttara) consciousnesses that constitute the mind at the moment of awakening itself.
    (30) The basic structure of this hierarchy of consciousness parallels quite explicitly the
    basic structure of the cosmos: consciousness belongs to the sense sphere (kamavacara), the
    form sphere (rupavacara), or the formless sphere (arupavacara); beings exist in the sense
    world (kama-dhatu, kama-loka), the form world (rupa-dhatu, rupa-loka), or the formless
    world (arupa-dhatu, arupa-loka). As well as laying down a more precise hierarchy of
    consciousness, the Abhidhamma also finalized the structure of the cosmos: both Theravadin
    and northern sources detail thirty-one basic realms. (31) The basic structure of this
    cosmos, along with its psychological parallel, is set out in figure 1. </font></p>
    <p><i>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">[Figure 1 ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] </font></i></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In detailing the types of consciousness that beings reborn
    in particular realms are able to experience, the Abhidhamma provides a further indication
    of the parallel between the psychological order and the cosmological order. (32) Beings in
    the lowest realms (hell beings, animals, hungry ghosts, Asuras) can only experience
    sense-sphere consciousness; beings in the human realm and the heavens of the sense sphere
    characteristically experience sense-sphere consciousness but can in special circumstances
    (i.e., when attaining jhana) experience form-sphere and formless-sphere consciousness.
    Beings in the form and formless worlds characteristically experience form and sense-sphere
    consciousness respectively; both may experience certain forms of both skillful and
    unskillful sense-sphere consciousness, but not those associated with hatred and unpleasant
    feeling. (33) The logic governing this arrangement is as follows: A being in one of the
    lower realms must experience at least a modicum of skillful consciousness or else, never
    being able to generate the skillful kamma necessary to condition rebirth in a higher
    realm, he or she is stuck there forever. Similarly, beings in the Brahma worlds must
    experience some unskillful consciousness, otherwise their kamma would be exclusively
    skillful, and they would be able to remain forever in these blissful realms where no
    unpleasant bodily or mental feeling ever occurs, escaping dukkha permanently rather than
    only temporarily (albeit for an aeon or two). Finally, beings such as humans who are in
    the middle of the hierarchy are evenly poised; they may experience the most unskillful
    kinds of consciousness or they may experience the most skillful--they may go right to the
    bottom or right to the top. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A point of particular significance that emerges from this
    is that, from the perspective of Abhidharma, to shift from talk about levels of existence
    to talk about levels of the mind is to continue to talk about the same thing but on a
    different scale. What is involved in moving from the psychological order (the hierarchy of
    consciousness) to the cosmological order (the hierarchy of beings) is essentially a shift
    in time scales. The mind (of certain beings) might range through the possible levels of
    consciousness in a relatively short period--possibly in moments. A being, in contrast,
    exists at a particular level in the cosmos for rather longer--84,000 aeons in the case of
    a being in the realm of &quot;neither consciousness nor unconsciousness&quot;--and to
    range through all the possible levels of being is going to take a very long time indeed.
    (34) The fact that what we are talking about here is a change of scale is exactly brought
    out by the Abhidharma treatment of &quot;dependent arising&quot; (pratityasamutpada). This
    law that governs the process of things, whether the workings of the mind or the process of
    rebirth, is always the same. Thus the Abhidharma illustrates the operation of the twelve
    links of dependent arising either by reference to the way in which beings progress from
    life to life or by reference to the progress of consciousness from moment to moment: from
    one perspective we are born, live, and die over a period of, say, eighty years; from
    another we are born, live, and die in every moment. (35) In chapter 3 of the
    Abhidharmakosa, Vasubandhu in fact discusses these different scales for the interpretation
    of pratityasamutpada precisely in the context of his exposition of cosmology (vv. 20-38).
    In general, traditional Buddhist cosmology as expounded in the Nikayas and Abhidhamma must
    be understood as at once a map of all realms of existence and an account of all possible
    experiences. </font></p>
    <p><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">THE EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION OF WORLD-SYSTEMS </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to Buddhist cosmological systems the universe is
    constituted by innumerable &quot;world-systems&quot; or &quot;world-spheres&quot;
    (loka-dhatu, cakkavala) comprising just thirty-one levels of existence. (36) Much as the
    mind is not static or stable, neither, on a grander scale, are world-systems; they
    themselves go through vast cycles of expansion and contraction. According to the
    exegetical traditions of both the Theravadins and Sarvastivadins, the formula I quoted
    from the Agganna-sutta, referring as it does to the rebirth of beings in the realm of
    Radiance (abhassara/abhasvara) (37) at the time of world contraction, describes this
    contraction as the result of destruction by fire. Both Buddhaghosa and Vasubandhu provide
    some further details about how the destruction proceeds. (38) According to Buddhaghosa,
    world-systems contract in great clusters--he speaks of a billion (koti-sata-sahassa)
    world-systems contracting at a time. (39) Both writers describe how, when they contract,
    world-systems contract from the bottom upward. Thus in the case of destruction by fire,
    the fire starts in the lower realms of the sense sphere and having burned up these, it
    invades the form realms; but having burned up the realms corresponding to the first
    jhana/dhyana, it stops. The realms corresponding to the second, third, and fourth jhanas,
    and the four formless realms, are thus spared the destruction. But destruction by fire is
    not the only kind of destruction, merely the most frequent--water and wind also wreak
    their havoc. When the destruction is by water, the three realms corresponding to the
    second jhana are also included in the general destruction, while the destruction by wind
    invades and destroys even the realms corresponding to the third jhana. Overall, only the
    seven realms corresponding to the fourth jhana and the four formless realms are never
    subject to this universal destruction. (40) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So what becomes of the beings that occupy the lower realms
    when fire, water, and wind wreak their destruction? They cannot just disappear from
    samsara; they must go somewhere. Here we touch upon a question which posed something of a
    problem in the Buddhist tradition and to which its answers are not entirely consistent.
    The simple answer that Buddhaghosa gives in the Visuddhimagga is that at the time of the
    destruction of a world-system by fire, all the beings that occupy the lower
    realms--including hell beings (nerayika)--are reborn in the Abhassara Brahma realm
    (corresponding to the second jhana) or above it. But since rebirth in a Brahma realm can
    only occur as a result of the practice of the jhanas, Buddhaghosa has a problem. The chaos
    and hardships that are a prelude to the destruction of the world are hardly conducive to
    the practice of jhana. Moreover, certain beings simply do not have the capacity to attain
    jhana even if they try. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is no rebirth in the Brahma world without jhana, and
    some beings are oppressed by the scarcity of food, and some are incapable of attaining
    jhana. How are they reborn there? By virtue of jhana acquired in the Deva world. For at
    that time, knowing that in a hundred thousand years the aeon will come to an end, the
    sense-sphere gods, called &quot;Marshals of the World,&quot; loosen their headdresses and,
    with disheveled hair and pitiful faces, wiping their tears with their hands, clothed in
    red and wearing their garments in great disarray, come and frequent the haunts of men
    saying, &quot;Good sirs, a hundred thousand years from now the aeon will come to an end:
    this world will be destroyed, the great ocean will dry up, and Sineru, king of mountains,
    will be burnt up and destroyed. The destruction of the world will reach the Brahma world.
    Develop loving kindness, good sirs. Develop compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity.
    Take care of your mothers and fathers; honor the elders of the family.&quot; Hearing their
    words, both men and the deities of the earth are for the most part moved; they become kind
    to one another, and making merit by loving kindness and so on, they are reborn in the Deva
    world. There they enjoy the food of the gods and having completed the initial work on the
    air kasina, they attain jhana </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">However there are others who are reborn in the Deva world
    by virtue of their kamma &quot;that is to be experienced at an unspecified time,&quot; for
    there is certainly no being wandering in samsara devoid of kamma that is to be experienced
    at an unspecified time. They also similarly acquire jhana there [in the Deva world]. So
    all beings are reborn in the Brahma world by virtue of the attainment of jhana. (41) For
    Buddhaghosa, at the time of the contraction of a world-system, all the beings occupying
    the lower realms should be understood as being reborn in those higher Brahma worlds that
    escape the destruction--this is true even of the beings in the lower realms of hell. When
    all else fails, this comes about by virtue of the fact that there is no being in samsara
    that has not at some time or other performed the kamma necessary for rebirth in the happy
    realms of the sense sphere. Thus even beings born in hell realms as the result of
    unwholesome kamma will always have a latent good kamma that can come to fruition at the
    time of the pending contraction of the world-system; this is their &quot;kamma to be
    experienced at an unspecified time&quot; (aparapariya-vedaniya-kamma). (42) Such beings
    are first reborn in a sense-sphere heaven, where they subsequently cultivate jhana leading
    to rebirth in the Brahma worlds. What follows from this view of the matter is that all
    beings in samsara are regarded as having dwelt at some time in the Brahma realms
    corresponding to the second, third, and fourth jhanas; moreover, periodically--though the
    periods may be of inconceivable duration--all beings are regarded as returning to these
    realms. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It seems, however, that some in the Buddhist tradition
    were not entirely happy with the understanding of the matter presented by Buddhaghosa.
    Commenting on the phrase, &quot;when the world contracts beings are for the most part born
    in the realm of Radiance,&quot; as it occurs in the Brahmajala Sutta, Buddhaghosa states
    that &quot;`for the most part' [yebhuyyena] is said because there are other beings who are
    born either in higher Brahma realms or in the formless realms.&quot; (43) Dhammapala,
    however, in his subcommentary on the text by Buddhaghosa, adds: &quot;or in world-systems
    other than those in the process of contracting&quot; is the alternative to be understood
    by the word or. For it is not possible to consider that all beings in the descents at that
    time are born in form or formless existence, since it is impossible for those beings in
    the descents with the longest life spans to be reborn in the human realm. (44) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dhammapala's problem with Buddhaghosa's account seems to
    be that it fails to take account of the case of beings who, for example, commit one of the
    five great anantariya-kammas (killing one's mother, father, an arhat, wounding a Buddha,
    splitting the Samgha) toward the end of an aeon. Such beings must as a result surely be
    born in the hell realms, and yet the aeon might end before they had lived out the result
    of that kamma. Dhammapala therefore concludes that such beings must be reborn in the hells
    of other world systems. (45) Looking further afield in Buddhist sources we find other
    instances of both Buddhaghosa's position and Dhammapala's position on what happens to
    beings in the lower realms when a world-system contracts. For example, in chapter 3 of the
    Kosa, Vasubandhu writes: When not a single being remains in the hells, the world has
    contracted to this extent: namely by the contraction of the hells. At that time any being
    who still has karma that must be experienced in a hell is thrown into the hells of another
    world-system [that is not contracting]. (46) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In chapter 8, however, Vasubandhu comments that at the
    time of the contraction of a world-system, &quot;all beings of the lower realms produce
    dhyana of the form-realm because of the special occurrence of skillful dharmas.&quot; (47)
    Yasomitra comments that in these circumstances dhyana arises without any instruction
    because of the existence of the trace (vasana) of previous dhyana attainment. (48) Another
    cosmological treatise current in Southeast Asia is the eleventh- or twelfth-century
    Lokapannatti. Like the Visuddhimagga of Buddhaghosa, the Lokapannatti states that at the
    time of the contraction of a world-system, beings in the lower realms are reborn first in
    the kamadhatu and then in the Abhassara realm after practicing the second jhana; there is
    no mention of being reborn in the hells of other world systems. (49) The much later
    Theravadin source, &quot;Three Worlds according to King Ruang,&quot; on the other hand,
    takes the line of Dhammapala and chapter 3 of the Kosa, stating that hell beings may be
    reborn in the hells of world-systems that are not contracting. (50) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What are relative merits of these two perspectives
    regarding what happens to beings in lower realms at the time of world contraction? The
    position represented by Dhammapala, Kosa chapter 3 and the Triphum of Phya Lithai--namely,
    that they are reborn in the lower realms of world-systems that are not in the process of
    contracting--appears to be more in keeping with the laws of karma and, for this reason,
    the more carefully considered: beings who murder their mothers, fathers, arhats, wound a
    Buddha, or split the Samgha must surely experience the results of their actions whether or
    not a world-system contracts. (51) Yet this makes the alternative tradition--that all
    beings are reborn in the Brahma realms--all the more interesting and, I think,
    significant. It is, as it were, the lectio difficilior. Why should Buddhaghosa,
    Vasubandhu, and the Lokapannatti preserve and hand down a tradition that is so obviously
    problematic? In order to answer this question I would like to turn first to consider the
    theoretical account of the stages of the Buddhist path, since it seems to me that, viewed
    in the light of each other, the accounts of the stages of the path and the process of the
    expansion and contraction of the universe reveal clues about the unspoken assumptions that
    lie at the heart of Indian Buddhist thought. </font></p>
    <p><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">COSMOLOGY AND THE BUDDHIST PATH </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What should perhaps be regarded as the classic Nikaya
    account of the stages of the Buddhist path is found repeated in various suttas of the
    silakkhandha-vagga of the Digha Nikaya, and also, with slight variations, in several
    suttas of the Majjhima Nikaya. (52) This account can be summarized in simple terms as
    follows: on the basis of the practice of good conduct (sila), the bhikkhu practices
    meditation; by this means, he abandons the five hindrances and attains the first jhana.
    Attaining, successively, the second and third jhanas, the bhikkhu is described as further
    refining his concentrated mind until he eventually attains and abides in the fourth jhana.
    This is described as a state of &quot;purity of equanimity and mindfulness&quot;
    (upekkha-sati-parisuddhi); &quot;he suffuses his body with his mind that has been
    thoroughly purified and cleansed.&quot; (53) We then have a description of a series of
    eight (in the Digha) or three (in the Majjhima) (54) different attainments, each one of
    which is introduced by precisely the same formula: &quot;When his mind has become
    concentrated thus, when it is thoroughly purified and cleansed, stainless, the defilements
    absent, when it has become sensitive, workable, steady, having attained imperturbability,
    he inclines and applies his mind to. . .&quot; (55) In other words, having stilled the
    mind to the level of the fourth jhana, the bhikkhu has brought his mind to an extremely
    refined state that is suitable and fit for various tasks: the development of knowledge of
    the interdependence of consciousness and the body; the creation of a mind-made body; the
    acquiring of certain extraordinary powers (the iddhis and other abilities, elsewhere
    termed higher knowledges or abhinnas). Lastly he may apply this mind to the gaining of the
    knowledge of the destruction of the asavas, the knowledge of suffering, the arising of
    suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the way leading to the cessation of suffering;
    he then knows that for him birth is destroyed and that there is no future rebirth after
    the present one. (56) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The story of the bhikkhu in the Kevaddha-sutta to which I
    referred earlier is in fact a rather precise parable of this understanding of the progress
    of the Buddhist path. The bhikkhu of the Kevaddha-sutta resorts to increasingly subtler
    states of consciousness and/or levels of the cosmos in order to seek an answer to the
    question of the ultimate nature of the universe; and yet, having come to the furthest
    reaches of the universe, he does not find his question satisfactorily answered but must
    return to the Buddha and be instructed to reorient his quest. Similarly, the bhikkhu who
    attains jhana does not come to the end of the path but must turn his attention elsewhere
    in order finally to understand the nature of suffering, its cause, it cessation, and the
    path leading to its cessation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is in the light of this close correspondence that
    exists in Buddhist literature between journeys through the realms of the cosmos and inner
    journeys of the mind that the significance of the accounts of the expansion and
    contraction of the universe begins to be revealed. Stanley Tambiah has already drawn
    attention to this in some comments made in his study of the Thai forest monastic
    tradition--comments which are, however, brief and do not articulate the nature of the
    parallels entirely accurately. (57) Buddhist cosmology--in general, but especially in the
    account of the contraction and expansion of world-systems-provides us with a poetic,
    imaginative, and mythic counterpart to accounts of the stages of jhana attainment. Reading
    accounts of the Buddhist path alongside tales of the universe's end and beginning is the
    way to enter more fully into the thought-world of ancient Indian Buddhism. In particular,
    what is revealed in the cosmological accounts is the understanding of the nature of the
    fourth jhana: both the theoretical accounts of the stages of the path and the mythic
    descriptions of the contraction of the world-system converge on the fourth jhana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">That the mythic account of the contraction of a
    world-system can be read as paralleling a meditator's progress through the successive
    dhyanas is brought out explicitly in the following passage from the Abhidharmakos'a which
    comments on how, at the time of contraction, fire, water, and wind destroy the
    successively higher levels of the world-system: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the first dhyana thinking and reflection are
    imperfections; these are similar to fire since they burn through the mind. In the second
    dhyana joy is the imperfection; this is like water since, by association with tranquility,
    it makes the senses soft.... In the third dhyana out-breaths and in-breaths [are
    imperfections]; these are actually winds. In this way the subjective [adhyatmika]
    imperfection in a dhyana attainment is of the same nature as the objective [bahya]
    imperfection in the corresponding dhyana rebirth. (58) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A mediator's entering the fourth jhana thus marks the
    temporary attainment of a state of consciousness that is secure in its freedom from
    disturbances and defilements. For just as the realms of existence corresponding to the
    fourth jhana can never be reached by the ravages of fire, water, or wind, so the mind in
    the fourth jhana is undisturbed either by the gross objects of the five senses'or the
    subtler movements of the mind still remaining in the first, second, and third jhanas. What
    is more, viewed from the cosmological perspective of the expansion and contraction of the
    world-system and the periodic return of beings to the Brahma realms, in stilling the mind
    to the level of the fourth jhana, the bhikkhu is returning to a state experienced long
    ago. The cultivation of the jhanas becomes almost a kind of Platonic recollection of
    something long forgotten, of something one does not remember one knows. The recovery of
    the fourth jhana is a return to a basic or fundamental state--a stable and imperturbable
    state of the universe and also of the mind. (59) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In saying, however, that the realms of existence
    corresponding to the fourth jhana are always there, it is, of course, necessary to keep
    firmly in mind Buddhist principles of impermanence. The realms of the fourth jhana do not
    have some kind of mysterious existence of their own; these realms always exist in the
    sense that there are always beings &quot;in&quot; these realms, although the particular
    beings occupying these realms continually change and no individual being can permanently
    exist in such a realm. The fourth jhana realms thus do not constitute some kind of
    permanent substrate of the universe; it is simply that there are always beings
    &quot;there,&quot; or rather beings that exist in the manner of the fourth jhana. For the
    Abhassara or Vehapphala, realms are not so much places as modes or ways of being. (60) So,
    to say that periodically the world contracts back as far as the Vehapphala realm is
    exactly to say that periodically beings return to this manner of being. It is in this
    sense that the levels associated with the fourth jhana are basic, fundamental, almost, one
    might say, primordial. This, it seems, is precisely why they can serve as the stepping-off
    point for gaining the four formless attainments, (61) for developing various extraordinary
    meditational powers, (62) for realizing the liberating knowledge of the path. This, it
    seems, is precisely why, at the time of his parinibbana, the fourth jhana is the final
    active state of mind to be experienced by a living Buddha. (63) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I am now in a position to return to the question I posed
    above concerning Buddhaghosa's (and others') account of the process of the contraction of
    world-systems: Why does he preserve an apparently problematic account? The view handed
    down by Buddhaghosa, which he has no doubt received from the Sinhala atthakatha sources he
    had before him, seems concerned to emphasize that no being in samsara is without the
    necessary kamma to enable a skillful rebirth in the kamadhatu as a basis for subsequent
    rebirth in the realms corresponding to the fourth jhana; and that there is no being in
    samsara without experience of the realms of the fourth jhana--of the states which give
    close access to the liberating insight of bodhi. In other words, all beings have the
    capacity to become awakened and indeed all have somewhere in them an experience of a state
    of mind that is in certain important respects &quot;close&quot; to the awakening state of
    mind. </font></p>
    <p><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">THE MAHAYANA </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To anyone familiar with the Mahayana, the suggestion that
    beings always have within them a capacity to become awakened sounds strangely familiar,
    and at this point I would like to consider certain parallels that can, I think, be found
    between the cosmological ideas I have been discussing and certain ideas that find
    expression in Mahayana sutras. Buddhaghosa's account of what happens to beings when a
    world-system contracts bears a certain resemblance to aspects of an idea we are accustomed
    to associate with the Mahayana, namely, the tradition of tathagatagarbha--&quot;that
    within each being which enables enlightenment to take place.&quot; (64) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although formulated rather differently, something of the
    tathagatagarbha way of thinking is, I suggest, present in the cosmological traditions of
    the Abhidharma. In the context of the Nikaya and Abhidharma understanding of the
    development of the stages of the Buddhist path, the function of a &quot;trace&quot; left
    by previous dhyana practice experienced long ago, or of a skillful karma &quot;to be
    experienced at an unspecified time&quot; which makes for the attainment of the fourth
    dhyana state, is in significant respects similar to that of the tathagatagarbha in
    Mahayana thought: both may facilitate and effect enlightenment for deluded beings. This is
    not to suggest that Buddhaghosa here espouses a doctrine of tathagatagarbha or that
    tathagatagarbha views have influenced him or that he has influenced the development of
    tathagatagarbha theory. Rather there appears to be a common Buddhist theme here that finds
    expression in one way in Buddhaghosa's account of the contraction of a world-system and in
    another way in the theory of tathagatagarbha. (65) While we cannot say that Buddhaghosa's
    account of the expansion and contraction of a world-system is in all respects equivalent
    to the theory of tathagatagarbha, we can say that in certain respects it is; there is a
    certain overlap here. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A second area of interest centers on the understanding of
    the &quot;pure abodes&quot; (suddhavasa/suddhavasa) in the Nikayas, Abhidharma, and
    Mahayana. The Buddhist yogin who has mastered the fourth jhana has withdrawn the mind from
    the world of the senses, from the world of ordinary ideas and thoughts, and returned it,
    as it were, to a refined and fundamental state. From this state of mind he now has the
    possibility of seeing the world more clearly, seeing it as it truly is, and even, to a
    limited extent, by the practice of the various meditational powers (such as creating
    mind-made bodies, etc.), of constructing a different world. This way of thinking is
    continued and taken further in Mahayana Buddhist thought. For it is in the realm of the
    fourth dhyana that Bodhisattvas become Buddhas and create their &quot;Buddha fields&quot;
    and &quot;pure lands.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In non-Mahayana texts the five &quot;pure abodes&quot; are
    regarded as the abodes of &quot;never-returners&quot; (anagamin), beings who are all but
    awakened, beings who are in their last life and who will certainly attain arhatship before
    they pass away. (66) Rather interestingly, then, according to certain traditions of the
    developed Mahayana, the Akanistha realm--the highest of the &quot;pure abodes&quot; and of
    the realms of the fourth dhyana---is occupied not by never-returners about to become
    arhats but by tenth-stage Bodhisattvas about to become samyaksambuddhas. Having attained
    Buddhahood in the Akanistha realm, they send out their &quot;creation bodies&quot;
    (nirmana-kaya) to the lower realms for the benefit of sentient beings. Santaraksita in the
    Tattvasamgraha explains as follows: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">3549. Since their existence is outside samsara, which
      consists of the five destinies, the death of Buddhas is not admitted by us; therefore it
      is their creations that are perceived. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">3550. In the lovely city of Akanistha, free from all
      impure abodes--there Buddhas awaken; but here [in this world] creations awaken. (67) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kamalasila goes on to comment: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Samsara consists of the five destinies comprising hells,
    hungry-ghosts, animals, gods and men; and since Buddhas exist outside this their mortality
    is not accepted. How then does one learn of their birth in the family of Suddhodana and
    others? Accordingly he says that it is their creations that are perceived. Supporting this
    from scripture he utters the words beginning, &quot;In the Akanistha....&quot; There are
    gods called the Akanisthas; in a certain place among them the gods are called &quot;those
    belonging to the pure abodes,&quot; for here only the pure noble ones dwell. Among them
    the highest place is called the Palace of the Great Lord, and there only Bodhisattvas in
    their last existence who are established in the tenth bhumi are born, while here [in this
    world] by reason of their sovereignty in that place their creations gain knowledge. Such
    is the tradition. (68) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Significantly, a level associated with the fourth dhyana
    is once more conceived of as in some sense fundamental and primordial--the level upon
    which the creative activity of Buddhas is based. The extent and precise interpretation of
    the tradition that Buddhas become enlightened in Akanistha is not, however, entirely
    clear; the ancient accounts of the career of the Bodhisattva are varied and not always
    consistent. The exact source of Santaraksita's quotation from &quot;scripture&quot;
    (agama) is not traced, although the Lankavatara Sutra (Sagathaka vv. 38-40, 772-74)
    similarly states that beings become Buddhas in the Pure Abodes &quot;among the Akanisthas
    of the form-realm&quot; while their creations awaken in this world: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">772. I am of Katyayana's family; issuing from the Pure
      Abode I teach beings dharma that leads to the city of nirvana. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">773. This is the ancient path; the Tathagatas and I have
      taught nirvana in three thousand sutras. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">774. Thus not in the realm of the senses nor in the
      formless does a Buddha awaken, but among the Akanisthas of the form realm who are free of
      passion he awakens. (69) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Taking this tradition at face value, what seems to be
    being said is that full Buddhahood is attained by a tenth-stage Bodhisattva in the
    Akanistha realm; after this the &quot;created&quot; or &quot;emanated&quot; body
    (nirmanakaya) performs the acts of a Buddha beginning with the descent to this world from
    Tusita, the Heaven of Delight. In other words, Siddhartha Gautama from the time of his
    conception and birth is a nirmana-kaya of an already fully awakened Buddha. However, such
    an understanding is not entirely consistent with what is said in the Prajnaparamita
    literature or in the Dasabhumika about the final stages of the career of the Bodhisattva. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Pancavimsatasahasrika-Prajnaparamita appears to make
    no mention of the Pure Abodes or Akanistha in this connection, and it is the ninth-stage
    Bodhisattva that descends into the womb, takes birth, and sits beneath the tree of
    awakening, reaching the tenth stage when he becomes a Tathagata. (70) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although the Dasabhumika once again does not mention the
    Pure Abodes or Akanistha in Connection with the bhumis, it does talk of Bodhisattvas
    established in the tenth Stage as being &quot;mostly the Great Lord [mahesvara], king of
    the gods [deva-raja].&quot; (71) Various passages (which must be the source of the
    Tattvasamgraha tradition quoted above) consistently identify these terms as epithets of
    the chief of the gods of the Pure Abodes. (72) But for the Dasabhumika it is the
    Bodhisattva of the tenth stage (and not the ninth Stage as in the Prajnaparamita) who
    manifests in a single world-system all the acts of Tathagatas from abiding in the Tusita
    realm to Parinirvana (the final attainment of nirvana at death), but he appears to do this
    as Bodhisattva, remaining such and not becoming a full Buddha in the process. (73) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Moreover, at will he displays the array of the realms of
    all the Buddhas at the end of a single hair; at will he displays untold arrays of the
    realms of the Buddhas of all kinds; at will in the twinkling of an eye he creates as many
    individuals as there are particles in untold world-systems.... In the arising of a thought
    he embraces the ten directions; in a moment of thought he controls the manifestation of
    innumerable processes of complete awakening and final nirvana.... In his own body he
    controls countless manifestations of the qualities of the Buddha fields of innumerable
    Blessed Buddhas. (74) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If this is what tenth-stage Bodhisattvas do, then what do
    Buddhas do? Ignoring the poetic imagination of the Dasabhumika, the short answer seems to
    be much, much more of the same--so much so that one cannot properly begin to conceive of
    what Buddhas truly do. Nevertheless, it appears that we are to understand that at some
    point in the process--the repeated process of manifesting the acts of Buddhas and carrying
    out their work--these tenth-stage Bodhisattvas do actually become Buddhas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At this point it is useful, I think, to consider the
    witness of the later Indo-Tibetan tradition. mKhas grub rje's &quot;Fundamentals of the
    Buddhist Tantras&quot; (rGuyd safe spyi'i rnam par gzhag pa rgyas par brjod) is an early
    fifteenth-century dGe lugs work which devotes its first chapter to the question of how the
    Sravakas and then the Mahayana (considered by way of the &quot;Paramita&quot; and
    &quot;Mantra&quot; schools) understand the final stages of the process of the Blessed
    teacher's becoming a fully awakened one (abhisambuddha). (75) Let me go straight to mKhas
    grub rje's account of the understanding of this process according to the Mantra school.
    mKhas grub rje takes it as axiomatic for the Mahayana that full awakening is gained in
    Akanistha. But how precisely does it come about there? mKhas grub rje details the position
    of the Yoga and Anuttarayoga Tantras according to a number of Indian commentators (eighth
    to tenth century). For present concerns some indication of his account of Sakyamitra's and
    Buddhaguhya's understanding of the Yoga Tantras will suffice. According to them,
    Siddhartha Gautama, a tenth-stage Bodhisattva from the time of his birth, having practiced
    austerities for six years, then established himself in the imperturbable concentration
    (aninjyo-nama-samadhi) of the fourth dhyana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At that time, the Buddhas of all the ten directions
    assembled, aroused him from that samadhi by snapping their fingers, and said to him,
    &quot;You cannot become a Manifest Complete Buddha by this samadhi alone.&quot; &quot;Then
    how shall I proceed?&quot; he implored them. They guided him to the Akanistha heaven.
    Moreover, while his maturation body (vipaka-kaya) stayed on the bank of the same
    Nairahjana River, the mental body (manomaya-kaya) of the Bodhisattva Sarvarthasiddha
    proceeded to the Akanistha heaven. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After the Buddhas of the ten directions had given garment
    initiation (vastraabhiseka) and diadem initiation (makuta-abhiseka), they bade him enter
    the intense contemplation in sequence of the five Abhisambodhi. After completing the five
    Abhisambodhi, he became a Manifest Complete Buddha as Mahavairocana, the Sambhoga-kaya.
    (76) Insofar as this account sees Gautama as a Bodhisattva who has taken a human birth in
    his last existence and the enlightenment as straightforwardly founded on the actual
    attainment of the fourth dhyana, it is closer (than, say, the Pancavimsatika or
    Dasabhumika accounts) to the Nikaya description; the Bhayabherava-sutta of the Majjhima
    Nikaya describes the Bodhisatta as gaining the fourth jhana and then, on the basis of that
    attainment, the three knowledges which culminate in the knowledge of the destruction of
    the asavas. (77) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we now consider the above range of material on the
    process of the Bodhisattva's final attainment of Buddhahood, it seems that it embraces two
    basic views. According to one view the Bodhisattva in his &quot;final existence&quot;
    (i.e., before finally transcending existence) is reborn in the Akanistha heaven where he
    finally becomes a Buddha; he subsequently manifests various creations which appear to be
    born, go forth, practice, meditation, and become Buddhas. According to the other the
    Bodhisattva in his last existence is actually born as a human being; seated beneath the
    tree of awakening he ascends in meditation with a mind-made body to the Akanistha heaven
    where he finally becomes a Buddha, while his &quot;real&quot; human body remains seated
    beneath the tree. Yet to state the positions thus baldly actually infringes a deeply
    rooted ambiguity and equivocation that runs through the cosmological material I have been
    considering in the course of this article. For where is the true Buddha? In Akanistha? Or
    seated beneath the tree of awakening? How does one come to Akanistha? By traveling through
    space? Or by journeying in the mind? Let me emphasize here that I am asking these
    questions of the ancient texts and not raising the problem of how the modern Buddhist
    tradition should set about finding an understanding of its ancient cosmology that is
    compatible with the &quot;findings&quot; or modern science, whatever precisely those are.
    And my point is that to ask such questions in such terms betrays a particular metaphysics
    and ontology which is precisely not the metaphysics and ontology of the Indian Buddhist
    tradition. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the course of this article I have been trying to
    explore the way in which psychology and cosmology parallel each other in Buddhist
    thought--something that Peter Masefield has already tried to elucidate in the Nikayas by
    reference to the Upanisadic terms adhyatmam and adhidaivatam. I have suggested that in the
    Abhidharma the shift from psychology (levels of citta) to cosmology (levels of the
    lokadhatu) can be viewed as a shift of time scale. The effect of my discussion is not to
    reveal something new but to bring into sharper focus something that lies at the heart of
    Indian Buddhist thought, namely, a basic ambiguity about matters of cosmology and
    psychology, about the objective outer world and the subjective inner world. This is true
    to the extent that the key to understanding both is to recognize that there is a
    fundamental and profound equivalence between cosmology and psychology. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In conclusion I should like to risk a few general comments
    about the metaphysics and ontology of Indian Buddhism. I do not want to imply here that
    all Indian Buddhism shares an explicit and definite metaphysics and ontology, but I am
    suggesting that there is a general, underlying orientation, which tends to locate reality
    in the mind and its processes rather than in something &quot;out there&quot; which is
    other than the mind. We may want to persist in asking questions in the latter terms, yet
    it is significant that the tradition itself never quite does. On the contrary, it seems to
    take for granted and as natural an ambiguity between cosmology and psychology, for what is
    the difference between really being in Akanistha and experiencing one is really in
    Akanistha? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To put it another way, there is a loosely
    &quot;idealist&quot; tendency to all Indian Buddhist thought. It is no accident that one
    of the most important and influential philosophical schools of Indian Buddhism, the
    Yogacara, expounded an idealist ontology. For the Yogacara the only reality anything
    ultimately has is psychological. Yogacara thought is essentially a product of and a
    continuation of an Abhidharmic way of thinking; it gives explicit expression in systematic
    and philosophical form to a tendency that runs through the whole of Buddhist thought. The
    Theravadin Abhidhamma tends to sidestep the issue of the ultimate ontological status of
    the external world and the world of matter; the question is never explicitly raised. Yet
    for the Theravadin Abhidhamma--and as I understand it this would also be true of the
    Vaibhasika Abhidharma--the physical world each being lives in and experiences is one that
    is the result of his or her past kamma performed by deed, word, and thought; regardless of
    the ultimate ontological status of the external world and the world of matter, the
    particular physical sensations that beings experience are constructed mentally insofar as
    each one is the result of past kamma. In technical Abhidhamma terms our basic experience
    of the physical world is encompassed by just ten classes of sense-sphere consciousness
    that are the results (vipaka) of twelve unskillful and eight skillful classes of
    sense-sphere consciousnesses: what we thought in the past has created the world we live in
    and experience in the present; what we think in the present will create the world we shall
    live in in the future. (78) Or, as Dhammapada (vv. 1-2) famously put it, &quot;dhammas
    have mind as their forerunner, mind as preeminent, mind as their maker&quot;
    (&quot;manopubbamgama dhamma manosettha manomaya&quot;). That is, Indian Buddhist thought
    is in unanimous agreement that ultimately the particular world each of us experiences is
    something that we individually and collectively have created by our thoughts. The parallel
    that exists in Buddhist thought between cosmology and psychology is simply a reflection of
    this basic fact of the Abhidharma understanding of the nature of existence. Indologists
    are familiar with the Upanisadic interiorization of the Vedic sacrificial ritual; students
    of Hindu and Buddhist Tantra take for granted the correspondences that are made between
    the body of the yogin and the universe as microcosm and macrocosm respectively. (79) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yet the similarities between this and certain ways and
    patterns of thinking found in early and Abhidharmic Buddhist thought are rarely recognized
    in the existing scholarly literature. These similarities consist in the general tendency
    to assimilate some kind of internal world to an external world, and in the principle that
    places mind and psychology--the way the world is experienced--first. The assimilation of
    cosmology and psychology found in early Buddhist thought and developed in the Abhidharma
    must be seen in this context to be fully understood and appreciated. I can do no better
    than to finish with the words of the Buddha: That the end of the world . . . is to be
    known, seen or reached by travelling--that I do not say. . . . And yet I do not say that
    one makes an end of suffering without reaching the end of the world. Rather, in this
    fathom-long body, with its consciousness and mind, I declare the world, the arising of the
    world, the ceasing of the world and the way leading to the ceasing of the world. (80) </font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">APPENDIX B </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">HOW OLD IS BUDDHIST COSMOLOGY? A NOTE ON THE AGGANNA-SUTTA
    </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The writings of a number of scholars seem to imply that
    the Nikaya cosmology should not be attributed to the Buddha himself. Konrad Meisig,
    continuing the work of Ulrich Schneider, argues that the account of the evolution of the
    world and human society introduced by the formula I quoted at the start of this article
    should not be regarded as forming part of the &quot;original&quot; Agganna-sutta. (81)
    Schneider's and Meisig's arguments are complex and involved but appear to me to be neither
    individually nor collectively conclusive. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fact remains that the cosmogonic myth forms a
    significant part of all four versions of the text that Meisig examines; in other words, we
    have no hard evidence of an Agganna-sutta--or whatever its &quot;original&quot;
    title--without the cosmogonic myth. On the other hand, we do have some hard evidence for
    the cosmogonic myth apart from the Agganna-sutta. (82) Even when it is not accepted as
    forming part of an &quot;original&quot; Agganna-sutta, it must be acknowledged that the
    tradition it represents is well attested. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The whole notion of an original version of a sutta raises
    interesting questions. The kind of model with which Meisig would seem to be working
    regards the original Agganna-sutta as a discourse delivered by the Buddha himself on one
    particular occasion (at Savatthi since all versions are agreed in locating it there?),
    which was remembered by his followers and for a while handed down faithfully by them,
    until someone or some group still in the pre-Asokan period appended to it a cosmogonic
    myth. (83) But this kind of model is perhaps inappropriate to the composition and
    transmission of oral literature and may also be historically naive. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A more appropriate general model for an original sutta
    might be of a &quot;text&quot; representing the substance of a discourse or teaching that
    the Buddha himself may have given on a number of different occasions and which in part at
    least draws on a stock of images and formulas which the Buddha himself employed in a
    variety of contexts as he considered appropriate. Whether or not the Buddha himself
    composed his teachings in this way, it is clear that someone started doing so at some
    point, since many of the discourses of the Pali Nikayas and Chinese Agamas are manifestly
    put together in this way. This, however, is a matter that needs more systematic research.
    It may well be that Schneider's and Meisig's analysis goes some way to revealing the
    blocks of tradition which have been put together to form the Agganna-sutta; but to expose
    these blocks of tradition does not of itself tell us anything about who put them together
    and when. In the end, Schneider's and Meisig's understanding of the original Agganna-sutta
    amounts to a judgment about how well the blocks of tradition have been put together; their
    view is that they have been put together badly and that the two basic parts of the
    discourse are ill-fitting. Yet even if we agree with this judgment, the bare fact that a
    sutta is badly put together does not of itself preclude the possibility that it is the
    original work of the Buddha; a claim that the Buddha cannot possibly have made such a mess
    of it is an appeal to the transcendent notion of Buddhahood rather than a conclusive
    historical argument. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To say that the Agganna-sutta is composed of two parts
    must surely be largely uncontroversial. Clearly paragraphs 1-9 and 27-32 do form something
    of a unity and could intelligibly stand on their own; again, the cosmogonic myth of
    paragraphs 10-26 is an intelligible unit such that the Buddhist tradition itself
    abstracted portions of it to be used outside this context. But it seems to me purely
    arbitrary to pick on the first as original and relegate the second to the status of later
    interpolation. One might just as well argue the Buddha originally gave a discourse
    consisting of a cosmogonic myth that was later wrapped up in an ethical disquisition on
    the four classes (vanna) by certain of his followers who did not appreciate myth. This
    reveals what one suspects might be the true basis for the conclusion that it is the
    section of the Agganna-sutta concerned with the four classes that constitute the original
    sutta: the &quot;ethical&quot; portion of the discourse is to be preferred to the
    &quot;mythic&quot; precisely because it is ethical, and, as we all know, the earliest
    Buddhist teachings were simple, ethical teachings, unadulterated by myth and superstition;
    we know that early Buddhist teaching was like this because of the evidence of the rest of
    the canon. Here the argument becomes one of classic circularity: we arrive at a particular
    view about the nature of early Buddhism by ignoring portions of the canon and then use
    that view to argue for the lateness of the portions of the canon we have ignored. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Richard Gombrich has countered the Schneider/Meisig view
    of the Agganna-sutta by arguing that the two parts of the discourse have been skillfully
    put together and that the cosmogonic myth works as an integral part of the discourse taken
    as a whole. (84) According to Gombrich the first half of the discourse introduces the
    problem of the relative status of brahmanas and suddas; this question is then dealt with
    in a tongue-in-cheek satirical manner by the Aganna myth. Gombrich regards the overall
    form of the Agganna-sutta as we have it as attributable to the Buddha himself and thus
    original. But for Gombrich the text is &quot;primarily satirical and parodistic in
    intent,&quot; although in time the jokes were lost on its readers and the myth came to be
    misunderstood by Buddhist tradition &quot;as being a more or less straight-faced account
    of how the universe, and in particular society, originated.&quot; (85) Following Gombrich,
    Steven Collins has discussed the Agganna Sutta in some detail as a &quot;humorous
    parable,&quot; finding in certain of its phrases echoes of Vinaya formulas. (86)
    Gombrich's arguments for the essential unity of the Agganna text as we have it are
    extremely persuasive, yet I would disagree with the implication that we should regard the
    mythic portions of the Agganna-sutta as solely satirical. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Certainly it seems to me that Gombrich must be right in
    arguing that there is a good deal of intended humor in the Agganna-sutta, and certainly I
    would not want to argue that the cosmogonic myth was never intended to be understood as
    literal history in the modern sense. How could it have been? Yet it still seems to me
    unlikely that, for the original compiler (s) of and listeners to the discourse, the mythic
    portion of the sutta could have been intended to be understood or actually understood in
    its entirety as a joke at the expense of the poor old brahanas. As Gombrich so rightly
    says, if we want to discover the original meaning of the Buddha's discourses we need to
    understand the intellectual and cultural presuppositions shared by the Buddha and his
    audience. While in absolute terms this is an impossible task, since we can never entirely
    escape our own intellectual and cultural presuppositions and be reborn in the world of the
    Buddha--at least in the short term--we can still surely make some progress in trying to
    rediscover that world. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The question I would therefore ask is, Do we have any
    particular historical reasons for supposing that it is unlikely that the Buddha should
    have recounted a more or less straight-faced cosmogonic myth? My answer is that we do not.
    Indeed, I want to argue the opposite: what we can know of the cultural milieu in which the
    Buddha operated and in which the first Buddhist texts were composed suggests that someone
    such as the Buddha might very well have presented the kind of myth contained in the
    Agganna-sutta as something more than merely a piece of satire. Far from being out of key
    with what we can understand of early Buddhist thought from the rest of the Nikayas, the
    cosmogonic views offered by the Agganna-sutta in fact harmonize extremely well with it. I
    would go further and say that something along the lines of what is contained in the
    Agganna myth is actually required by the logic of what is generally accepted as Nikaya
    Buddhism. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It might be countered that the Buddha's refusal to answer
    categorically certain questions--including questions about whether or not the world was
    eternal and infinite--indicates that the Buddha was not interested in metaphysical
    questions and instructed his monks not to waste their energy on them. The account of the
    world on a cosmic scale found in the Agganna-sutta is then to be seen as not in keeping
    with the spirit of the Buddha's instructions and therefore as the creation of curious
    bhikkhus who, unable to restrain their imaginations, ignored the express instructions of
    their teacher. Such an outlook both misunderstands the nature of the, usually, ten
    &quot;undetermined questions&quot; and misrepresents the Agganna-sutta. This sutta does
    not expressly answer the question of whether or not the world is eternal and infinite, and
    as Steven Collins has argued, the real reason for the refusal to give a categorical answer
    to the questions is that they are, from the standpoint of Buddhist thought, linguistically
    ill-formed. (87) Thus it is not because the Buddha does not know the answer to these
    questions that he refuses to answer them but because the terms employed in the questions
    have in the Buddhist view of things no ultimate referent: it simply does not make sense to
    ask whether the world is eternal or not because there is no one &quot;thing&quot; to which
    the word world refers. The notion &quot;world&quot; is just like the notion
    &quot;self&quot;: it is not of itself an ultimately real thing but merely a concept, a
    mental construct. The ten undetermined questions thus, it seems to me, have no direct
    bearing on the cosmological ideas expounded in the Agganna-sutta. </font></p>
