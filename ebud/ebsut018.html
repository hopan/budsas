This is the second article in the series about the Vinaya, the
body of monastic rules and traditions binding on every Buddhist
monk and nun. In this article I will be concerned with the controversial
issue of a monk's or nun's dealings with money.
<P>
The issue has been controversial for over 2,000 years. Around
200 years after the Buddha's final passing away, there arose a
great quarrel in which "both endless disputations arose and of
not one speech was the meaning clear" [1].
This dispute arose because a large community of monks were accepting
money in defiance of the Vinaya. The proceedings of the dispute
became known as the Second Council and it sowed the seed of the
first great schism in the Buddhist world, which happened soon
after.
<P>
Then, as now, there is no excuse for uncertainty on this point,
for the Buddha's own words make it plain...
<P>

<P>
Buddhist monks (bhikkhus) and nuns (bhikkhunis) are not allowed
to accept money for themselves. Nor are they allowed to tell a
trustworthy layperson to receive it on their behalf and keep it
for them (e.g. keeping a personal bank account). Such practices
are explicitly prohibited in the 18th rule of the section of Vinaya
called Nissaggiya Pacittiya.
<P>
Nor may monks or nuns buy and sell things for themselves using
money. This is prohibited by the 19th rule in the Nissaggiya Pacittiya.
<P>
Some people argue that these two rules refer only to gold and
silver but such a view is indefensible. The Vinaya specifically
states that these rules cover "whatever is used in business" [2], i.e. any medium of exchange.
<P>
Other people try to get around this rule by saying that it is
only a minor rule, inapplicable to monastic life today. Indeed,
the Buddha once did say that the Sangha may abolish the "lesser
and minor" rules.
<P>
But is this rule a minor one?...
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>'Monks, there are these four stains because of which the sun and
moon glow not, shine not, blaze not. What are these four? Rain
clouds... snow clouds... smoke and dust... and an eclipse. Even
so, monks, there are these four stains because of which monks
and priests glow not, shine not, blaze not. What are these four?
Drinking alcohol... indulging in sexual intercourse... accepting
gold or money... obtaining one's requisites through a wrong mode
of livelihood. These are the four stains, monks, because of which
monks and priests glow not, shine not, blaze not.' [3]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Obviously, the Buddha thought that the rule prohibiting the acceptance
of gold or money was, indeed, a very important rule.
<P>
The non-acceptance of money has always been one of the fundamental
observances of those who have left the world. Money is the measure
of wealth and to most people material wealth is the goal of life.
In the renunciation of money by monks and nuns, they emphatically
demonstrate their complete rejection of worldly pursuits. At one
stroke they set themselves significantly apart from the vast majority
of people and thus become a constant reminder to all that a life
based on the struggle to accumulate money is not the only way
to live. Through giving up money they give up much of their power
to manipulate the world and to satisfy their desires. Thus, as
the Buddha once said when asked whether money was permissible
to the monks and nuns:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>'Whoever agrees to gold or money, headman, also agrees to the
five strands of sensual pleasure, and whoever agrees to the five
strands of sensual pleasure, headman, you may take it for certain
that this is not the way of a recluse, that this is not the way
of a Buddhist monk.'[4]</BLOCKQUOTE>
