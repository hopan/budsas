    <td width="100%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>his sutta [Ud. iv i,
    AN ix i 3], which appears twice in the Pali canon, tells of a young monk, the Venerable
    Meghiya, who was the Buddha's attendant. This bhikkhu, returning from alms round one
    morning, spotted a beautiful and delightful mango grove. He felt this would be the ideal
    place to practise meditation, so he asked the Buddha if he might go there for the day's
    meditation. The Buddha responded by asking him to wait until another monk came to carry
    out his duties as attendant. However, the Venerable Meghiya was eager to go and persisted
    in his request: </font><p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&quot;The Lord has nothing
    further that should be done, and nothing to add to what has been done, but for me there is
    something further to be done and something to add to what has been done.&quot;</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After the third such request, the Buddha agreed: <i>&quot;Do
    now, Meghiya, as you think fit.&quot;</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So Meghiya went to the mango grove and finding a suitable
    shady spot, sat down, his back erect and began his meditation. But for the whole time his
    mind was filled with unskillful thoughts - of sensuality, malevolence and cruelty. This
    was a source of surprise and consternation. He had gone forth, full of faith and
    aspiration; he had found for himself what seemed like the perfect situation for practice,
    and was making enormous effort - but it was all going wrong, it was not bringing the
    results he had anticipated or hoped for. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the end of what must have been a very difficult
    afternoon, he returned to the Buddha to tell him of his troubles. It seems that the Buddha
    was not at all surprised when he heard what what had happened. (In fact, the commentary
    suggests that the Buddha had refused permission for him to go, knowing that he was not yet
    ready to practise in this way.) He then listed the five conditions that, when the heart's
    deliverance is not yet ripe, conduce to its ripening: </font><ol>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Good friends, </font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Virtuous life, </font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Profitable talk, </font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Zealous exertion, </font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Insight into impermanence, which leads to the ending of
        ill. </font></li>
    </ol>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Four other things, he said, should also be developed <i>bhavetabba</i>:
    </font><dl>
      <dt><font face="Times New Roman">1. Meditation on the unlovely (repulsive or loathsome): </font></dt>
      <dd><font face="Times New Roman">For the abandonment of passion (lust or greed); </font></dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt><font face="Times New Roman">2. Kindliness </font></dt>
      <dd><font face="Times New Roman">For the abandonment of ill will. </font></dd>
      <dt><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></dt>
      <dt><font face="Times New Roman">3. Mindfulness of in and out breathing anapanasati </font></dt>
      <dd><font face="Times New Roman">For cutting off discursive thinking. </font></dd>
      <dt><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></dt>
      <dt><font face="Times New Roman">4. The contemplation of impermanence aniccasanna </font></dt>
      <dd><font face="Times New Roman">To uproot the pride of egoism: </font></dd>
      <dd><font face="Times New Roman">`For one who thinks on impermanence, the thought of
        not-self is established; thinking on there being no self, one wins to the state wherein
        the conceit &quot;I am&quot; has been uprooted, to the cool nibbana even in this life' </font></dd>
    </dl>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We can take a closer took at these.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Firstly, good friends - <i>kalyanamitta hoti
    kalyanasampavanko</i>: This is usually taken to mean having a wise teacher or wise
    spiritual companions. This would certainly be appropriate in this context: the Buddha
    advising the young monk on the importance of being with people who can influence him in a
    wholesome way. However, the word <i>hoti</i>, means <i>he is</i>, so a more literal
    translation might be: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>He is a friend, an intimate of what is good or
    wholesome</i>. This points to the need for any type of spiritual endeavour to be motivated
    by a sense of what is right, a love of the good, and a yearning to manifest that in one's
    life. Whereas, practice motivated by selfishness - the desire to gain power, prestige, or
    to take advantage of others - would bring, instead of release, a sense of being
    increasingly trapped in the world of one's own self seeking - <i>samsara</i>. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha explains that having a wise advisor, good
    friends or simply a love of the good, is the natural basis for the arising of the other
    conditions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, secondly: <i>It may be expected of one who has wise
    companions that he will be virtuous</i> - <i>silava hoti</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We learn by example. In Sangha life, although there is the
    formal training in vinaya, most of our learning and inspiration comes simply through
    watching how others do things: their manner of behaviour, what they say (or don't say),
    and when and how they say it. Associating with people following a similar precept form
    stimulates an interest in this training of body, speech and mind; we are further
    encouraged by the results it brings. So the full translation for the second condition:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">- <i>a monk is virtuous, he abides restrained by the
    restraint of the obligations; he is perfect in the practice of right behaviour, sees
    danger in trifling faults and trains himself in the ways of training.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thirdly: Profitable talk. The sutta states that such talk
    arises easily, and that there is a willingness to share one's understanding with others;
    it arises naturally, according to the way one is living the life. This talk is described
    as being that which is <br>
    <i>serious and suitable for opening up the heart, and conduces to a complete turning away
    from worldly values - nibbidaya; to dispassion, ending, calm, comprehension, to perfect
    insight, to Nibbana. That is to say, talk about wanting little; contentment; solitude;
    avoiding society; putting forth effort; virtue, concentration and wisdom; about release
    and the knowledge and insight of release.</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The company of wise friends who are at ease in themselves
    dispels any sense of having to repress or deny inclinations that do not accord with these
    guidelines; to see that it is not a matter of forcing oneself into a puritanical kind of
    `holiness', but that these qualities arise naturally as the practice matures. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fourth condition is zealous exertion: <i>[One abides]
    resolute in energy for the abandoning of unprofitable things and for taking up what is
    profitable - stout and strong in effort, not giving up on what one has undertaken (not
    relinquishing the burden of righteousness.</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Again, a wise teacher or good friend, can encourage us and
    guide our efforts towards what is wholesome. Inevitably, on a religious path there are
    times when the practice seems dull, lifeless, or totally unproductive. There may be an
    inclination to abandon the whole thing and to return to look for refuge in the world, in
    what is familiar and seems comfortable. A wise teacher and good friends remind us of our
    deeper aspiration and potential, and of the inherent danger or unsatisfactoriness of the
    world of the senses. This enables us to continue on towards our goal. Practising together
    we, in a sense, carry one another when there is faltering - just through doing the
    practice to the best of our ability. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Fifthly: <i>a monk is possessed of insight, and
    understands the way of growth and decay, having Ariyan penetration concerning the way to
    the utter destruction of Ill</i>.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We need to be reminded of where to look to find our
    freedom. It is not in the attainment of some special state in the future, although such
    states can be the basis for insight, but right in this moment itself. The late Ajahn
    Buddhadasa used to say: &quot;Nothing whatsoever is to be clung to!&quot; It's an insight
    that's so subtle that we can easily miss it. Our longing for security and the power of our
    conditioning are so strong that we can dismiss this key to the door of the Deathless; we
    are bound by ignorance, nescience - not seeing, not wanting to look, until it is too late.
    So we need every encouragement to keep looking, to keep remembering, in order to find that
    point of non-attachment - which is not a rejection of anything at all but, rather, a
    proper appreciation of our human predicament. Some pick it up quickly (according to the
    commentary, the Venerable Meghiya attained to stream entry just on hearing this teaching)
    for others, the lessons need much repetition. We are caught by some desire - a plan, an
    idea, a regret or a grudge - it hurts, and eventually we let go. This happens over and
    over again, until finally we learn not to pick things up, not to attach to anything at
    all. The beauty of Nature is in its transitoriness - not in anything lasting that one can
    claim as one's own. The Buddha, through his own efforts, awakened to this reality, which
    freed him from having to <i>trudge and travel through this long round - samsara.</i> This
    is the insight, as he explained to the Venerable Meghiya, that can free us all from the
    pain of attachment. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha concludes by outlining techniques of meditation
    which should be cultivated in response to specific conditions that may arise in the mind.
    This responsiveness itself is important to consider. We are not asked to simply work away
    at developing one particular type of meditation practice. The encouragement is to be aware
    of what is happening in the mind at any time, and to exercise intelligence in choosing the
    technique suitable to bring about and support a state of calm, in order that wisdom may
    arise. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So we have: </font><ol>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Meditation on the unlovely <i>asubha</i> for overcoming
        states of passion, lust or greed. <br>
        Sometimes this is translated as meditation on loathsomeness or repulsiveness - which can
        indeed be the case with certain aspects of physicality. However, sometimes a more
        analytical approach can be effective in inducing a sense of disinterest, or neutrality, as
        opposed to actual aversion - which is actually just another form of desire. For example,
        there is the contemplation that monks and nuns are given at the time of Going Forth - hair
        of the head, hair of the body, nails, teeth and skin - which is a way of dismantling the
        illusion of physical beauty or attractiveness of another person. Contemplating objects in
        terms of the elements that comprise them: earth, water, fire and air can be helpful in
        cooling the passion or interest with things like food; looking at the form, colour or
        texture, rather than automatically absorbing into the anticipation of something to be
        consumed, or delighting in the smell or taste of it. <br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">For dealing with ill will or malevolence, the practice of
        kindliness or well wishing <i>metta</i> is recommended.<br>
        This does not mean that we have to like everybody, but at least to avoid allowing the mind
        to linger in states of negativity or aversion towards them.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">The third meditation is mindfulness of in and out breathing
        <i>anapanasati</i>. <br>
        The Buddha recommended this universally as a way of focussing the mind in the present;
        gathering attention onto the breath, rather than being whirled around, pulled to and fro
        by distracting thoughts.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">The fourth contemplation is of impermanence. <br>
        One way to approach this is by careful attention to how we experience `ourselves' and
        others in each moment. This pierces the illusion of a fixed and enduring personality that
        is in any way related to body or mind; there is simply awareness. </font></li>
    </ol>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These four meditation exercises need to be developed
    continually in order for the deeply rooted habits, which have arisen because of our
    ignorance, to be transformed. But, as the Buddha pointed out to the Venerable Meghiya, the
    ripening of the heart's emancipation will arise quite naturally when the five conditions
    are there as a basis for our practice. </font></p>

    <hr width="25%" align="center">
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was
    staying among the Calikans, at <a NAME="calika">Calika Mountain</a>. At that time <a
    NAME="meghiya">Ven. Meghiya</a> was his attendant. Then Ven. Meghiya went to the Blessed
    One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, stood to one side. As he was standing there
    he said to the Blessed One, &quot;I would like to go into <a NAME="jantu">Jantu Village</a>
    for alms.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then do, Meghiya, what you think it is now time to
    do.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then in the early morning, Ven. Meghiya, having put on his
    robes and carrying his bowl and outer robe, went into Jantu Village for alms. Having gone
    for alms in Jantu Village, after the meal, returning from his alms round, he went to the
    banks of the <a NAME="kimikala">Kimikala River</a>. As he was walking along the banks of
    the river to exercise his legs, he saw a pleasing, charming mango grove. Seeing it, the
    thought occurred to him: &quot;How pleasing and charming is this mango grove! It's an
    ideal place for a young man of good family intent on exertion to exert himself in
    meditation. If the Blessed One gives me permission, I would like to exert myself in
    meditation in this mango grove.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So Ven. Meghiya went to the Blessed One and, on arrival,
    having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed
    One, &quot;Just now, in the early morning, having put on my robes and carrying my bowl and
    outer robe, I went into Jantu Village for alms. Having gone for alms in Jantu Village,
    after the meal, returning from my alms round, I went to the banks of the Kimikala River.
    As I was walking along the banks of the river to exercise my legs, I saw a pleasing,
    charming mango grove. Seeing it, the thought occurred to me: 'How pleasing and charming is
    this mango grove! It's an ideal place for a young man of good family intent on exertion to
    exert himself in meditation. If the Blessed One gives me permission, I would like to exert
    myself in meditation in this mango grove.' If the Blessed One gives me permission, I would
    like to go to the mango grove to exert myself in meditation.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When this was said, the Blessed One responded to Ven.
    Meghiya, &quot;As long as I am still alone, stay here until another monk comes.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A second time, Ven. Meghiya said to the Blessed One,
    &quot;Lord, the Blessed One has nothing further to do, and nothing further to add to what
    he has done. I, however, have something further to do, and something further to add to
    what I have done. If the Blessed One gives me permission, I would like to go to the mango
    grove to exert myself in meditation.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A second time, the Blessed One responded to Ven. Meghiya,
    &quot;As long as I am still alone, stay here until another monk comes.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A third time, Ven. Meghiya said to the Blessed One,
    &quot;Lord, the Blessed One has nothing further to do, and nothing further to add to what
    he has done. I, however, have something further to do, and something further to add to
    what I have done. If the Blessed One gives me permission, I would like to go to the mango
    grove to exert myself in meditation.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;As you are talking about exertion, Meghiya, what can
    I say? Do what you think it is now time to do.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then Ven. Meghiya, rising from his seat, bowing down to
    the Blessed One and circling him to the right, went to the mango grove. On arrival, having
    gone deep into the grove, he sat down at the foot of a certain tree for the day's abiding.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now while Ven. Meghiya was staying in the mango grove, he
    was for the most part assailed by three kinds of unskillful thoughts: sensual thoughts,
    thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of doing harm. The thought occurred to him: &quot;How
    amazing! How awesome! Even though it was through faith that I went forth from home to the
    homeless life, still I am overpowered by these three kinds of unskillful thoughts: sensual
    thoughts, thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of doing harm.&quot; Emerging from his
    seclusion in the late afternoon, he went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed
    down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One,
    &quot;Just now, while I was staying in the mango grove, I was for the most part assailed
    by three kinds of unskillful thoughts: sensual thoughts, thoughts of ill will, and
    thoughts of doing harm. The thought occurred to me: 'How amazing! How awesome! Even though
    it was through faith that I went forth from home to the homeless life, still I am
    overpowered by these three kinds of unskillful thoughts: sensual thoughts, thoughts of ill
    will, and thoughts of doing harm.'&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Meghiya, in one whose release of awareness is still
    immature, five qualities bring it to maturity. Which five? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;There is the case where a monk has admirable people
    as friends, companions, and colleagues. In one whose release of awareness is still
    immature, this is the first quality that brings it to maturity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Furthermore, the monk is virtuous. He dwells
    restrained in accordance with the Patimokkha, consummate in his behavior and sphere of
    activity. He trains himself, having undertaken the training rules, seeing danger in the
    slightest faults. In one whose release of awareness is still immature, this is the second
    quality that brings it to maturity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Furthermore, he gets to hear at will, easily and
    without difficulty, talk that is truly sobering and conducive to the opening of awareness,
    i.e., talk on having few wants, on contentment, on seclusion, on non-entanglement, on
    arousing persistence, on virtue, on concentration, on discernment, on release, and on the
    knowledge and vision of release. In one whose release of awareness is still immature, this
    is the third quality that brings it to maturity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Furthermore, he keeps his persistence aroused for
    abandoning unskillful [mental] qualities and for taking on skillful qualities. He is
    steadfast, solid in his effort, not shirking his duties with regard to skillful qualities.
    In one whose release of awareness is still immature, this is the fourth quality that
    brings it to maturity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Furthermore, he is discerning, endowed with the
    discernment of arising and passing away -- noble, penetrating, leading to the right ending
    of stress. In one whose release of awareness is still immature, this is the fifth quality
    that brings it to maturity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Meghiya, when a monk has admirable people as
    friends, companions, and colleagues, it is to be expected that he will be virtuous, will
    dwell restrained in accordance with the Patimokkha, consummate in his behavior and sphere
    of activity, and will train himself, having undertaken the training rules, seeing danger
    in the slightest faults. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When a monk has admirable people as friends,
    companions, and colleagues, it is to be expected that he will get to hear at will, easily
    and without difficulty, talk that is truly sobering and conducive to the opening of
    awareness, i.e., talk on having few wants, on contentment, on seclusion, on
    non-entanglement, on arousing persistence, on virtue, on concentration, on discernment, on
    release, and on the knowledge and vision of release. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When a monk has admirable people as friends,
    companions, and colleagues, it is to be expected that he will keep his persistence aroused
    for abandoning unskillful qualities, and for taking on skillful qualities -- steadfast,
    solid in his effort, not shirking his duties with regard to skillful qualities. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When a monk has admirable people as friends,
    companions, and colleagues, it is to be expected that he will be discerning, endowed with
    discernment of arising and passing away -- noble, penetrating, leading to the right ending
    of stress. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And furthermore, when the monk is established in
    these five qualities, there are four additional qualities he should develop: He should
    develop [contemplation of] the unattractive so as to abandon lust. He should develop good
    will so as to abandon ill will. He should develop mindfulness of in-and-out breathing so
    as to cut off distractive thinking. He should develop the perception of inconstancy so as
    to uproot the conceit, 'I am.' For a monk perceiving inconstancy, the perception of
    not-self is made firm. One perceiving not-self attains the uprooting of the conceit, 'I
    am' -- Unbinding in the here and now.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed
    One on that occasion exclaimed: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Little thoughts, subtle thoughts,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when followed, stir up the heart.<br>
      Not comprehending the thoughts of the heart,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one runs here &amp; there,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the mind out of control.<br>
      But comprehending the thoughts of the heart,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one who is ardent, mindful,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; restrains them.<br>
      When, followed, they stir up the heart,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one who is awakened<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lets them go without trace. </font></p>
