      <TD WIDTH="100%"><B>Introduction</B><P>This booklet is written to beginner 
      meditators as well as for those who are more practiced in meditation. The 
      author is taking the instructions given in the oldest of the original 
      discourses <I>[suttas]</I> still in existence today. They may seem a 
      little different from other instructions that you have been given or read 
      in the past. But, rest assured, these instructions are what the Buddha 
      taught over 2500 years ago.</P>
      <P>These instructions include &#39;The Four Foundations of Mindfulness&#39; (in 
      Pali this is called <I>Satipatthana</I>), that is Mindfulness of the Body, 
      Mindfulness of Feeling, Mindfulness of Mind, and Mindfulness of Dhammas. 
      By practicing these meditation instructions given by the Buddha in this 
      sutta, the meditator will naturally experience the meditation stages 
      called <I>Jhana</I> (This is a Pali word that means a level or stage of 
      meditation).</P>
      <P>According to the original teaches of the Buddha, the &#39;Four Foundations 
      of Mindfulness&#39; and &#39;The Mindfulness of Breathing&#39; suttas are intimately 
      intertwined and dependent on each other. So, when the meditator practices 
      in this way, can then gain the insight, wisdom, tranquility and equanimity 
      needed to experience the ultimate goal of awakening called <I>Nibbana</I>.</P>
      <B>
      <P>What is meditation?</P>
      </B>
      <P>Meditation is one of those kinds of words that we all hear and it seems 
      to have different meanings for different people. When asked, some people 
      may practice meditation but, they can&#39;t explain exactly what it is they 
      do. So here is a definition of meditation that agrees with the Buddha&#39;s 
      instructions. Meditation is the skill in watching &quot;how&quot; mind moves. By 
      this I mean, when mind is very happy, peaceful and calm then all of a 
      sudden something happens and mind becomes sad, or anxious, or angry, &quot;How&quot; 
      did that happen? &quot;How&quot; did mind move from the happiness, peacefulness and 
      calm to becoming sad, anxious or angry? Meditation is being able to watch 
      how this happens, and then &quot;how&quot; to let go, without getting sad, anxious, 
      or angry. Meditation is the art of observation and relaxing.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Commentaries</P>
      </B>
      <P>The instructions given here may seem different from what may be taught 
      elsewhere. The reason is that over the years many scholars have written 
      about meditation. These writings are called commentaries.</P>
      <P>These commentaries are often written by people who have never practiced 
      meditation, but have studied exclusively. They didn&#39;t write about their 
      own direct experiential knowledge from practicing meditation, but would 
      talk to people who practiced many different types of meditation and copied 
      what was reported to them. These commentaries may have been very 
      convincing to the scholars, but when anyone compares them against what is 
      taught in the original texts, they can see a very big difference in the 
      instructions. Sometimes the commentaries completely leave out whole 
      sections of the instructions and sometimes they just go out on their own 
      and add what another style of meditation they think works, then gives them 
      as the proper instructions, as if they were given from the Buddha.</P>
      <P>Please understand that all styles of meditation are of real benefit to 
      anyone who practices regularly. But consider that just like looking at a 
      map, all roads don&#39;t lead to the same place. (there are many different 
      roads that may be taken, but they may not get to the desired destination.) 
      In the same way, when we go back to the discourses given by the Buddha 
      there is a map that leads directly to the cessation of all suffering, when 
      we follow it closely. This is the reason that the author has taken the 
      time and energy to go back to the original discourses <I>[suttas]</I> to 
      understand and practice meditation in the way that was originally taught. 
      Which was painstakingly researched by direct experience and studied for 
      many, many years.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Psychotherapy and Buddhist Meditation</P>
      </B>
      <P>Western psychology and psychotherapy differs from Buddhist meditation 
      and awareness in very subtle but obvious ways. This is not to say that 
      western psychology and psychotherapy are wrong and Buddhist meditation is 
      right.</P>
      <P>They both have their advantages and uses but the end results are quite 
      different. The roads on the map are different and lead to different 
      results. Western psychology and psychotherapy takes a person suffering 
      from mental imbalances and shows them how to live in a more balanced way. 
      Buddhist meditation takes a mentally balanced person and shows them how to 
      be fully awake, truly happy and free from all suffering.</P>
      <P>Psychology and psychotherapy deals entirely with thoughts and feelings, 
      then spends time analyzing them. The therapist helps the client to get 
      involved with the identification and content of the feelings or emotions. 
      This is when the psychologist talks about making the &quot;ego&quot; healthy.</P>
      <P>Whereas, in Buddhism we learn to see how the experiences we have are 
      nothing more than an ever-changing &quot;process&quot; (called dependent 
      origination). We learn that getting involved with these thoughts and 
      feelings personally, or taking them to be &quot;me or mine&quot;, is the cause of 
      great unhappiness and suffering. The ultimate goal of the Buddha&#39;s 
      teachings is to show us how to let go of any ideas about there being a 
      permanent &quot;self or ego&quot; that controls everything. The Buddhist meditator 
      learns to see all things in life as being simply part of a &quot;process&quot; 
      (dependent origination) that is ever-changing <I>(anicca)</I>, painful <I>
      (dukkha)</I> and impersonal <I>(anatta)</I>.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Why versus How</P>
      </B>
      <P>The goals of western psychology and psychotherapy and Buddhist 
      meditation work at solving the human conditions of suffering, but they are 
      quite unique and have extremely different end results. They both teach a 
      person to become more aware of thoughts and feelings, but as you can see 
      their perspectives are quite different.</P>
      <P>In other words, western psychology and psychotherapy places its focus 
      on observing past experiences and analyzes these experiences to find out 
      &quot;WHY&quot; it occurred. Then it shows a person how to live a healthy life by 
      dealing with these past occurrences. The therapist helps to teach an 
      unbalanced person to experience life in a more balanced or regular way. 
      Buddhism, on the other hand, puts its focus on observing experience and 
      seeing &quot;how&quot; the whole process of experience occurs through seeing 
      dependent origination and teaches us to understand that it is an 
      impersonal evolution. The key to Buddhist teachings deals with &quot;HOW&quot; this 
      process works. Whereas, western psychology deals with &quot;why&quot; these things 
      come up. Which is dealing mostly with concepts and the reasons for their 
      appearing.</P>
      <P>Buddhism shows how to develop our mind with pure, coherent awareness 
      and observation of every process (experience) as it arises and teaches us 
      to understand how to see more clearly. This is dealing directly with the 
      reality of observing exactly &quot;how&quot; things arise in the present moment. So 
      the Buddha&#39;s teachings are seen only as an impersonal process and not to 
      falsely identify with or get overly involved with this process by thinking 
      about it. The Buddha teaches us to see this whole experience and let go, 
      relax, then gently re-direct our attention back to the breath and 
      relaxing, without getting involved with and wrongly identifying with the 
      content of those thoughts and feelings. Or we could say, we learn to see 
      everything as an impersonal experience to be seen, not to get involved 
      with or take this process as being a personal self or ego.</P>
      <P>These two different types of perspective have different goals and 
      objectives. Their separate approaches can bring happiness and balance into 
      our life. The Buddhist approach tends to go beyond ordinary types of 
      awareness and it leads us to see how to let go of all ego-identification 
      so we can truly see and experience the ultimate goal, which is the 
      complete cessation of all suffering.</P>
      <P>When a person takes the time and energy to practice meditation in this 
      way, they will begin to see and understand for themselves just why the 
      Buddha&#39;s path is such an amazing way of experiencing the world around 
      them. The Buddha proclaimed that &quot;We are the Happy One&#39;s&quot; . Doing the 
      meditation that is written in this booklet, you will see why for yourself.</P>
      <B>
      <P><I>Anapanasati Sutta</I></P>
      </B>
      <P>The actual instructions given in the discourse called <I>&quot;The 
      Anapanasati Sutta&quot;</I> are only one paragraph long but the explanation 
      will take a bit more space. These instructions are word for word, letter 
      for letter repeated in other discourses<I> [suttas]</I> as well. For 
      example, they are in the &quot;The Four Foundations of Mindfulness&quot; <I>
      [Satipatthana Sutta]</I> and the &quot;Mindfulness of the Body&quot; <I>
      [Kayagatasati Sutta]</I> discourses as well, to name just a couple.</P>
      <P>As you read these instructions and give them a try, you will begin to 
      see and understand how mind works, which is a very exciting and fun 
      experience. Also, if you have practiced other styles of meditation, you 
      will notice that things like headaches, vertigo, or ringing in the ears, 
      won&#39;t occur anymore.</P>
      <P>This meditation practice is not only about sitting as still as a statue 
      and doing a quiet type of meditation but it is very helpful in all daily 
      activities that we have to do during our everyday lives.</P>
      <P>Please follow these instructions as closely as possible for the best 
      results and progress. Also, it is best to do only one meditation at a 
      time, because mind is fickle and will jump around when there are different 
      types of meditation being practiced at the same time. It can become 
      confusing as to which meditation to practice then the meditator tries 
      doing one type and when it doesn&#39;t seem right the meditator jumps to 
      another type of meditation, as a result, they wind up not doing any real 
      meditation at all.</P>
      <P>So, please prepare yourself for a very pleasant journey to the 
      cessation of suffering.</P>

      </I></B>
      <P>There will be some Pali words introduced into this instruction and the 
      author will try to make these words understandable in English for the 
      readers. This discourse is taken from the <I>&quot;Anapanasati Sutta&quot;, 
      &#39;Anapana&#39;</I> is a Pali word meaning in breathing and out breathing. <I>
      &#39;Sati&#39; </I>means mindfulness, watchfulness or observation power. So, the 
      meaning of <I>&quot;anapanasati&quot;</I> means watchfulness of the in breathing and 
      out breathing. The Pali word <I>&quot;Sutta&quot;</I> means &#39;thread&#39;. So whenever we 
      see the word <I>&#39;sutta&#39;</I> it is another thread that is woven with other 
      &#39;suttas&#39; and together they make a very beautiful cloth of <I>&#39;Dhamma&#39;</I> 
      [many people use the Sanskrit word <I>&#39;Dharma&#39;</I>, instead. they have 
      exactly the same meaning but the author prefers to use the Pali 
      pronunciation] <I>&#39;Dhamma&#39;</I> is another Pali word that has many 
      different meanings some of which are truth, the way things are, the 
      Buddha&#39;s teachings, the true nature of things, etc.</P>
      <P>This <I>sutta</I> [thread] is taken from the <I>&quot;The Anapanasati Sutta&quot;</I> 
      and will be given in bold letters and underlined. There will be an 
      explanation given in regular type after each section.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>[16] &quot;And how, monks, is mindfulness of breathing developed and 
      cultivated, so that it is of great fruit and great benefit?</P>
      <P>[17] &quot;Here a monk, gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an 
      empty hut, sits down; having folded his legs crosswise, set his body 
      erect, and establishes mindfulness in front of him, ever mindful he 
      breathes in, mindful he breathes out.</P>
      </B></I>
      <P>These are the preparatory stages of the meditation. It basically means 
      for the meditator to find a quiet place to sit with little or no 
      distractions. Turn off the TV, radio or telephone and find a place that 
      has very few noises which will pull you away from the sitting. For the 
      beginning meditator noises can turn into a big distraction and can pull 
      one&#39;s attention away from watching the breath and relaxing. After the 
      meditator becomes more familiar with this practice, noises won&#39;t really be 
      a bother anymore. They just become a part of the meditation practice.</P>
      <P>The next part says to sit with the legs folded crosswise. But the 
      author has found that many people in this country are not used to sitting 
      on the oor with their legs crossed. When they try, it can cause a lot of 
      pain to arise. The meditator can sit on a cushion or if they prefer they 
      can sit on a chair [as long as they don&#39;t lean into the back rest]. Some 
      meditation teachers want their students to sit in what is called a &quot;full 
      or half lotus&quot; position, but it really isn&#39;t necessary. There is no magic 
      in sitting on the floor and twisting the legs into a pretzel. A 
      comfortable sitting posture where the legs don&#39;t go to sleep is best.</P>
      <P>The reason that the Buddha recommended sitting on the floor is at the 
      time he was alive they didn&#39;t use chairs, so everyone sat on the floor and 
      they were used to it. But, in our culture, we hardly ever sit on the oor, 
      so our bodies are not used to it. Also, it may take quite a long time to 
      become used to sitting on the oor in a comfortable way. It can even be a 
      painful experience for a long time before the legs get limber enough to be 
      comfortable.</P>
      <P>It is the meditator&#39;s choice whether they sit on the floor or not. When 
      sitting in meditation it is best to sit with the back nicely straight, 
      with one vertebrae stacked on the other. Please don&#39;t sit in a rigid way 
      where the back is overly straight as this can cause unnecessary pain and 
      back problems to arise. Contrary to what many people think, pain is not 
      the point of the meditation and nothing is further from the truth. 
      Watching mind move and seeing how it goes from one thing to another is 
      what meditation is all about. Please sit with the legs in a comfortable 
      position and have the back nicely straight.</P>
      <P>Now is when the actual instructions begin.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>[18] &quot;Breathing in long, he understands: &#39;I breathe in long&#39;; or 
      breathing out long, he understands: &#39;I breathe out long&#39;: Breathing in 
      short, he understands: &#39;I breathe in short&#39;; breathing out short, he 
      understands: &#39;I breathe out short&#39;.</P>
      </B></I>
      <P>The key words here are &quot;He understands&quot;, it doesn&#39;t say anything about 
      placing your attention on the nostril tip or the abdomen. The instructions 
      don&#39;t say to count the breaths, nor do they say anything about following 
      the breath around in the body from the nostril tip to the throat to the 
      lungs to the abdomen and back again. The instructions simply say to 
      &quot;understand&quot; what the breath is doing in the present moment, They never 
      mention focusing one&#39;s attention in any one place. All that these 
      instructions say is the &quot;He/she understands when they breathe in and out 
      long or short. So where does one put their attention? The answer is &#39;One 
      Understands&#39; when breath is long or short, they understand when breath is 
      fine or coarse, they understand when breath is fast or slow. In other 
      words the meditator knows what the breath is doing in the present moment. 
      The meditator doesn&#39;t need to focus on any one place or follow it from one 
      place to another. They only have to understand the general characteristics 
      of what the breath is doing. Let us continue on:</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>He trains thus: &#39;I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body&#39;; <BR>
      He trains thus: &#39;I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body. <BR>
      He trains thus: &#39;I shall breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formation&#39;:
      <BR>
      He trains thus: &#39;I shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation&#39;.</P>
      </B></I>
      <P>Now, we get to the part where the real instructions abide. When the 
      instructions says &#39;He trains thus&#39; the meditator begins to train their 
      mind to become more observant, so they see their whole physical body on 
      the in breath and out breath. The meditator NEVER tries to control their 
      breath in any way! They just let body breathe naturally. They notice where 
      body has tightness or tension in it. On the in breath notice when there is 
      tightness in the muscle of the shoulders or back or hands, etc. And do the 
      same on the out breath.</P>
      <P>This, is the most important part of the meditation and that is to relax 
      those tight muscles consciously and do this on the in breath and the out 
      breath.</P>
      <P>An interesting observation about the people in this country is, that 
      they think the whole body starts at the neck then goes down, while from 
      the neck up is a part of mind. This is a wrong perception that needs to be 
      addressed. The whole body starts at the top of the head and goes down from 
      there. When noticing any tightness or tension, the first place that needs 
      to be observed is in the head. Every thought, every movement of mind 
      begins with a subtle tightness or tension arising in the head. Meditators 
      need to be aware of this and relax on the in breath and relax on the out 
      breath. The meditator uses the breath as a reminder to relax.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Smiling</P>
      </B>
      <P>Once the meditator begins to meditate, first softly close the eyes, 
      then put a little smile in the mind, a little smile in the eyes, even 
      though the eyes are closed, put a little smile on the lips and a smile in 
      the heart.</P>
      <P>Having a smile is a very important part of the meditation! There have 
      been some studies done on the corners of the mouth. When the corners of 
      the mouth go down, mind has a tendency to be heavy, rigid and unhappy. So 
      at that time, mind tends to be sluggish and can become stiff and it moves 
      very slowly. But when the corners of the mouth go up mind tends to be 
      happy and have uplifting thoughts. Then mind tends to be lighter and more 
      uid in watching. Joy is one of the enlightenment factors and smiling leads 
      the meditator to this joy. Just look at a good Buddha image and see the 
      smile. The artist is showing us that this should be a joyful experience. 
      This is definitely a smiling meditation!</P>
      <P>On the in-breath, relax the tightness in the body [especially the 
      head]... smile. On the out-breath... relax... smile... in-breath... 
      relax... smile... outbreath... relax.. smile. When relaxing feel mind kind 
      of open up and expand, like a hand does when it opens up after it was 
      holding onto something, then, at that time, mind becomes very calm and 
      clear. It is like mind takes a tiny step down from where it was. This open 
      calm mind has no thoughts in it, there is only a pure awareness, that is 
      exceptionally alert and bright. The meditator stays with the breath and 
      relaxing as much as possible, without grabbing onto or trying to control 
      anything. Just observe, and relax. This is the simplest and most fun 
      meditation to practice, that the author has ever seen or experienced.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Arising thoughts</P>
      </B>
      <P>Many people think that when they are &quot;meditating&quot;, mind is not 
      &quot;supposed&quot; to have thoughts in it. But this is not the case. Especially at 
      the beginning mind will run all over the place and think about this and 
      think about that. &quot;AND&quot; that is alright!</P>
      <P>Thoughts are not the enemy to push down, stop or fight with. Thoughts 
      are just thoughts, so the meditator treats them simply as a small 
      distraction and when the meditator notices that mind is thinking about 
      this or that, they just let go of those thoughts, even if mind thinks that 
      these thoughts are &quot;important&quot;. Let them go , relax the subtle tightness 
      caused by the thoughts and softly redirect the attention back to the 
      breath and relaxing again.</P>
      <P>At first the meditator may not notice that mind has gone away for a 
      long time, but as soon as they have noticed they let go, relax and 
      redirect mind back to the meditation object (the breath, relaxing and 
      smiling). There is no need to criticize or condemn oneself, at all. This 
      is a part of training one&#39;s awareness and it can be a fun part of the 
      meditation when not taken too seriously. It is alright to have fun and 
      make the meditation a part of a game. Smile!</P>
      <B>
      <P>Body movement</P>
      </B>
      <P>When the meditator begins to sit they must not move any part of there 
      body at all. Please don&#39;t wiggle the fingers or toes, don&#39;t sway the body, 
      don&#39;t scratch, don&#39;t shift the body, don&#39;t rub, don&#39;t change your posture, 
      for any reason. Please sit as still as a Buddha image or big rock that is 
      stuck in the ground. You can move as much as they do.</P>
      <P>When sitting like this there may be some sensations that arise, like an 
      itch, a tickle in the throat, a sneeze, heat, vibration, or even pain. 
      Please remember that you can&#39;t move at all! So what to do? First, notice 
      that the impulse to make the sensation go away is very strong and your 
      mind will begin to think about it. These thoughts sound something like 
      this, &quot;I wish that this would stop!&quot;, &quot;I hate this feeling&quot;, &quot;Why doesn&#39;t 
      this just go away and stop bothering me!&quot;, &quot;I want this to leave me 
      alone!&quot;, &quot;But the instructions say that I can&#39;t move!&quot;, or &quot;Oh, what 
      torture!&quot;.</P>
      <P>The first thing that the meditator will observe is the thoughts about 
      the sensation. The meditator will see that the more one tries to control 
      the sensation with their thoughts, the bigger and more intense that 
      sensation becomes. The instructions tell us, to let go of the thoughts and 
      then to notice that there is a subtle tightness in the head and in one&#39;s 
      mind, so then relax.</P>
      <P>Next the meditator will notice that there is a tight mental fist 
      wrapped around that sensation, one lets the sensation be there without any 
      resistance at all. The truth <I>[dhamma]</I> of the present moment is, 
      when a sensation arises, &#39;It is there&#39; ! If the meditator tries to fight 
      that sensation, or they try to control that sensation in any way, or they 
      try to make that sensation go away, as a result, it gets bigger and more 
      intense.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Allowing sensations to be</P>
      </B>
      <P>The meditator learns through this training of themselves, to allow that 
      sensation to be there. One learns to open up that tight mental fist and 
      allow the sensation to be and do whatever it wants to do. It is only a 
      sensation and it is alright for that sensation to be there. It has to be 
      alright, why? Because that is the truth! Anytime one tries to fight with 
      the truth or control the truth or make the truth be they way they want it 
      to be, it causes more and more suffering.</P>
      <P>The meditator simply allows the sensation to be there and to float like 
      a bubble floating in the wind. When the wind blows from one direction the 
      bubble goes in the same direction and when the wind changes and blows in 
      another direction the bubble goes in that direction. The bubble has no 
      resistance at all it just oats around wherever it will. So in the same 
      way, the meditator allows the sensation to float wherever it will. This 
      meditation is about watching the movements of mind.</P>
      <P>Meditation is learning how to lovingly accept whatever it is that 
      arises in the present moment and allow it to be there without any 
      resistance at all. Now, the meditator notices a kind of subtle and 
      sometimes not so subtle tightness or tension in their body, especially in 
      the head, relax and smile. Now they feel mind relax and kind of expand 
      then open up and next mind seems to take a little step down and it becomes 
      calm.</P>
      <P>At that time, mind becomes very clear and alert, there are no thoughts 
      in mind so it becomes pure. Now the meditator will please redirect their 
      attention back to the breath, relax and smile again. Of course, the nature 
      of these kinds of sensations is that they don&#39;t go away right away. So 
      mind may get pulled back to that sensation again and the meditator does 
      the same thing again. No matter how many times mind gets pulled away, the 
      process is always the same. First let go of the thought... relax... smile, 
      next let go of that tight mental fist wrapped around that sensation... 
      relax... smile... softly redirect mind back to the breath, relaxing and 
      smile...</P>

      <P>Conclusion</P>
      </B>
      <P>These are the bare-bones instructions for the Mindfulness of Breathing. 
      These instructions when followed closely will work for every type of 
      distraction that takes mind away from being in the present moment, 
      relaxing and smiling. One thing to remember is that this is an all of the 
      time meditation. When a person is walking from their house to the car or 
      the car to their work place, what is their mind doing at that time? 
      Thinking about this or that, liking this, disliking that and so on. This 
      is the time to recognize that mind is wandering around and let go of the 
      thoughts, relax, smile and redirect their attention back to the breath, 
      relaxing and smiling again. Do this as many times during the day as can be 
      remembered. This is how one practices the meditation all of the time.</P>
