<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We often talk about &quot;living in the present&quot;. But
  what do we really mean by &quot;living in the present&quot;? Does that mean that we do not
  think about the past or the future? But how can we not think about the past or the future?
  That would not be possible or desirable. For we do need to recollect the past and to plan
  for the future at times. So we need to discuss what we mean by &quot;living in the
  present&quot;.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Living in the present&quot; menas living well in the
  present, living skilfully in the present. Doing what we have to do now <i>well</i>, for
  that will, in fact, be the best guarantee for the future. And also there will be no
  regrets when we think back about the past. Instead, there will be joy -- joy at having
  lived a good life and at having done good deeds.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">How do we live skilfully in the present? For that we need
  wisdom, we need midfulness and understanding. We need to know how to place our mind, how
  to compose our mind, how to steer our mind in the right direction -- away from the
  unwholesome and towards the wholesome.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To live wholesomely we need mindfulness, we need to engage
  mindfulness in various ways. How? Mindfulness is like our watchdog. Whenver an unwholesome
  thought arises, mindfulness can alert us. It can tell us: &quot;This is unwholesome. We
  shouldn't be thinking or responding this way.&quot; And realising that, we can check the
  unwholesome. For example, when anger arises, mindulness can tell us: &quot;Hey, watch it.
  You are getting angry. You better look at your anger. You better get a hold of yourself
  and cool down. You better not say or do anything which you will regret later.&quot; And so
  on and so forth. Actually, there is more than mindfulness involved her. First, mindfulness
  spots the anger. Then with wisdom and understanding, we can reflect and caution ourselves
  from giving vent to anger.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Similarly with other mental states such as worry and
  anxiety. Again mindfulness can notice how worrisome we have become lately, how poorly we
  have been applying the Dhamma in our daily life. We can then check the unwholesome trend.
  We can adjust and correct our attitudes. If we try to stay more in the present by being
  aware of all our daily activities, paying good attention to whatever we do, we can check
  the wandering worrisome mind. Staying more and more in the present, living from moment to
  moment, day to day, doing the best we can, solving each problem as it comes along, we will
  find scant time for moping and worrying. We will be <i>living</i>, that is to say, we will
  be living well.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So mindfulness and wisdom go hand-in-hand. If an
  unwholesome mind arises, mindfulness alerts us and we can check it. If a wholesome mind
  arises, mindfulness also knows. We can approve of the wholesome mind. We can encourage
  more of such mind or thoughts to arise.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mindfulness also has a quality of memory or recollection.
  So from time to time too, mindfulness can remind us of the impermanent, suffering and
  no-self nature of life. Reflecting often on these three characteristics of existence, we
  can live more wisely, with less pain-bringing kind of attachment.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">By engaging mindfulness in these various ways, we will be
  living skilfully in the present. Also, we will be gradually developing our perception on
  the impermanent, suffering and no-self nature of existence, and of this mind and body.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">On another level, mindfulness can expericence directly and
  vividly the constant arising and passing away of mental and physical phenomena. This is
  through Vipassana (Insight) meditation. When we sit in meditation, especially during an
  intensive retreat, we will be observing closely the nature of our mind and body. As our
  concentration develops, we will be able to see very clearly that mental and physical
  phenomena are constantly arising and passing away, that they do not remain the same for
  even two moments. Such direct kind of seeing can climax in the attainment of <i>magga-phala</i>
  (path and fruition) insight knowledges and Nibbana.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, we can see that there are various aspects to <i>living
  in the present</i>. There is that which involved skilful living from day to day, and
  there's the direct perception of phenomena in the present moment in Vipassana meditation.
  The latter kind is what we must all come to eventually, for it is only by such direct
  seeing that we can truly comprehend the impermanent, suffering and no-self nature of this
  mind and body. Comprehending thus, we can cut off for good our defilements of greed,
  hatred and delusion. Once these defilements are eliminated, we will suffer no more
  torments of mind. We will become quenched and cooled. We will live our last life as
  arahants and not be reborn again. Of course, right now we may still be a long distance
  from the goal, but we are, through skilful and mindful living, already checking our
  defilement. Mindfulness, the Buddha said, acts as a check and gradually, through deepening
  wisom, we can cut off the defilements completely.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Living in the present entails not going unskilfully into
  the past or future. Sometimes we think needlessly about the past. For example, we may be
  recollecting some ill-deed we had done and remorsing over it now and then. We are unable
  to forget it, so it keeps popping up. What we should do si not to mope over what had
  already been done, but to resolve not to repeat the mistake. That is the best we can do.
  It is unwholesome and unskilful to keep mulling over a mistake, such taht we become very
  miserable and are unable to live in the present.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes we may be thinking about some injury that we
  perceived, rightly or wrongly, to have been done to us by another person. We are unable to
  forget. We nurse the pain in our heart. There is pain and anger in us whenever we
  recollect, and we want to hit back at the other person. This too is unwholesome and
  unskilful.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes we live in the past, thinking of some happiness
  or pleasures that we enjoyed then, and wishing and yearning for those &quot;good old
  days&quot;. Such placing of the mind too is painful and unskilful.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As for the future, we can plan to no end until we cannot
  eat or sleep. We can also, so to speak, worry ourselves to death, thinking about some
  impending problems. Our we may be having some great expectations such that we cannot
  concentrate on what we are presently doing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">These are just some examples of how we go unskilfully into
  the past or future. There are many other possibly scenerios. Basically, our problem is
  that we take everything too personally. Whethere it is the past, present or future, we
  tend to relate to them from the context of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot;. We don't
  realize that ultimately nothing belongs to us. We ourselves are conditioned and
  impermanent beings. How can something that is impermanent and which has ultimately
  no-self, owns anything in the first place? Not to mention too the thing we supposedly own
  is also impermanent itself! So can we see the height of our own folly?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha advised us to live skilfully in the present so
  that we can eventually realize the impermanent, suffering and no-self anture of all
  conditioned phenomena. On the ultimate level, we need to do vipassana meditation to
  penetrate these truths on a direct experiential level. Once we have done so, we will be
  able to live well, naturally, effortlessly.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But while we have not yet eliminate the defilements, we
  need to use all our skill and understanding to live well in the present, and not to go
  unskilfully into the past or the future. If we recollect the past, it should be for good
  purpose, such as to see where we had gone wrong with a view to not repeating the mistake.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes too we can recollect the good deeds that we have
  done in giving, observing precepts and meditation. We can get much joy and comfort in such
  skilful recollection. In fact, when we are near death, recollecting the good that we have
  done can give us a peaceful comforting end and a good rebirth.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As for the future, no doubt we need to plan from time to
  time. We can think and plan accordingly. We should do so with a good mind, thinking well
  and deeply. The problem is we often tend to over-think and over-plan until we become
  anxious and agitated, and even neurotic. So we should plan calmly and not get excited. We
  should be flexible and versatile, understanding that we may need to change or modify our
  plans as we go along. And we should carry on doing what we have to do from day to day.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">On a wider perspective, we have to decide how we want to
  live our life, in which direction we wish to go, and the measures we have to take to
  realize our goal. Then we need to go about steering our life towards that direction.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Living in present, we need lots of mindfulness. We can be
  mindful of all our bodily postures and activities -- getting up, sitting down, stretching,
  bending, eating, drinking, walking, standing, urinating, defecating, opening a door,
  switching on a light, picking up the phone, etc. We shoudl pay good attention to whatever
  we are doing. In this way too, we can check the wandering and worrisome mind.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As for the mind, we have already mentioned about the need
  to be mindful of what arises in it. The main point is to guard the mind from being invaded
  by greed, anger and delusion. Our task is to cultivate wisdom, loving-kindness and
  compassion. So in whatever we do, we should try to be as mindful as possible with the view
  to cultivating wholesome qualities. And in whatever situation we may be, we should always
  try to respond with non-greed, non-anger and non-delusion. Which means to say we should
  respond with wisdom, loving-kindness and compassion.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is not possible for me to write more comprehensively on
  the subject of <i>living in the present in just this one article. <strong>But I do hope
  the thoughts that I have shared with you thus far may have been of some help, that they
  may have given you some pointers along the way. I wish you good practice. May you live
  well and happily in the present.</strong></i></font></p>
