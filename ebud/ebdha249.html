      <TD WIDTH="100%">&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Respected Venerables 
      and Distinguished Guests, </FONT>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is an honour for me to be here today. I 
      was born a Christian, was educated in Christian schools, and I even sang 
      in the local church choir. But when I read my first book on Buddhism, at 
      the age of 16, I immediately knew I was a Buddhist. I was moved by the 
      compassion, the wisdom, and the freedom that shone more brilliantly in the 
      Lord Buddha's Teachings than in anything else I had met before. 
      Experiences similar to my own are being repeated hundreds of thousands of 
      times, in the lives of the people of this 21st century. When ordinary 
      people in non-Buddhist countries encounter the pure Teachings of Buddhism, 
      presented in a clear and reliable manner, then they quickly recognize it 
      as the most fragrant of all paths, the most precious of all truths, and 
      the best of all religions. They only wonder why such liberating wisdom is 
      not made more widely known.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In my own land, Australia, the number of 
      Buddhists was insignificant in 1983, when I first arrived from Thailand. 
      By 1991, the proportion of Buddhists grew to 0.8%. In 1996, that had 
      increased to 1.1%. Recently, in the Australian Census of August 2001, the 
      number of Buddhists had grown by 75% to 1.9% of the population. That is 
      almost one in fifty Australians declaring themselves to be Buddhists. As 
      the Christian religion declines in the West, Buddhism has become the 
      fastest growing religion in Australia and many other developed countries.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">That is good news and bad news. It is good 
      news in that more Australians are benefiting from the world's most 
      peaceful religion. It is bad news in that it means monks like me have to 
      work so much harder with more disciples to look after!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I would now like to suggest why I think 
      Buddhism is growing so well in the West. I will use the acronym PURE to 
      summarize four key strategies that have helped extend the spread of 
      Buddhism:</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">1. <B><FONT SIZE="4">P</FONT></B>resentation 
        -- in ordinary language<BR>

        problems<BR>
        4. <B><FONT SIZE="4">E</FONT></B>xamples -- monks leading by example</FONT></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>1. Presentation</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If we want the wonderful Teachings of 
      Buddhism to reach our modern generation, then it needs to be presented in 
      a modern way. It is not the essence of the Dharma that needs to be 
      changed, it is the presentation that needs continual adjustment. The 
      generations of tomorrow are not going to listen to boring monks droning 
      on, giving irrelevant sermons.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We all know that the Lord Buddha said to 
      teach the Dharma in ordinary language (e.g. Aranavibhanga Sutra). Let me 
      give an example of what I think this means. Last century, Western priests 
      and scholars dismissed Buddhism as pessimistic, saying that it only 
      focuses on suffering. This was even repeated by Pope John Paul II in his 
      controversial book on world religions. To avoid this misunderstanding one 
      may rearrange the central Dharma Teaching of the Four Noble Truths as 
      Happiness (Dukkhanirodho); the Cause of Happiness (the Eight-Fold Path); 
      the Absence of Happiness (Dukkha); and the Cause for the Absence of 
      Happiness (Craving). This shifts the focus onto happiness.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is a simple re-packaging of the 
      Dharma that retains the essence while being more attractive to modern 
      audiences. It is justified by the Lord Buddha's statement that &quot;Nirvana is 
      the highest happiness&quot; (Dhammapada 203, 204). When I present the Four 
      Noble Truths in such a way, I find all generations listen and come back 
      for more.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>2. User Friendly</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Presenting the Dharma in ordinary language 
      is the first step to making Buddhism user friendly. However, I have found 
      many cases of people, in the West and in the East, who want to learn about 
      Buddhism but are too afraid to come into the temple or monastery because 
      they are not familiar with the traditional customs, or even because they 
      are scared of scowling monks! When Buddhist temples are more welcoming to 
      their visitors, and more accommodating to newcomers, when the monks are 
      more approachable, then the temple is user friendly.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In these modern times, though, people are 
      so busy that they rarely have time to visit the temple. So the temple 
      should go to the people with books, audio cassettes, CDs and, of course, 
      the Internet. Our Buddhist Society of Western Australia has a large 
      web-site that loads weekly spoken Dharma talks in English so that anyone, 
      anywhere in the world can listen to Dharma in the comfort of their own 
      homes at a time convenient to them. This has been highly successful with a 
      large audience of regular disciples all over the world, with no need for 
      expensive and extravagant buildings.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>3. Relevant</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Religions like Christianity are declining 
      in the West because they are seen as irrelevant to most people's lives. 
      Few are concerned about abstract philosophy, rituals with no apparent 
      meaning, or with speculations that go against reason. However, they are 
      very concerned about how to find more happiness amid the common problems 
      of life.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I have found it easy to explain that 
      keeping moral precepts raises one's average level of happiness, just as a 
      rising tide lifts the average level of the sea. The result is that many of 
      my audience keep the Five Precepts. It is also not difficult to illustrate 
      that kindness to your colleagues, family and to yourself, brings much more 
      comfort into your life. So my disciples become less angry and more 
      forgiving. There is so much medical evidence to prove that traditional 
      Buddhist meditation practices ease the stress of modern life and relieve 
      so many other related problems. So the members of my temple are all keen 
      meditators. These three central Buddhist trainings -- morality, kindness 
      and meditation -- when framed in the context of personal growth in 
      happiness, attract so many to Buddhism. They relate to what many people 
      consider as important to them.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When we focus on what is relevant to 
      ordinary people, then Buddhism becomes important to them. They might begin 
      with interest in solving their worldly problems, but that soon leads to 
      the Path that liberates one from all suffering.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>4. Examples</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">All this means nothing to the modern 
      generation without high quality leaders to provide the inspiration. The 
      growth of Buddhism relies crucially on living examples of virtuous, 
      compassionate, wise and peaceful monks. People of the 21st century are 
      sceptical. They withhold their belief until they see some evidence that it 
      will benefit them. Does Buddhism help? Does it really lead to virtue, 
      compassion, contentment and freedom? They are looking at us monks for 
      examples of where Buddhism leads, before they will follow. How can we 
      expect to inspire the questioning modern generation when monks live in 
      luxury, more wealthy that the common person, when we are slack in our 
      precepts and know little of serenity? The Dharma is spread mostly by 
      example, much more powerfully than by any sermon.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As one well educated Australian wrote in 
      her recent book, before becoming a Buddhist she observed the monks in 
      Perth for many months. When she saw that they were very frugal, kept their 
      precepts, worked hard and were very happy, only then did she go for refuge 
      and start calling herself a Buddhist. Actions speak louder than words.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So, for example, in Western Australia we 
      have established monasteries for training Sangha leaders of both genders, 
      what I call a 'monk factory' and a 'nun factory'. By putting many 
      resources into training high quality Sangha leaders we will be ensuring 
      the supply of high quality examples for the next generation.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">These are some of the strategies that have 
      worked in Australia to make Buddhism the fastest growing religion there. 
      We do not need to change the message of the Lord Buddha, nor do we need to 
      change the monastic rules. We may fulfil our duty to the Greatest Teacher, 
      our Lord Buddha, and spread the delightful Dharma throughout all parts of 
      our modern world, by making Buddhism <B>PURE</B>. That is <B>Presented</B> 
      in ordinary language, <B>User friendly,</B> <B>Relevant</B>, and with us 
      monks as the inspiring <B>Examples</B>.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Thank you.</FONT></P>
