    <hr width="25%">
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The main question for
    a lot of people is how to practice meditation in daily life.
    How to practice the Dhamma in daily life. The practice of
    formal meditation in a retreat is primarily intensive
    training in a very structured environment. This is helpful
    and important, but the real practice of meditation, if
    meditation is to be of any real value, is in our daily lives.
    </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In daily life, the
    full path and the other aspects of cultivating the mind have
    to be undertaken and practiced as well. It's really in our
    daily lives, in our day-to-day situations that we <i>need</i>
    skill and understanding to meet all the challenges that come
    up: all the conflicting situations, the chaos, the the daily
    ups and downs. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">We have to have a game
    plan for meeting and facing the defilements that come up
    within our own minds as well as the negativities and
    defilements that come at us from others. We have to develop
    qualities of the mind in addition to meditation. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Many people want to
    meditate and find peace of mind. But some of those people
    don't want to really change the rest of their life style.
    They want to have their cake and eat it too-be able to
    meditate and get the &quot;bennies,&quot; such as peace of
    mind, but still be able to do whatever comes into their mind
    according to their whims and their fancies. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">But the process
    doesn't really work that way. For most of us, the mind we
    encounter as we sit in meditation- all the states that come
    up, the difficult emotions, other negative mental states, and
    even the condition of our body, pains and the like- is
    basically the sum total of what we have been accumulating all
    of our life. These accumulations are the consequences of our
    life-long habit patterns, life style, and even of our
    viewpoints. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">There are practices,
    in addition to meditation, that we can cultivate to help us
    bring the Dhamma into our habit patterns, our life styles,
    and our viewpoints. Let's explore some of these other aspects
    of the Dhamma practice which we have to put into effect in
    our daily lives as the appropriate situations come up. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">We know that the
    second Noble Truth is that the source of suffering is craving
    and clinging, unbridled desire. Because of this, one of the
    main practices in the Dhamma is called Dana. Dana means the
    practice of giving or sharing with others. It is an antidote
    to attachment, to holding on tightly, to really holding on to
    our things. We find this greed and attachment everywhere. We
    hold on tightly to our possessions, don't want to let go of
    them. The problem is, the more that we have, the more of a
    burden it becomes. But the practice of giving helps. It's an
    antidote to stinginess, and by sharing things that we have
    with others, or letting go of our own selfish
    self-centeredness, it also helps to open up our minds in
    loving kindness and compassion. It is an antidote to clinging
    and craving. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Giving has different
    forms. You might say there are three degrees of giving. One
    is called <strong><i>one-handed giving</i></strong><i>.</i>
    With this degree of giving, you give things away because
    people ask you, or because u are pressured into it, or
    because people are looking. But you are also holding on with
    one hand. You may not really want to give, but, reluctantly,
    you do. Let's say that a beggar keeps on badgering you. To
    get rid of him, you give him something. If you've ever
    traveled in India, you've probably encountered situations
    where beggars follow you around like a shadow and won't let
    you go until you finally give them something. That is a form
    of giving, of sharing with others. But it has a limited
    value, because, of course, the whole spirit of giving is
    really letting go. This is letting go to some degree, but not
    fully. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The second degree of
    giving is <strong><i>friendly giving</i></strong><i>.</i>
    That means you give because you like to give. It feels good.
    You don't have to pressured into it. Whenever you see
    somebody in a situation of need, if you have enough for
    yourself, if you have two of something, you give it out of
    friendliness. If you have two bananas and somebody is hungry,
    you usually give them one. That's a higher form giving
    because you're not being pressured into it-it's coming from
    your own friendliness, and you're not tightly holding on. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The third degree is
    called <strong><i>kingly giving</i></strong><i>.</i> In
    kingly giving, you give anything at any time. You give the
    shirt off your back. You give the last food you have to
    someone who is hungrier. Because there's no thought-you give
    the <i>best</i> that you have. There's no holding on nor even
    thought of an &quot;I&quot; involved in the giving. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Giving material things
    may be the easiest form of giving, especially if you have
    more than enough. Most people, especially in the West, have
    more than enough. We have closets and garages full stuff; we
    have clothes that we don't use. Perhaps we clear things out
    once a year and give them to the Salvation Army or Good Will
    as a form of giving and generosity. Of course a lot of times,
    we're clearing our closets of things we don't need because
    we've got to make room for more things that we're going to
    accumulate. Giving material things, giving food, giving money
    to charity, that's all a form of material giving or sharing. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Another form of giving
    is the giving of your time. That goes a little bit deeper,
    because your own time is closer to your ego. It's fairly easy
    to give a beggar a dollar or some extra food if u have
    enough, but to share your time might be a little bit more
    difficult. Imagine that your neighbor comes over and says,
    &quot;Oh, you know, I'm really in a jam, I really need your
    help this Saturday to help me paint my house.&quot; </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Saturday! Oh, my
    God. That's the football game, the soccer match. Can't we do
    it on Sunday?&quot; Or, &quot;I'll hire my nephew. I'll give
    him ten dollars and send him on down to help you.&quot; </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">We cling to our own
    precious time and to our desire to do only what we want.
    Letting go of our own desires and time to help a person in
    need is a deeper form of giving. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Sharing our knowledge
    or talents with others is another way of giving. All these
    forms of giving- from the material to the mental- are ways of
    letting go. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Meditation is also a
    form of giving, of giving up. You might actually say that
    when we meditate, that's the highest form of giving, because
    we're giving up whatever is coming through our senses,
    especially in mindfulness meditation. We're giving up the
    sound coming to our ear, whether it's a pleasant sound or
    it's a painful sound, we're just letting it arise and vanish
    without holding on. If we do cling to it, we try to let go.
    We try to let go of our thoughts, let go of the pains in our
    bodies. And of course, ultimately, each of us tries to let go
    of the self. We let go of the feeling of self in order to
    realize unconditioned Dhamma and true liberation of mind. For
    this, even the sense of self has to be let go. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Surely if we cannot
    let go of material things, of mental things, of emotions such
    as anger, of other negative states or even of positive
    states, then when it comes time for it, we won't be able to
    let go of the self in meditation, to make that quantum leap
    to the unconditioned experience. Therefore the practice of
    giving is a whole and complete practice in itself. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In your daily lives
    you can find many opportunities for practicing giving. You
    can be especially giving of your time when somebody is in
    need, for example somebody at work say: &quot;Can you show me
    how to work this stupid computer?&quot; Show him how to do
    this, or help her do that, or give in other ways. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">There are three
    foundations of the Dhamma that help us as we practice giving.
    They are Right Understanding, the first aspect of the Noble
    Eightfold Path; Right Mindfulness, the seventh aspect, Right
    Effort, the sixth aspect. All those three work together. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Right understanding
    understands selfishness and miserliness as being negative
    states. Right Mindfulness ensures that when selfishness comes
    back or intervenes, we see it; we notice when our minds are
    holding on tightly to things. Having become mindful of
    selfishness and attachment as unwholesome states of mind, we
    use Right Effort to abandon them when they arise. Practicing
    Right Effort, we make the effort to prevent and abandon
    unwholesome states, the effort to cultivate and perfect
    wholesome states. </font></p>
