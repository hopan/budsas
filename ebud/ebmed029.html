<blockquote>
    <p align="center"><em>A talk given the last day of the
    celebration of the new ordination hall at Wat Asokaram, on
    May 19, 1960. This was the last talk that Ajaan Lee gave to
    his assembled students, supporters, and friends. </em></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I'd now like to explain the Dhamma as a gift for those of
    us who have gathered here. All of us, both lay and ordained,
    have come here with skillful intentions from many different
    provinces. Our coming here is of two sorts. The first sort is
    connected with our having received an invitation or the
    notice of this gathering, so that we've come to join in with
    the merit-making for the past eleven days. The second sort
    didn't receive any notice or invitation, but as soon as word
    of this gathering passed by our ears, we gave rise to a good
    intention -- good in one of two ways. The first way is that
    we see what's being done here is something good, and so we
    should join in. That's why some of you are here. This
    includes many of the monks and novices who came: you simply
    heard the news of this gathering and so you came to join your
    hearts with ours. This is called a skillful intention that
    has borne fruit in the hearts of all of us. </p>
    <p>And then there are those who considered that this is a
    gathering of our friends, of our teacher: even though we
    haven't been called to join, we should go. Some of you have
    thought in this way and so have joined in our gathering,
    participating in the various activities up to today. For all
    of these things, I'd like to express my thanks and
    appreciation to each and every one of you -- because this
    celebration has involved many duties, many activities of many
    sorts. If I were to try to do it all by myself, I'm sure that
    I wouldn't succeed. The fact that we have managed to succeed
    so well is due to the goodness of all of you together. </p>
    <p>Now, the fact that you've succeeded in completing these
    activities will give you two results in two ways: the first
    is through <strong>merit</strong> -- there's no need to doubt
    that. The second is through <strong>benefaction</strong>. </p>
    <p>Results through merit means that we've never been here
    before, we're not intimate with the people here, but we've
    learned that what they're doing here is meritorious, and so
    we've come in hopes of merit. </p>
    <p>The other way is, as I've said earlier: we've come on the
    basis of being students or friends, or of being students of
    the same teacher. When we willingly come to help in these
    activities, this too is meritorious. The results we'll
    receive will come in two ways: through merit and through
    benefaction. </p>
    <p>Merit is an individual affair, something for which each
    person has to be responsible in terms of him or her own self.
    As for benefaction, the person who has benefited from your
    help and support won't forget your kindness. The memory will
    stay buried there in the heart: that when we held the
    celebration in that year or that time, our friends came to
    help us. If they have any need for our help, then -- to the
    extent that we're able -- we should take the opportunity to
    return their kindness in line with our ability. Whether they
    call for our help or not, and whether or not we can actually
    go to help, we can't escape having the intention to benefit
    them in one way or another. Even though my body may not be
    able to go, or my words can't reach you, still my mind --
    when I hear the news one way or another of any meritorious
    activities, and there's some way that I can help -- will
    remember your kindness, and the merit that I've accumulated
    myself, and so I'll spread thoughts of good will, dedicating
    the fruits of that merit to pour down on you all. It's as if
    all of you were farming in a certain place, planting rice or
    vegetables, or starting an orchard, and then ran into
    difficulties, such as a drought. When this happens, there are
    things that have to be done: finding water, for instance, or
    repairing the dikes in the rice field. When a person who has
    received help from you in the past learns of your
    difficulties, but can't carry the water to you or help with
    the repair work, he'll spread thoughts of good will. </p>
    <p>Spreading thoughts of good will is something subtle and
    hard to perceive, like the energy that flows out of our eyes.
    The eyes of every person shoot beams of energy out into the
    air, the same way that the beams of car headlights light up a
    road. The energy from our eyes, though, is refined. No matter
    where we look, we don't see the energy flowing past because
    the current is subtle. It's because the current is subtle,
    though, that it can flow far. If the current were blatant, it
    would go only a short distance. This is why, when people
    develop solid concentration, they're able to see many subtle
    worlds. In other words, the nature of eye-energy has no
    limit, but we simply get no use out of it. Why? Because our
    minds aren't still. If our minds aren't still, we're like a
    person preoccupied, all wrapped up in his work. When the mind
    is wrapped up in confusion this way, then even though the
    eyes have potential energy, we can't get any use out of it
    because it's very subtle. The energy can go very far, but the
    problem is that the mind isn't quiet. If the mind were really
    quiet, we could immediately see very far. That's
    clairvoyance. </p>
    <p>This is something ordinary and natural that exists in
    every human being. If the mind is weak, then outside currents
    cut off the energy coming from our eyes. If the mind is
    strong and resilient, the currents of the world can't cut off
    that energy. Such people can see far regardless of whether
    their eyes are open or closed. This is a quality that exists
    in the human body -- something of very high quality by its
    nature, but we can't get any use out of it because our minds
    are distracted and restless. When our minds are distracted
    and restless, we're like people who are dead drunk: even
    though drunk people may have tools in their possession, they
    can't put them to any use other than as weapons to kill one
    another. Only if they're good and sober will they be able to
    use those tools to amass wealth and provide for their
    physical well-being. But if they're mentally unbalanced, you
    give them a knife and they'll use it to slice somebody's head
    open. As a result, they end up in prison. Even if they don't
    end up in prison, they'll have to get caged or locked up at
    home. </p>
    <p>The same is true with the human beings born in this world:
    even though they're endowed with good things by nature, their
    minds aren't at normalcy. And so the good things within them
    end up causing various kinds of harm. </p>
    <p>Here we've been talking about physical nature. When we
    talk about subtle matters, like merit or the mind, they're
    much more refined than the body. For this reason, helping
    people by way of the mind is something much more profound.
    When a person trains his own mind, and trains it well, to the
    point where he experiences happiness and peace, and then
    hears that other people are suffering and that there's a way
    he can be of help, he uses the strength of the mind. He
    cultivates the mind until it's firmly established and then
    can send that clean current to be of immediate help. </p>
    <p>The hearts of ordinary people, though, are like salt water
    in the ocean. If you use it to bathe, you're not really
    comfortable -- although it can help you get by in a pinch. If
    you try to drink it, it doesn't nourish the body. You use it
    only if you really don't have anything else at all. </p>
    <p>In the same way, the hearts of human beings in this world
    are adrift in the ocean: the flood of sensuality, the flood
    of becoming, the flood of views, the flood of ignorance.
    These four oceans are deep: deeper than the water in the sea.
    We depend on our minds that are swimming in these oceans,
    sinking in salt water. That's why, when some people are in
    really salty water, the waves are strong. If they lie down to
    sleep, they toss and turn just like waves in the sea. They
    lie down on their left side and can't sleep. They turn over
    and lie on their right side and still can't sleep. It comes
    from the waves. And where do these waves come from? The
    ocean. In other words, they come from </p>
    <p><i>-- </i><strong><i>the flood of sensuality</i></strong><i>:</i>
    sensual desires, attachment to sensual objects; </p>
    <p><i>-- </i><strong><i>the flood of becoming</i></strong><i>:</i>
    wanting to be this, wanting to be that, struggling to escape
    from the state we're in; </p>
    <p><i>-- </i><strong><i>the flood of views:</i></strong><i> </i>holding
    fast to our own views to the point of getting into arguments
    -- a sign that we're adrift in salt water; </p>
    <p><i>-- and </i><strong><i>the flood of ignorance</i></strong><i>:</i>
    darkness behind us -- not knowing the past; darkness in front
    of us -- not knowing the future; darkness in the present --
    not knowing what's good and evil within ourselves, letting
    the mind fall for the ways of the world of rebirth. That's
    what's called ignorance. </p>
    <p>The normal nature of the human mind is to be floating
    adrift in this way, which is why the Buddha had the great
    kindness to want us to develop our merit and skillfulness.
    That's why he advised us to build a boat for ourselves: the
    boat, here, is the activity of our physical body. As for the
    provisions that we'll need for crossing the ocean, those are
    the requisites that we as Buddhists sacrifice in order to
    benefit monastics in our development of generosity. If you
    can give a lot, it means that you'll have enough to help you
    cross over the ocean, for you'll have enough to eat. If you
    give only a little, you might run out of provisions and start
    drifting aimlessly with the currents and waves in the middle
    of the ocean. If you're lucky, the waves may wash you ashore,
    so that you manage to survive. But if the waves are large,
    and your boat is small, you won't be able to reach land, and
    you'll end up sinking in the middle of the sea. </p>
    <p>The Buddha contemplated this fact, which is why he advised
    us to develop our goodness. On one level, developing goodness
    is involved with the way we use our material possessions. On
    another, it's involved with the way we look after our
    actions, improving the way we use our physical body so that
    it becomes fully trained. The results we'll receive are of
    two sorts. The first is that our boat won't sink. The second
    is that we'll have plenty of provisions, so that we'll be
    able to cross over the vast expanse of the sea. But even when
    people have a seaworthy boat and plenty of provisions, they
    can still run out of water to drink. When that happens, then
    even though they have plenty of provisions, they're put to
    difficulties. To prevent this, the Buddha taught us another
    skill: how to distill salt water so that we can drink it. If
    we're intelligent, we can distill salt water so that we can
    drink it. We'll be able to reach America without having to
    stop off anywhere along the way. If we have discernment,
    we'll be able to drink salt water. In what way? Salt water
    comes from fresh water, so wherever there's salt water, there
    has to be fresh water. They can't escape from each other.
    Once you realize this, you can travel around the world. If
    you're skilled at distilling, your salt water can turn into
    fresh water. Once we can turn salt water into fresh water in
    this way, we can be at our ease. Even though we're in the
    middle of the ocean, we'll have fresh water to drink and to
    bathe our bodies. That way we'll be at our ease. </p>
    <p>In the same way, those of us who are adrift in the ocean
    of life have to: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>1) caulk our boat so that it's nice and tight,<br>
        2) stock our boat with enough provisions, and <br>
        3) learn how to distill fresh water from salt water. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The &quot;<strong>boat</strong>&quot; here stands for our
    body. It's not a big boat -- if it were larger than this, we
    human beings would have lots of problems. The body is a
    fathom long, a cubit wide, and a span thick. This is a boat
    that we have to caulk so that it's nice and tight. Caulking
    the boat here stands for restraint of the senses: restraining
    the eye -- being careful not to give rise to bad kamma
    because of the eye, not letting barnacles build up on it;
    restraining the ear -- don't let anything evil come in by way
    of the ear, for anything that's evil is like a barnacle. The
    same holds true with our nose, tongue, body, and mind: we
    shouldn't take an interest in anything evil or bad, for
    things of that sort are like barnacles or insects that will
    bore into the wood of our boat and destroy it. </p>
    <p>This is why we're taught to practice restraint over our
    eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind. We abstain from
    doing whatever shouldn't be done. We have to protect
    ourselves and practice restraint, considering things
    thoroughly before we act. If we let barnacles develop all
    over our body, this boat of ours -- this Body Ship -- will
    wear out and sink into the ocean. </p>
    <p>As for the mind, we have to be careful so that defilements
    don't arise in the heart. We have to exercise restraint like
    this at all times, continually caulking our six sense media,
    caulking our eyes with the right sights, our ears with the
    right sounds, our nose with the right smells, our tongue with
    the right flavors, our body with the right tactile
    sensations, and our mind with the Dhamma. </p>
    <p>Caulking the eye means that if we see a lack anywhere that
    will give us a chance to develop merit and skillfulness --
    whether it's inside the monastery or out -- we shouldn't be
    indifferent to it. We should fill up the lack as we can, step
    by step. This is called caulking the eye. </p>
    <p>Caulking the ear means that when we hear people say
    anything -- regardless of whether they have the intention of
    telling or teaching us -- when their voices come scraping
    into our ears, we should tell ourselves that the sound is a
    chance for us to develop our goodness so that the sound will
    be useful to us. No matter what kind of person is speaking --
    child or adult; monk, novice, or nun; tall, short, black,
    white, whatever: we should choose to pay attention only to
    the things that will be of use to us. This is called using
    sounds as pitch for caulking for the ears. </p>
    <p>When we encounter smells passing by our nose, we should
    search only for smells that will make us cheerful, that will
    give rise to skillful mental states as a way of caulking our
    nose. This is what will bring happiness and peace to the
    mind. </p>
    <p>Caulking the body stands for the way we sit here quietly
    listening to the Dhamma without moving around or making any
    disturbance. It also stands for sitting in meditation,
    sitting and chanting, performing a candle circumambulation
    ceremony, using the body to bow down to the Buddha. All of
    these things count as caulking for the body. </p>
    <p>As for caulking the mind, that stands for <strong><i>dhamma-osatha</i></strong>:
    the medicine of the Dhamma. We caulk the mind by the way we
    think. If, when we think of something, the mind sours, we
    shouldn't think about that thing. Whether it's a matter of
    the world or of the Dhamma, if thinking about it gives rise
    to anger or delusion in the mind, we shouldn't pay it any
    attention. We should think instead of the good that we've
    done in the past. For example, we can think of the good
    things we did together in the celebration of the year 2500
    B.E. Even though we've parted ways since then, we've come
    back together to do skillful and meritorious things once
    more. This is a caulking for the mind. In addition to that,
    we foster another form of goodness, called developing
    concentration. Developing concentration is a way of caulking
    the mind so that it doesn't develop any gaps, leaks, or
    holes. </p>
    <p>All of this is called caulking our boat -- the boat of the
    body. In Pali, this is called <strong><i>indriya-samvara-sila</i></strong><i>,</i>
    the principles of restraint over the sense faculties. We
    exercise restraint over our eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body,
    and mind, so that our boat will float on the ocean without
    sinking. This is called caulking our boat. </p>
    <p>What do we do next? We have to stock our boat with
    provisions. Once we're born in the world, our well-being
    depends on the requisites of life. We've eaten food, worn
    clothing, lived in shelter, and used medicine to treat the
    body. That's why we've been able to find as much comfort as
    we have. When we consider this fact, we have to turn and
    consider how others are getting along. When we see that we
    need these things to get along, we start stocking our boat by
    giving gifts of almsfood and making other donations for the
    purpose of all four requisites. This is called stocking our
    boat with provisions. Then we put up a mast and unfurl a
    sail. In other words, we invite a monk to get up on the
    sermon seat and teach the Dhamma as a way of inclining the
    mind in the right direction. The mind will then zip right
    along in line with the breeze of the Dhamma. And the body
    will go right along with it. For example, once we've heard
    the Dhamma we gain a feeling of contentment so that we want
    to hear it again. This is a sign that our boat has caught
    wind, and the wind is strong, so we sail right along. This
    will help our boat reach the other shore easily. If there's
    no sail to help it along, and we stock the boat with too many
    things, it may sink. This is why there's the custom, when
    anyone makes a donation, to have a sermon at the same time as
    a way of inclining the mind in the direction of the Dhamma.
    For our boat to get anywhere, it needs a sail. Then no matter
    how many provisions we haul on board, the boat will head in
    the direction we want it to. This is the second thing we need
    to know. </p>
    <p>The third thing is the method for distilling salt water so
    that it can become fresh. This stands for practicing
    tranquillity meditation and insight meditation. We give rise
    to directed thought and evaluation within the mind. And what
    is salt water? Salt water stands for defilement. The
    defilements of the mind are saltier than salt. When we try to
    eat salt -- even just a little -- we can't swallow it because
    we find it so salty, but the defilements are even saltier
    than that. They can crust us over so that we spoil and rot in
    all sorts of ways. When this is the case, what can we do? We
    have to filter or distill them. Filtering refers to <strong><i>yoniso
    manasikara</i></strong>, appropriate attention. Whatever we
    do, we have to reflect, to be observant, to consider things
    carefully before we act. This is the first vat in our
    distillery. </p>
    <p>Our second vat is meditation, contemplating our
    fabrications by using skillful strategies, giving rise to the
    factors of jhana. The first one is directed thought: keeping
    in mind the preoccupation that can act as a foundation for
    the mind -- its <strong><i>gocara-dhamma</i></strong><i>,</i>
    or proper range -- as a way of aiming it in the right
    direction by developing the four frames of reference <i>(</i><strong><i>satipatthana</i></strong><i>).
    </i>This is how we distill salt water. </p>
    <p>The four frames of reference are: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>focusing on the body in and of itself, <br>
        focusing on feelings in and of themselves, <br>
        focusing on the mind in and of itself, and <br>
        focusing on mental qualities in and of themselves. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>All four of these are gathered in the body and mind. This
    is one way of looking at them, called <strong><i>anuloma</i></strong><i>,</i>
    or in line with the standard way. The other way is called <strong><i>patiloma</i></strong><i>,</i>
    in reverse of the standard way, in which we take all four and
    turn them into one. The standard way is when we practice
    directed thought and evaluation. But when we take all four
    and turn them into one, we take only one part of the body, as
    they say in the Great Frames of Reference Discourse: we focus
    on the body in and of itself as an object of tranquillity
    meditation. In other words, we take all four parts and gather
    them into the body: the properties of earth, water, fire, and
    wind. That's the body. When we see that it has many parts and
    many aspects, preventing the mind from growing still, making
    it distracted, we choose only one of the parts. For example,
    we put aside the properties of earth, water, and fire, and
    stay still only with the property of wind. We focus down on
    the wind property as the object we keep in mind: this is
    called the body in and of itself. </p>
    <p>The wind property here means the in-and-out breath. When
    we keep the breath in mind and watch constantly over it,
    that's called developing the body in and of itself. When the
    breath comes in, we watch it. When it goes out, we watch it.
    We keep surveying it constantly. Sometimes it's coarse,
    sometimes it's refined, sometimes it's cool, sometimes it's
    warm. No matter what it's like, we keep watching it.
    Sometimes, just as we're about to reach something good in the
    meditation, we get discouraged. It's like boiling water in
    our distillery. Normally, two sorts of things can happen. If
    the fire is too strong, the water starts boiling so fast that
    it all turns into steam, overflows the vat, and puts out the
    fire. If the fire is too weak, the water doesn't boil and so
    it produces no steam at all. Sometimes the fire is just right
    -- not too strong, not too weak -- just right in between. The
    middle way. The fire is just enough to give rise to steam --
    not so much that it overflows the vat, but enough for steam
    to come out of the vat, enough for the steam to become drops
    of fresh water. </p>
    <p>This is why we're taught to be observant. When the desire
    to succeed in the meditation is really strong, it can keep
    the mind from growing still. The breath gets stirred up and
    can't grow subtle. This is called desire getting in the way.
    Sometimes the desire is too weak. You sit there, the mind
    still, the breath refined, light -- and you drift right to
    sleep. The water never comes to a boil. You have to put
    things together in the right proportions, just right, with
    mindfulness and alertness monitoring things at all times.
    When the mind is staying with coarse breathing, you know.
    When it's staying with refined breathing, you know. When your
    mindfulness and alertness are constant in this way, the
    result is rapture: the body is light, cool, comfortable, and
    at ease. The mind has a sense of fullness, blooming and
    bright in its concentration. This is where fresh water is
    beginning to gather in your distillery. The salt water begins
    to disappear. In other words, the salt water of sensual
    desire, ill will, sloth &amp; drowsiness, restlessness &amp;
    anxiety, and uncertainty -- letting the mind run to the past,
    run to the future, not clearly seeing the present -- begins
    to disappear. When the mind is really still and refined, it
    gives rise to concentration, with a sense of ease and
    fullness, so that you can sit for many hours. </p>
    <p>This is the same as taking a single jar of fresh water
    with us in our boat. If we have the intelligence to distill
    fresh water out of salt water, our one jar of water will
    become an amazing jar, providing us with enough water to
    drink all the way around the world. In the same way, when we
    develop concentration by using directed thought to lift the
    mind to its object as the first step in the first jhana, and
    evaluation to keep contemplating the object of our meditation
    to make it subtle and refined -- when the properties of the
    body have been thoroughly evaluated, the mind will be able to
    contemplate the drawbacks of the five hindrances. The body
    will grow quiet -- this is called <strong><i>kaya-passaddhi</i></strong><i>,</i>
    physical serenity; and the mind will grow still -- <strong><i>citta-passaddhi</i></strong><i>,</i>
    mental serenity. The body will be at ease, with no pains or
    heaviness: this is <strong><i>kaya-lahuta</i></strong><i>,</i>
    physical lightness. This is where rapture arises. The mind
    will feel full and satisfied, with no restlessness or
    distraction, like a person who has eaten his fill, or a child
    who has eaten its fill so that it no longer disturbs its
    mother or father. </p>
    <p>When the heart has rapture as its companion, it will be
    free from unrest. It will be cool. It will be able to use the
    fresh water it has distilled from salt water as a means of
    washing its clothing, as a means of bathing its body. Then it
    will be able to wash the earth property -- which is like a
    rag -- the water property, the wind property, and the fire
    property, all of which are like rags: they're always ripping
    and tearing, always getting dirty. This is why we have to
    care for them at all times. When the mind has given rise to
    the factors of concentration, the power of rapture will come
    to wash our properties of earth, water, wind, and fire. Then,
    if we want to be warm, we won't have to sit in the sunlight;
    if we want to be cool, we won't have to sit in the breeze.
    If, when we're stuck in the sunlight, we want to be cool,
    we'll be cool. If, when we're stuck in water, we want to be
    warm, we'll be warm. That way we can be at our ease, like a
    person who has clothing to cover his body, and so has no need
    to feel bashful when he enters human society. </p>
    <p>This is why meditators have no fear of difficult
    conditions. Why is that? Because they have their own source
    of fresh water: water to bathe in, water to drink. They've
    got all the water they need to use for bathing their body;
    for bathing their eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind;
    for bathing the properties of earth, water, wind, and fire.
    That's water for using. As for water for drinking: they can
    develop concentration to an even higher level, to give rise
    to a sense of inner pleasure: pleasure that arises from
    within the mind itself. When the mind feels pleasure, both
    the body and mind will be at their ease. The mind will imbibe
    nothing but pleasure -- and there's no pleasure higher than
    that of the mind at peace. Thus rapture is water for using,
    for bathing the body and mind; whereas pleasure is drinking
    water specifically for the mind. </p>
    <p>So whoever has the discernment to distill fresh water from
    salt water will experience ease and well-being. This is our
    first distillery. The second distillery is where we take the
    water from the first and distill it to even greater purity.
    This is the same as when they refine sugar: after the first
    stage, it still contains some alcohol, so they have to refine
    it a second time. This stands for developing insight
    meditation, something very refined -- so refined that nobody
    else can see it. You can stand and practice insight
    meditation, sit and practice insight meditation, you can lie
    down, you can even be giving a Dhamma talk and practice
    insight meditation: the mouth speaks, the mind thinks of its
    topic -- when you think of something to say, or thoughts
    simply arise within the mind, there's no attachment to bodily
    fabrication, i.e., the processes of the body; no attachment
    to verbal fabrication, i.e., the thoughts that fabricate
    words for other people to hear. There's no attachment to your
    words, and your mind doesn't run out after them. As for
    thoughts that arise from ignorance and craving, you know them
    immediately for what they are. The mind in that state isn't
    involved in bodily fabrication, verbal fabrication, or mental
    fabrication. The mind is then released from all fabrications.
    </p>
    <p>All fabrications that arise simply change and then
    disband. This is true of bodily fabrications, verbal
    fabrications, and mental fabrications. When you see these
    things in terms of their common characteristics, when you see
    them as </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong><i>inconstant</i></strong><i>,</i> constantly
        spinning around, <br>
        <strong><i>stressful</i></strong><i>,</i> hard to bear,
        and <br>
        <strong><i>not-self</i></strong><i>,</i> beyond your
        control, </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>then whether you're standing, sitting, lying down,
    performing physical work, or speaking -- even when you're
    just sitting and thinking alone by yourself -- you'll find
    all things good and noble flowing to you at all times. This
    is called practicing insight meditation. </p>
    <p>A person like this can then set up an enormous distillery,
    turning the water of the sea into clouds. When the water of
    the sea has been turned into clouds, they'll float through
    the sky. Wherever people are suffering from hardships, the
    water in the clouds will come raining down, watering the land
    where people live so that they can grow food conveniently. In
    the same way, when people have released their hearts from the
    power of worldliness, their goodness is like clouds. When the
    clouds turn into rain, the rain water will help good people
    live in happiness and well-being. This is one of the benefits
    that comes from those who have developed discernment. </p>
    <p>So I ask that all of you make a mental note of these three
    maxims: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>1) Caulk your boat.<br>
        2) Set up a mast, unfurl your sails so that they catch
        the wind, and then stock your boat with provisions by
        practicing generosity.<br>
        3) Learn how to take salt water and distill it into
        fresh. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Whoever can give rise to these skills within themselves
    will, at the very least, become good people. If they're not
    heedless, and make a continual effort, they will be able to
    take the mind beyond all becoming. </p>
    <p>So, all of you who have gathered together to make merit on
    this occasion: I ask that you accept, as a gift, the Dhamma
    described here; take it with you; and put it into practice.
    You will experience pleasure, flourish, and thrive in the
    Buddha's teachings. </p>
