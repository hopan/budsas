<BLOCKQUOTE>                                          
  The purification of conduct established by the prior three factors 
  serves as the basis for the next division of the path, the division of 
  concentration (<I>samadhikkhandha</I>). This present phase of practice, 
  which advances from moral restraint to direct mental training, 
  comprises the three factors of right effort, right mindfulness, and 
  right concentration. It gains its name from the goal to which it 
  aspires, the power of sustained concentration, itself required as the 
  support for insight-wisdom. Wisdom is the primary tool for 
  deliverance, but the penetrating vision it yields can only open up 
  when the mind has been composed and collected. Right concentration 
  brings the requisite stillness to the mind by unifying it with 
  undistracted focus on a suitable object. To do so, however, the factor 
  of concentration needs the aid of effort and mindfulness. Right effort 
  provides the energy demanded by the task, right mindfulness the 
  steadying points for awareness.
  <p>  
    The commentators illustrate the interdependence of the three factors 
  within the concentration group with a simple simile. Three boys go to 
  a park to play. While walking along they see a tree with flowering 
  tops and decide they want to gather the flowers. But the flowers are 
  beyond the reach even of the tallest boy. Then one friend bends down 
  and offers his back. The tall boy climbs up, but still hesitates to 
  reach for the flowers from fear of falling. So the third boy comes 
  over and offers his shoulder for support. The first boy, standing on 
  the back of the second boy, then leans on the shoulder of the third 
  boy, reaches up, and gathers the flowers.<A HREF="#n1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
  <p>  
    In this simile the tall boy who picks the flowers represents 
  concentration with its function of unifying the mind. But to unify the 
  mind concentration needs support: the energy provided by right effort, 
  which is like the boy who offers his back. It also requires the 
  stabilizing awareness provided by mindfulness, which is like the boy 
  who offers his shoulder. When right concentration receives this 
  support, then empowered by right effort and balanced by right 
  mindfulness it can draw in the scattered strands of thought and fix 
  the mind firmly on its object.
  <p>  
    Energy (<I>viriya</I>), the mental factor behind right effort, can 
  appear in either wholesome or unwholesome forms. The same factor fuels 
  desire, aggression, violence, and ambition on the one hand, and 
  generosity, self-discipline, kindness, concentration, and 
  understanding on the other. The exertion involved in right effort is a 
  wholesome form of energy, but it is something more specific, namely, 
  the energy in wholesome states of consciousness directed to liberation 
  from suffering. This last qualifying phrase is especially important. 
  For wholesome energy to become a contributor to the path it has to be 
  guided by right view and right intention, and to work in association 
  with the other path factors. Otherwise, as the energy in ordinary 
  wholesome states of mind, it merely engenders an accumulation of merit 
  that ripens within the round of birth and death; it does not issue in 
  liberation from the round.
  <p>  
    Time and again the Buddha has stressed the need for effort, for 
  diligence, exertion, and unflagging perseverance. The reason why 
  effort is so crucial is that each person has to work out his or her 
  own deliverance. The Buddha does what he can by pointing out the path 
  to liberation; the rest involves putting the path into practice, a 
  task that demands energy. This energy is to be applied to the 
  cultivation of the mind, which forms the focus of the entire path. The 
  starting point is the defiled mind, afflicted and deluded; the goal is 
  the liberated mind, purified and illuminated by wisdom. What comes in 
  between is the unremitting effort to transform the defiled mind into 
  the liberated mind. The work of self-cultivation is not easy -- there 
  is no one who can do it for us but ourselves -- but it is not 
  impossible. The Buddha himself and his accomplished disciples provide 
  the living proof that the task is not beyond our reach. They assure 
  us, too, that anyone who follows the path can accomplish the same 
  goal. But what is needed is effort, the work of practice taken up with 
  the determination: "I shall not give up my efforts until I have 
  attained whatever is attainable by manly perseverance, energy, and 
  endeavour."<A HREF="#n2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
  <p>  
    The nature of the mental process effects a division of right effort 
  into four "great endeavours":
  <p>
<ol>  
       <li>to prevent the arising of unarisen unwholesome states;
       
       <li>to abandon unwholesome states that have already arisen;
       
       <li>to arouse wholesome states that have not yet arisen;
       
       <li>to maintain and perfect wholesome states already arisen.
</ol>
<p>       
    The unwholesome states (<I>akusala dhamma</I>) are the defilements, and 
  the thoughts, emotions, and intentions derived from them, whether 
  breaking forth into action or remaining confined within. The wholesome 
  states (<I>kusala dhamma</I>) are states of mind untainted by 
  defilements, especially those conducing to deliverance. Each of the 
  two kinds of mental states imposes a double task. The unwholesome side 
  requires that the defilements lying dormant be prevented from erupting 
  and that the active defilements already present be expelled. The 
  wholesome side requires that the undeveloped liberating factors first 
  be brought into being, then persistently developed to the point of 
  full maturity. Now we will examine each of these four divisions of 
  right effort, giving special attention to their most fertile field of 
  application, the cultivation of the mind through meditation.
<p>
<ol>    
  <li> To prevent the arising of unarisen unwholesome states
<p>
<blockquote>       
       Herein the disciple rouses his will to avoid the arising of evil, 
       unwholesome states that have not yet arisen; and he makes effort, 
       stirs up his energy, exerts his mind and strives.<A HREF="#n3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
</blockquote>    
    The first side of right effort aims at overcoming unwholesome 
  states, states of mind tainted by defilements. Insofar as they impede 
  concentration the defilements are usually presented in a fivefold set 
  called the "five hindrances" (<I>pancanivarana</I>): sensual desire, ill 
  will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and worry, and doubt.<A HREF="#n4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> 
  They receive the name "hindrances" because they block the path to 
  liberation; they grow up and over the mind preventing calm and 
  insight, the primary instruments for progress. The first two 
  hindrances, sensual desire and ill will, are the strongest of the set, 
  the most formidable barriers to meditative growth, representing, 
  respectively, the unwholesome roots of greed and aversion. The other 
  three hindrances, less toxic but still obstructive, are offshoots of 
  delusion, usually in association with other defilements.
  <p>  
    <I>Sensual desire</I> is interpreted in two ways. Sometimes it is 
  understood in a narrow sense as lust for the "five strands of sense 
  pleasure," i.e. agreeable sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches; 
  sometimes a broader interpretation is given, by which the term becomes 
  inclusive of craving in all its modes, whether for sense pleasures, 
  wealth, power, position, fame, or anything else it can settle upon. 
  The second hindrance, <I>ill will</I>, is a synonym for aversion. It 
  comprises hatred, anger, resentment, repulsion of every shade, whether 
  directed towards other people, towards oneself, towards objects, or 
  towards situations. The third hindrance, <I>dullness and drowsiness</I>, 
  is a compound of two factors linked together by their common feature 
  of mental unwieldiness. One is dullness (<I>thina</I>), manifest as 
  mental inertia; the other is drowsiness (<I>middha</I>), seen in mental 
  sinking, heaviness of mind, or excessive inclination to sleep. At the 
  opposite extreme is the fourth hindrance, <I>restlessness and worry</I>. 
  This too is a compound with its two members linked by their common 
  feature of disquietude. Restlessness (<I>uddhacca</I>) is agitation or 
  excitement, which drives the mind from thought to thought with speed 
  and frenzy; worry (<I>kukkucca</I>) is remorse over past mistakes and 
  anxiety about their possible undesired consequences. The fifth 
  hindrance, <I>doubt</I>, signifies a chronic indecisiveness and lack of 
  resolution: not the probing of critical intelligence, an attitude 
  encouraged by the Buddha, but a persistent inability to commit oneself 
  to the course of spiritual training due to lingering doubts concerning 
  the Buddha, his doctrine, and his path. 
  <p>  
    The first effort to be made regarding the hindrances is the effort 
  to prevent the unarisen hindrances from arising; this is also called 
  the endeavour to restrain (<I>samvarappadhana</I>). The effort to hold 
  the hindrances in check is imperative both at the start of meditative 
  training and throughout the course of its development. For when the 
  hindrances arise, they disperse attention and darken the quality of 
  awareness, to the detriment of calm and clarity. The hindrances do not 
  come from outside the mind but from within. They appear through the 
  activation of certain tendencies constantly lying dormant in the deep 
  recesses of the mental continuum, awaiting the opportunity to surface. 
  <p>  
    Generally what sparks the hindrances into activity is the input 
  afforded by sense experience. The physical organism is equipped with 
  five sense faculties each receptive to its own specific kind of data 
  -- the eye to forms, the ear to sounds, the nose to smells, the tongue 
  to tastes, the body to tangibles. Sense objects continuously impinge 
  on the senses, which relay the information they receive to the mind, 
  where it is processed, evaluated, and accorded an appropriate 
  response. But the mind can deal with the impressions it receives in 
  different ways, governed in the first place by the manner in which it 
  attends to them. When the mind adverts to the incoming data 
  carelessly, with unwise consideration (<I>ayoniso manasikara</I>), the 
  sense objects tend to stir up unwholesome states. They do this either 
  directly, through their immediate impact, or else indirectly by 
  depositing memory traces which later may swell up as the objects of 
  defiled thoughts, images, and fantasies. As a general rule the 
  defilement that is activated corresponds to the object: attractive 
  objects provoke desire, disagreeable objects provoke ill will, and 
  indeterminate objects provoke the defilements connected with delusion.
  <p>  
    Since an uncontrolled response to the sensory input stimulates the 
  latent defilements, what is evidently needed to prevent them from 
  arising is control over the senses. Thus the Buddha teaches, as the 
  discipline for keeping the hindrances in check, an exercise called the 
  restraint of the sense faculties (<I>indriya-samvara</I>):
  <p>
<blockquote>     
       When he perceives a form with the eye, a sound with the ear, an 
       odour with the nose, a taste with the tongue, an impression with 
       the body, or an object with the mind, he apprehends neither the 
       sign nor the particulars. And he strives to ward off that through 
       which evil and unwholesome states, greed and sorrow, would arise, 
       if he remained with unguarded senses; and he watches over his 
       senses, restrains his senses.<A HREF="#n5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>
</blockquote>       
    Restraint of the senses does not mean denial of the senses, 
  retreating into a total withdrawal from the sensory world. This is 
  impossible, and even if it could be achieved, the real problem would 
  still not be solved; for the defilements lie in the mind, not in the 
  sense organs or objects. The key to sense control is indicated by the 
  phrase "not apprehending the sign or the particulars." The "sign" 
  (<I>nimitta</I>) is the object's general appearance insofar as this 
  appearance is grasped as the basis for defiled thoughts; the 
  "particulars" (<I>anubyanjana</I>) are its less conspicuous features. If 
  sense control is lacking, the mind roams recklessly over the sense 
  fields. First it grasps the sign, which sets the defilements into 
  motion, then it explores the particulars, which permits them to 
  multiply and thrive.
  <p>  
    To restrain the senses requires that mindfulness and clear 
  understanding be applied to the encounter with the sense fields. Sense 
  consciousness occurs in a series, as a sequence of momentary cognitive 
  acts each having its own special task. The initial stages in the 
  series occur as automatic functions: first the mind adverts to the 
  object, then apprehends it, then admits the percept, examines it, and 
  identifies it. Immediately following the identification a space opens 
  up in which there occurs a free evaluation of the object leading to 
  the choice of a response. When mindfulness is absent the latent 
  defilements, pushing for an opportunity to emerge, will motivate a 
  wrong consideration. One will grasp the sign of the object, explore 
  its details, and thereby give the defilements their opportunity: on 
  account of greed one will become fascinated by an agreeable object, on 
  account of aversion one will be repelled by a disagreeable object. But 
  when one applies mindfulness to the sensory encounter, one nips the 
  cognitive process in the bud before it can evolve into the stages that 
  stimulate the dormant taints. Mindfulness holds the hindrances in 
  check by keeping the mind at the level of what is sensed. It rivets 
  awareness on the given, preventing the mind from embellishing the 
  datum with ideas born of greed, aversion, and delusion. Then, with 
  this lucent awareness as a guide, the mind can proceed to comprehend 
  the object as it is, without being led astray.
  <p>  
    
  <li> To abandon the arisen unwholesome states
  <p>
<blockquote>     
       Herein the disciple rouses his will to overcome the evil, 
       unwholesome states that have already arisen and he makes effort, 
       stirs up his energy, exerts his mind and strives.<A HREF="#n6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>
</blockquote>       
    Despite the effort at sense control the defilements may still 
  surface. They swell up from the depths of the mental continuum, from 
  the buried strata of past accumulations, to congeal into unwholesome 
  thoughts and emotions. When this happens a new kind of effort becomes 
  necessary, the effort to abandon arisen unwholesome states, called for 
  short the endeavour to abandon (<I>pahanappadhana</I>):
  <p>
<blockquote>     
       He does not retain any thought of sensual lust, ill will, or 
       harmfulness, or any other evil and unwholesome states that may 
       have arisen; he abandons them, dispels them, destroys them, 
       causes them to disappear.<A HREF="#n7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>
</blockquote>       
  Just as a skilled physician has different medicines for different 
  ailments, so the Buddha has different antidotes for the different 
  hindrances, some equally applicable to all, some geared to a 
  particular hindrance. In an important discourse the Buddha explains 
  five techniques for expelling distracting thoughts.<A HREF="#n8"><SUP>8</SUP></A> The first is to 
  expel the defiled thought with a wholesome thought which is its exact 
  opposite, analogous to the way a carpenter might use a new peg to 
  drive out an old one. For each of the five hindrances there is a 
  specific remedy, a line of meditation designed expressly to deflate it 
  and destroy it. This remedy can be applied intermittently, when a 
  hindrance springs up and disrupts meditation on the primary subject; 
  or it can be taken as a primary subject itself, used to counter a 
  defilement repeatedly seen to be a persistent obstacle to one's 
  practice. But for the antidote to become effective in the first role, 
  as a temporary expedient required by the upsurge of a hindrance, it is 
  best to gain some familiarity with it by making it a primary object, 
  at least for short periods.
<p>  
  For desire a remedy of general application is the meditation on 
  impermanence, which knocks away the underlying prop of clinging, the 
  implicit assumption that the objects clung to are stable and durable. 
  For desire in the specific form of sensual lust the most potent 
  antidote is the contemplation of the unattractive nature of the body, 
  to be dealt with at greater length in the next chapter. Ill will meets 
  its proper remedy in the meditation on lovingkindness (<I>metta</I>), 
  which banishes all traces of hatred and anger through the methodical 
  radiation of the altruistic wish that all beings be well and happy. 
  The dispelling of dullness and drowsiness calls for a special effort 
  to arouse energy, for which several methods are suggested: the 
  visualization of a brilliant ball of light, getting up and doing a 
  period of brisk walking meditation, reflection on death, or simply 
  making a firm determination to continue striving. Restlessness and 
  worry are most effectively countered by turning the mind to a simple 
  object that tends to calm it down; the method usually recommended is 
  mindfulness of breathing, attention to the in-and-out flow of the 
  breath. In the case of doubt the special remedy is investigation: to 
  make inquiries, ask questions, and study the teachings until the 
  obscure points become clear.<A HREF="#n9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
  <p>
  Whereas this first of the five methods for expelling the hindrances 
  involves a one-to-one alignment between a hindrance and its remedy, 
  the other four utilize general approaches. The second marshals the 
  forces of shame (<I>hiri</I>) and moral dread (<I>ottappa</I>) to abandon 
  the unwanted thought: one reflects on the thought as vile and ignoble 
  or considers its undesirable consequences until an inner revulsion 
  sets in which drives the thought away. The third method involves a 
  deliberate diversion of attention. When an unwholesome thought arises 
  and clamours to be noticed, instead of indulging it one simply shuts 
  it out by redirecting one's attention elsewhere, as if closing one's 
  eyes or looking away to avoid an unpleasant sight. The fourth method 
  uses the opposite approach. Instead of turning away from the unwanted 
  thought, one confronts it directly as an object, scrutinizes its 
  features, and investigates its source. When this is done the thought 
  quiets down and eventually disappears. For an unwholesome thought is 
  like a thief: it only creates trouble when its operation is concealed, 
  but put under observation it becomes tame. The fifth method, to be 
  used only as a last resort, is suppression -- vigorously restraining 
  the unwholesome thought with the power of the will in the way a strong 
  man might throw a weaker man to the ground and keep him pinned there 
  with his weight.
  <p>
  By applying these five methods with skill and discretion, the Buddha 
  says, one becomes a master of all the pathways of thought. One is no 
  longer the subject of the mind but its master. Whatever thought one 
  wants to think, that one will think. Whatever thought one does not 
  want to think, that one will not think. Even if unwholesome thoughts 
  occasionally arise, one can dispel them immediately, just as quickly 
  as a red-hot pan will turn to steam a few chance drops of water.
  <p>
  
  <li> To arouse unarisen wholesome states
  <p>
<blockquote>
       Herein the disciple rouses his will to arouse wholesome states 
       that have not yet arisen; and he makes effort, stirs up his 
       energy, exerts his mind and strives.<A HREF="#n10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>
</blockquote>       
    Simultaneously with the removal of defilements, right effort also 
  imposes the task of cultivating wholesome states of mind. This 
  involves two divisions: the arousing of wholesome states not yet 
  arisen and the maturation of wholesome states already arisen.
 <p>   
    The first of the two divisions is also known as the endeavour to 
  develop (<I>bhavanappadhana</I>). Though the wholesome states to be 
  developed can be grouped in various ways -- serenity and insight, the 
  four foundations of mindfulness, the eight factors of the path, etc. 
  -- the Buddha lays special stress on a set called the seven factors of 
  enlightenment (<I>satta bojjhanga</I>): mindfulness, investigation of 
  phenomena, energy, rapture, tranquillity, concentration, and 
  equanimity. 
  <p>
  Thus he develops the factors of enlightenment, based on solitude, on 
  detachment, on cessation, and ending in deliverance, namely: the 
  enlightenment factors of mindfulness, investigation of phenomena, 
  energy, rapture, tranquillity, concentration, and equanimity.<A HREF="#n11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>
  <p>
  The seven states are grouped together as "enlightenment factors" both 
  because they lead to enlightenment and because they constitute 
  enlightenment. In the preliminary stages of the path they prepare the 
  way for the great realization; in the end they remain as its 
  components. The experience of enlightenment, perfect and complete 
  understanding, is just these seven components working in unison to 
  break all shackles and bring final release from sorrow.
  <p>
  The way to enlightenment starts with <I>mindfulness</I>. Mindfulness 
  clears the ground for insight into the nature of things by bringing to 
  light phenomena in the now, the present moment, stripped of all 
  subjective commentary, interpretations, and projections. Then, when 
  mindfulness has brought the bare phenomena into focus, the factor of 
  <I>investigation</I> steps in to search out their characteristics, 
  conditions, and consequences. Whereas mindfulness is basically 
  receptive, investigation is an active factor which unflinchingly 
  probes, analyzes, and dissects phenomena to uncover their fundamental 
  structures.
  <p>
  The work of investigation requires <I>energy</I>, the third factor of 
  enlightenment, which mounts in three stages. The first, inceptive 
  energy, shakes off lethargy and arouses initial enthusiasm. As the 
  work of contemplation advances, energy gathers momentum and enters the 
  second stage, perseverance, wherein it propels the practice without 
  slackening. Finally, at the peak, energy reaches the third stage, 
  invincibility, where it drives contemplation forward leaving the 
  hindrances powerless to stop it.
  <p>
  As energy increases, the fourth factor of enlightenment is quickened. 
  This is <I>rapture</I>, a pleasurable interest in the object. Rapture 
  gradually builds up, ascending to ecstatic heights: waves of bliss run 
  through the body, the mind glows with joy, fervour and confidence 
  intensify. But these experiences, as encouraging as they are, still 
  contain a flaw: they create an excitation verging on restlessness. 
  With further practice, however, rapture subsides and a tone of 
  quietness sets in signalling the rise of the fifth factor, 
  <I>tranquillity</I>. Rapture remains present, but it is now subdued, and 
  the work of contemplation proceeds with self-possessed serenity.
  <p>
  Tranquillity brings to ripeness <I>concentration</I>, the sixth factor, 
  one-pointed unification of mind. Then, with the deepening of 
  concentration, the last enlightenment factor comes into dominance. 
  This is <I>equanimity</I>, inward poise and balance free from the two 
  defects of excitement and inertia. When inertia prevails, energy must 
  be aroused; when excitement prevails, it is necessary to exercise 
  restraint. But when both defects have been vanquished the practice can 
  unfold evenly without need for concern. The mind of equanimity is 
  compared to the driver of a chariot when the horses are moving at a 
  steady pace: he neither has to urge them forward nor to hold them 
  back, but can just sit comfortably and watch the scenery go by. 
  Equanimity has the same "on-looking" quality. When the other factors 
  are balanced the mind remains poised watching the play of phenomena.
  <p>
  
  <li> To maintain arisen wholesome states
<p>
<blockquote>       
       Herein the disciple rouses his will to maintain the wholesome 
       things that have already arisen, and not to allow them to 
       disappear, but to bring them to growth, to maturity, and to the 
       full perfection of development; and he makes effort, stirs up his 
       energy, exerts his mind and strives.<A HREF="#n12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>
</blockquote>       
    This last of the four right efforts aims at maintaining the arisen 
  wholesome factors and bringing them to maturity. Called the "endeavour 
  to maintain" (<I>anurakkhanappadhana</I>), it is explained as the effort 
  to "keep firmly in the mind a favourable object of concentration that 
  has arisen."<A HREF="#n13"><SUP>13</SUP></A> The work of guarding the object causes the seven 
  enlightenment factors to gain stability and gradually increase in 
  strength until they issue in the liberating realization. This marks 
  the culmination of right effort, the goal in which the countless 
  individual acts of exertion finally reach fulfilment.
