<BLOCKQUOTE>                                          
  The Buddha says that the Dhamma, the ultimate truth of things, is 
  directly visible, timeless, calling out to be approached and seen. He 
  says further that it is always available to us, and that the place 
  where it is to be realized is within oneself.<A HREF="#n1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> The ultimate truth, 
  the Dhamma, is not something mysterious and remote, but the truth of 
  our own experience. It can be reached only by understanding our 
  experience, by penetrating it right through to its foundations. This 
  truth, in order to become liberating truth, has to be known directly. 
  It is not enough merely to accept it on faith, to believe it on the 
  authority of books or a teacher, or to think it out through deductions 
  and inferences. It has to be known by insight, grasped and absorbed by 
  a kind of knowing which is also an immediate seeing.
  <p>  
    What brings the field of experience into focus and makes it 
  accessible to insight is a mental faculty called in Pali <i>sati</i>, 
  usually translated as "mindfulness." Mindfulness is presence of mind, 
  attentiveness or awareness. Yet the kind of awareness involved in 
  mindfulness differs profoundly from the kind of awareness at work in 
  our usual mode of consciousness. All consciousness involves awareness 
  in the sense of a knowing or experiencing of an object. But with the 
  practice of mindfulness awareness is applied at a special pitch. The 
  mind is deliberately kept at the level of <I>bare attention</I>, a 
  detached observation of what is happening within us and around us in 
  the present moment. In the practice of right mindfulness the mind is 
  trained to remain in the present, open, quiet, and alert, 
  contemplating the present event. All judgements and interpretations 
  have to be suspended, or if they occur, just registered and dropped. 
  The task is simply to note whatever comes up just as it is occurring, 
  riding the changes of events in the way a surfer rides the waves on 
  the sea. The whole process is a way of coming back into the present, 
  of standing in the here and now without slipping away, without getting 
  swept away by the tides of distracting thoughts.
  <p>  
    It might be assumed that we are always aware of the present, but 
  this is a mirage. Only seldom do we become aware of the present in the 
  precise way required by the practice of mindfulness. In ordinary 
  consciousness the mind begins a cognitive process with some impression 
  given in the present, but it does not stay with it. Instead it uses 
  the immediate impression as a springboard for building blocks of 
  mental constructs which remove it from the sheer facticity of the 
  datum. The cognitive process is generally interpretative. The mind 
  perceives its object free from conceptualization only briefly. Then, 
  immediately after grasping the initial impression, it launches on a 
  course of ideation by which it seeks to interpret the object to 
  itself, to make it intelligible in terms of its own categories and 
  assumptions. To bring this about the mind posits concepts, joins the 
  concepts into constructs -- sets of mutually corroborative concepts -- 
  then weaves the constructs together into complex interpretative 
  schemes. In the end the original direct experience has been overrun by 
  ideation and the presented object appears only dimly through dense 
  layers of ideas and views, like the moon through a layer of clouds.
  <p>  
    The Buddha calls this process of mental construction <I>papanca</I>, 
  "elaboration," "embellishment," or "conceptual proliferation." The 
  elaborations block out the presentational immediacy of phenomena; they 
  let us know the object only "at a distance," not as it really is. But 
  the elaborations do not only screen cognition; they also serve as a 
  basis for projections. The deluded mind, cloaked in ignorance, 
  projects its own internal constructs outwardly, ascribing them to the 
  object as if they really belonged to it. As a result, what we know as 
  the final object of cognition, what we use as the basis for our 
  values, plans, and actions, is a patchwork product, not the original 
  article. To be sure, the product is not wholly illusion, not sheer 
  fantasy. It takes whatis given in immediate experience as its 
  groundwork and raw material, but along with this it includes something 
  else: the embellishments fabricated by the mind.
  <p>  
    The springs for this process of fabrication, hidden from view, are 
  the latent defilements. The defilements create the embellishments, 
  project them outwardly, and use them as hooks for coming to the 
  surface, where they cause further distortion. To correct the erroneous 
  notions is the task of wisdom, but for wisdom to discharge its work 
  effectively, it needs direct access to the object as it is in itself, 
  uncluttered by the conceptual elaborations. The task of right 
  mindfulness is to clear up the cognitive field. Mindfulness brings to 
  light experience in its pure immediacy. It reveals the object as it is 
  before it has been plastered over with conceptual paint, overlaid with 
  interpretations. To practice mindfulness is thus a matter not so much 
  of doing but of undoing: not thinking, not judging, not associating, 
  not planning, not imagining, not wishing. All these "doings" of ours 
  are modes of interference, ways the mind manipulates experience and 
  tries to establish its dominance. Mindfulness undoes the knots and 
  tangles of these "doings" by simply noting. It does nothing but note, 
  watching each occasion of experience as it arises, stands, and passes 
  away. In the watching there is no room for clinging, no compulsion to 
  saddle things with our desires. There is only a sustained 
  contemplation of experience in its bare immediacy, carefully and 
  precisely and persistently.
  <p>  
    Mindfulness exercises a powerful grounding function. It anchors the 
  mind securely in the present, so it does not float away into the past 
  and future with their memories, regrets, fears, and hopes. The mind 
  without mindfulness is sometimes compared to a pumpkin, the mind 
  established in mindfulness to a stone.<A HREF="#n2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> A pumpkin placed on the 
  surface of a pond soon floats away and always remains on the water's 
  surface. But a stone does not float away; it stays where it is put and 
  at once sinks into the water until it reaches bottom. Similarly, when 
  mindfulness is strong, the mind stays with its object and penetrates 
  its characteristics deeply. It does not wander and merely skim the 
  surface as the mind destitute of mindfulness does.
  <p>  
    Mindfulness facilitates the achievement of both serenity and 
  insight. It can lead to either deep concentration or wisdom, depending 
  on the mode in which it is applied. Merely a slight shift in the mode 
  of application can spell the difference between the course the 
  contemplative process takes, whether it descends to deeper levels of 
  inner calm culminating in the stages of absorption, the <I>jhanas</I>, or 
  whether instead it strips away the veils of delusion to arrive at 
  penetrating insight. To lead to the stages of serenity the primary 
  chore of mindfulness is to keep the mind on the object, free from 
  straying. Mindfulness serves as the guard charged with the 
  responsibility of making sure that the mind does not slip away from 
  the object to lose itself in random undirected thoughts. It also keeps 
  watch over the factors stirring in the mind, catching the hindrances 
  beneath their camouflages and expelling them before they can cause 
  harm. To lead to insight and the realizations of wisdom, mindfulness 
  is exercised in a more differentiated manner. Its task, in this phase 
  of practice, is to observe, to note, to discern phenomena with utmost 
  precision until their fundamental characteristics are brought to 
  light.
  <p>  
    Right mindfulness is cultivated through a practice called "the four 
  foundations of mindfulness" (<I>cattaro satipatthana</I>), the mindful 
  contemplation of four objective spheres: the body, feelings, states of 
  mind, and phenomena.<A HREF="#n3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> As the Buddha explains:
    
       <BLOCKQUOTE>And what, monks, is right mindfulness? Herein, a monk dwells 
       contemplating the body in the body, ardent, clearly comprehending 
       and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief concerning 
       the world. He dwells contemplating feelings in feelings ... 
       states of mind in states of mind ... phenomena in phenomena, 
       ardent, clearly comprehending and mindful, having put away 
       covetousness and grief concerning the world.<A HREF="#n4"><SUP>4</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>
       
    The Buddha says that the four foundations of mindfulness form "the 
  only way that leads to the attainment of purity, to the overcoming of 
  sorrow and lamentation, to the end of pain and grief, to the entering 
  upon the right path and the realization of Nibbana."<A HREF="#n5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> They are 
  called "the only way" (<I>ekayana magga</I>), not for the purpose of 
  setting forth a narrow dogmatism, but to indicate that the attainment 
  of liberation can only issue from the penetrating contemplation of the 
  field of experience undertaken in the practice of right mindfulness.
   <p> 
    Of the four applications of mindfulness, the contemplation of the 
  body is concerned with the material side of existence; the other three 
  are concerned principally (though not solely) with the mental side. 
  The completion of the practice requires all four contemplations. 
  Though no fixed order is laid down in which they are to be taken up, 
  the body is generally taken first as the basic sphere of 
  contemplation; the others come into view later, when mindfulness has 
  gained in strength and clarity. Limitations of space do not allow for 
  a complete explanation of all four foundations. Here we have to settle 
  for a brief synopsis.
  
<a name="body">  
  <p><hr size=5 align=center width=45%><p>                                        
 <H3 ALIGN=center>(1) Contemplation of the Body (<I>kayanupassana</I>)</H3>
  <p><hr size=5 align=center width=45%><p>

  The Buddha begins his exposition of the body with contemplation of the 
  mindfulness of breathing (<I>anapanasati</I>). Though not required as a 
  starting point for meditation, in actual practice mindfulness of 
  breathing usually serves as the "root meditation subject" 
  (<I>mulakammatthana</I>), the foundation for the entire course of 
  contemplation. It would be a mistake, however, to consider this 
  subject merely an exercise for neophytes. By itself mindfulness of 
  breathing can lead to all the stages of the path culminating in full 
  awakening. In fact it was this meditation subject that the Buddha used 
  on the night of his own enlightenment. He also reverted to it 
  throughout the years during his solitary retreats, and constantly 
  recommended it to the monks, praising it as "peaceful and sublime, an 
  unadulterated blissful abiding, which banishes at once and stills evil 
  unwholesome thoughts as soon as they arise" (MN 118).
  <p>
  Mindfulness of breathing can function so effectively as a subject of 
  meditation because it works with a process that is always available to 
  us, the process of respiration. What it does to turn this process into 
  a basis for meditation is simply to bring it into the range of 
  awareness by making the breath an object of observation. The 
  meditation requires no special intellectual sophistication, only 
  awareness of the breath. One merely breathes naturally through the 
  nostrils keeping the breath in mind at the contact point around the 
  nostrils or upper lip, where the sensation of breath can be felt as 
  the air moves in and out. There should be no attempt to control the 
  breath or to force it into predetermined rhythms, only a mindful 
  contemplation of the natural process of breathing in and out. The 
  awareness of breath cuts through the complexities of discursive 
  thinking, rescues us from pointless wandering in the labyrinth of vain 
  imaginings, and grounds us solidly in the present. For whenever we 
  become aware of breathing, really aware of it, we can be aware of it 
  only in the present, never in the past or the future.
  <p>
  The Buddha's exposition of mindfulness of breathing involves four 
  basic steps. The first two (which are not necessarily sequential) 
  require that a long inhalation or exhalation be noted as it occurs, 
  and that a short inhalation or exhalation be noted as it occurs. One 
  simply observes the breath moving in and out, observing it as closely 
  as possible, noting whether the breath is long or short. As 
  mindfulness grows sharper, the breath can be followed through the 
  entire course of its movement, from the beginning of an inhalation 
  through its intermediary stages to its end, then from the beginning of 
  an exhalation through its intermediary stages to its end. This third 
  step is called "clearly perceiving the entire (breath) body." The 
  fourth step, "calming the bodily function," involves a progressive 
  quieting down of the breath and its associated bodily functions until 
  they become extremely fine and subtle. Beyond these four basic steps 
  lie more advanced practices which direct mindfulness of breathing 
  towards deep concentration and insight.<A HREF="#n6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>
  <p>
  Another practice in the contemplation of the body, which extends 
  meditation outwards from the confines of a single fixed position, is 
  mindfulness of the postures. The body can assume four basic postures 
  -- walking, standing, sitting, and lying down -- and a variety of 
  other positions marking the change from one  posture to another. 
  Mindfulness of the postures focuses full attention on the body in 
  whatever position it assumes: when walking one is aware of walking, 
  when standing one is aware of standing, when sitting one is aware of 
  sitting, when lying down one is aware of lying down, when changing 
  postures one is aware of changing postures. The contemplation of the 
  postures illuminates the impersonal nature of the body. It reveals 
  that the body is not a self or the belonging of a self, but merely a 
  configuration of living matter subject to the directing influence of 
  volition.
  <p>
  The next exercise carries the extension of mindfulness a step further. 
  This exercise, called "mindfulness and clear comprehension" 
  (<I>satisampajanna</I>), adds to the bare awareness an element of 
  understanding. When performing any action, one performs it with full 
  awareness or clear comprehension. Going and coming, looking ahead and 
  looking aside, bending and stretching, dressing, eating, drinking, 
  urinating, defecating, falling asleep, waking up, speaking, remaining 
  silent -- all become occasions for the progress of meditation when 
  done with clear comprehension. In the commentaries clear comprehension 
  is explained as fourfold: (1) understanding the purpose of the action, 
  i.e. recognizing its aim and determining whether that aim accords with 
  the Dhamma; (2) understanding suitability, i.e. knowing the most 
  efficient means to achieve one's aim; (3) understanding the range of 
  meditation, i.e. keeping the mind constantly in a meditative frame 
  even when engaged in action; and (4) understanding without delusion, 
  i.e. seeing the action as an impersonal process devoid of a 
  controlling ego-entity.<A HREF="#n7"><SUP>7</SUP></A> This last aspect will be explored more 
  thoroughly in the last chapter, on the development of wisdom.
  <p>
  The next two sections on mindfulness of the body present analytical 
  contemplations intended to expose the body's real nature. One of these 
  is the meditation on the body's unattractiveness, already touched on 
  in connection with right effort; the other, the analysis of the body 
  into the four primary elements. The first, the meditation on 
  unattractiveness,<A HREF="#n8"><SUP>8</SUP></A> is designed to counter infatuation with the body, 
  especially in its form of sexual desire. The Buddha teaches that the 
  sexual drive is a manifestation of craving, thus a cause of <I>dukkha</I> 
  that has to be reduced and extricated as a precondition for bringing 
  <I>dukkha</I> to an end. The meditation aims at weakening sexual desire 
  by depriving the sexual urge of its cognitive underpinning, the 
  perception of the body as sensually alluring. Sensual desire rises and 
  falls together with this perception. It springs up because we view the 
  body as attractive; it declines when this perception of beauty is 
  removed. The perception of bodily attractiveness in turn lasts only so 
  long as the body is looked at superficially, grasped in terms of 
  selected impressions. To counter that perception we have to refuse to 
  stop with these impressions but proceed to inspect the body at a 
  deeper level, with a probing scrutiny grounded in dispassion.
  <p>
  Precisely this is what is undertaken in the meditation on 
  unattractiveness, which turns back the tide of sensuality by pulling 
  away its perceptual prop. The meditation takes one's own body as 
  object, since for a neophyte to start off with the body of another, 
  especially a member of the opposite sex, might fail to accomplish the 
  desired result. Using visualization as an aid, one mentally dissects 
  the body into its components and investigates them one by one, 
  bringing their repulsive nature to light. The texts mention thirty-two 
  parts: head-hairs, body-hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, 
  bones, marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, large 
  intestines, small intestines, stomach contents, excrement, brain, 
  bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, snot, spittle, 
  sinovial fluid, and urine. The repulsiveness of the parts implies the 
  same for the whole: the body seen closeup is truly unattractive, its 
  beautiful appearance a mirage. But the aim of this meditation must not 
  be misapprehended. The aim is not to produce aversion and disgust but 
  detachment, to extinguish the fire of lust by removing its fuel.<A HREF="#n9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
  <p>
  The other analytical contemplation deals with the body in a different 
  way. This meditation, called the analysis into elements 
  (<I>dhatuvavatthana</I>), sets out to counter our innate tendency to 
  identify with the body by exposing the body's essentially impersonal 
  nature. The means it employs, as its name indicates, is the mental 
  dissection of the body into the four primary elements, referred to by 
  the archaic names earth, water, fire, and air, but actually signifying 
  the four principal behavioural modes of matter: solidity, fluidity, 
  heat, and oscillation. The solid element is seen most clearly in the 
  body's solid parts -- the organs, tissues, and bones; the fluid 
  element, in the bodily fluids; the heat element, in the body's 
  temperature; the oscillation element, in the respiratory process. The 
  break with the identification of the body as "I" or "my self" is 
  effected by a widening of perspective after the elements have come 
  into view. Having analyzed the body into the elements, one then 
  considers that all four elements, the chief aspects of bodily 
  existence, are essentially identical with the chief aspects of 
  external matter, with which the body is in constant interchange. When 
  one vividly realizes this through prolonged meditation, one ceases to 
  identify with the body, ceases to cling to it. One sees that the body 
  is nothing more than a particular configuration of changing material 
  processes which support a stream of changing mental processes. There 
  is nothing here that can be considered a truly existent self, nothing 
  that can provide a substantial basis for the sense of personal 
  identity.<A HREF="#n10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>
  <p>
  The last exercise in mindfulness of the body is a series of "cemetery 
  meditations," contemplations of the body's disintegration after death, 
  which may be performed either imaginatively, with the aid of pictures, 
  or through direct confrontation with a corpse. By any of these means 
  one obtains a clear mental image of a decomposing body, then applies 
  the process to one's own body, considering: "This body, now so full of 
  life, has the same nature and is subject to the same fate. It cannot 
  escape death, cannot escape disintegration, but must eventually die 
  and decompose." Again, the purpose of this meditation should not be 
  misunderstood. The aim is not to indulge in a morbid fascination with 
  death and corpses, but to sunder our egoistic clinging to existence 
  with a contemplation sufficiently powerful to break its hold. The 
  clinging to existence subsists through the implicit assumption of 
  permanence. In the sight of a corpse we meet the teacher who proclaims 
  unambiguously: "Everything formed is impermanent."
  
  <a name="Feeling">
  <p><hr size=5 align=center width=45%><p>
<H3 ALIGN=center>(2) Contemplation of Feeling (<I>vedananupassana</I>)</H3>
  <p><hr size=5 align=center width=45%><p>

  The next foundation of mindfulness is feeling (<I>vedana</I>). The word 
  "feeling" is used here, not in the sense of emotion (a complex 
  phenomenon best subsumed under the third and fourth foundations of 
  mindfulness), but in the narrower sense of the affective tone or 
  "hedonic quality" of experience. This may be of three kinds, yielding 
  three principal types of feeling: pleasant feeling, painful feeling, 
  and neutral feeling. The Buddha teaches that feeling is an inseparable 
  concomitant of consciousness, since every act of knowing is coloured 
  by some affective tone. Thus feeling is present at every moment of 
  experience; it may be strong or weak, clear or indistinct, but some 
  feeling must accompany the cognition.
  <p>  
    Feeling arises in dependence on a mental event called "contact" 
  (<I>phassa</I>). Contact marks the "coming together" of consciousness 
  with the object via a sense faculty; it is the factor by virtue of 
  which consciousness "touches" the object presenting itself to the mind 
  through the sense organ. Thus there are six kinds of contact 
  distinguished by the six sense faculties -- eye-contact, ear-contact, 
  nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, and mind-contact -- and 
  six kinds of feeling distinguished by the contact from which they 
  spring.
  <p>  
    Feeling acquires special importance as an object of contemplation 
  because it is feeling that usually triggers the latent defilements 
  into activity. The feelings may not be clearly registered, but in 
  subtle ways they nourish and sustain the dispositions to unwholesome 
  states. Thus when a pleasant feeling arises, we fall under the 
  influence of the defilement greed and cling to it. When a painful 
  feeling occurs, we respond with displeasure, hate, and fear, which are 
  aspects of aversion. And when a neutral feeling occurs, we generally 
  do not notice it, or let it lull us into  a false sense of security -- 
  states of mind governed by delusion. From this it can be seen that 
  each of the root defilements is conditioned by a particular kind of  
  feeling: greed by pleasant feeling, aversion by painful feeling, 
  delusion by neutral feeling.
  <p>  
    But the link between feelings and the defilements is not a necessary 
  one. Pleasure does not always have to lead to greed, pain to aversion, 
  neutral feeling to delusion. The tie between them can be snapped, and 
  one essential means for snapping it is mindfulness. Feeling will stir 
  up a defilement only when it is not noticed, when it is indulged 
  rather than observed. By turning it into an object of observation, 
  mindfulness defuses the feeling so that it cannot provoke an 
  unwholesome response. Then, instead of relating to the feeling by way 
  of habit through attachment, repulsion, or apathy, we relate by way of 
  contemplation, using the feeling as a springboard for understanding 
  the nature of experience.
  <p>  
    In the early stages the contemplation of feeling involves attending 
  to the arisen feelings, noting their distinctive qualities: pleasant, 
  painful, neutral. The feeling is noted without identifying with it, 
  without taking it to be "I" or "mine" or something happening "to me." 
  Awareness is kept at the level of bare attention: one watches each 
  feeling that arises, seeing it as merely a feeling, a bare mental 
  event shorn of all subjective references, all pointers to an ego. The 
  task is simply to note the feeling's quality, its tone of pleasure, 
  pain, or neutrality.
  <p>  
    But as practice advances, as one goes on noting each feeling, 
  letting it go and noting the next, the focus of attention shifts from 
  the qualities of feelings to the process of feeling itself. The 
  process reveals a ceaseless flux of feelings arising and dissolving, 
  succeeding one another without a halt. Within the process there is 
  nothing lasting. Feeling itself is only a stream of events, occasions 
  of feeling flashing into being moment by moment, dissolving as soon as 
  they arise. Thus begins the insight into impermanence, which, as it 
  evolves, overturns the three unwholesome roots. There is no greed for 
  pleasant feelings, no aversion for painful feelings, no delusion over 
  neutral feelings. All are seen as merely fleeting and substanceless 
  events devoid of any true enjoyment or basis for involvement.
    
 <a name="Mind">   
  <p><hr size=5 align=center width=45%><p>  
        <H3 ALIGN=center>(3) Contemplation of the State of Mind (<I>cittanupassana</I>)</H3>
  <p><hr size=5 align=center width=45%><p>
  
  With this foundation of mindfulness we turn from a particular mental 
  factor, feeling, to the general state of mind to which that factor 
  belongs. To understand what is entailed by this contemplation it is 
  helpful to look at the Buddhist conception of the mind. Usually we 
  think of the mind as an enduring faculty remaining identical with 
  itself through the succession of experiences. Though experience 
  changes, the mind which undergoes the changing experience seems to 
  remain the same, perhaps modified in certain ways but still retaining 
  its identity. However, in the Buddha's teaching the notion of a 
  permanent mental organ is rejected. The mind is regarded, not as a 
  lasting subject of thought, feeling, and volition, but as a sequence 
  of momentary mental acts, each distinct and discrete, their 
  connections with one another causal rather than substantial.
  <p>  
    A single act of consciousness is called a <i>citta</i>, which we shall  
  render "a state of mind." Each citta consists of many components, the 
  chief of which is consciousness itself, the basic experiencing of the 
  object; consciousness is also called <i>citta</i>, the name for the whole 
  being given to its principal part. Along with consciousness every 
  citta contains a set of concomitants called <I>cetasikas</I>, mental 
  factors. These include feeling, perception, volition, the emotions, 
  etc.; in short, all the mental functions except the primary knowing of 
  the object, which is citta or consciousness.
  <p>  
    Since consciousness in itself is just a bare experiencing of an 
  object, it cannot be differentiated through its own nature but only by 
  way of its associated factors, the cetasikas. The cetasikas colour the 
  citta and give it its distinctive character; thus when we want to 
  pinpoint the citta as an object of contemplation, we have to do so by 
  using the cetasikas as indicators. In his exposition of the 
  contemplation of the state of mind, the Buddha mentions, by reference 
  to cetasikas, sixteen kinds of citta to be noted: the mind with lust, 
  the mind without lust, the mind with aversion, the mind without 
  aversion, the mind with delusion, the mind without delusion, the 
  cramped mind, the scattered mind, the developed mind, the undeveloped 
  mind, the surpassable mind, the unsurpassable mind, the concentrated 
  mind, the unconcentrated mind, the freed mind, the unfreed mind. For 
  practical purposes it is sufficient at the start to focus solely on 
  the first six states, noting whether the mind is associated with any 
  of the unwholesome roots or free from them. When a particular citta is 
  present, it is contemplated merely as a citta, a state of mind. It is 
  not identified with as "I" or "mine," not taken as a self or as 
  something belonging to a self. Whether it is a pure state of mind or a 
  defiled state, a lofty state or a low one, there should be no  elation 
  or dejection, only a clear recognition of the state. The state is 
  simply noted, then allowed to pass without clinging to the desired 
  ones or resenting the undesired ones.
  <p>  
    As contemplation deepens, the contents of the mind become 
  increasingly rarefied. Irrelevant flights of thought, imagination, and 
  emotion subside, mindfulness becomes clearer, the mind remains 
  intently aware, watching its own process of becoming. At times there 
  might appear to be a persisting observer behind the process, but with 
  continued practice even this apparent observer disappears. The mind 
  itself -- the seemingly solid, stable mind -- dissolves into a stream 
  of cittas flashing in and out of being moment by moment, coming from 
  nowhere and going nowhere, yet continuing in sequence without pause.

  In the context of the fourth foundation of mindfulness, the 
  multivalent word <I>dhamma</I> (here intended in the plural) has two 
  interconnected meanings, as the account in the sutta shows. One 
  meaning is <I>cetasikas</I>, the mental factors, which are now attended 
  to in their own right apart from their role as colouring the state of 
  mind, as was done in the previous contemplation. The other meaning is 
  the elements of actuality, the ultimate constituents of experience as 
  structured in the Buddha's teaching.To convey both senses we render 
  <I>dhamma</I> as "phenomena," for lack of a better alternative. But when 
  we do so this should not be taken to imply the existence of some 
  <I>noumenon</I> or substance behind the phenomena.The point of the 
  Buddha's teaching of <I>anatta</I>, egolessness, is that the basic 
  constituents of actuality are bare phenomena (<I>suddha-dhamma</I>) 
  occurring without any noumenal support.
   <p> 
    The sutta section on the contemplation of phenomena is divided into 
  five sub-sections, each devoted to a different set of phenomena: the 
  five hindrances, the five aggregates, the six inner and outer sense 
  bases, the seven factors of enlightenment, and the Four Noble Truths. 
  Among these, the five hindrances and the seven enlightenment factors 
  are <i>dhamma</i> in the narrower sense of mental factors, the others are 
  <i>dhamma</i> in the broader sense of constituents of actuality. (In the 
  third section, however, on the sense bases, there is a reference to 
  the fetters that arise through the senses; these can also be included 
  among the mental factors.) In the present chapter we shall deal 
  briefly only with the two groups that may be regarded as <i>dhamma</i> in 
  the sense of mental factors. We already touched on both of these in 
  relation to right effort (Chapter V); now we shall consider them in 
  specific connection with the practice of right mindfulness. We shall 
  discuss the other types of <i>dhamma</i> -- the five aggregates and the 
  six senses -- in the final chapter, in relation to the development of 
  wisdom.
  <p>  
    The five hindrances and seven factors of enlightenment require 
  special attention because they are the principal impediments and aids 
  to liberation. The hindrances -- sensual desire, ill will, dullness 
  and drowsiness, restlessness and worry, and doubt -- generally become 
  manifest in an early stage of practice, soon after the initial 
  expectations and gross disturbances subside and the subtle tendencies 
  find the opportunity to surface. Whenever one of the hindrances crops 
  up, its presence should be noted; then, when it fades away, a note 
  should be made of its disappearance. To ensure that the hindrances are 
  kept under control an element of comprehension is needed: we have to 
  understand how the hindrances arise, how they can be removed, and how 
  they can be prevented from arising in the future.<A HREF="#n11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>
  <p>  
    A similar mode of contemplation is to be applied to the seven 
  factors of enlightenment: mindfulness, investigation, energy, rapture, 
  tranquillity, concentration, and equanimity. When any one of these 
  factors arises, its presence should be noted. Then, after noting its 
  presence, one has to investigate to discover how it arises and how it 
  can be matured.<A HREF="#n12"><SUP>12</SUP></A> When they first spring up, the enlightenment 
  factors are weak, but with consistent cultivation they accumulate 
  strength. Mindfulness initiates the contemplative process. When it 
  becomes well-established, it arouses investigation, the probing 
  quality of intelligence. Investigation in turn calls forth energy, 
  energy gives rise to rapture, rapture leads to tranquillity, 
  tranquillity to one-pointed concentration, and concentration to 
  equanimity. Thus the whole evolving course of practice leading to 
  enlightenment begins with mindfulness, which remains throughout as the 
  regulating power ensuring that the mind is clear, cognizant, and 
  balanced.
