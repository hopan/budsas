  This completes our survey of the Noble Eightfold Path, the way to 
  deliverance from suffering taught by the Buddha. The higher reaches of 
  the path may seem remote from us in our present position, the demands 
  of practice may appear difficult to fulfil. But even if the heights of 
  realization are now distant, all that we need to reach them lies just 
  beneath our feet. The eight factors of the path are always accessible 
  to us; they are mental components which can be established in the mind 
  simply through determination and effort. We have to begin by 
  straightening out our views and clarifying our intentions. Then we 
  have to purify our conduct -- our speech, action, and livelihood. 
  Taking these measures as our foundation, we have to apply ourselves 
  with energy and mindfulness to the cultivation of concentration and 
  insight. The rest is a matter of gradual practice and gradual 
  progress, without expecting quick results. For some progress may be 
  rapid, for others it may be slow, but the rate at which progress 
  occurs should not cause elation or discouragement. Liberation is the 
  inevitable fruit of the path and is bound to blossom forth when there 
  is steady and persistent practice. The only requirements for reaching 
  the final goal are two: to start and to continue. If these 
  requirements are met there is no doubt the goal will be attained. This 
  is the Dhamma, the undeviating law.
