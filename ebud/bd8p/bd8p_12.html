  The eight factors of the Noble Eightfold Path are not steps to be 
  followed in sequence, one after another. They can be more aptly 
  described as components rather than as steps, comparable to the 
  intertwining strands of a single cable that requires the contributions 
  of all the strands for maximum strength. With a certain degree of 
  progress all eight factors can be present simultaneously, each 
  supporting the others. However, until that point is reached, some 
  sequence in the unfolding of the path is inevitable. Considered from 
  the standpoint of practical training, the eight path factors divide 
  into three groups: (i) the moral discipline group (<I>silakkhandha</I>), 
  made up of right speech, right action, and right livelihood; (ii) the 
  concentration group (<I>samadhikkhandha</I>), made up of right effort, 
  right mindfulness, and right concentration; and (iii) the wisdom group 
  (<I>pannakkhandha</I>), made up of right view and right intention. These 
  three groups represent three stages of training: the training in the 
  higher moral  discipline, the training in the higher consciousness, 
  and the training in the higher wisdom.<sup><A HREF="#n1">1</A></sup>
 <p> 
    The order of the three trainings is determined by the overall aim 
  and direction of the path. Since the final goal to which the path 
  leads, liberation from suffering, depends ultimately on uprooting 
  ignorance, the climax of the path must be the training directly 
  opposed to ignorance. This is the training in wisdom, designed to 
  awaken the faculty of penetrative understanding which sees things "as 
  they really are." Wisdom unfolds by degrees, but even the faintest 
  flashes of insight presuppose as their basis a mind that has been 
  concentrated, cleared of disturbance and distraction. Concentration is 
  achieved through the training in the higher consciousness, the second 
  division of the path, which brings the calm and collectedness needed 
  to develop wisdom. But in order for the mind to be unified in 
  concentration, a check must be placed on the unwholesome dispositions 
  which ordinarily dominate its workings, since these dispositions 
  disperse the beam of attention and scatter it among a multitude of 
  concerns. The unwholesome dispositions continue to rule as long as 
  they are permitted to gain expression through the channels of body and 
  speech as bodily and verbal deeds. Therefore, at the very outset of 
  training, it is necessary to restrain the faculties of action, to 
  prevent them from becoming tools of the defilements. This task is 
  accomplished by the first division of the path, the training in moral 
  discipline. Thus the path evolves through its three stages, with moral 
  discipline as the foundation for concentration, concentration the 
  foundation for wisdom, and wisdom the direct instrument for reaching 
  liberation.
 <p>   
    Perplexity sometimes arises over an apparent inconsistency in the 
  arrangement of the path factors and the threefold training. Wisdom -- 
  which includes right view and right intention -- is the last stage in 
  the threefold training, yet its factors are placed at the beginning of 
  the path rather than at its end, as might be expected according to the 
  canon of strict consistency. The sequence of the path factors, 
  however, is not the result of a careless slip, but is determined by an 
  important logistical consideration, namely, that right view and right 
  intention of a preliminary type are called for at the outset as the 
  spur for entering the threefold training. Right view provides the 
  perspective for practice, right intention the sense of direction. But 
  the two do not expire in this preparatory role. For when the mind has 
  been refined by the training in moral discipline and concentration, it 
  arrives at a superior right view and right intention, which now form 
  the proper training in the higher wisdom.
  <p>  
    Right view is the forerunner of the entire path, the guide for all 
  the other factors. It enables us to understand our starting point, our 
  destination, and the successive landmarks to pass as practice 
  advances. To attempt to engage in the practice without a foundation of 
  right view is to risk getting lost in the futility of undirected 
  movement. Doing so might be compared to wanting to drive someplace 
  without consulting a roadmap or listening to the suggestions of an 
  experienced driver. One might get into the car and start to drive, but 
  rather than approaching closer to one's destination, one is more 
  likely to move farther away from it. To arrive at the desired place 
  one has to have some idea of its general direction and of the roads 
  leading to it. Analogous considerations apply to the practice of the 
  path, which takes place in a framework of understanding established by 
  right view.
    <P>
    The importance of right view can be gauged from the fact that our 
  perspectives on the crucial issues of reality and value have a bearing 
  that goes beyond mere theoretical convictions. They govern our 
  attitudes, our actions, our whole orientation to existence. Our views 
  might not be clearly formulated in our mind; we might have only a hazy 
  conceptual grasp of our beliefs. But whether formulated or not, 
  expressed or maintained in silence, these views have a far-reaching 
  influence. They structure our perceptions, order our values, 
  crystallize into the ideational framework through which we interpret 
  to ourselves the meaning of our being in the world.
   <P> 
    These views then condition action. They lie behind our choices and 
  goals, and our efforts to turn these goals from ideals into actuality. 
  The actions themselves might determine consequences, but the actions 
  along with their consequences hinge on the views from which they 
  spring. Since views imply an "ontological commitment," a decision on 
  the question of what is real and true, it follows that views divide 
  into two classes, right views and wrong views. The former correspond 
  to what is real, the latter deviate from the real and confirm the 
  false in its place. These two different kinds of views, the Buddha 
  teaches, lead to radically disparate lines of action, and thence to 
  opposite results. If we hold a wrong view, even if that view is vague, 
  it will lead us towards courses of action that eventuate in suffering. 
  On the other hand, if we adopt a right view, that view will steer us 
  towards right action, and thereby towards freedom from suffering. 
  Though our conceptual orientation towards the world might seem 
  innocuous and inconsequential, when looked at closely it reveals 
  itself to be the decisive determinant of our whole course of future 
  development. The Buddha himself says that he sees no single factor so 
  responsible for the arising of unwholesome states of mind as wrong 
  view, and no factor so helpful for the arising of wholesome states of 
  mind as right view. Again, he says that there is no single factor so 
  responsible for the suffering of living beings as wrong view, and no 
  factor so potent in promoting the good of living beings as right view 
  (AN 1:16.2).
 <P>
    In its fullest measure right view involves a correct understanding 
  of the entire Dhamma or teaching of the Buddha, and thus its scope is 
  equal to the range of the Dhamma itself. But for practical purposes 
  two kinds of right view stand out as primary. One is mundane right 
  view, right view which operates within the confines of the world. The 
  other is supramundane right view, the superior right view which leads 
  to liberation from the world. The first is concerned with the laws 
  governing material and spiritual progress within the round of 
  becoming, with the principles that lead to higher and lower states of 
  existence, to mundane happiness and suffering. The second is concerned 
  with the principles essential to liberation. It does not aim merely at 
  spiritual progress from life to life, but at emancipation from the 
  cycle of recurring lives and deaths.

<h2 align=center> Mundane Right View</h2>
 <P><hr size=5 align=center width=45%><p>            
                             
  Mundane right view involves a correct grasp of the law of kamma, the 
  moral efficacy of action. Its literal name is "right view of the 
  ownership of action" (<I>kammassakata sammaditthi</I>), and it finds its 
  standard formulation in the statement: "Beings are the owners of their 
  actions, the heirs of their actions; they spring from their actions, 
  are bound to their actions, and are supported by their actions. 
  Whatever deeds they do, good or bad, of those they shall be heirs."<sup><A HREF="#n2">2</A></sup> 
  More specific formulations have also come down in the texts. One stock 
  passage, for example, affirms that virtuous actions such as giving and 
  offering alms have moral significance, that good and bad deeds produce 
  corresponding fruits, that one has a duty to serve mother and father, 
  that there is rebirth and a world beyond the visible one, and that 
  religious teachers of high attainment can be found who expound the 
  truth about the world on the basis of their own superior 
  realization.<A HREF="#n3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
  <p>
    To understand the implications of this form of right view we first 
  have to examine the meaning of its key term, <i>kamma</i>. The word 
  <i>kamma</i> means action. For Buddhism the relevant kind of action is 
  volitional action, deeds expressive of morally determinate volition, 
  since it is volition that gives the action ethical significance. Thus 
  the Buddha expressly identifies action with volition. In a discourse 
  on the analysis of kamma he says: "Monks, it is volition that I call 
  action (<i>kamma</i>). Having willed, one performs an action through 
  body, speech, or mind."<A HREF="#n4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> The identification of kamma with volition 
  makes kamma essentially a mental event, a factor originating in the 
  mind which seeks to actualize the mind's drives, dispositions, and 
  purposes. Volition comes into being through any of three channels -- 
  body, speech, or mind -- called the three doors of action 
  (<I>kammadvara</I>). A volition expressed through the body is a bodily 
  action; a volition expressed through speech is a verbal action; and a 
  volition that issues in thoughts, plans, ideas, and other mental 
  states without gaining outer expression is a mental action. Thus the 
  one factor of volition differentiates into three types of kamma 
  according to the channel through which it becomes manifest.
  <p>  
    Right view requires more than a simple knowledge of the general 
  meaning of kamma. It is also necessary to understand: (i) the ethical 
  distinction of kamma into the unwholesome and the wholesome; (ii) the 
  principal cases of each type; and (iii) the roots from which these 
  actions spring. As expressed in a sutta: "When a noble disciple 
  understands what is kammically unwholesome, and the root of 
  unwholesome kamma, what is kammically wholesome, and the root of 
  wholesome kamma, then he has right view."<SUP><A HREF="#n5">5</A></SUP>
    
    <OL TYPE=i>
   <LI> Taking these points in order, we find that kamma is first 
     distinguished as unwholesome (<I>akusala</I>) and wholesome (<I>kusala</I>). 
     Unwholesome kamma is action that is morally blameworthy, detrimental 
     to spiritual development, and conducive to suffering for oneself and 
     others. Wholesome kamma, on the other hand, is action that is morally 
     commendable, helpful to spiritual growth, and productive of benefits 
     for oneself and others.
       <p>
   <LI> Innumerable instances of unwholesome and wholesome kamma can be 
     cited, but the Buddha selects ten of each as primary. These he calls 
     the ten courses of unwholesome and wholesome action. Among the ten in 
     the two sets, three are bodily, four are verbal, and three are mental. 
     The ten courses of unwholesome kamma may be listed as follows, divided 
     by way of their doors of expression:
   <p>
  
    <OL>
   <LI>   Destroying life
   <LI>   Taking what is not given      
   <LI>   Wrong conduct in regard to sense pleasures   
   <LI>   False speech
   <LI>   Slanderous speech --  Verbal action
   <LI>   Harsh speech        (<I>vacikamma</I>) 
   <LI>   Idle chatter
   <LI>   Covetousness
   <LI>   Ill will  
   <LI>   Wrong view   
</OL>  
    
<p>
    The ten courses of wholesome kamma are the opposites of these: 
  abstaining from the first seven courses of unwholesome kamma, being 
  free from covetousness and ill will, and holding right view. Though 
  the seven cases of abstinence are exercised entirely by the mind and 
  do not necessarily entail overt action, they are still designated 
  wholesome bodily and verbal action because they centre on the control 
  of the faculties of body and speech.
    <p>
<li> Actions are distinguished as wholesome and unwholesome on the 
  basis of their underlying motives, called "roots" (<I>mula</I>), which 
  impart their moral quality to the volitions concomitant with 
  themselves. Thus kamma is wholesome or unwholesome according to 
  whether its roots are wholesome or unwholesome. The roots are 
  threefold for each set. The unwholesome roots are the three 
  defilements we already mentioned -- greed, aversion, and delusion. Any 
  action originating from these is an unwholesome kamma. The three 
  wholesome roots are their opposites, expressed negatively in the old 
  Indian fashion as non-greed (<I>alobha</I>), non-aversion (<I>adosa</I>), 
  and non-delusion (<I>amoha</I>). Though these are negatively designated, 
  they signify not merely the absence of defilements but the 
  corresponding virtues. Non-greed implies renunciation, detachment, and 
  generosity; non-aversion implies loving-kindness, sympathy, and 
  gentleness; and non-delusion implies wisdom. Any action originating 
  from these roots is a wholesome kamma.
    </ol><p>
    The most important feature of kamma is its capacity to produce 
  results corresponding to the ethical quality of the action. An 
  immanent universal law holds sway over volitional actions, bringing it 
  about that these actions issue in retributive consequences, called 
  <I>vipaka</I>, "ripenings," or <I>phala</I>, "fruits." The law connecting 
  actions with their fruits works on the simple principle that 
  unwholesome actions ripen in suffering, wholesome actions in 
  happiness. The ripening need not come right away; it need not come in 
  the present life at all. Kamma can operate across the succession of 
  lifetimes; it can even remain dormant for aeons into the future. But 
  whenever we perform a volitional action, the volition leaves its 
  imprint on the mental continuum, where it remains as a stored up 
  potency. When the stored up kamma meets with conditions favourable to 
  its maturation, it awakens from its dormant state and triggers off 
  some effect that brings due compensation for the original action. The 
  ripening may take place in the present life, in the next life, or in 
  some life subsequent to the next. A kamma may ripen by producing 
  rebirth into the next existence, thus determining the basic form of 
  life; or it may ripen in the course of a lifetime, issuing in our 
  varied experiences of happiness and pain, success and failure, 
  progress and decline. But whenever it ripens and in whatever way, the 
  same principle invariably holds: wholesome actions yield favourable 
  results, unwholesome actions yield unfavourable results.
  <p>  
    To recognize this principle is to hold right view of the mundane 
  kind. This view at once excludes the multiple forms of wrong view with 
  which it is incompatible. As it affirms that our actions have an 
  influence on our destiny continuing into future lives, it opposes the 
  nihilistic view which regards this life as our only existence and 
  holds that consciousness terminates with death. As it grounds the 
  distinction between good and evil, right and wrong, in an objective 
  universal principle, it opposes the ethical subjectivism which asserts 
  that good and evil are only postulations of personal opinion or means 
  to social control. As it affirms that people can choose their actions 
  freely, within limits set by their conditions, it opposes the "hard 
  deterministic" line that our choices are always made subject to 
  necessitation, and hence that free volition is unreal and moral 
  responsibility untenable.
  <p>  
    Some of the implications of the Buddha's teaching on the right view 
  of kamma and its fruits run counter to popular trends in present-day 
  thought, and it is helpful to make these differences explicit. The 
  teaching on right view makes it known that good and bad, right and 
  wrong, transcend conventional opinions about what is good and bad, 
  what is right and wrong. An entire society may be predicated upon a 
  confusion of correct moral values, and even though everyone within 
  that society may applaud one particular kind of action as right and 
  condemn another kind as wrong, this does not make them validly right 
  and wrong. For the Buddha moral standards are objective and 
  invariable. While the moral character of deeds is doubtlessly 
  conditioned by the circumstances under which they are performed, there 
  are objective criteria of morality against which any action, or any 
  comprehensive moral code, can be evaluated. This objective standard of 
  morality is integral to the Dhamma, the cosmic law of truth and 
  righteousness. Its transpersonal ground of validation is the fact that 
  deeds, as expressions of the volitions that engender them, produce 
  consequences for the agent, and that the correlations between deeds 
  and their consequences are intrinsic to the volitions themselves. 
  There is no divine judge standing above the cosmic process who assigns 
  rewards and punishments. Nevertheless, the deeds themselves, through 
  their inherent moral or immoral nature, generate the appropriate 
  results.
  <p>  
    For most people, the vast majority, the right view of kamma and its 
  results is held out of confidence, accepted on faith from an eminent 
  spiritual teacher who proclaims the moral efficacy of action. But even 
  when the principle of kamma is not personally seen, it still remains a 
  facet of <I>right view</I>. It is part and parcel of right view because 
  right view is concerned with understanding -- with understanding our 
  place in the total scheme of things -- and one who accepts the 
  principle that our volitional actions possess a moral potency has, to 
  that extent, grasped an important fact pertaining to the nature of our 
  existence. However, the right view of the kammic efficacy of action 
  need not remain exclusively an article of belief screened behind an 
  impenetrable barrier. It can become a matter of direct seeing. Through 
  the attainment of certain states of deep concentration it is possible 
  to develop a special faculty called the "divine eye" 
  (<I>dibbacakkhu</I>), a super-sensory power of vision that reveals things 
  hidden from the eyes of flesh. When this faculty is developed, it can 
  be directed out upon the world of living beings to investigate the 
  workings of the kammic law. With the special vision it confers one can 
  then see for oneself, with immediate perception, how beings pass away 
  and re-arise according to their kamma, how they meet happiness and 
  suffering through the maturation of their good and evil deeds.<A HREF="#n6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>

 <h2 align=center>Superior Right View</h2>

    The right view of kamma and its fruits provides a rationale for 
  engaging in wholesome actions and attaining high status within the 
  round of rebirths, but by itself it does not lead to liberation. It is 
  possible for someone to accept the law of kamma yet still limit his 
  aims to mundane achievements. One's motive for performing noble deeds 
  might be the accumulation of meritorious kamma leading to prosperity 
  and success here and now, a fortunate rebirth as a human being, or the 
  enjoyment of celestial bliss in the heavenly worlds. There is nothing 
  within the logic of kammic causality to impel the urge to transcend 
  the cycle of kamma and its fruit. The impulse to deliverance from the 
  entire round of becoming depends upon the acquisition of a different 
  and deeper perspective, one which yields insight into the inherent 
  defectiveness of all forms of samsaric existence, even the most 
  exalted.
    <p>
    This superior right view leading to liberation is the understanding 
  of the Four Noble Truths. It is this right view that figures as the 
  first factor of the  Noble Eightfold Path in the proper sense: as the 
  <I>noble</I> right view. Thus the Buddha defines the path factor of right 
  view expressly in terms of the four truths: "What now is right view? 
  It is understanding of suffering (<I>dukkha</I>), understanding of the 
  origin of suffering, understanding of the cessation of suffering, 
  understanding of the way leading to the cessation to suffering."<A HREF="#n7"><SUP>7</SUP></A> 
  The Eightfold Path starts with a conceptual understanding of the Four 
  Noble Truths apprehended only obscurely through the media of thought 
  and reflection. It reaches its climax in a direct intuition of those 
  same truths, penetrated with a clarity tantamount to enlightenment. 
  Thus it can be said that the right view of the Four Noble Truths forms 
  both the beginning and the culmination of the way to the end of 
  suffering.
    <p>
    The first noble truth is the truth of suffering (<I>dukkha</I>), the 
  inherent unsatisfactoriness of existence, revealed in the 
  impermanence, pain, and perpetual incompleteness intrinsic to all 
  forms of life.
    <p>
<blockquote>
    This is the noble truth of suffering. Birth is suffering; aging is 
  suffering; sickness is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, 
  lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are suffering; association with 
  the unpleasant is suffering; separation from the pleasant is 
  suffering; not to get what one wants is suffering; in brief, the five 
  aggregates of clinging are suffering.<A HREF="#n8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>
</blockquote>
   <p> 
    The last statement makes a comprehensive claim that calls for some 
  attention. The five aggregates of clinging (<I>pancupadanakkandha</I>) 
  are a classificatory scheme for understanding the nature of our being. 
  What we are, the Buddha teaches, is a set of five aggregates -- 
  material form, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and 
  consciousness -- all connected with clinging. We are the five and the 
  five are us. Whatever we identify with, whatever we hold to as our 
  self, falls within the set of five aggregates. Together these five 
  aggregates generate the whole array of thoughts, emotions, ideas, and 
  dispositions in which we dwell, "our world." Thus the Buddha's 
  declaration that the five aggregates are <I>dukkha</I> in effect brings 
  all experience, our entire existence, into the range of <I>dukkha</I>.
   <p> 
    But here the question arises: Why should the Buddha say that the 
  five aggregates are <i>dukkha</i>? The reason he says that the five 
  aggregates are <i>dukkha</i> is that they are impermanent. They change 
  from moment to moment, arise and fall away, without anything 
  substantial behind them persisting through the change. Since the 
  constituent factors of our being are always changing, utterly devoid 
  of a permanent core, there is nothing we can cling to in them as a 
  basis for security. There is only a constantly disintegrating flux 
  which, when clung to in the desire for permanence, brings a plunge 
  into suffering.
    <p>
    The second noble truth points out the cause of <i>dukkha</i>. From the 
  set of defilements which eventuate in suffering, the Buddha singles 
  out craving (<I>tanha</I>) as the dominant and most pervasive cause, "the 
  origin of suffering."
    <p>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>
   This is the noble truth of the origin of suffering. It is this 
  craving which produces repeated existence, is bound up with delight 
  and lust, and seeks pleasure here and there, namely, craving for sense 
  pleasures, craving for existence, and craving for non-existence.<A HREF="#n9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <p>
    The third noble truth simply reverses this relationship of 
  origination. If craving is the cause of <i>dukkha</i>, then to be free 
  from <i>dukkha</i> we have to eliminate craving. Thus the Buddha says:
    <p>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>
   This is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering. It is the 
  complete fading away and cessation of this craving, its forsaking and 
  abandonment, liberation and detachment from it.<A HREF="#n10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <p>
    The state of perfect peace that comes when craving is eliminated is 
  <I>Nibbana</I> (<I>nirvana</I>), the unconditioned state experienced while 
  alive with the extinguishing of the flames of greed, aversion, and 
  delusion. The fourth noble truth shows the way to reach the end of 
  <i>dukkha</i>, the way to the realization of Nibbana. That way is the 
  Noble Eightfold Path itself.
    <p>
    The right view of the Four Noble Truths develops in two stages. The 
  first is called the right view that accords with the truths 
  (<I>saccanulomika samma ditthi</I>); the second, the right view that 
  penetrates the truths (<I>saccapativedha samma ditthi</I>). To acquire 
  the right view that accords with the truths requires a clear 
  understanding of their meaning and significance in our lives. Such an 
  understanding arises first by learning the truths and studying them. 
  Subsequently it is deepened by reflecting upon them in the light of 
  experience until one gains a strong conviction as to their veracity.
    <p>
    But even at this point the truths have not been penetrated, and thus 
  the understanding achieved is still defective, a matter of concept 
  rather than perception. To arrive at the experiential realization of 
  the truths it is necessary to take up the practice of meditation -- 
  first to strengthen the capacity for sustained concentration, then to 
  develop insight. Insight arises by contemplating the five aggregates, 
  the factors of existence, in order to discern their real 
  characteristics. At the climax of such contemplation the mental eye 
  turns away from the conditioned phenomena comprised in the aggregates 
  and shifts its focus to the unconditioned state, Nibbana, which 
  becomes accessible through the deepened faculty of insight. With this 
  shift, when the mind's eye sees Nibbana, there takes place a 
  simultaneous penetration of all Four Noble Truths. By seeing Nibbana, 
  the state beyond <i>dukkha</i>, one gains a perspective from which to 
  view the five aggregates and see that they are <i>dukkha</i> simply 
  because they are conditioned, subject to ceaseless change. At the same 
  moment Nibbana is realized, craving stops; the understanding then 
  dawns that craving is the true origin of <i>dukkha</i>. When Nibbana is 
  seen, it is realized to be the state of peace, free from the turmoil 
  of becoming. And because this experience has been reached by 
  practising the Noble Eightfold Path, one knows for oneself that the 
  Noble Eightfold Path is truly the way to the end of <i>dukkha</i>.
    <p>
    This right view that penetrates the Four Noble Truths comes at the 
  end of the path, not at the beginning. We have to start with the right 
  view conforming to the truths, acquired through learning and fortified 
  through reflection. This view inspires us to take up the practice, to 
  embark on the threefold training in moral discipline, concentration, 
  and wisdom. When the training matures, the eye of wisdom opens by 
  itself, penetrating the truths and freeing the mind from bondage.
