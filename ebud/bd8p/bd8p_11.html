  The search for a spiritual path is born out of suffering. It does not 
  start with lights and ecstasy, but with the hard tacks of pain, 
  disappointment, and confusion. However, for suffering to give birth to 
  a genuine spiritual search, it must amount to more than something 
  passively received from without. It has to trigger an inner 
  realization, a perception which pierces through the facile complacency 
  of our usual encounter with the world to glimpse the insecurity 
  perpetually gaping underfoot. When this insight dawns, even if only 
  momentarily, it can precipitate a profound personal crisis. It 
  overturns accustomed goals and values, mocks our routine 
  preoccupations, leaves old enjoyments stubbornly unsatisfying.
  <p>
    At first such changes generally are not welcome. We try to deny our 
  vision and to smother our doubts; we struggle to drive away the 
  discontent with new pursuits. But the flame of inquiry, once lit, 
  continues to burn, and if we do not let ourselves be swept away by 
  superficial readjustments or slouch back into a patched up version of 
  our natural optimism, eventually the original glimmering of insight 
  will again flare up, again confront us with our essential plight. It 
  is precisely at that point, with all escape routes blocked, that we 
  are ready to seek a way to bring our disquietude to an end. No longer 
  can we continue to drift complacently through life, driven blindly by 
  our hunger for sense pleasures and by the pressure of prevailing 
  social norms. A deeper reality beckons us; we have heard the call of a 
  more stable, more authentic happiness, and until we arrive at our 
  destination we cannot rest content.
    <p>
    But it is just then that we find ourselves facing a new difficulty. 
  Once we come to recognize the need for a spiritual path we discover 
  that spiritual teachings are by no means homogeneous and mutually 
  compatible. When we browse through the shelves of humanity's spiritual 
  heritage, both ancient and contemporary, we do not find a single tidy 
  volume but a veritable bazaar of spiritual systems and disciplines 
  each offering themselves to us as the highest, the fastest, the most 
  powerful, or the most profound solution to our quest for the Ultimate. 
  Confronted with this melange, we fall into confusion trying to size 
  them up -- to decide which is truly liberative, a real solution to our 
  needs, and which is a sidetrack beset with hidden flaws.
    <p>
    One approach to resolving this problem that is popular today is the 
  eclectic one: to pick and choose from the various traditions whatever 
  seems amenable to our needs, welding together different practices and 
  techniques into a synthetic whole that is personally satisfying. Thus 
  one may combine Buddhist mindfulness meditation with sessions of Hindu 
  mantra recitation, Christian prayer with Sufi dancing, Jewish Kabbala 
  with Tibetan visualization exercises. Eclecticism, however, though 
  sometimes helpful in making a transition from a predominantly worldly 
  and materialistic way of life to one that takes on a spiritual hue, 
  eventually wears thin. While it makes a comfortable halfway house, it 
  is not comfortable as a final vehicle.
    <p>
    There are two interrelated flaws in eclecticism that account for its 
  ultimate inadequacy. One is that eclecticism compromises the very 
  traditions it draws upon. The great spiritual traditions themselves do 
  not propose their disciplines as independent techniques that may be 
  excised from their setting and freely recombined to enhance the felt 
  quality of our lives. They present them, rather, as parts of an 
  integral whole, of a coherent vision regarding the fundamental nature 
  of reality and the final goal of the spiritual quest. A spiritual 
  tradition is not a shallow stream in which one can wet one's feet and 
  then beat a quick retreat to the shore. It is a mighty, tumultuous 
  river which would rush through the entire landscape of one's life, and 
  if one truly wishes to travel on it, one must be courageous enough to 
  launch one's boat and head out for the depths.
    <p>
    The second defect in eclecticism follows from the first. As 
  spiritual practices are built upon visions regarding the nature of 
  reality and the final good, these visions are not mutually compatible. 
  When we honestly examine the teachings of these traditions, we will 
  find that major differences in perspective reveal themselves to our 
  sight, differences which cannot be easily dismissed as alternative 
  ways of saying the same thing. Rather, they point to very different 
  experiences constituting the supreme goal and the path that must be 
  trodden to reach that goal.
    <p>
    Hence, because of the differences in perspectives and practices that 
  the different spiritual traditions propose, once we decide that we 
  have outgrown eclecticism and feel that we are ready to make a serious 
  commitment to one particular path, we find ourselves confronted with 
  the challenge of choosing a path that will lead us to true 
  enlightenment and liberation. One cue to resolving this dilemma is to 
  clarify to ourselves our fundamental aim, to determine what we seek in 
  a genuinely liberative path. If we reflect carefully, it will become 
  clear that the prime requirement is a way to the end of suffering. All 
  problems ultimately can be reduced to the problem of suffering; thus 
  what we need is a way that will end this problem finally and 
  completely. Both these qualifying words are important. The path has to 
  lead to a <i>complete</i> end of suffering, to an end of suffering in all 
  its forms, and to a <I>final</I> end of suffering, to bring suffering to 
  an irreversible stop.
    <p>
    But here we run up against another question. How are we to find such 
  a path -- a path which has the capacity to lead us to the full and 
  final end of suffering? Until we actually follow a path to its goal we 
  cannot know with certainty where it leads, and in order to follow a 
  path to its goal we must place complete trust in the efficacy of the 
  path. The pursuit of a spiritual path is not like selecting a new suit 
  of clothes. To select a new suit one need only try on a number of 
  suits, inspect oneself in the mirror, and select the suit in which one 
  appears most attractive. The choice of a spiritual path is closer to 
  marriage: one wants a partner for life, one whose companionship will 
  prove as trustworthy and durable as the pole star in the night sky.
    <p>
    Faced with this new dilemma, we may think that we have reached a 
  dead end and conclude that we have nothing to guide us but personal 
  inclination, if not a flip of the coin. However, our selection need 
  not be as blind and uninformed as we imagine, for we do have a 
  guideline to help us. Since spiritual paths are generally presented in 
  the framework of a total teaching, we can evaluate the effectiveness 
  of any particular path by investigating the teaching which expounds 
  it.
    <p>
    In making this investigation we can look to three criteria as 
  standards for evaluation:
    <p>
<ol>
<li><I>First</I>, the teaching has to give a full and accurate picture 
  of the range of suffering. If the picture of suffering it gives is 
  incomplete or defective, then the path it sets forth will most likely 
  be flawed, unable to yield a satisfactory solution. Just as an ailing 
  patient needs a doctor who can make a full and correct diagnosis of 
  his illness, so in seeking release from suffering we need a teaching 
  that presents a reliable account of our condition.
    <p>
<li> The <I>second</I> criterion calls for a correct analysis of the 
  causes giving rise to suffering. The teaching cannot stop with a 
  survey of the outward symptoms. It has to penetrate beneath the 
  symptoms to the level of causes, and to describe those causes 
  accurately. If a teaching makes a faulty causal analysis, there is 
  little likelihood that its treatment will succeed.
    <p>
<li> The <I>third</I> criterion pertains directly to the path itself. It 
  stipulates that the path which the teaching offers has to remove 
  suffering at its source. This means it must provide a method to cut 
  off suffering by eradicating its causes. If it fails to bring about 
  this root-level solution, its value is ultimately nil. The path it 
  prescribes might help to remove symptoms and make us feel that all is 
  well; but one afflicted with a fatal disease cannot afford to settle 
  for cosmetic surgery when below the surface the cause of his malady 
  continues to thrive.
    <p>
</ol>
    To sum up, we find three requirements for a teaching proposing to 
  offer a true path to the end of suffering: first, it has to set forth 
  a full and accurate picture of the range of suffering; second, it must 
  present a correct analysis of the causes of suffering; and third, it 
  must give us the means to eradicate the causes of suffering.
    <p>
    This is not the place to evaluate the various spiritual disciplines 
  in terms of these criteria. Our concern is only with the Dhamma, the 
  teaching of the Buddha, and with the solution this teaching offers to 
  the problem of suffering. That the teaching should be relevant to this 
  problem is evident from its very nature; for it is formulated, not as 
  a set of doctrines about the origin and end of things commanding 
  belief, but as a message of deliverance from suffering claiming to be 
  verifiable in our own experience. Along with that message there comes 
  a method of practice, a way leading to the end of suffering. This way 
  is the Noble Eightfold Path (<I>ariya atthangika magga</I>). The 
  Eightfold Path stands at the very heart of the Buddha's teaching. It 
  was the discovery of the path that gave the Buddha's own enlightenment 
  a universal significance and elevated him from the status of a wise 
  and benevolent sage to that of a world teacher. To his own disciples 
  he was pre-eminently "the arouser of the path unarisen before, the 
  producer of the path not produced before, the declarer of the path not 
  declared before, the knower of the path, the seer of the path, the 
  guide along the path" (MN 108). And he himself invites the seeker with 
  the promise and challenge: "You yourselves must strive. The Buddhas 
  are only teachers. The meditative ones who practise the path are 
  released from the bonds of evil" (Dhp. v. 276).
    <p>
    To see the Noble Eightfold Path as a viable vehicle to liberation, 
  we have to check it out against our three criteria: to look at the 
  Buddha's account of the range of suffering, his analysis of its 
  causes, and the programme he offers as a remedy.

  The Buddha does not merely touch the problem of suffering 
  tangentially; he makes it, rather, the very cornerstone of his 
  teaching. He starts the Four Noble Truths that sum up his message with 
  the announcement that life is inseparably tied to something he calls 
  <i>dukkha</i>. The Pali word is often translated as suffering, but it 
  means something deeper than pain and misery. It refers to a basic 
  unsatisfactoriness running through our lives, the lives of all but the 
  enlightened. Sometimes this unsatisfactoriness erupts into the open as 
  sorrow, grief, disappointment, or despair; but usually it hovers at 
  the edge of our awareness as a vague unlocalized sense that things are 
  never quite perfect, never fully adequate to our expectations of what 
  they should be. This fact of <i>dukkha</i>, the Buddha says, is the only 
  real spiritual problem. The other problems -- the theological and 
  metaphysical questions that have taunted religious thinkers through 
  the centuries -- he gently waves aside as "matters not tending to 
  liberation." What he teaches, he says, is just suffering and the 
  ending of suffering, <i>dukkha</i> and its cessation.
  <p>
    The Buddha does not stop with generalities. He goes on to expose the 
  different forms that <i>dukkha</i> takes, both the evident and the 
  subtle. He starts with what is close at hand, with the suffering 
  inherent in the physical process of life itself. Here <i>dukkha</i> shows 
  up in the events of birth, aging, and death, in our susceptibility to 
  sickness, accidents, and injuries, even in hunger and thirst. It 
  appears again in our inner reactions to disagreeable situations and 
  events: in the sorrow, anger, frustration, and fear aroused by painful 
  separations, by unpleasant encounters, by the failure to get what we 
  want. Even our pleasures, the Buddha says, are not immune from 
  <i>dukkha</i>. They give us happiness while they last, but they do not 
  last forever; eventually they must pass away, and when they go the 
  loss leaves us feeling deprived. Our lives, for the most part, are 
  strung out between the thirst for pleasure and the fear of pain. We 
  pass our days running after the one and running away from the other, 
  seldom enjoying the peace of contentment; real satisfaction seems 
  somehow always out of reach, just beyond the next horizon. Then in the 
  end we have to die: to give up the identity we spent our whole life 
  building, to leave behind everything and everyone we love.
    <p>
    But even death, the Buddha teaches, does not bring us to the end of 
  <i>dukkha</i>, for the life process does not stop with death. When life 
  ends in one place, with one body, the "mental continuum," the 
  individual stream of consciousness, springs up again elsewhere with a 
  new body as its physical support. Thus the cycle goes on over and over 
  -- birth, aging, and death -- driven by the thirst for more existence. 
  The Buddha declares that this round of rebirths -- called <I>samsara</I>, 
  "the wandering" -- has been turning through beginningless time. It is 
  without a first point, without temporal origin. No matter how far back 
  in time we go we always find living beings -- ourselves in previous 
  lives -- wandering from one state of existence to another. The Buddha 
  describes various realms where rebirth can take place: realms of 
  torment, the animal realm, the human realm, realms of celestial bliss. 
  But none of these realms can offer a final refuge. Life in any plane 
  must come to an end. It is impermanent and thus marked with that 
  insecurity which is the deepest meaning of <i>dukkha</i>. For this reason 
  one aspiring to the complete end of <i>dukkha</i> cannot rest content 
  with any mundane achievement, with any status, but must win 
  emancipation from the entire unstable whirl.

  A teaching proposing to lead to the end of suffering must, as we said, 
  give a reliable account of its causal origination. For if we want to 
  put a stop to suffering, we have to stop it where it begins, with its 
  causes. To stop the causes requires a thorough knowledge of what they 
  are and how they work; thus the Buddha devotes a sizeable section of 
  his teaching to laying bare "the truth of the origin of <i>dukkha</i>." 
  The origin he locates within ourselves, in a fundamental malady that 
  permeates our being, causing disorder in our own minds and vitiating 
  our relationships with others and with the world. The sign of this 
  malady can be seen in our proclivity to certain unwholesome mental 
  states called in Pali <I>kilesas</I>, usually translated "defilements." 
  The most basic defilements are the triad of greed, aversion, and 
  delusion. Greed (<I>lobha</I>) is self-centered desire: the desire for 
  pleasure and possessions, the drive for survival, the urge to bolster 
  the sense of ego with power, status, and prestige. Aversion (<I>dosa</I>) 
  signifies the response of negation, expressed as rejection, 
  irritation, condemnation, hatred, enmity, anger, and violence. 
  Delusion (<I>moha</I>) means mental darkness: the thick coat of 
  insensitivity which blocks out clear understanding.
  <p>
    From these three roots emerge the various other defilements -- 
  conceit, jealousy, ambition, lethargy, arrogance, and the rest -- and 
  from all these defilements together, the roots and the branches, comes 
  <i>dukkha</i> in its diverse forms: as pain and sorrow, as fear and 
  discontent, as the aimless drifting through the round of birth and 
  death. To gain freedom from suffering, therefore, we have to eliminate 
  the defilements. But the work of removing the defilements has to 
  proceed in a methodical way. It cannot be accomplished simply by an 
  act of will, by wanting them to go away. The work must be guided by 
  investigation. We have to find out what the defilements depend upon 
  and then see how it lies within our power to remove their support.
    <p>
    The Buddha teaches that there is one defilement which gives rise to 
  all the others, one root which holds them all in place. This root is 
  ignorance (<I>avijja</I>).<A HREF="#n1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> Ignorance is not 
  mere absence of knowledge, 
  a lack of knowing particular pieces of information. Ignorance can 
  co-exist with a vast accumulation of itemized knowledge, and in its 
  own way it can be tremendously shrewd and resourceful. As the basic 
  root of <i>dukkha</i>, ignorance is a fundamental darkness shrouding the 
  mind. Sometimes this ignorance operates in a passive manner, merely 
  obscuring correct understanding. At other times it takes on an active 
  role: it becomes the great deceiver, conjuring up a mass of distorted 
  perceptions and conceptions which the mind grasps as attributes of the 
  world, unaware that they are its own deluded constructs. 
    <p>
    In these erroneous perceptions and ideas we find the soil that 
  nurtures the defilements. The mind catches sight of some possibility 
  of pleasure, accepts it at face value, and the result is greed. Our 
  hunger for gratification is thwarted, obstacles appear, and up spring 
  anger and aversion. Or we struggle over ambiguities, our sight clouds, 
  and we become lost in delusion. With this we discover the breeding 
  ground of <i>dukkha</i>: ignorance issuing in the defilements, the 
  defilements issuing in suffering. As long as this causal matrix stands 
  we are not yet beyond danger. We might still find pleasure and 
  enjoyment -- sense pleasures, social pleasures, pleasures of the mind 
  and heart. But no matter how much pleasure we might experience, no 
  matter how successful we might be at dodging pain, the basic problem 
  remains at the core of our being and we continue to move within the 
  bounds of <i>dukkha</i>.

  To free ourselves from suffering fully and finally we have to 
  eliminate it by the root, and that means to eliminate ignorance. But 
  how does one go about eliminating ignorance? The answer follows 
  clearly from the nature of the adversary. Since ignorance is a state 
  of not knowing things as they really are, what is needed is knowledge 
  of things as they really are. Not merely conceptual knowledge, 
  knowledge as idea, but perceptual knowledge, a knowing which is also a 
  seeing. This kind of knowing is called wisdom (<I>panna</I>). Wisdom 
  helps to correct the distorting work of ignorance. It enables us to 
  grasp things as they are in actuality, directly and immediately, free 
  from the screen of ideas, views, and assumptions our minds ordinarily 
  set up between themselves and the real.
  <p>
    To eliminate ignorance we need wisdom, but how is wisdom to be 
  acquired? As indubitable knowledge of the ultimate nature of things, 
  wisdom cannot be gained by mere learning, by gathering and 
  accumulating a battery of facts. However, the Buddha says, wisdom can 
  be cultivated. It comes into being through a set of conditions, 
  conditions which we have the power to develop. These conditions are 
  actually mental factors, components of consciousness, which fit 
  together into a systematic structure that can be called a path in the 
  word's essential meaning: a courseway for movement leading to a goal. 
  The goal here is the end of suffering, and the path leading to it is 
  the Noble Eightfold Path with its eight factors: right view, right 
  intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, 
  right mindfulness, and right concentration.
    <p>
    The Buddha calls this path the middle way (<I>majjhima patipada</I>). 
  It is the middle way because it steers clear of two extremes, two 
  misguided attempts to gain release from suffering. One is the extreme 
  of indulgence in sense pleasures, the attempt to extinguish 
  dissatisfaction by gratifying desire. This approach gives pleasure, 
  but the enjoyment won is gross, transitory, and devoid of deep 
  contentment. The Buddha recognized that sensual desire can exercise a 
  tight grip over the minds of human beings, and he was keenly aware of 
  how ardently attached people become to the pleasures of the senses. 
  But he also knew that this pleasure is far inferior to the happiness 
  that arises from renunciation, and therefore he repeatedly taught that 
  the way to the Ultimate eventually requires the relinquishment of 
  sensual desire. Thus the Buddha describes the indulgence in sense 
  pleasures as "low, common, worldly, ignoble, not leading to the goal." 
    <p>
    The other extreme is the practice of self-mortification, the attempt 
  to gain liberation by afflicting the body. This approach may stem from 
  a genuine aspiration for deliverance, but it works within the compass 
  of a wrong assumption that renders the energy expended barren of 
  results. The error is taking the body to be the cause of bondage, when 
  the real source of trouble lies in the mind -- the mind obsessed by 
  greed, aversion, and delusion. To rid the mind of these defilements 
  the affliction of the body is not only useless but self-defeating, for 
  it is the impairment of a necessary instrument. Thus the Buddha 
  describes this second extreme as "painful, ignoble, not leading to the 
  goal."<SUP><A HREF="#n2">2</A></SUP>
    <p>
    Aloof from these two extreme approaches is the Noble Eightfold Path, 
  called the middle way, not in the sense that it effects a compromise 
  between the extremes, but in the sense that it transcends them both by 
  avoiding the errors that each involves. The path avoids the extreme of 
  sense indulgence by its recognition of the futility of desire and its 
  stress on renunciation. Desire and sensuality, far from being means to 
  happiness, are springs of suffering to be abandoned as the requisite 
  of deliverance. But the practice of renunciation does not entail the 
  tormenting of the body. It consists in mental training, and for this 
  the body must be fit, a sturdy support for the inward work. Thus the 
  body is to be looked after well, kept in good health, while the mental 
  faculties are trained to generate the liberating wisdom. That is the 
  middle way, the Noble Eightfold Path, which "gives rise to vision, 
  gives rise to knowledge, and leads to peace, to direct knowledge, to 
  enlightenment, to Nibbana." <SUP><A HREF="#n3">3</A></SUP>
