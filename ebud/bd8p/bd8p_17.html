  The eighth factor of the path is right concentration, in Pali <I>samma 
  samadhi</I>. Concentration represents an intensification of a mental 
  factor present in every state of consciousness. This factor, 
  one-pointedness of mind (<I>citt'ekaggata</I>), has the function of 
  unifying the other mental factors in the task of cognition. It is the 
  factor responsible for the individuating aspect of consciousness, 
  ensuring that every citta or act of mind remains centred on its 
  object. At any given moment the mind must be cognizant of something -- 
  a sight, a sound, a smell, a taste, a touch, or a mental object. The 
  factor of one-pointedness unifies the mind and its other concomitants 
  in the task of cognizing the object, while it simultaneously exercises 
  the function of centring all the constituents of the cognitive act on 
  the object. One-pointedness of mind explains the fact that in any act 
  of consciousness there is a central point of focus, towards which the 
  entire objective datum points from its outer peripheries to its inner 
  nucleus.
  <p>  
    However, <i>samadhi</i> is only a particular kind of one-pointedness; 
  it is not equivalent to one-pointedness in its entirety. A gourmet 
  sitting down to a meal, an assassin about to slay his victim, a 
  soldier on the battlefield -- these all act with a concentrated mind, 
  but their concentration cannot be characterized as <i>samadhi</i>. 
  <i>Samadhi</i> is exclusively wholesome one-pointedness, the 
  concentration in a wholesome state of mind. Even then its range is 
  still narrower: it does not signify every form of wholesome 
  concentration, but only the intensified concentration that results 
  from a deliberate attempt to raise the mind to a higher, more purified 
  level of awareness.
  <p>  
    The commentaries define <i>samadhi</i> as the centring of the mind and 
  mental factors rightly and evenly on an object. <i>Samadhi</i>, as 
  wholesome concentration, collects together the ordinarily dispersed 
  and dissipated stream of mental states to induce an inner unification. 
  The two salient features of a concentrated mind are unbroken 
  attentiveness to an object and the consequent tranquillity of the 
  mental functions, qualities which distinguish it from the 
  unconcentrated mind. The mind untrained in concentration moves in a 
  scattered manner which the Buddha compares to the flapping about of a 
  fish taken from the water and thrown onto dry land. It cannot stay 
  fixed but rushes from idea to idea, from thought to thought, without 
  inner control. Such a distracted mind is also a deluded mind. 
  Overwhelmed by worries and concerns, a constant prey to the 
  defilements, it sees things only in fragments, distorted by the 
  ripples of random thoughts. But the mind that has been trained in 
  concentration, in contrast, can remain focused on its object without 
  distraction. This freedom from distraction further induces a softness 
  and serenity which make the mind an effective instrument for 
  penetration. Like a lake unruffled by any breeze, the concentrated 
  mind is a faithful reflector that mirrors whatever is placed before it 
  exactly as it is.

<H2 ALIGN=center>The Development of Concentration</H2>
<p><hr size=5 width=45% align=center><p> 
 
  Concentration can be developed through either of two methods -- either 
  as the goal of a system of practice directed expressly towards the 
  attainment of deep concentration at the level of absorption or as the 
  incidental accompaniment of the path intended to generate insight. The 
  former method is called the development of serenity 
  (<I>samatha-bhavana</I>), the second the development of insight 
  (<I>vipassana-bhavana</I>). Both paths share certain preliminary 
  requirements. For both, moral discipline must be purified, the various 
  impediments must be severed, the meditator must seek out suitable 
  instruction (preferrably from a personal teacher), and must resort to 
  a dwelling conducive to practice. Once these preliminaries have been 
  dispensed with, the meditator on the path of serenity has to obtain an 
  object of meditation, something to be used as a focal point for 
  developing concentration.<A HREF="#n1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
  <p>
    If the meditator has a qualified teacher, the teacher will probably 
  assign him an object judged to be appropriate for his temperament. If 
  he doesn't have a teacher, he will have to select an object himself, 
  perhaps after some experimentation. The meditation manuals collect the 
  subjects of serenity meditation into a set of forty, called "places of 
  work" (<I>kammatthana</I>) since they are the places where the meditator 
  does the work of practice. The forty may be listed as follows:
  <ul>     
      <LI> ten kasinas
      <LI> ten unattractive objects (<I>dasa asubha</I>)
      <LI> ten recollections (<I>dasa anussatiyo</I>)
      <LI> four sublime states (<I>cattaro brahmavihara</I>)
      <LI> four immaterial states (<I>cattaro aruppa</I>)
      <LI> one perception (<I>eka sanna</I>)
      <LI> one analysis (<I>eka vavatthana</I>)
  </ul>     
    The kasinas are devices representing certain primordial qualities. 
  Four represent the primary elements -- the earth, water, fire, and air 
  kasinas; four represent colours -- the blue, yellow, red, and white 
  kasinas; the other two are the light and the space kasinas. Each 
  kasina is a concrete object representative of the universal quality it 
  signifies. Thus an earth kasina would be a circular disk filled with 
  clay. To develop concentration on the earth kasina the meditator sets 
  the disk in front of him, fixes his gaze on it, and contemplates 
  "earth, earth." A similar method is used for the other kasinas, with 
  appropriate changes to fit the case.
  <p>  
    The ten "unattractive objects" are corpses in different stages of 
  decomposition. This subject appears similar to the contemplation of 
  bodily decay in the mindfulness of the body, and in fact in olden 
  times the cremation ground was recommended as the most appropriate 
  place for both. But the two meditations differ in emphasis. In the 
  mindfulness exercise stress falls on the application of reflective 
  thought, the sight of the decaying corpse serving as a stimulus for 
  consideration of one's own eventual death and disintegration. In this 
  exercise the use of reflective thought is discouraged. The stress 
  instead falls on one-pointed mental fixation on the object, the less 
  thought the better.
  <p>  
    The ten recollections form a miscellaneous collection. The first 
  three are devotional meditations on the qualities of the Triple Gem -- 
  the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha; they use as their basis 
  standard formulas that have come down in the Suttas. The next three 
  recollections also rely on ancient formulas: the meditations on 
  morality, generosity, and the potential for divine-like qualities in 
  oneself. Then come mindfulness of death, the contemplation of the 
  unattractive nature of the body, mindfulness of breathing, and lastly, 
  the recollection of peace, a discursive meditation on Nibbana.
  <p>  
    The four sublime states or "divine abodes" are the outwardly 
  directed social attitudes -- lovingkindness, compassion, sympathetic 
  joy, and equanimity -- developed into universal radiations  which are 
  gradually extended in range until they encompass all living beings. 
  The four immaterial states are the objective bases for certain deep 
  levels of absorption: the base of infinite space, the base of infinite 
  consciousness, the base of nothingness, and the base of 
  neither-perception-nor-non-perception. These become accessible as 
  objects only to those who are already adept in concentration. The "one 
  perception" is the perception of the repulsiveness of food, a 
  discursive topic intended to reduce attachment to the pleasures of the 
  palate. The "one analysis" is the contemplation of the body in terms 
  of the four primary elements, already discussed in the chapter on 
  right mindfulness.
  <p>  
    When such a variety of meditation subjects is presented, the 
  aspiring meditator without a teacher might be perplexed as to which to 
  choose. The manuals divide the forty subjects according to their 
  suitability for different personality types. Thus the unattractive 
  objects and the contemplation of the parts of the body are judged to 
  be most suitable for a lustful type, the meditation on lovingkindness 
  to be best for a hating type, the meditation on the qualities of the 
  Triple Gem to be most effective for a devotional type, etc. But for 
  practical purposes the beginner in meditation can generally be advised 
  to start with a simple subject that helps reduce discursive thinking. 
  Mental distraction caused by restlessness and scattered thoughts is a 
  common problem faced by persons of all different character types; thus 
  a meditator of any temperament can benefit from a subject which 
  promotes a slowing down and stilling of the thought process. The 
  subject generally recommended for its effectiveness in clearing the 
  mind of stray thoughts is mindfulness of breathing, which can 
  therefore be suggested as the subject most suitable for beginners as 
  well as veterans seeking a direct approach to deep concentration. Once 
  the mind settles down and one's thought patterns become easier to 
  notice, one might then make use of other subjects to deal with special 
  problems that arise: the meditation on lovingkindness may be used to 
  counteract anger and ill will, mindfulness of the bodily parts to 
  weaken sensual lust, the recollection of the Buddha to inspire faith 
  and devotion, the meditation on death to arouse a sense of urgency. 
  The ability to select the subject appropriate to the situation 
  requires skill, but this skill evolves through practice, often through 
  simple trial-and-error experimentation.
    
  <a name="stages">  
  <p><hr size=5 width=45% align=center><p>  
  <H2 ALIGN=center>The Stages of Concentration</H2>
  <p><hr size=5 width=45% align=center><p>  

  Concentration is not attained all at once but develops in stages. To 
  enable our exposition to cover all the stages of concentration, we 
  will consider the case of a meditator who follows the entire path of 
  serenity meditation from start to finish, and who will make much 
  faster progress than the typical meditator is likely to make.
  <p>  
    After receiving his meditation subject from a teacher, or selecting 
  it on his own, the meditator retires to a quiet place. There he 
  assumes the correct meditation posture -- the legs crossed 
  comfortably, the upper part of the body held straight and erect, hands 
  placed one above the other on the lap, the head kept steady, the mouth 
  and eyes closed (unless a kasina or other visual object is used), the 
  breath flowing naturally and regularly through the nostrils. He then 
  focuses his mind on the object and tries to keep it there, fixed and 
  alert. If the mind strays, he notices this quickly, catches it, and 
  brings it back gently but firmly to the object, doing this over and 
  over as often as is necessary. This initial stage is called 
  preliminary concentration (<I>parikkamma-samadhi</I>) and the object the 
  preliminary sign (<I>parikkamma-nimitta</I>).
  <p>  
    Once the initial excitement subsides and the mind begins to settle 
  into the practice, the five hindrances are likely to arise, bubbling 
  up from the depths. Sometimes they appear as thoughts, sometimes as 
  images, sometimes as obsessive emotions: surges of desire, anger and 
  resentment, heaviness of mind, agitation, doubts. The hindrances pose 
  a formidable barrier, but with patience and sustained effort they can 
  be overcome. To conquer them the meditator will have to be adroit. At 
  times, when a particular hindrance becomes strong, he may have to lay 
  aside his primary subject of meditation and take up another subject 
  expressly opposed to the hindrance. At other times he will have to 
  persist with his primary subject despite the bumps along the road, 
  bringing his mind back to it again and again.
  <p>  
    As he goes on striving along the path of concentration, his exertion 
  activates five mental factors which come to his aid. These factors are 
  intermittently present in ordinary undirected consciousness, but there 
  they lack a unifying bond and thus do not play any special role. 
  However, when activated by the work of meditation, these five factors 
  pick up power, link up with one another, and steer the mind towards 
  <i>samadhi</i>, which they will govern as the "jhana factors," the 
  factors of absorption (<I>jhananga</I>). Stated in their usual order the 
  five are: initial application of mind (<I>vitakka</I>), sustained 
  application of mind (<I>vicara</I>), rapture (<I>piti</I>), happiness 
  (<I>sukha</I>), and one-pointedness (<I>ekaggata</I>).
  <p>  
    <I>Initial application of mind</I> does the work of directing the mind 
  to the object. It takes the mind, lifts it up, and drives it into the 
  object the way one drives a nail through a block of wood. This done, 
  <I>sustained application of mind</I> anchors the mind on the object, 
  keeping it there through its function of examination. To clarify the 
  difference between these two factors, initial application is compared 
  to the striking of a bell, sustained application to the bell's 
  reverberations. <I>Rapture</I>, the third factor, is the delight and joy 
  that accompany a favourable interest in the object, while 
  <I>happiness</I>, the fourth factor, is the pleasant feeling that 
  accompanies successful concentration. Since rapture and happiness 
  share similar qualities they tend to be confused with each other, but 
  the two are not identical. The difference between them is illustrated 
  by comparing rapture to the joy of a weary desert-farer who sees an 
  oasis in the distance, happiness to his pleasure when drinking from 
  the pond and resting in the shade. The fifth and final factor of 
  absorption is <I>one-pointedness</I>, which has the pivotal function of 
  unifying the mind on the object.<A HREF="#n2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
  <p>  
    When concentration is developed, these five factors spring up and 
  counteract the five hindrances. Each absorption factor opposes a 
  particular hindrance. Initial application of mind, through its work of 
  lifting the mind up to the object, counters dullness and drowsiness. 
  Sustained application, by anchoring the mind on the object, drives 
  away doubt. Rapture shuts out ill will, happiness excludes 
  restlessness and worry, and one-pointedness counters sensual desire, 
  the most alluring inducement to distraction. Thus, with the 
  strengthening of the absorption factors, the hindrances fade out and 
  subside. They are not yet eradicated -- eradication can only be 
  effected by wisdom, the third division of the path -- but they have 
  been reduced to a state of quiescence where they cannot disrupt the 
  forward movement of concentration.
  <p>  
    At the same time that the hindrances are being overpowered by the 
  jhana factors inwardly, on the side of the object too certain changes 
  are taking place. The original object of concentration, the 
  preliminary sign, is a gross physical object; in the case of a kasina, 
  it is a disk representing the chosen element or colour, in the case of 
  mindfulness of breathing the touch sensation of the breath, etc. But 
  with the strengthening of concentration the original object gives rise 
  to another object called the "learning sign" (<I>uggaha-nimitta</I>). For 
  a kasina this will be a mental image of the disk seen as clearly in 
  the mind as the original object was with the eyes; for the breath it 
  will be a reflex image arisen from the touch sensation of the air 
  currents moving around the nostrils.
  <p>  
    When the learning sign appears, the meditator leaves off the 
  preliminary sign and fixes his attention on the new object. In due 
  time still another object will emerge out of the learning sign. This 
  object, called the "counterpart sign" (<I>patibhaga-nimitta</I>), is a 
  purified mental image many times brighter and clearer than the 
  learning sign. The learning sign is compared to the moon seen behind a 
  cloud, the counterpart sign to the moon freed from the cloud. 
  Simultaneously with the appearance of the counterpart sign, the five 
  absorption factors suppress the five hindrances, and the mind enters 
  the stage of concentration called <I>upacara-samadhi</I>, "access 
  concentration." Here, in access concentration, the mind is drawing 
  close to absorption. It has entered the "neighbourhood" (a possible 
  meaning of <I>upacara</I>) of absorption, but more work is still needed 
  for it to become fully immersed in the object, the defining mark of 
  absorption.
  <p>  
    With further practice the factors of concentration gain in strength 
  and bring the mind to absorption (<I>appana-samadhi</I>). Like access 
  concentration, absorption takes the counterpart sign as object. The 
  two stages of concentration are differentiated neither by the absence 
  of the hindrances nor by the counterpart sign as object; these are 
  common to both. What differentiates them is the strength of the jhana 
  factors. In access concentration the jhana factors are present, but 
  they lack strength and steadiness. Thus the mind in this stage is 
  compared to a child who has just learned to walk: he takes a few 
  steps, falls down, gets up, walks some more, and again falls down. But 
  the mind in absorption is like a man who wants to walk: he just gets 
  up and walks straight ahead without hesitation.
  <p>  
    Concentration in the stage of absorption is divided into eight 
  levels, each marked by greater depth, purity, and subtlety than its 
  predecessor. The first four form a set called the four <I>jhanas</I>, a 
  word best left untranslated for lack of a suitable equivalent, though 
  it can be loosely rendered "meditative absorption."<A HREF="#n3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> The second four 
  also form a set, the four immaterial states (<I>aruppa</I>). The eight 
  have to be attained in progressive order, the achievement of any later 
  level being dependent on the mastery of the immediately preceding 
  level.
  <p>  
    The four jhanas make up the usual textual definition of right 
  concentration. Thus the Buddha says:
    
    <BLOCKQUOTE>   And what, monks, is right concentration? Herein, secluded from 
       sense pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a monk enters 
       and dwells in the first jhana, which is accompanied by initial 
       and sustained application of mind and filled with rapture and 
       happiness born of seclusion.
       
       Then, with the subsiding of initial and sustained application of 
       mind, by gaining inner confidence and mental unification, he 
       enters and dwells in the second jhana, which is free from initial 
       and sustained application but is filled with rapture and 
       happiness born of concentration.
       
       With the fading out of rapture, he dwells in equanimity, mindful 
       and clearly comprehending; and he experiences in his own person 
       that bliss of which the noble ones say: "Happily lives he who is 
       equanimous and mindful" -- thus he enters and dwells in the third 
       jhana.
       
       With the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous 
       disappearance of joy and grief, he enters and dwells in the 
       fourth jhana, which has neither-pleasure-nor-pain and purity of 
       mindfulness due to equanimity.
       
       This, monks, is right concentration.<A HREF="#n4"><SUP>4</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>
       
    The <I>jhanas</I> are distinguished by way of their component factors. The 
  first <I>jhana</I> is constituted by the original set of five absorption 
  factors: initial application, sustained application, rapture, 
  happiness, and one-pointedness. After attaining the first jhana the 
  meditator is advised to master it. On the one hand he should not fall 
  into complacency over his achievement and neglect sustained practice; 
  on the other, he should not become over-confident and rush ahead to 
  attain the next jhana. To master the jhana he should enter it 
  repeatedly and perfect his skill in it, until he can attain it, remain 
  in it, emerge from it, and review it without any trouble or 
  difficulty.
  <p>  
    After mastering the first <I>jhana</I>, the meditator then considers that 
  his attainment has certain defects. Though the <I>jhana</I> is certainly far 
  superior to ordinary sense consciousness, more peaceful and blissful, 
  it still stands close to sense consciousness and is not far removed 
  from the hindrances. Moreover, two of its factors, initial application 
  and sustained application, appear in time to be rather coarse, not as 
  refined as the other factors. Then the meditator renews his practice 
  of concentration intent on overcoming initial and sustained 
  application. When his faculties mature, these two factors subside and 
  he enters the second <I>jhana</I>. This <I>jhana</I> contains only three component 
  factors: rapture, happiness, and one-pointedness. It also contains a 
  multiplicity of other constituents, the most prominent of which is 
  confidence of mind.
  <p>  
    In the second <I>jhana</I> the mind becomes more tranquil and more 
  thoroughly unified, but when mastered even this state seems gross, as 
  it includes rapture, an exhilarating factor that inclines to 
  excitation. So the meditator sets out again on his course of training, 
  this time resolved on overcoming rapture. When rapture fades out, he 
  enters the third <I>jhana</I>. Here there are only two absorption factors, 
  happiness and one-pointedness, while some other auxiliary states come 
  into ascendency, most notably mindfulness, clear comprehension, and 
  equanimity. But still, the meditator sees, this attainment is 
  defective in that it contains the feeling of happiness, which is gross 
  compared to neutral feeling, feeling that is neither pleasant not 
  painful. Thus he strives to get beyond even the sublime happiness of 
  the third <I>jhana</I>. When he succeeds, he enters the fourth <I>jhana</I>, which 
  is defined by two factors -- one-pointedness and neutral feeling -- 
  and has a special purity of mindfulness due to the high level of 
  equanimity.
  <p>  
    Beyond the four <I>jhanas</I> lie the four immaterial states, levels of 
  absorption in which the mind transcends even the subtlest perception 
  of visualized images still sometimes persisting in the jhanas. The 
  immaterial states are attained, not by refining mental factors as are 
  the jhanas, but by refining objects, by replacing a relatively gross 
  object with a subtler one. The four attainments are named after their 
  respective objects: the base of infinite space, the base of infinite 
  consciousness, the base of nothingness, and the base of 
  neither-perception-nor-non-perception.<A HREF="#n5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> These states represent 
  levels of concentration so subtle and remote as to elude clear verbal 
  explanation. The last of the four stands at the apex of mental 
  concentration; it is the absolute, maximum degree of unification 
  possible for consciousness. But even so, these absorptions reached by 
  the path of serenity meditation, as exalted as they are, still lack 
  the wisdom of insight, and so are not yet sufficient for gaining 
  deliverance.
  <p>  
    The kinds of concentration discussed so far arise by fixing the mind 
  upon a single object to the exclusion of other objects. But apart from 
  these there is another kind of concentration which does not depend 
  upon restricting the range of awareness. This is called "momentary 
  concentration" (<I>khanika-samadhi</I>). To develop momentary 
  concentration the meditator does not deliberately attempt to exclude 
  the multiplicity of phenomena from his field of attention. Instead, he 
  simply directs mindfulness to the changing states of mind and body, 
  noting any phenomenon that presents itself; the task is to maintain a 
  continuous awareness of whatever enters the range of perception, 
  clinging to nothing. As he goes on with his noting, concentration 
  becomes stronger moment after moment until it becomes established 
  one-pointedly on the constantly changing stream of events. Despite the 
  change in the object, the mental unification remains steady, and in 
  time acquires a force capable of suppressing the hindrances to a 
  degree equal to that of access concentration. This fluid, mobile 
  concentration is developed by the practice of the four foundations of 
  mindfulness, taken up along the path of insight; when sufficiently 
  strong it issues in the breakthrough to the last stage of the path, 
  the arising of wisdom.
