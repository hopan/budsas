<blockquote>  
  The essence of the Buddha's teaching can be summed up in two 
  principles: the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path. The 
  first covers the side of doctrine, and the primary response it elicits 
  is understanding; the second covers the side of discipline, in the 
  broadest sense of that word, and the primary response it calls for is 
  practice. In the structure of the teaching these two principles lock 
  together into an indivisible unity called the <I>dhamma-vinaya</I>, the 
  doctrine-and-discipline, or, in brief, the Dhamma. The internal unity 
  of the Dhamma is guaranteed by the fact that the last of the Four 
  Noble Truths, the truth of the way, is the Noble Eightfold Path, while 
  the first factor of the Noble Eightfold Path, right view, is the 
  understanding of the Four Noble Truths. Thus the two principles 
  penetrate and include one another, the formula of the Four Noble 
  Truths containing the Eightfold Path and the Noble Eightfold Path 
  containing the Four Truths.
  <p>
    Given this integral unity, it would be pointless to pose the 
  question which of the two aspects of the Dhamma has greater value, the 
  doctrine or the path. But if we did risk the pointless by asking that 
  question, the answer would have to be the path. The path claims 
  primacy because it is precisely this that brings the teaching to life. 
  The path translates the Dhamma from a collection of abstract formulas 
  into a continually unfolding disclosure of truth. It gives an outlet 
  from the problem of suffering with which the teaching starts. And it 
  makes the teaching's goal, liberation from suffering, accessible to us 
  in our own experience, where alone it takes on authentic meaning.
    <p>
    To follow the Noble Eightfold Path is a matter of practice rather 
  than intellectual knowledge, but to apply the path correctly it has to 
  be properly understood. In fact, right understanding of the path is 
  itself a part of the practice. It is a facet of right view, the first 
  path factor, the forerunner and guide for the rest of the path. Thus, 
  though initial enthusiasm might suggest that the task of intellectual 
  comprehension may be shelved as a bothersome distraction, mature 
  consideration reveals it to be quite essential to ultimate success in 
  the practice.
    <p>
    The present book aims at contributing towards a proper understanding 
  of the Noble Eightfold Path by investigating its eight factors and 
  their components to determine exactly what they involve. I have 
  attempted to be concise, using as the framework for exposition the 
  Buddha's own words in explanation of the path factors, as found in the 
  Sutta Pitaka of the Pali Canon. To assist the reader with limited 
  access to primary sources even in translation, I have tried to confine 
  my selection of quotations as much as possible (but not completely) to 
  those found in Venerable Nyanatiloka's classic anthology, <I>The Word 
  of the Buddha</I>. In some cases passages taken from that work have been 
  slightly modified, to accord with my own preferred renderings. For 
  further amplification of meaning I have sometimes drawn upon the 
  commentaries; especially in my accounts of concentration and wisdom 
  (Chapters VII and VIII) I have relied heavily on the <I>Visuddhimagga</I> 
  (<I>The Path of Purification</I>), a vast encyclopedic work which 
  systematizes the practice of the path in a detailed and comprehensive 
  manner. Limitations of space prevent an exhaustive treatment of each 
  factor. To compensate for this deficiency I have included a list of 
  recommended readings at the end, which the reader may consult for more 
  detailed explanations of individual path factors. For full commitment 
  to the practice of the path, however, especially in its advanced 
  stages of concentration and insight, it will be extremely helpful to 
  have contact with a properly qualified teacher.
