<BLOCKQUOTE>                                          
  Though right concentration claims the last place among the factors of 
  the Noble Eightfold Path, concentration itself does not mark the 
  path's culmination. The attainment of concentration makes the mind 
  still and steady, unifies its concomitants, opens vast vistas of 
  bliss, serenity, and power. But by itself it does not suffice to reach 
  the highest accomplishment, release from the bonds of suffering. To 
  reach the end of suffering demands that the Eightfold Path be turned 
  into an instrument of discovery, that it be used to generate the 
  insights unveiling the ultimate truth of things. This requires the 
  combined contributions of all eight factors, and thus a new 
  mobilization of right view and right intention. Up to the present 
  point these first two path factors have performed only a preliminary 
  function. Now they have to be taken up again and raised to a higher 
  level. Right view is to become a direct seeing into the real nature of 
  phenomena, previously grasped only conceptually; right intention, to 
  become a true renunciation of defilements born out of deep 
  understanding.
  <p>  
    Before we turn to the development of wisdom, it will be helpful to 
  inquire why concentration is not adequate to the attainment of 
  liberation. Concentration does not suffice to bring liberation because 
  it fails to touch the defilements at their fundamental level. The 
  Buddha teaches that the defilements are stratified into three layers: 
  the stage of latent tendency, the stage of manifestation, and the 
  stage of transgression. The most deeply grounded is the level of 
  latent tendency (<I>anusaya</I>), where a defilement merely lies dormant 
  without displaying any activity. The second level is the stage of 
  manifestation (<I>pariyutthana</I>), where a defilement, through the 
  impact of some stimulus, surges up in the form of unwholesome 
  thoughts, emotions, and volitions. Then, at the third level, the 
  defilement passes beyond a purely mental manifestation to motivate 
  some unwholesome action of body or speech. Hence this level is called 
  the stage of transgression (<I>vitikkama</I>).
  <p>  
    The three divisions of the Noble Eightfold Path provide the check 
  against this threefold layering of the defilements. The first, the 
  training in moral discipline, restrains unwholesome bodily and verbal 
  activity and thus prevents defilements from reaching the stage of 
  transgression. The training in concentration provides the safeguard 
  against the stage of manifestation. It removes already manifest 
  defilements and protects the mind from their continued influx. But 
  even though concentration may be pursued to the depths of full 
  absorption, it cannot touch the basic source of affliction -- the 
  latent tendencies lying dormant in the mental continuum. Against these 
  concentration is powerless, since to root them out calls for more than 
  mental calm. What it calls for, beyond the composure and serenity of 
  the unified mind, is wisdom (<I>panna</I>), a penetrating vision of 
  phenomena in their fundamental mode of being.
  <p>  
    Wisdom alone can cut off the latent tendencies at their root because 
  the most fundamental member of the set, the one which nurtures the 
  others and holds them in place, is ignorance (<I>avijja</I>), and wisdom 
  is the remedy for ignorance. Though verbally a negative, "unknowing," 
  ignorance is not a factual negative, a mere privation of right 
  knowledge. It is, rather, an insidious and volatile mental factor 
  incessantly at work inserting itself into every compartment of our 
  inner life. It distorts cognition, dominates volition, and determines 
  the entire tone of our existence. As the Buddha says: "The element of 
  ignorance is indeed a powerful element" (SN 14:13).
  <p>  
    At the cognitive level, which is its most basic sphere of operation, 
  ignorance infiltrates our perceptions, thoughts, and views, so that we 
  come to misconstrue our experience, overlaying it with multiple strata 
  of delusions. The most important of these delusions are three: the 
  delusions of seeing permanence in the impermanent, of seing 
  satisfaction in the unsatisfactory, and of seeing a self in the 
  selfless.<A HREF="#n1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> Thus we take ourselves and our world to be solid, stable, 
  enduring entities, despite the ubiquitous reminders that everything is 
  subject to change and destruction. We assume we have an innate right 
  to pleasure, and direct our efforts to increasing and intensifying our 
  enjoyment with an anticipatory fervour undaunted by repeated 
  encounters with pain, disappointment, and frustration. And we perceive 
  ourselves as self-contained egos, clinging to the various ideas and 
  images we form of ourselves as the irrefragable truth of our identity.
  <p>  
    Whereas ignorance obscures the true nature of things, wisdom removes 
  the veils of distortion, enabling us to see phenomena in their 
  fundamental mode of being with the vivacity of direct perception. The 
  training in wisdom centres on the development of insight 
  (<I>vipassana-bhavana</I>), a deep and comprehensive seeing into the 
  nature of existence which fathoms the truth of our being in the only 
  sphere where it is directly accessible to us, namely, in our own 
  experience. Normally we are immersed in our experience, identified 
  with it so completely that we do not comprehend it. We live it but 
  fail to understand its nature. Due to this blindness experience comes 
  to be misconstrued, worked upon by the delusions of permanence, 
  pleasure, and self. Of these cognitive distortions, the most deeply 
  grounded and resistant is the delusion of self, the idea that at the 
  core of our being there exists a truly established "I" with which we 
  are essentially identified. This notion of self, the Buddha teaches, 
  is an error, a mere presupposition lacking a real referent. Yet, 
  though a mere presupposition, the idea of self is not inconsequential. 
  To the contrary, it entails consequences that can be calamitous. 
  Because we make the view of self the lookout point from which we 
  survey the world, our minds divide everything up into the dualities of 
  "I" and "not I," what is "mine" and what is "not mine." Then, trapped 
  in these dichotomies, we fall victim to the defilements they breed, 
  the urges to grasp and destroy, and finally to the suffering that 
  inevitably follows.
  <p>  
    To free ourselves from all defilements and suffering, the illusion 
  of selfhood that sustains them has to be dispelled, exploded by the 
  realization of selflessness. Precisely this is the task set for the 
  development of wisdom. The first step along the path of development is 
  an analytical one. In order to uproot the view of self, the field of 
  experience has to be laid out in certain sets of factors, which are 
  then methodically investigated to ascertain that none of them singly 
  or in combination can be taken as a self. This analytical treatment of 
  experience, so characteristic of the higher reaches of Buddhist 
  philosophical psychology, is not intended to suggest that experience, 
  like a watch or car, can be reduced to an accidental conglomeration of 
  separable parts. Experience does have an irreducible unity, but this 
  unity is functional rather than substantial; it does not require the 
  postulate of a unifying self separate from the factors, retaining its 
  identity as a constant amidst the ceaseless flux.
  <p>  
    The method of analysis applied most often is that of the five 
  aggregates of clinging (<I>panc'upadanakkhandha</I>): material form, 
  feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness.<A HREF="#n2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> Material 
  form constitutes the material side of existence: the bodily organism 
  with its sense faculties and the outer objects of cognition. The other 
  four aggregates constitute the mental side. Feeling provides the 
  affective tone, perception the factor of noting and identifying, the 
  mental formations the volitional and emotive elements, and 
  consciousness the basic awareness essential to the whole occasion of 
  experience. The analysis by way of the five aggregates paves the way 
  for an attempt to see experience solely in terms of its constituting 
  factors, without slipping in implicit references to an unfindable 
  self. To gain this perspective requires the development of intensive 
  mindfulness, now applied to the fourth foundation, the contemplation 
  of the factors of existence (<I>dhammanupassana</I>). The disciple will 
  dwell contemplating the five aggregates, their arising and passing:
    
       <BLOCKQUOTE>The disciple dwells in contemplation of phenomena, namely, of the 
       five aggregates of clinging. He knows what material form is, how 
       it arises, how it passes away; knows what feeling is, how it 
       arises, how it passes away; knows what perception is, how it 
       arises, how it passes away; knows what mental formations are, how 
       they arise, how they pass away; knows what consciousness is, how 
       it arises, how it passes away.<A HREF="#n3"><SUP>3</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>
       
    Or the disciple may instead base his contemplation on the six 
  internal and external spheres of sense experience, that is, the six 
  sense faculties and their corresponding objects, also taking note of 
  the "fetters" or defilements that arise from such sensory contacts:
       
      <BLOCKQUOTE> The disciple dwells in contemplation of phenomena, namely, of the 
       six internal and external sense bases. He knows the eye and 
       forms, the ear and sounds, the nose and odours, the tongue and 
       tastes, the body and tangibles, the mind and mental objects; and 
       he knows as well the fetter that arises in dependence on them. He 
       understands how the unarisen fetter arises, how the arisen fetter 
       is abandoned, and how the abandoned fetter does not arise again 
       in the future.<A HREF="#n4"><SUP>4</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>
       
    The view of self is further attenuated by examining the factors of 
  existence, not analytically, but in terms of their relational 
  structure. Inspection reveals that the aggregates exist solely in 
  dependence on conditions. Nothing in the set enjoys the absolute 
  self-sufficiency of being attributed to the assumed "I." Whatever 
  factors in the body-mind complex be looked at, they are found to be 
  dependently arisen, tied to the vast net of events extending beyond 
  themselves temporally and spatially. The body, for example, has arisen 
  through the union of sperm and egg and subsists in dependence on food, 
  water, and air. Feeling, perception, and mental formations occur in 
  dependence on the body with its sense faculties. They require an 
  object, the corresponding consciousness, and the contact of the object 
  with the consciousness through the media of the sense faculties. 
  Consciousness in its turn depends on the sentient organism and the 
  entire assemblage of co-arisen mental factors. This whole process of 
  becoming, moreover, has arisen from the previous lives in this 
  particular chain of existences and inherit all the accumulated kamma 
  of the earlier existences. Thus nothing possesses a self-sufficient 
  mode of being. All conditioned phenomena exist relationally, 
  contingent and dependent on other things.
  <p>  
    The above two steps -- the factorial analysis and the discernment of 
  relations -- help cut away the intellectual adherence to the idea of 
  self, but they lack sufficient power to destroy the ingrained clinging 
  to the ego sustained by erroneous perception. To uproot this subtle 
  form of ego-clinging requires a counteractive perception: direct 
  insight into the empty, coreless nature of phenomena. Such an insight 
  is generated by contemplating the factors of existence in terms of 
  their three universal marks -- impermanence (<I>aniccata</I>), 
  unsatisfactoriness (<I>dukkhata</I>), and selflessness (<I>anattata</I>). 
  Generally, the first of the three marks to be discerned is 
  impermanence, which at the level of insight does not mean merely that 
  everything eventually comes to an end. At this level it means 
  something deeper and more pervasive, namely, that conditioned 
  phenomena are in constant process, happenings which break up and 
  perish almost as soon as they arise. The stable objects appearing to 
  the senses reveal themselves to be strings of momentary formations 
  (<I>sankhara</I>); the person posited by common sense dissolves into a 
  current made up of two intertwining streams -- a stream of material 
  events, the aggregate of material form, and a stream of mental events, 
  the other four aggregates.
  <p>  
    When impermanence is seen, insight into the other two marks closely 
  follows. Since the aggregates are constantly breaking up, we cannot 
  pin our hopes on them for any lasting satisfaction. Whatever 
  expectations we lay on them are bound to be dashed to pieces by their 
  inevitable change. Thus when seen with insight they are <I>dukkha</I>, 
  suffering, in the deepest sense. Then, as the aggregates are 
  impermanent and unsatisfactory, they cannot be taken as self. If they 
  were self, or the belongings of a self, we would be able to control 
  them and bend them to our will, to make them everlasting sources of 
  bliss. But far from being able to exercise such mastery, we find them 
  to be grounds of pain and disappointment. Since they cannot be 
  subjected to control, these very factors of our being are <I>anatta</I>: 
  not a self, not the belongings of a self, just empty, ownerless 
  phenomena occurring in dependence on conditions.
  <p>  
    When the course of insight practice is entered, the eight path 
  factors become charged with an intensity previously unknown. They gain 
  in force and fuse together into the unity of a single cohesive path 
  heading towards the goal. In the practice of insight all eight factors 
  and three trainings co-exist; each is there supporting all the others; 
  each makes its own unique contribution to the work. The factors of 
  moral discipline hold the tendencies to transgression in check with 
  such care that even the thought of unethical conduct does not arise. 
  The factors of the concentration group keep the mind firmly fixed upon 
  the stream of phenomena, contemplating whatever arises with impeccable 
  precision, free from forgetfulness and distraction. Right view, as the 
  wisdom of insight, grows continually sharper and deeper; right 
  intention shows itself in a detachment and steadiness of purpose 
  bringing an unruffled poise to the entire process of contemplation.
  <p>  
    Insight meditation takes as its objective sphere the "conditioned 
  formations" (<I>sankhara</I>) comprised in the five aggregates. Its task 
  is to uncover their essential characteristics: the three marks of 
  impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and selflessness. Because it still 
  deals with the world of conditioned events, the Eightfold Path in the 
  stage of insight is called the mundane path (<I>lokiyamagga</I>). This 
  designation in no way implies that the path of insight is concerned 
  with mundane goals, with achievements falling in the range of samsara. 
  It aspires to transcendence, it leads to liberation, but its objective 
  domain of contemplation still lies within the conditioned world. 
  However, this mundane contemplation of the conditioned serves as the 
  vehicle for reaching the unconditioned, for attaining the 
  supramundane. When insight meditation reaches its climax, when it 
  fully comprehends the impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and 
  selflessness of everything formed, the mind breaks through the 
  conditioned and realizes the unconditioned, Nibbana. It sees Nibbana 
  with direct vision, makes it an object of immediate realization.
  <p>  
    The breakthrough to the unconditioned is achieved by a type of 
  consciousness or mental event called the supramundane path 
  (<I>lokuttaramagga</I>). The supramundane path occurs in four stages, 
  four "supramundane paths," each marking a deeper level of realization 
  and issuing in a fuller degree of liberation, the fourth and last in 
  complete liberation. The four paths can be achieved in close proximity 
  to one another -- for those with extraordinarily sharp faculties even 
  in the same sitting -- or (as is more typically the case) they can be 
  spread out over time, even over several lifetimes.<A HREF="#n5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> The supramundane 
  paths share in common the penetration of the Four Noble Truths. They 
  understand them, not conceptually, but intuitively. They grasp them 
  through vision, seeing them with self-validating certainty to be the 
  invariable truths of existence. The vision of the truths which they 
  present is complete at one moment. The four truths are not understood 
  sequentially, as in the stage of reflection when thought is the 
  instrument of understanding. They are seen simultaneously: to see one 
  truth with the path is to see them all.
  <p>  
    As the path penetrates the four truths, the mind exercises four 
  simultaneous functions, one regarding each truth. It fully comprehends 
  the truth of suffering, seeing all conditioned existence as stamped 
  with the mark of unsatisfactoriness. At the same time it abandons 
  craving, cuts through the mass of egotism and desire that repeatedly 
  gives birth to suffering. Again, the mind realizes cessation, the 
  deathless element Nibbana, now directly present to the inner eye. And 
  fourthly, the mind develops the Noble Eightfold Path, whose eight 
  factors spring up endowed with tremendous power, attained to 
  supramundane stature: right view as the direct seeing of Nibbana, 
  right intention as the mind's application to Nibbana , the triad of 
  ethical factors as the checks on moral transgression, right effort as 
  the energy in the path-consciousness, right mindfulness as the factor 
  of awareness, and right concentration as the mind's one-pointed focus. 
  This ability of the mind to perform four functions at the same moment 
  is compared to a candle's ability to simultaneously burn the wick, 
  consume the wax, dispel darkness, and give light.<A HREF="#n6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>
  <p>  
    The supramundane paths have the special task of eradicating the 
  defilements. Prior to the attainment of the paths, in the stages of 
  concentration and even insight meditation, the defilements were not 
  cut off but were only debilitated, checked and suppressed by the 
  training of the higher mental faculties. Beneath the surface they 
  continued to linger in the form of latent tendencies. But when the 
  supramundane paths are reached, the work of eradication begins.
  <p>  
    Insofar as they bind us to the round of becoming, the defilements 
  are classified into a set of ten "fetters" (<I>samyojana</I>) as follows: 
  (1) personality view, (2) doubt, (3) clinging to rules and rituals, 
  (4) sensual desire, (5) aversion, (6) desire for fine-material 
  existence, (7) desire for immaterial existence, (8) conceit, (9) 
  restlessness, and (10) ignorance. The four supramundane paths each 
  eliminate a certain layer of defilements. The first, the path of 
  stream-entry (<I>sotapatti-magga</I>), cuts off the first three fetters, 
  the coarsest of the set, eliminates them so they can never arise 
  again. "Personality view" (<I>sakkaya-ditthi</I>), the view of a truly 
  existent self in the five aggregates, is cut off since one sees the 
  selfless nature of all phenomena. Doubt is eliminated because one has 
  grasped the truth proclaimed by the Buddha, seen it for oneself, and 
  so can never again hang back due to uncertainty. And clinging to rules 
  and rites is removed since one knows that deliverance can be won only 
  through the practice of the Eightfold Path, not through rigid moralism 
  or ceremonial observances.
  <p>  
    The path is followed immediately by another state of supramundane 
  consciousness known as the fruit (<I>phala</I>), which results from the 
  path's work of cutting off defilements. Each path is followed by its 
  own fruit, wherein for a few moments the mind enjoys the blissful 
  peace of Nibbana before descending again to the level of mundane 
  consciousness. The first fruit is the fruit of stream-entry, and a 
  person who has gone through the experience of this fruit becomes a 
  "stream-enterer" (<I>sotapanna</I>). He has entered the stream of the 
  Dhamma carrying him to final deliverance. He is bound for liberation 
  and can no longer fall back into the ways of an unenlightened 
  worldling. He still has certain defilements remaining in his mental 
  makeup, and it may take him as long as seven more lives to arrive at 
  the final goal, but he has acquired the essential realization needed 
  to reach it, and there is no way he can fall away.
  <p>  
    An enthusiastic practitioner with sharp faculties, after reaching 
  stream-entry, does not relax his striving but puts forth energy to 
  complete the entire path as swiftly as possible. He resumes his 
  practice of insight contemplation, passes through the ascending stages 
  of insight-knowledge, and in time reaches the second path, the path of 
  the once-returner (<I>sakadagami-magga</I>). This supramundane path does 
  not totally eradicate any of the fetters, but it attenuates the roots 
  of greed, aversion, and delusion. Following the path the meditator 
  experiences its fruit, then emerges as a "once-returner" who will 
  return to this world at most only one more time before attaining full 
  liberation.
  <p>  
    But our practitioner again takes up the task of contemplation. At 
  the next stage of supramundane realization he attains the third path, 
  the path of the non-returner (<I>anagami-magga</I>), with which he cuts 
  off the two fetters of sensual desire and ill will. From that point on 
  he can never again fall into the grip of any desire for sense 
  pleasure, and can never be aroused to anger, aversion, or discontent. 
  As a non-returner he will not return to the human state of existence 
  in any future life. If he does not reach the last path in this very 
  life, then after death he will be reborn in a higher sphere in the 
  fine-material world (<I>rupaloka</I>) and there reach deliverance.
  <p>  
    But our meditator again puts forth effort, develops insight, and at 
  its climax enters the fourth path, the path of arahatship 
  (<I>arahatta-magga</I>). With this path he cuts off the five remaining 
  fetters -- desire for fine-material existence and desire for 
  immaterial existence, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance. The first 
  is the desire for rebirth into the celestial planes made accessible by 
  the four jhanas, the planes commonly subsumed under the name "the 
  Brahma-world." The second is the desire for rebirth into the four 
  immaterial planes made accessible by the achievement of the four 
  immaterial attainments. Conceit (<I>mana</I>) is not the coarse type of 
  pride to which we become disposed through an over-estimation of our 
  virtues and talents, but the subtle residue of the notion of an ego 
  which subsists even after conceptually explicit views of self have 
  been eradicated. The texts refer to this type of conceit as the 
  conceit "I am" (<I>asmimana</I>). Restlessness (<I>uddhacca</I>) is the 
  subtle excitement which persists in any mind not yet completely 
  enlightened, and ignorance (<I>avijja</I>) is the fundamental cognitive 
  obscuration which prevents full understanding of the Four Noble 
  Truths. Although the grosser grades of ignorance have been scoured 
  from the mind by the wisdom faculty in the first three paths, a thin 
  veil of ignorance overlays the truths even in the non-returner.
  <p>  
    The path of arahatship strips away this last veil of ignorance and, 
  with it, all the residual mental defilements. This path issues in 
  perfect comprehension of the Four Noble Truths. It fully fathoms the 
  truth of suffering; eradicates the craving from which suffering 
  springs; realizes with complete clarity the unconditioned element, 
  Nibbana, as the cessation of suffering; and consummates the 
  development of the eight factors of the Noble Eightfold Path.
  <p>  
    With the attainment of the fourth path and fruit the disciple 
  emerges as an arahat, one who in this very life has been liberated 
  from all bonds. The arahat has walked the Noble Eightfold Path to its 
  end and lives in the assurance stated so often in the formula from the 
  Pali Canon: "Destroyed is birth; the holy life has been lived; what 
  had to be done has been done; there is no coming back to any state of 
  being." The arahat is no longer a practitioner of the path but its 
  living embodiment. Having developed the eight factors of the path to 
  their consummation, the Liberated One lives in the enjoyment of their 
  fruits, enlightenment and final deliverance.

  <li> In the first edition of this book I stated here that the four paths 
     have to be passed through sequentially, such that there is no 
     attainment of a higher path without first having reached the paths 
     below it. This certainly seems to be the position of the 
     Commentaries. However, the Suttas sometimes show individuals 
     proceeding directly from the stage of worldling to the third or 
     even the fourth path and fruit. Though the commentator explains 
     that they passed through each preceding path and fruit in rapid 
     succession, the canonical texts themselves give no indication that 
     this has transpired but suggest an immediate realization of the 
     higher stages without the intermediate attainment of the lower 
     stages.
