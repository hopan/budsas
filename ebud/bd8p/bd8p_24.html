  Bhikkhu Bodhi is a Buddhist monk of American nationality, born in New 
  York City in 1944. After completing a doctorate in philosophy at the 
  Claremont Graduate School, he came to Sri Lanka for the purpose of 
  entering the Sangha. He received novice ordination in 1972 and higher 
  ordination in 1973, both under the eminent scholar-monk, Ven. 
  Balangoda Ananda Maitreya, with whom he studied Pali and Dhamma. He is 
  the author of several works on Theravada Buddhism, including four 
  translations of major Pali suttas along with their commentaries. Since 
  1984 he has been the Editor for the Buddhist Publication Society, and 
  since 1988 its President.
