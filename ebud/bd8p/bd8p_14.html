<BLOCKQUOTE>                                         
  The next three path factors -- right speech, right action, and right 
  livelihood -- may be treated together, as collectively they make up the 
  first of the three divisions of the path, the division of moral 
  discipline (<I>silakkhandha</I>). Though the principles laid down in this 
  section restrain immoral actions and promote good conduct, their 
  ultimate purpose is not so much ethical as spiritual. They are not 
  prescribed merely as guides to action, but primarily as aids to mental 
  purification. As a necessary measure for human well-being, ethics has 
  its own justification in the Buddha's teaching and its importance 
  cannot be underrated. But in the special context of the Noble 
  Eightfold Path ethical principles are subordinate to the path's 
  governing goal, final deliverance from suffering. Thus for the moral 
  training to become a proper part of the path, it has to be taken up 
  under the tutelage of the first two factors, right view and right 
  intention, and to lead beyond to the trainings in concentration and 
  wisdom.
  <p>  
    Though the training in moral discipline is listed first among the 
  three groups of practices, it should not be regarded lightly. It is 
  the foundation for the entire path, essential for the success of the 
  other trainings. The Buddha himself frequently urged his disciples to 
  adhere to the rules of discipline, "seeing danger in the slightest 
  fault." One time, when a monk approached the Buddha and asked for the 
  training in brief, the Buddha told him: "First establish yourself in 
  the starting point of wholesome states, that is, in purified moral 
  discipline and in right view. Then, when your moral discipline is 
  purified and your view straight, you should practise the four 
  foundations of mindfulness" (SN 47:3).
  <p>  
    The Pali word we have been translating as "moral discipline," 
  <i>sila</i>, appears in the texts with several overlapping meanings all 
  connected with right conduct. In some contexts it means action 
  conforming to moral principles, in others the principles themselves, 
  in still others the virtuous qualities of character that result from 
  the observance of moral principles. <i>Sila</i> in the sense of precepts 
  or principles represents the formalistic side of the ethical training, 
  <i>sila</i> as virtue the animating spirit, and <i>sila</i> as right conduct -- 
  the expression of virtue in real-life situations. Often <i>sila</i> is 
  formally defined as abstinence from unwholesome bodily and verbal 
  action. This definition, with its stress on outer action, appears 
  superficial. Other explanations, however, make up for the deficiency 
  and reveal that there is more to <i>sila</i> than is evident at first 
  glance. The Abhidhamma, for example, equates <i>sila</i> with the mental 
  factors of abstinence (<I>viratiyo</I>) -- right speech, right action, and 
  right livelihood -- an equation which makes it clear that what is really 
  being cultivated through the observance of moral precepts is the mind. 
  Thus while the training in <i>sila</i> brings the "public" benefit of 
  inhibiting socially detrimental actions, it entails the personal 
  benefit of mental purification, preventing the defilements from 
  dictating to us what lines of conduct we should follow.
  <p>  
    The English word "morality" and its derivatives suggest a sense of 
  obligation and constraint quite foreign to the Buddhist conception of 
  <i>sila</i>; this connotation probably enters from the theistic 
  background to Western ethics. Buddhism, with its non-theistic 
  framework, grounds its ethics, not on the notion of obedience, but on 
  that of harmony. In fact, the commentaries explain the word <i>sila</i> 
  by another word, <I>samadhana</I>, meaning "harmony" or "coordination."
  <p>  
    The observance of <i>sila</i> leads to harmony at several 
  levels -- social, psychological, kammic, and contemplative. At the social 
  level the principles of <i>sila</i> help to establish harmonious 
  interpersonal relations, welding the mass of differently constituted 
  members of society -- with their own private interests and goals -- into a 
  cohesive social order in which conflict, if not utterly eliminated, is 
  at least reduced. At the psychological level <i>sila</i> brings harmony 
  to the mind, protection from the inner split caused by guilt and 
  remorse over moral transgressions. At the kammic level the observance 
  of <i>sila</i> ensures harmony with the cosmic law of kamma, hence 
  favourable results in the course of future movement through the round 
  of repeated birth and death. And at the fourth level, the 
  contemplative, <i>sila</i> helps establish the preliminary purification 
  of mind to be completed, in a deeper and more thorough way, by the 
  methodical development of serenity and insight.
  <p>  
    When briefly defined, the factors of moral training are usually 
  worded negatively, in terms of abstinence. But there is more to 
  <i>sila</i> than refraining from what is wrong. Each principle embedded 
  in the precepts, as we will see, actually has two aspects, both 
  essential to the training as a whole. One is abstinence from the 
  unwholesome, the other commitment to the wholesome; the former is 
  called "avoidance" (<I>varitta</I>) and the latter "performance" 
  (<I>caritta</I>). At the outset of training the Buddha stresses the 
  aspect of avoidance. He does so, not because abstinence from the 
  unwholesome is sufficient in itself, but to establish the steps of 
  practice in proper sequence. The steps are set out in their natural 
  order (more logical than temporal) in the famous dictum of the 
  Dhammapada: "To abstain from all evil, to cultivate the good, and to 
  purify one's mind this is the teaching of the Buddhas" (v. 183). The 
  other two steps -- cultivating the good and purifying the mind -- also 
  receive their due, but to ensure their success, a resolve to avoid the 
  unwholesome is a necessity. Without such a resolve the attempt to 
  develop wholesome qualities is bound to issue in a warped and stunted 
  pattern of growth.
  <p>  
    The training in moral discipline governs the two principal channels 
  of outer action, speech and body, as well as another area of vital 
  concern -- one's way of earning a living. Thus the training contains 
  three factors: right speech, right action, and right livelihood. These 
  we will now examine individually, following the order in which they 
  are set forth in the usual exposition of the path.

<H2 ALIGN=center>Right Speech (<I>samma vaca</I>)</H2> 
<p><hr size=5 align=center width=45%><p>
                                          
  The Buddha divides right speech into four components: abstaining from 
  false speech, abstaining from slanderous speech, abstaining from harsh 
  speech, and abstaining from idle chatter. Because the effects of 
  speech are not as immediately evident as those of bodily action, its 
  importance and potential is easily overlooked. But a little reflection 
  will show that speech and its offshoot, the written word, can have 
  enormous consequences for good or for harm. In fact, whereas for 
  beings such as animals who live at the preverbal level physical action 
  is of dominant concern, for humans immersed in verbal communication 
  speech gains the ascendency. Speech can break lives, create enemies, 
  and start wars, or it can give wisdom, heal divisions, and create 
  peace. This has always been so, yet in the modern age the positive and 
  negative potentials of speech have been vastly multiplied by the 
  tremendous increase in the means, speed, and range of communications. 
  The capacity for verbal expression, oral and written, has often been 
  regarded as the distinguishing mark of the human species. From this we 
  can appreciate the need to make this capacity the means to human 
  excellence rather than, as too often has been the case, the sign of 
  human degradation.
   <p> 
<ol>
<li> Abstaining from false speech (<I>musavada veramani</I>)
<p>
<blockquote>    
       Herein someone avoids false speech and abstains from it. He 
       speaks the truth, is devoted to truth, reliable, worthy of 
       confidence, not a deceiver of people. Being at a meeting, or 
       amongst people, or in the midst of his relatives, or in a 
       society, or in the king's court, and called upon and asked as 
       witness to tell what he knows, he answers, if he knows nothing: 
       "I know nothing," and if he knows, he answers: "I know"; if he 
       has seen nothing, he answers: "I have seen nothing," and if he 
       has seen, he answers: "I have seen." Thus he never knowingly 
       speaks a lie, either for the sake of his own advantage, or for 
       the sake of another person's advantage, or for the sake of any 
       advantage whatsoever.<A HREF="#n1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
</blockquote>    
    This statement of the Buddha discloses both the negative and the 
  positive sides to the precept. The negative side is abstaining from 
  lying, the positive side speaking the truth. The determinative factor 
  behind the transgression is the intention to deceive. If one speaks 
  something false believing it to be true, there is no breach of the 
  precept as the intention to deceive is absent. Though the deceptive 
  intention is common to all cases of false speech, lies can appear in 
  different guises depending on the motivating root, whether greed, 
  hatred, or delusion. Greed as the chief motive results in the lie 
  aimed at gaining some personal advantage for oneself or for those 
  close to oneself -- material wealth, position, respect, or admiration. 
  With hatred as the motive, false speech takes the form of the 
  malicious lie, the lie intended to hurt and damage others. When 
  delusion is the principal motive, the result is a less pernicious type 
  of falsehood: the irrational lie, the compulsive lie, the interesting 
  exaggeration, lying for the sake of a joke.
   <p> 
    The Buddha's stricture against lying rests upon several reasons. For 
  one thing, lying is disruptive to social cohesion. People can live 
  together in society only in an atmosphere of mutual trust, where they 
  have reason to believe that others will speak the truth; by destroying 
  the grounds for trust and inducing mass suspicion, widespread lying 
  becomes the harbinger signalling the fall from social solidarity to 
  chaos. But lying has other consequences of a deeply personal nature at 
  least equally disastrous. By their very nature lies tend to 
  proliferate. Lying once and finding our word suspect, we feel 
  compelled to lie again to defend our credibility, to paint a 
  consistent picture of events. So the process repeats itself: the lies 
  stretch, multiply, and connect until they lock us into a cage of 
  falsehoods from which it is difficult to escape. The lie is thus a 
  miniature paradigm for the whole process of subjective illusion. In 
  each case the self-assured creator, sucked in by his own deceptions, 
  eventually winds up their victim.
   <p> 
    Such considerations probably lie behind the words of counsel the 
  Buddha spoke to his son, the young novice Rahula, soon after the boy 
  was ordained. One day the Buddha came to Rahula, pointed to a bowl 
  with a little bit of water in it, and asked: "Rahula, do you see this 
  bit of water left in the bowl?" Rahula answered: "Yes, sir." "So 
  little, Rahula, is the spiritual achievement (<I>samaya</I>, lit. 
  'recluseship') of one who is not afraid to speak a deliberate lie." 
  Then the Buddha threw the water away, put the bowl down, and said: "Do 
  you see, Rahula, how that water has been discarded? In the same way 
  one who tells a deliberate lie discards whatever spiritual achievement 
  he has made." Again he asked: "Do you see how this bowl is now empty? 
  In the same way one who has no shame in speaking lies is empty of 
  spiritual achievement." Then the Buddha turned the bowl upside down 
  and said: "Do you see, Rahula, how this bowl has been turned upside 
  down? In the same way one who tells a deliberate lie turns his 
  spiritual achievements upside down and becomes incapable of progress." 
  Therefore, the Buddha concluded, one should not speak a deliberate lie 
  even in jest.<A HREF="#n2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
  <p>  
    It is said that in the course of his long training for enlightenment 
  over many lives, a bodhisatta can break all the moral precepts except 
  the pledge to speak the truth. The reason for this is very profound, 
  and reveals that the commitment to truth has  a significance 
  transcending the domain of ethics and even mental purification, taking 
  us to the domains of knowledge and being. Truthful speech provides, in 
  the sphere of interpersonal communication, a parallel to wisdom in the 
  sphere of private understanding. The two are respectively the outward 
  and inward modalities of the same commitment to what is real. Wisdom 
  consists in the realization of truth, and truth (<I>sacca</I>) is not 
  just a verbal proposition but the nature of things as they are. To 
  realize truth our whole being has to be brought into accord with 
  actuality, with things as they are, which requires that in 
  communications with others we respect things as they are by speaking 
  the truth. Truthful speech establishes a correspondence between our 
  own inner being and the real nature of phenomena, allowing wisdom to 
  rise up and fathom their real nature. Thus, much more than an ethical 
  principle, devotion to truthful speech is a matter of taking our stand 
  on reality rather than illusion, on the truth grasped by wisdom rather 
  than the fantasies woven by desire.
  <p>
    <li>Abstaining from slanderous speech (<I>pisunaya vacaya veramani</I>)
<p>
<blockquote>    
       He avoids slanderous speech and abstains from it. What he has 
       heard here he does not repeat there, so as to cause dissension 
       there; and what he has heard there he does not repeat here, so as 
       to cause dissension here. Thus he unites those that are divided; 
       and those that are united he encourages. Concord gladdens him, he 
       delights and rejoices in concord; and it is concord that he 
       spreads by his words.<A HREF="#n3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
</blockquote>    
    Slanderous speech is speech intended to create enmity and division, 
  to alienate one person or group from another. The motive behind such 
  speech is generally aversion, resentment of a rival's success or 
  virtues, the intention to tear down others by verbal denigrations. 
  Other motives may enter the picture as well: the cruel intention of 
  causing hurt to others, the evil desire to win affection for oneself, 
  the perverse delight in seeing friends divided.
  <p>  
    Slanderous speech is one of the most serious moral transgressions. 
  The root of hate makes the unwholesome kamma already heavy enough, but 
  since the action usually occurs after deliberation, the negative force 
  becomes even stronger because premeditation adds to its gravity. When 
  the slanderous statement is false, the two wrongs of falsehood and 
  slander combine to produce an extremely powerful unwholesome kamma. 
  The canonical texts record several cases in which the calumny ofan 
  innocent party led to an immediate rebirth in the plane of misery.
  <p>  
    The opposite of slander, as the Buddha indicates, is speech that 
  promotes friendship and harmony. Such speech originates from a mind of 
  lovingkindness and sympathy. It wins the trust and affection of 
  others, who feel they can confide in one without fear that their 
  disclosures will be used against them. Beyond the obvious benefits 
  that such speech brings in this present life, it is said that 
  abstaining from slander has as its kammic result the gain of a retinue 
  of friends who can never be turned against one by the slanderous words 
  of others.<A HREF="#n4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
<p>
  <li> Abstaining from harsh speech (<I>pharusaya vacaya veramani</I>).
<p>
 <blockquote>   
       He avoids harsh language and abstains from it. He speaks such 
       words as are gentle, soothing to the ear, loving, such words as 
       go to the heart, and are courteous, friendly, and agreeable to 
       many.<A HREF="#n5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>
 </blockquote>   
    Harsh speech is speech uttered in anger, intended to cause the 
  hearer pain. Such speech can assume different forms, of which we might 
  mention three. One is <I>abusive speech</I>: scolding, reviling, or 
  reproving another angrily with bitter words. A second is <I>insult</I>: 
  hurting another by ascribing to him some offensive quality which 
  detracts from his dignity. A third is <I>sarcasm</I>: speaking to someone 
  in a way which ostensibly lauds him, but with such a tone or twist of 
  phrasing that the ironic intent becomes clear and causes pain.
  <p>  
    The main root of harsh speech is aversion, assuming the form of 
  anger. Since the defilement in this case tends to work impulsively, 
  without deliberation, the transgression is less serious than slander 
  and the kammic consequence generally less severe. Still, harsh speech 
  is an unwholesome action with disagreeable results for oneself and 
  others, both now and in the future, so it has to be restrained. The 
  ideal antidote is patience -- learning to tolerate blame and criticism 
  from others, to sympathize with their shortcomings, to respect 
  differences in viewpoint, to endure abuse without feeling compelled to 
  retaliate. The Buddha calls for patience even under the most trying 
  conditions:
  <p>  
    Even if, monks, robbers and murderers saw through your limbs and 
  joints, whosoever should give way to anger thereat would not be 
  following my advice. For thus ought you to train yourselves: 
  "Undisturbed shall our mind remain, with heart full of love, and free 
  from any hidden malice; and that person shall we penetrate with loving 
  thoughts, wide, deep, boundless, freed from anger and hatred."<A HREF="#n6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>

 <p>   
   <li> Abstaining from idle chatter (<I>samphappalapa veramani</I>).
<p>
 <blockquote>   
       He avoids idle chatter and abstains from it. He speaks at the 
       right time, in accordance with facts, speaks what is useful, 
       speaks of the Dhamma and the discipline; his speech is like a 
       treasure, uttered at the right moment, accompanied by reason, 
       moderate and full of sense.<A HREF="#n7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>
 </blockquote>  
    Idle chatter is pointless talk, speech that lacks purpose or depth. 
  Such speech communicates nothing of value, but only stirs up the 
  defilements in one's own mind and in others. The Buddha advises that 
  idle talk should be curbed and speech restricted as much as possible 
  to matters of genuine importance. In the case of a monk, the typical 
  subject of the passage just quoted, his words should be selective and 
  concerned primarily with the Dhamma. Lay persons will have more need 
  for affectionate small talk with friends and family, polite 
  conversation with acquaintances, and talk in connection with their 
  line of work. But even then they should be mindful not to let the 
  conversation stray into pastures where the restless mind, always eager 
  for something sweet or spicy to feed on, might find the chance to 
  indulge its defiling propensities.
  <p>  
    The traditional exegesis of abstaining from idle chatter refers only 
  to avoiding engagement in such talk oneself. But today it might be of 
  value to give this factor a different slant, made imperative by 
  certain developments peculiar to our own time, unknown in the days of 
  the Buddha and the ancient commentators. This is avoiding exposure to 
  the idle chatter constantly bombarding us through the new media of 
  communication created by modern technology. An incredible array of 
  devices -- television, radio, newspapers, pulp journals, the cinema -- turns 
  out a continuous stream of needless information and distracting 
  entertainment the net effect of which is to leave the mind passive, 
  vacant, and sterile. All these developments, naively accepted as 
  "progress," threaten to blunt our aesthetic and spiritual 
  sensitivities and deafen us to the higher call of the contemplative 
  life. Serious aspirants on the path to liberation have to be extremely 
  discerning in what they allow themselves to be exposed to. They would 
  greatly serve their aspirations by including these sources of 
  amusement and needless information in the category of idle chatter and 
  making an effort to avoid them.

<p><hr size=5 width=45% align=center><p>
                                          
  Right action means refraining from unwholesome deeds that occur with 
  the body as their natural means of expression. The pivotal element in 
  this path factor is the mental factor of abstinence, but because this 
  abstinence applies to actions performed through the body, it is called 
  "right action." The Buddha mentions three components of right action: 
  abstaining from taking life, abstaining from taking what is not given, 
  and abstaining from sexual misconduct. These we will briefly discuss 
  in order.
  <p>
<ol>  
    <li>Abstaining from the taking of life (<I>panatipata veramani</I>)
    <p>
<blockquote>
       Herein someone avoids the taking of life and abstains from it. 
       Without stick or sword, conscientious, full of sympathy, he is 
       desirous of the welfare of all sentient beings.<A HREF="#n8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>
</blockquote>    
    "Abstaining from taking life" has a wider application than simply 
  refraining from killing other human beings. The precept enjoins 
  abstaining from killing any sentient being. A "sentient being" 
  (<I>pani</I>, <I>satta</I>) is a living being endowed with mind or 
  consciousness; for practical purposes, this means human beings, 
  animals, and insects. Plants are not considered to be sentient beings; 
  though they exhibit some degree of sensitivity, they lack full-fledged 
  consciousness, the defining attribute of a sentient being.
  <p>  
    The "taking of life" that is to be avoided is <I>intentional</I> 
  killing, the deliberate destruction of life of a being endowed with 
  consciousness. The principle is grounded in the consideration that all 
  beings love life and fear death, that all seek happiness and are 
  averse to pain. The essential determinant of transgression is the 
  volition to kill, issuing in an action that deprives a being of life. 
  Suicide is also generally regarded as a violation, but not accidental 
  killing as the intention to destroy life is absent. The abstinence may 
  be taken to apply to two kinds of action, the primary and the 
  secondary. The primary is the actual destruction of life; the 
  secondary is deliberately harming or torturing another being without 
  killing it.
  <p>  
    While the Buddha's statement on non-injury is quite simple and 
  straightforward, later commentaries give a detailed analysis of the 
  principle. A treatise from Thailand, written by an erudite Thai 
  patriarch, collates a mass of earlier material into an especially 
  thorough treatment, which we shall briefly summarize here.<A HREF="#n9"><SUP>9</SUP></A> The 
  treatise points out that the taking of life may have varying degrees 
  of moral weight entailing different consequences. The three primary 
  variables governing moral weight are the object, the motive, and the 
  effort. With regard to the object there is a difference in seriousness 
  between killing a human being and killing an animal, the former being 
  kammically heavier since man has a more highly developed moral sense 
  and greater spiritual potential than animals. Among human beings, the 
  degree of kammic weight depends on the qualities of the person killed 
  and his relation to the killer; thus killing a person of superior 
  spiritual qualities or a personal benefactor, such as a parent or a 
  teacher, is an especially grave act.
  <p>  
    The motive for killing also influences moral weight. Acts of killing 
  can be driven by greed, hatred, or delusion. Of the three, killing 
  motivated by hatred is the most serious, and the weight increases to 
  the degree that the killing is premeditated. The force of effort 
  involved also contributes, the unwholesome kamma being proportional to 
  the force and the strength of the defilements.
  <p>  
    The positive counterpart to abstaining from taking life, as the 
  Buddha indicates, is the development of kindness and compassion for 
  other beings. The disciple not only avoids destroying life; he dwells 
  with a heart full of sympathy, desiring the welfare of all beings. The 
  commitment to non-injury and concern for the welfare of others 
  represent the practical application of the second path factor, right 
  intention, in the form of good will and harmlessness.
  <p>  
  <li> Abstaining from taking what is not given (<I>adinnadana 
  veramani</I>)
  <p>
<blockquote>  
       He avoids taking what is not given and abstains from it; what 
       another person possesses of goods and chattel in the village or 
       in the wood, that he does not take away with thievish intent.<A HREF="#n10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>
</blockquote>    
    "Taking what is not given" means appropriating the rightful 
  belongings of others with thievish intent. If one takes something that 
  has no owner, such as unclaimed stones, wood, or even gems extracted 
  from the earth, the act does not count as a violation even though 
  these objects have not been given. But also implied as a 
  transgression, though not expressly stated, is withholding from others 
  what should rightfully be given to them.
<p>    
    Commentaries mention a number of ways in which "taking what is not 
  given" can be committed. Some of the most common may be enumerated:
<p>
<ol>    
   <li> <I>stealing</I>: taking the belongings of others secretly, as in 
  housebreaking, pickpocketing, etc.;
    
   <li> <I>robbery</I>: taking what belongs to others openly by force or 
  threats;
    
   <li> <I>snatching</I>: suddenly pulling away another's possession before 
  he has time to resist; 
    
    <li> <I>fraudulence</I>: gaining possession of another's belongings by 
  falsely claiming them as one's own;
    
    <li> <I>deceitfulness</I>: using false weights and measures to cheat 
  customers.<A HREF="#n11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>
 </ol>
<p>   
    The degree of moral weight that attaches to the action is determined 
  by three factors: the value of the object taken; the qualities of the 
  victim of the theft; and the subjective state of the thief. Regarding 
  the first, moral weight is directly proportional to the value of the 
  object. Regarding the second, the weight varies according to the moral 
  qualities of the deprived individual. Regarding the third, acts of 
  theft may be motivated either by greed or hatred. While greed is the 
  most common cause, hatred may also be responsible as when one person 
  deprives another of his belongings not so much because he wants them 
  for himself as because he wants to harm the latter. Between the two, 
  acts motivated by hatred are kammically heavier than acts motivated by 
  sheer greed.
<p>    
    The positive counterpart to abstaining from stealing is honesty, 
  which implies respect for the belongings of others and for their right 
  to use their belongings as they wish. Another related virtue is 
  contentment, being satisfied with what one has without being inclined 
  to increase one's wealth by unscrupulous means. The most eminent 
  opposite virtue is generosity, giving away one's own wealth and 
  possessions in order to benefit others.
<p>    
    <li> Abstaining from sexual misconduct (<I>kamesu miccha-cara 
  veramani</I>)
<p>
<blockquote>    
       He avoids sexual misconduct and abstains from it. He has no 
       intercourse with such persons as are still under the protection 
       of father, mother, brother, sister or relatives, nor with married 
       women, nor with female convicts, nor lastly, with betrothed 
       girls.<A HREF="#n12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>
</blockquote>    
    The guiding purposes of this precept, from the ethical standpoint, 
  are to protect marital relations from outside disruption and to 
  promote trust and fidelity within the marital union. From the 
  spiritual standpoint it helps curb the expansive tendency of sexual 
  desire and thus is a step in the direction of renunciation, which 
  reaches its consummation in the observance of celibacy 
  (<I>brahmacariya</I>) binding on monks and nuns. But for laypeople the 
  precept enjoins abstaining from sexual relations with an illicit 
  partner. The primary transgression is entering into full sexual union, 
  but all other sexual involvements of a less complete kind may be 
  considered secondary infringements.
 <p>   
    The main question raised by the precept concerns who is to count as 
  an illicit partner. The Buddha's statement defines the illicit partner 
  from the perspective of the man, but later treatises elaborate the 
  matter for both sexes.<A HREF="#n13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>
  <p>  
    For a man, three kinds of women are considered illicit partners:
  <p>
  <ol>  
    <li> A woman who is married to another man. This includes, besides a 
  woman already married to a man, a woman who is not his legal wife but 
  is generally recognized as his consort, who lives with him or is kept 
  by him or is in some way acknowledged as his partner. All these women 
  are illicit partners for men other than their own husbands. This class 
  would also include a woman engaged to another man. But a widow or 
  divorced woman is not out of bounds, provided she is not excluded for 
  other reasons.
   <p> 
    <li> A woman still under protection. This is a girl or woman who is 
  under the protection of her mother, father, relatives, or others 
  rightfully entitled to be her guardians. This provision rules out 
  elopements or secret marriages contrary to the wishes of the 
  protecting party.
    <p>
    <li> A woman prohibited by convention. This includes close female 
  relatives forbidden as partners by social tradition, nuns and other 
  women under a vow of celibacy, and those prohibited as partners by the 
  law of the land.
    <p>
</ol>
    From the standpoint of a woman, two kinds of men are considered 
  illicit partners:
    <p>
<ol>
    <li> For a married woman any man other than her husband is out of 
  bounds. Thus a married woman violates the precept if she breaks her 
  vow of fidelity to her husband. But a widow or divorcee is free to 
  remarry.
    <p>
    <li> For any woman any man forbidden by convention, such as close 
  relatives and those under a vow of celibacy, is an illicit partner.
    <p>
</ol>
    Besides these, any case of forced, violent, or coercive sexual union 
  constitutes a transgression. But in such a case the violation falls 
  only on the offender, not on the one compelled to submit.
 <p>   
    The positive virtue corresponding to the abstinence is, for 
  laypeople, marital fidelity. Husband and wife should each be faithful 
  and devoted to the other, content with the relationship, and should 
  not risk a breakup to the union by seeking outside partners. The 
  principle does not, however, confine sexual relations to the marital 
  union. It is flexible enough to allow for variations depending on 
  social convention. The essential purpose, as was said, is to prevent 
  sexual relations which are hurtful to others. When mature independent 
  people, though unmarried, enter into a sexual relationship through 
  free consent, so long as no other person is intentionally harmed, no 
  breach of the training factor is involved.
  <p>  
    Ordained monks and nuns, including men and women who have undertaken 
  the eight or ten precepts, are obliged to observe celibacy. They must 
  abstain not only from sexual misconduct, but from all sexual 
  involvements, at least during the period of their vows. The holy life 
  at its highest aims at complete purity in thought, word, and deed, and 
  this requires turning back the tide of sexual desire.
</ol>

  Right livelihood is concerned with ensuring that one earns one's 
  living in a righteous way. For a lay disciple the Buddha teaches that 
  wealth should be gained in accordance with certain standards. One 
  should acquire it only by legal means, not illegally; one should 
  acquire it peacefully, without coercion or violence; one should 
  acquire it honestly, not by trickery or deceit; and one should acquire 
  it in ways which do not entail harm and suffering for others.<A HREF="#n14"><SUP>14</SUP></A> The 
  Buddha mentions five specific kinds of livelihood which bring harm to 
  others and are therefore to be avoided: dealing in weapons, in living 
  beings (including raising animals for slaughter as well as slave trade 
  and prostitution), in meat production and butchery, in poisons, and in 
  intoxicants (AN 5:177). He further names several dishonest means of 
  gaining wealth which fall under wrong livelihood: practising deceit, 
  treachery, soothsaying, trickery, and usury (MN 117). Obviously any 
  occupation that requires violation of right speech and right action is 
  a wrong form of livelihood, but other occupations, such as selling 
  weapons or intoxicants, may not violate those factors and yet be wrong 
  because of their consequences for others.
  <p>  
    The Thai treatise discusses the positive aspects of right livelihood 
  under the three convenient headings of rightness regarding actions, 
  rightness regarding persons, and rightness regarding objects.<A HREF="#n15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> 
  "Rightness regarding actions" means that workers should fulfil their 
  duties diligently and conscientiously, not idling away time, claiming 
  to have worked longer hours than they did, or pocketing the company's 
  goods. "Rightness regarding persons" means that due respect and 
  consideration should be shown to employers, employees, colleagues, and 
  customers. An employer, for example, should assign his workers chores 
  according to their ability, pay them adequately, promote them when 
  they deserve a promotion and give them occasional vacations and 
  bonuses. Colleagues should try to cooperate rather than compete, while 
  merchants should be equitable in their dealings with customers. 
  "Rightness regarding objects" means that in business transactions and 
  sales the articles to be sold should be presented truthfully. There 
  should be no deceptive advertising, misrepresentations of quality or 
  quantity, or dishonest manoeuvers.
