  The second factor of the path is called in Pali <I>samma sankappa</I>, 
  which we will translate as "right intention." The term is sometimes 
  translated as "right thought," a rendering that can be accepted if we 
  add the proviso that in the present context the word "thought" refers 
  specifically to the purposive or conative aspect of mental activity, 
  the cognitive aspect being covered by the first factor, right view. It 
  would be artificial, however, to insist too strongly on the division 
  between these two functions. From the Buddhist perspective, the 
  cognitive and purposive sides of the mind do not remain isolated in 
  separate compartments but intertwine and interact in close 
  correlation. Emotional predilections influence views, and views 
  determine predilections. Thus a penetrating view of the nature of 
  existence, gained through deep reflection and validated through 
  investigation, brings with it a restructuring of values which sets the 
  mind moving towards goals commensurate with the new vision. The 
  application of mind needed to achieve those goals is what is meant by 
  right intention.
  <p>
    The Buddha explains right intention as threefold: the intention of 
  renunciation, the intention of good will, and the intention of 
  harmlessness.<A HREF="#n1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> The three are opposed to three parallel kinds of 
  wrong intention: intention governed by desire, intention governed by 
  ill will, and intention governed by harmfulness.<A HREF="#n2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> Each kind of right 
  intention counters the corresponding kind of wrong intention. The 
  intention of renunciation counters the intention of desire, the 
  intention of good will counters the intention of ill will, and the 
  intention of harmlessness counters the intention of harmfulness.
 <p>   
    The Buddha discovered this twofold division of thought in the period 
  prior to his Enlightenment (see MN 19). While he was striving for 
  deliverance, meditating in the forest, he found that his thoughts 
  could be distributed into two different classes. In one he put 
  thoughts of desire, ill will, and harmfulness, in the other thoughts 
  of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness. Whenever he noticed 
  thoughts of the first kind arise in him, he understood that those 
  thoughts lead to harm for oneself and others, obstruct wisdom, and 
  lead away from Nibbana. Reflecting in this way he expelled such 
  thoughts from his mind and brought them to an end. But whenever 
  thoughts of the second kind arose, he understood those thoughts to be 
  beneficial, conducive to the growth of wisdom, aids to the attainment 
  of Nibbana. Thus he strengthened those thoughts and brought them to 
  completion.
   <p> 
    Right intention claims the second place in the path, between right 
  view and the triad of moral factors that begins with right speech, 
  because the mind's intentional function forms the crucial link 
  connecting our cognitive perspective with our modes of active 
  engagement in the world. On the one side actions always point back to 
  the thoughts from which they spring. Thought is the forerunner of 
  action, directing body and speech, stirring them into activity, using 
  them as its instruments for expressing its aims and ideals. These aims 
  and ideals, our intentions, in turn point back a further step to the 
  prevailing views. When wrong views prevail, the outcome is wrong 
  intention giving rise to unwholesome actions. Thus one who denies the 
  moral efficacy of action and measures achievement in terms of gain and 
  status will aspire to nothing but gain and status, using whatever 
  means he can to acquire them. When such pursuits become widespread, 
  the result is suffering, the tremendous suffering of individuals, 
  social groups, and nations out to gain wealth, position, and power 
  without regard for consequences. The cause for the endless 
  competition, conflict, injustice, and oppression does not lie outside 
  the mind. These are all just manifestations of intentions, 
  outcroppings of thoughts driven by greed, by hatred, by delusion.
  <p>  
    But when the intentions are right, the actions will be right, and 
  for the intentions to be right the surest guarantee is right views. 
  One who recognizes the law of kamma, that actions bring retributive 
  consequences, will frame his pursuits to accord with this law; thus 
  his actions, expressive of his intentions, will conform to the canons 
  of right conduct. The Buddha succinctly sums up the matter when he 
  says that for a person who holds a wrong view, his deeds, words, 
  plans, and purposes grounded in that view will lead to suffering, 
  while for a person who holds right view, his deeds, words, plans, and 
  purposes grounded in that view will lead to happiness.<A HREF="#n3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
   <p> 
    Since the most important formulation of right view is the 
  understanding of the Four Noble Truths, it follows that this view 
  should be in some way determinative of the content of right intention. 
  This we find to be in fact the case. Understanding the four truths in 
  relation to one's own life gives rise to the intention of 
  renunciation; understanding them in relation to other beings gives 
  rise to the other two right intentions. When we see how our own lives 
  are pervaded by <i>dukkha</i>, and how this <i>dukkha</i> derives from 
  craving, the mind inclines to renunciation -- to abandoning craving 
  and the objects to which it binds us. Then, when we apply the truths 
  in an analogous way to other living beings, the contemplation nurtures 
  the growth of good will and harmlessness. We see that, like ourselves, 
  all other living beings want to be happy, and again that like 
  ourselves they are subject to suffering. The consideration that all 
  beings seek happiness causes thoughts of good will to arise -- the 
  loving wish that they be well, happy, and peaceful. The consideration 
  that beings are exposed to suffering causes thoughts of harmlessness 
  to arise -- the compassionate wish that they be free from suffering.
   <p> 
    The moment the cultivation of the Noble Eightfold Path begins, the 
  factors of right view and right intention together start to counteract 
  the three unwholesome roots. Delusion, the primary cognitive 
  defilement, is opposed by right view, the nascent seed of wisdom. The 
  complete eradication of delusion will only take place when right view 
  is developed to the stage of full realization, but every flickering of 
  correct understanding contributes to its eventual destruction. The 
  other two roots, being emotive defilements, require opposition through 
  the redirecting of intention, and thus meet their antidotes in 
  thoughts of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness.
    <p>
    Since greed and aversion are deeply grounded, they do not yield 
  easily; however, the work of overcoming them is not impossible if an 
  effective strategy is employed. The path devised by the Buddha makes 
  use of an indirect approach: it proceeds by tackling the thoughts to 
  which these defilements give rise. Greed and aversion surface in the 
  form of thoughts, and thus can be eroded by a process of "thought 
  substitution," by replacing them with the thoughts opposed to them. 
  The intention of renunciation provides the remedy to greed. Greed 
  comes to manifestation in thoughts of desire -- as sensual, 
  acquisitive, and possessive thoughts. Thoughts of renunciation spring 
  from the wholesome root of non-greed, which they activate whenever 
  they are cultivated. Since contrary thoughts cannot coexist, when 
  thoughts of renunciation are roused, they dislodge thoughts of desire, 
  thus causing non-greed to replace greed. Similarly, the intentions of 
  good will and harmlessness offer the antidote to aversion. Aversion 
  comes to manifestation either in thoughts of ill will -- as angry, 
  hostile, or resentful thoughts; or in thoughts of harming -- as the 
  impulses to cruelty, aggression, and destruction. Thoughts of good 
  will counter the former outflow of aversion, thoughts of harmlessness 
  the latter outflow, in this way excising the unwholesome root of 
  aversion itself.

<H2 ALIGN=center>The Intention of Renunciation</H2>
<p><hr size=5 align=center width=45%><p>
                                          
    The Buddha describes his teaching as running contrary to the way of 
  the world. The way of the world is the way of desire, and the 
  unenlightened who follow this way flow with the current of desire, 
  seeking happiness by pursuing the objects in which they imagine they 
  will find fulfilment. The Buddha's message of renunciation states 
  exactly the opposite: the pull of desire is to be resisted and 
  eventually abandoned. Desire is to be abandoned not because it is 
  morally evil but because it is a root of suffering.<A HREF="#n4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> Thus 
  renunciation, turning away from craving and its drive for 
  gratification, becomes the key to happiness, to freedom from the hold 
  of attachment.
  <p>  
    The Buddha does not demand that everyone leave the household life 
  for the monastery or ask his followers to discard all sense enjoyments 
  on the spot. The degree to which a person renounces depends on his or 
  her disposition and situation. But what remains as a guiding principle 
  is this: that the attainment of deliverance requires the complete 
  eradication of craving, and progress along the path is accelerated to 
  the extent that one overcomes craving. Breaking free from domination 
  by desire may not be easy, but the difficulty does not abrogate the 
  necessity. Since craving is the origin of <I>dukkha</I>, putting an end to 
  dukkha depends on eliminating craving, and that involves directing the 
  mind to renunciation.
  <p>  
    But it is just at this point, when one tries to let go of 
  attachment, that one encounters a powerful inner resistance. The mind 
  does not want to relinquish its hold on the objects to which it has 
  become attached. For such a long time it has been accustomed to 
  gaining, grasping, and holding, that it seems impossible to break 
  these habits by an act of will. One might agree to the need for 
  renunciation, might want to leave attachment behind, but when the call 
  is actually sounded the mind recoils and continues to move in the grip 
  of its desires.
   <p> 
    So the problem arises of how to break the shackles of desire. The 
  Buddha does not offer as a solution the method of repression -- the 
  attempt to drive desire away with a mind full of fear and loathing. 
  This approach does not resolve the problem but only pushes it below 
  the surface, where it continues to thrive. The tool the Buddha holds 
  out to free the mind from desire is understanding. Real renunciation 
  is not a matter of compelling ourselves to give up things still 
  inwardly cherished, but of changing our perspective on them so that 
  they no longer bind us. When we understand the nature of desire, when 
  we investigate it closely with keen attention, desire falls away by 
  itself, without need for struggle.
  <p>  
    To understand desire in such a way that we can loosen its hold, we 
  need to see that desire is invariably bound up with <i>dukkha</i>. The 
  whole phenomenon of desire, with its cycle of wanting and 
  gratification, hangs on our way of seeing things. We remain in bondage 
  to desire because we see it as our means to happiness. If we can look 
  at desire from a different angle, its force will be abated, resulting 
  in the move towards renunciation. What is needed to alter perception 
  is something called "wise consideration" (<I>yoniso manasikara</I>). Just 
  as perception influences thought, so thought can influence perception. 
  Our usual perceptions are tinged with "unwise consideration" 
  (<I>ayoniso manasikara</I>). We ordinarily look only at the surfaces of 
  things, scan them in terms of our immediate interests and wants; only 
  rarely do we dig into the roots of our involvements or explore their 
  long-range consequences. To set this straight calls for wise 
  consideration: looking into the hidden undertones to our actions, 
  exploring their results, evaluating the worthiness of our goals. In 
  this investigation our concern must not be with what is pleasant but 
  with what is true. We have to be prepared and willing to discover what 
  is true even at the cost of our comfort. For real security always lies 
  on the side of truth, not on the side of comfort.
   <p> 
    When desire is scrutinized closely, we find that it is constantly 
  shadowed by <i>dukkha</i>. Sometimes <i>dukkha</i> appears as pain or 
  irritation; often it lies low as a constant strain of discontent. But 
  the two -- desire and <i>dukkha</i> -- are inseparable concomitants. We 
  can confirm this for ourselves by considering the whole cycle of 
  desire. At the moment desire springs up it creates in us a sense of 
  lack, the pain of want. To end this pain we struggle to fulfil the 
  desire. If our effort fails, we experience frustration, 
  disappointment, sometimes despair. But even the pleasure of success is 
  not unqualified. We worry that we might lose the ground we have 
  gained. We feel driven to secure our position, to safeguard our 
  territory, to gain more, to rise higher, to establish tighter 
  controls. The demands of desire seem endless, and each desire demands 
  the eternal: it wants the things we get to last forever. But all the 
  objects of desire are impermanent. Whether it be wealth, power, 
  position, or other persons, separation is inevitable, and the pain 
  that accompanies separation is proportional to the force of 
  attachment: strong attachment brings much suffering; little attachment 
  brings little suffering; no attachment brings no suffering.<A HREF="#n5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>
  <p>  
    Contemplating the <i>dukkha</i> inherent in desire is one way to 
  incline the mind to renunciation. Another way is to contemplate 
  directly the benefits flowing from renunciation. To move from desire 
  to renunciation is not, as might be imagined, to move from happiness 
  to grief, from abundance to destitution. It is to pass from gross, 
  entangling pleasures to an exalted happiness and peace, from a 
  condition of servitude to one of self-mastery. Desire ultimately 
  breeds fear and sorrow, but renunciation gives fearlessness and joy. 
  It promotes the accomplishment of all three stages of the threefold 
  training: it purifies conduct, aids concentration, and nourishes the 
  seed of wisdom. The entire course of practice from start to finish can 
  in fact be seen as an evolving process of renunciation culminating in 
  Nibbana as the ultimate stage of relinquishment, "the relinquishing of 
  all foundations of existence" (<I>sabb'upadhipatinissagga</I>).
   <p> 
    When we methodically contemplate the dangers of desire and the 
  benefits of renunciation, gradually we steer our mind away from the 
  domination of desire. Attachments are shed like the leaves of a tree, 
  naturally and spontaneously. The changes do not come suddenly, but 
  when there is persistent practice, there is no doubt that they will 
  come. Through repeated contemplation one thought knocks away another, 
  the intention of renunciation dislodges the intention of desire.

<H2 ALIGN=center>The Intention of Good Will</H2>
<p><hr size=5 align=center width=45%><p> 
                                          
    The intention of good will opposes the intention of ill will, 
  thoughts governed by anger and aversion. As in the case of desire, 
  there are two ineffective ways of handling ill will. One is to yield 
  to it, to express the aversion by bodily or verbal action. This 
  approach releases the tension, helps drive the anger "out of one's 
  system," but it also poses certain dangers. It breeds resentment, 
  provokes retaliation, creates enemies, poisons relationships, and 
  generates unwholesome kamma; in the end, the ill will does not leave 
  the "system" after all, but instead is driven down to a deeper level 
  where it continues to vitiate one's thoughts and conduct. The other 
  approach, repression, also fails to dispel the destructive force of 
  ill will. It merely turns that force around and pushes it inward, 
  where it becomes transmogrified into self-contempt, chronic 
  depression, or a tendency to irrational outbursts of violence.
  <p>  
    The remedy the Buddha recommends to counteract ill will, especially 
  when the object is another person, is a quality called in Pali 
  <i>metta</i>. This word derives from another word meaning "friend," but 
  <i>metta</i> signifies much more than ordinary friendliness. I prefer to 
  translate it by the compound "lovingkindness," which best captures the 
  intended sense: an intense feeling of selfless love for other beings 
  radiating outwards as a heartfelt concern for their well-being and 
  happiness. <i>Metta</i> is not just sentimental good will, nor is it a 
  conscientious response to a moral imperative or divine command. It 
  must become a deep inner feeling, characterized by spontaneous warmth 
  rather than by a sense of obligation. At its peak <i>metta</i> rises to 
  the heights of a <I>brahmavihara</I>, a "divine dwelling," a total way of 
  being centred on the radiant wish for the welfare of all living 
  beings.
  <p>  
    The kind of love implied by <i>metta</i> should be distinguished from 
  sensual love as well as from the love involved in personal affection. 
  The first is a form of craving, necessarily self-directed, while the 
  second still includes a degree of attachment: we love a person because 
  that person gives us pleasure, belongs to our family or group, or 
  reinforces our own self-image. Only rarely does the feeling of 
  affection transcend all traces of ego-reference, and even then its 
  scope is limited. It applies only to a certain person or group of 
  people while excluding others.
  <p>  
    The love involved in <i>metta</i>, in contrast, does not hinge on 
  particular relations to particular persons. Here the reference point 
  of self is utterly omitted. We are concerned only with suffusing 
  others with a mind of lovingkindness, which ideally is to be developed 
  into a universal state, extended to all living beings without 
  discriminations or reservations. The way to impart to <i>metta</i> this 
  universal scope is to cultivate it as an exercise in meditation. 
  Spontaneous feelings of good will occur too sporadically and are too 
  limited in range to be relied on as the remedy for aversion. The idea 
  of deliberately developing love has been criticized as contrived, 
  mechanical, and calculated. Love, it is said, can only be genuine when 
  it is spontaneous, arisen without inner prompting or effort. But it is 
  a Buddhist thesis that the mind cannot be commanded to love 
  spontaneously; it can only be shown the means to develop love and 
  enjoined to practise accordingly. At first the means has to be 
  employed with some deliberation, but through practice the feeling of 
  love becomes ingrained, grafted onto the mind as a natural and 
  spontaneous tendency.
   <p> 
    The method of development is <I>metta-bhavana</I>, the meditation on 
  lovingkindness, one of the most important kinds of Buddhist 
  meditation. The meditation begins with the development of 
  lovingkindness towards oneself.<A HREF="#n6"><SUP>6</SUP></A> It is suggested that one take 
  oneself as the first object of <i>metta</i> because true lovingkindness 
  for others only becomes possible when one is able to feel genuine 
  lovingkindness for oneself. Probably most of the anger and hostility 
  we direct to others springs from negative attitudes we hold towards 
  ourselves. When <i>metta</i> is directed inwards towards oneself, it 
  helps to melt down the hardened crust created by these negative 
  attitudes, permitting a fluid diffusion of kindness and sympathy 
  outwards.
  <p>  
    Once one has learned to kindle the feeling of <i>metta</i> towards 
  oneself, the next step is to extend it to others. The extension of 
  <i>metta</i> hinges on a shift in the sense of identity, on expanding the 
  sense of identity beyond its ordinary confines and learning to 
  identify with others. The shift is purely psychological in method, 
  entirely free from theological and metaphysical postulates, such as 
  that of a universal self immanent in all beings. Instead, it proceeds 
  from a simple, straightforward course of reflection which enables us 
  to share the subjectivity of others and experience the world (at least 
  imaginatively) from the standpoint of their own inwardness. The 
  procedure starts with oneself. If we look into our own mind, we find 
  that the basic urge of our being is the wish to be happy and free from 
  suffering. Now, as soon as we see this in ourselves, we can 
  immediately understand that all living beings share the same basic 
  wish. All want to be well, happy, and secure. To develop <i>metta</i> 
  towards others, what is to be done is to imaginatively share their own 
  innate wish for happiness. We use our own desire for happiness as the 
  key, experience this desire as the basic urge of others, then come 
  back to our own position and extend to them the wish that they may 
  achieve their ultimate objective, that they may be well and happy.
  <p>  
    The methodical radiation of <i>metta</i> is practised first by 
  directing <i>metta</i> to individuals representing certain groups. These 
  groups are set in an order of progressive remoteness from oneself. The 
  radiation begins with a dear person, such as a parent or teacher, then 
  moves on to a friend, then to a neutral person, then finally to a 
  hostile person. Though the types are defined by their relation to 
  oneself, the love to be developed is not based on that relation but on 
  each person's common aspiration for happiness. With each individual 
  one has to bring his (or her) image into focus and radiate the 
  thought: "May he (she) be well! May he (she) be happy! May he (she) be 
  peaceful!"<A HREF="#n7"><SUP>7</SUP></A> Only when one succeeds in generating a warm feeling of 
  good will and kindness towards that person should one turn to the 
  next. Once one gains some success with individuals, one can then work 
  with larger units. One can try developing <i>metta</i> towards all 
  friends, all neutral persons, all hostile persons. Then <i>metta</i> can 
  be widened by directional suffusion, proceeding in the various 
  directions -- east, south, west, north, above, below -- then it can be 
  extended to all beings without distinction. In the end one suffuses 
  the entire world with a mind of lovingkindness "vast, sublime, and 
  immeasurable, without enmity, without aversion."
    
<a name="harmless">    
<p><hr size=5 align=center width=45%><p>     
<H2 ALIGN=center>The Intention of Harmlessness</H2>
<p><hr size=5 align=center width=45%><p> 
                                          
    The intention of harmlessness is thought guided by compassion 
  (<I>karuna</I>), aroused in opposition to cruel, aggressive, and violent 
  thoughts. Compassion supplies the complement to lovingkindness. 
  Whereas lovingkindness has the characteristic of wishing for the 
  happiness and welfare of others, compassion has the characteristic of 
  wishing that others be free from suffering, a wish to be extended 
  without limits to all living beings. Like <i>metta</i>, compassion arises 
  by entering into the subjectivity of others, by sharing their 
  interiority in a deep and total way. It springs up by considering that 
  all beings, like ourselves, wish to be free from suffering, yet 
  despite their wishes continue to be harassed by pain, fear, sorrow, 
  and other forms of <i>dukkha</i>.
  <p>  
    To develop compassion as a meditative exercise, it is most effective 
  to start with somebody who is actually undergoing suffering, since 
  this provides the natural object for compassion. One contemplates this 
  person's suffering, either directly or imaginatively, then reflects 
  that like oneself, he (she) also wants to be free from suffering. The 
  thought should be repeated, and contemplation continually exercised, 
  until a strong feeling of compassion swells up in the heart. Then, 
  using that feeling as a standard, one turns to different individuals, 
  considers how they are each exposed to suffering, and radiates the 
  gentle feeling of compassion out to them. To increase the breadth and 
  intensity of compassion it is helpful to contemplate the various 
  sufferings to which living beings are susceptible. A useful guideline 
  to this extension is provided by the first noble truth, with its 
  enumeration of the different aspects of <i>dukkha</i>. One contemplates 
  beings as subject to old age, then as subject to sickness, then to 
  death, then to sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair, and so 
  forth.
  <p>  
    When a high level of success has been achieved in generating 
  compassion by the contemplation of beings who are directly afflicted 
  by suffering, one can then move on to consider people who are 
  presently enjoying happiness which they have acquired by immoral 
  means. One might reflect that such people, despite their superficial 
  fortune, are doubtlessly troubled deep within by the pangs of 
  conscience. Even if they display no outward signs of inner distress, 
  one knows that they will eventually reap the bitter fruits of their 
  evil deeds, which will bring them intense suffering. Finally, one can 
  widen the scope of one's contemplation to include all living beings. 
  One should contemplate all beings as subject to the universal 
  suffering of <I>samsara</I>, driven by their greed, aversion, and 
  delusion through the round of repeated birth and death. If compassion 
  is initially difficult to arouse towards beings who are total 
  strangers, one can strengthen it by reflecting on the Buddha's dictum 
  that in this beginningless cycle of rebirths, it is hard to find even 
  a single being who has not at some time been one's own mother or 
  father, sister or brother, son or daughter.
  <p>  
    To sum up, we see that the three kinds of right intention -- of 
  renunciation, good will, and harmlessness -- counteract the three 
  wrong intentions of desire, ill will, and harmfulness. The importance 
  of putting into practice the contemplations leading to the arising of 
  these thoughts cannot be overemphasized. The contemplations have been 
  taught as methods for cultivation, not mere theoretical excursions. To 
  develop the intention of renunciation we have to contemplate the 
  suffering tied up with the quest for worldly enjoyment; to develop the 
  intention of good will we have to consider how all beings desire 
  happiness; to develop the intention of harmlessness we have to 
  consider how all beings wish to be free from suffering. The 
  unwholesome thought is like a rotten peg lodged in the mind; the 
  wholesome thought is like a new peg suitable to replace it. The actual 
  contemplation functions as the hammer used to drive out the old peg 
  with the new one. The work of driving in the new peg is practice -- 
  practising again and again, as often as is necessary to reach success. 
  The Buddha gives us his assurance that the victory can be achieved. He 
  says that whatever one reflects upon frequently becomes the 
  inclination of the mind. If one frequently thinks sensual, hostile, or 
  harmful thoughts, desire, ill will, and harmfulness become the 
  inclination of the mind. If one frequently thinks in the opposite way, 
  renunciation, good will, and harmlessness become the inclination of 
  the mind (MN 19). The direction we take always comes back to 
  ourselves, to the intentions we generate moment by moment in the 
  course of our lives.

  <li>Strictly speaking, greed or desire (<I>raga</I>)  becomes immoral only 
    when it impels actions violating the basic principles of ethics, 
    such as killing, stealing, adultery, etc. When it remains merely as 
    a mental factor or issues in actions not inherently immoral -- e.g. 
    the enjoyment of good food, the desire for recognition, sexual 
    relations that do not hurt others -- it is not immoral but is still 
    a form of craving causing bondage to suffering.

  <li>This might appear to contradict what we said earlier, that 
    <i>metta</i> is free from self-reference. The contradiction is only 
    apparent, however, for in developing <i>metta</i> towards oneself one 
    regards oneself objectively, as a third person. Further, the kind 
    of love developed is not self-cherishing but a detached altruistic 
    wish for one's own well-being.
