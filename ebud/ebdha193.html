      <td width="100%"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">O</font>n the
        occasion of giving a special talk, I feel I should deal with those
        important subjects that most adequately sum up the principles of Dhamma
        (Ultimate Truth; the truth of nature; the duty of all that lives; the
        teachings of the Buddha.) So I have resolved to speak on &quot;The
        Essential Points of the Buddhist Teachings&quot; in a hope that a grasp
        of them will greatly facilitate a wide-ranging advance on your studies.
        If these points are not grasped, it will be confusing. You will feel
        that there are a great number of things to be known and that they keep
        increasing until there are too many to understand and practice. This is
        the root cause of failure, for it results in discouragement and an
        interest that becomes more and more unfocused and imprecise. In the end,
        it's as if one is carrying around a great load of knowledge without
        being capable of studying or practicing so as to make use of it.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So please set your mind on some
        revision, on order to grasp the essential points of the Buddhist
        Teachings, so as to realize the knowledge that is the foundation for a
        correct understanding of Dhamma. I emphasize that it is the foundation,
        because there is knowledge that is not a foundation, just as there is
        incorrect understanding, understanding of the sort that deviates little
        by little until it is no longer Buddhist teaching. Or if it is still
        Buddhist teaching, it is an offshoot of it that is continually branching
        away from the trunk.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">To call something the foundation of the
        Buddhist Teachings is only correct if firstly, it is a principle which
        aims at the extinction of Dukkha (the suffering, unsatisfactoriness or
        imperfection of every experience or state clung to as being
        &quot;I&quot; or &quot;mine&quot;) and, secondly, it has a logic that
        one can see for oneself without having to believe others. These are the
        most important constituents of a foundation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha refused to have any dealings
        with those things which don't lead to the extinction of Dukkha. Take the
        question of whether or not there is rebirth. What is reborn? How is it
        reborn? What is its kammic inheritance? (kamma-is volitional action by
        means of body, speech or mind.) These questions are not aimed at the
        extinction of Dukkha. That being so, they are not Buddhist teaching and
        they are not connected with it. They do not lie in the sphere of
        Buddhism. Also, one who asks about such matters has no choice but to
        indiscriminately believe the answer he is given, because the one who
        answers is not going to be able to produce any proofs, he's just going
        to speak according to his memory and feeling. The listener can't see for
        himself and so has to blindly believe the other's words. Little by
        little the matter strays from Dhamma until its something else
        altogether, unconnected with the extinction of Dukkha.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, if one doesn't raise those sort of
        problems, one can ask instead, &quot;Is there Dukkha?&quot; and
        &quot;How can Dukkha be extinguished?&quot; To these questions the
        Buddha agreed to answer, and the listener can see the truth of every
        word of his answer without having to blindly believe them, see more and
        more clearly until he understands. And if one understands to the extent
        of being able to extinguish Dukkha, then that is the ultimate
        understanding. One knows that, even at this moment, there is no person
        living; one sees without a doubt that there is no self or anything
        belonging to a self. There is just a feeling of &quot;I&quot; and
        &quot;mine&quot; arising due to the foolishness whereby one is deluded
        by the beguiling nature of sense-experience. Therefore, there being no
        one born here, there is no one who dies and is reborn. So, the whole
        question of rebirth is utterly foolish and nothing to do with Buddhism
        at all.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddhist teachings aim to inform us
        that there is no self and nothing belonging to a self, there is only the
        false understanding of the ignorant mind. There is merely body and mind,
        which are nothing but natural processes. They function like a mechanism
        that can process and transform data. If they do so by the wrong method,
        it gives rise to foolishness and delusion, so that one feels that there
        is a self and things which belong to a self. If they do so by the
        correct method, those feelings do not arise; there is the primal
        truth-discerning awareness (satipanna), the fundamental true knowing and
        clear seeing that there is no self and nothing belonging to a self.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The matter of &quot;I&quot; and
        &quot;mine&quot; is the single essential point of the Buddhist
        teachings. It is the one thing which must be completely purged. It
        follows that here lies the knowing, understanding, and practice of all
        the Buddhist teachings without exception. So please pay full attention.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In regards to the foundations or root
        principles of Dhamma, there aren't a great deal. The Buddha said that
        there was a single handful. A sutta in the Samyutta Nikaya makes this
        clear. While walking through the forest, the Buddha picked up a handful
        of fallen leaves and asked the monks who were present, which was the
        greater amount - the leaves in his hand or all the leave in the forest.
        They all said that the leaves in the forest were much more, so much that
        it was beyond comparison. Even now, try to imagine the scene and see the
        truth of this, how much more they are, The Buddha then said that,
        similarly, those things which he had realized and which he knew were a
        great amount, equal to all the leaves in the forest - but that which was
        necessary to know, those things which should be taught and practiced,
        were equal to the number of leaves in his hand.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So from this it can be taken that,
        compared to all the myriad things that are to be found in the world, the
        root principles to be practiced to completely extinguish Dukkha amount
        to a single handful. We should appreciate that this &quot;single
        handful&quot; is not a huge amount, it's not something beyond our
        capabilities to reach and understand. This is the first important point
        that we must grasp if we want to lay the foundations for a correct
        understanding of the Buddhist teachings.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here we reach the phrase, &quot;the
        Buddhist Teachings&quot;. Please understand the phrase correctly. These
        days, that which is labeled as the &quot;Buddhist Teachings&quot; is a
        very nebulous thing - that is to say it is extensive without much
        definition. In the Buddha's time, a different word was used, the word
        &quot;<i>dhamma</i>&quot;; it referred specifically to the dhamma which
        extinguishes Dukkha. The dhamma of the Buddha was called Samana Gotama's
        dhamma. If it was the dhamma of another sect - say that of Nigantha
        Nataputta (contemporary of the Buddha and founder of the Jain religion)
        - it would be called Nigantha Nataputta's dhamma. One who liked a
        particular dhamma would try to study it until he understood it and then
        practiced accordingly. It was called dhamma and that is what it was,
        real pure dhamma without any of the numerous things which have come to
        be associated with it in later times. Now we call those appendages
        &quot;Buddhist Teachings&quot;. Due to our carelessness the
        &quot;Buddhist Teachings&quot; have become so nebulous that they include
        within them many things foreign to them.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The real Buddhist Teachings alone are
        already abundant - as many as all the leaves in the forest - but that
        which has to be studied and practiced is merely a handful, and that's
        already plenty. But nowadays we go and include those things which are
        associated with the teachings, such as the history of the religion and
        an expanded psychology. Take <i>Abhidhamma</i> (the third of the three
        &quot;baskets&quot; of the Buddhist scriptures. Compiled after the
        Buddha's death, they are a complete analysis of mind and matter into
        their constituent parts), some parts of it have become psychology, some
        parts philosophy, it's continually expanding to fulfill the requirement
        of those disciplines. And there are many more offshoots, so that things
        which are associated with the Teachings have become exceedingly
        numerous. They have all been swept in together under one term, so that
        there have become to be a large number of &quot;Buddhist
        Teachings&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we don't know how to take hold of the
        essential points, then it will seem that there's a great amount and we
        won't be able to choose between them. It will be like going into a shop
        selling a great variety of goods, and being completely at a loss what to
        take. So we will just follow our common sense -a bit of this, a bit of
        that, as we see fit. And mostly we will take those things which agree
        with defilements (kilesa) rather than let ourselves be guided by
        truth-discerning awareness. Spiritual life becomes a matter of rites and
        rituals, of making merit by rote or to ensure against some fear or
        other. There is no contact with the real Buddhist Teachings.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let us know how to separate the Buddhist
        Teachings from those things which have merely come to be associated with
        them and included under the same name. Even in the Teachings themselves,
        we must still know how to distinguish the root principles, the essential
        points, and it is of these things that I have resolved to talk.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The spiritual disease of our time is the
        disease whose germ lies in the feeling of &quot;we&quot; and
        &quot;ours&quot;, &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot; that is regularly
        present in the mind. The germ that is already in the mind develops first
        into the feeling of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot; and them, acting
        through the influence of self-centeredness, becomes greed, hate and
        delusion, causing upset for both oneself and others. These are the
        symptoms of the spiritual disease that lies within us. To remember it
        easily, it may be called the disease of &quot;I&quot; and
        &quot;mine.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Every one of us has the disease of
        &quot;I' and &quot;mine&quot;, and we absorb more germs every time we
        see a form, smell an odor, touch a tangible object, tastes a flavor, or
        think in the manner of an ignorant person. In other words, there is a
        reception of the germ, those things surrounding us that are infected and
        cause the disease, every time there is sense contact.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We must recognize that the germ is
        clinging (<i>upadana</i>) and that it is of two kinds: clinging to an
        &quot;I&quot; and clinging to &quot;mine&quot;. Clinging to
        &quot;I&quot; and feeling that &quot;I&quot; is an entity, that I am
        like this or like that, that I am the equal of any man. Anything of this
        sort is called &quot;I&quot;. &quot;Mine&quot; is taking that as
        belonging to me, that which I love, that which I like. Even that which
        we hate, we consider to be &quot;my&quot; enemy. This is called
        &quot;mine.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Pali, &quot;I&quot; is atta and mine
        is attaniya: or, if one uses the terms in the general use of Indian
        philosophy, ahamkara meaning to have the feeling of &quot;I&quot;
        (stemming from the word aham, &quot;I&quot;), and mamamakara, meaning to
        have the feeling of &quot;mine&quot; (stemming from the word mam, which
        means &quot;mine.&quot;)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The feelings of ahamkara and mamamkara
        are so very dangerous that they are called the spiritual disease, and
        every branch of philosophy or dhamma in the Buddha's time wanted to wipe
        them out. Even though they were followers of other teachings, they all
        had the same aim of wiping out ahamkara and mamamkara. The difference
        lay in that when they eradicated those feelings, they called what
        remained the True Self, the Pure Atman, the Desired. As for our Buddhist
        Teaching, it refused to use those names because it did not want to give
        rise to any new clinging to a self or things belonging to a self. It was
        just left a perfect emptiness, which was called Nibbana, as in the
        phrase, &quot;<i>Nibbanam paramam sunnam</i>&quot; <i>- &quot;Nibbana is
        supreme emptiness</i>&quot; - that is to say, absolutely empty of
        &quot;I&quot; and empty of &quot;mine&quot; in every respect, without
        remainder. That is Nibbana, the end of spiritual disease.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This matter of &quot;I&quot; and
        &quot;mine&quot; is very hard to see. If you don't really concentrate,
        you won't be able to understand that it is the force behind Dukkha, the
        force behind spiritual disease.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;That which is called
        &quot;atta&quot; or &quot;self&quot; corresponds to the latin word
        &quot;ego&quot;. If the feeling of self-consciousness arises, we call it
        egoism because once the feeling of &quot;I&quot; arises it naturally and
        inevitably gives rise to the feeling &quot;mine&quot;. Therefore, the
        feeling of self and the feeling of things belonging to self, taken
        together is egoism. Ego can be said to be natural to living beings and,
        moreover, to be their center. If the word &quot;ego&quot; is translated
        into English, it must be rendered as soul, a word corresponding to the
        Greek &quot;kentricon&quot; which in English means center. Ego and
        kentricon being the same thing, the soul (atta) can be regarded as the
        center of living beings, as their necessary nucleus, and therefore is
        something that the ordinary person cannot rid themselves of or refrain
        from.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So it follows that all unenlightened
        people must experience this feeling of egoism arising continually.
        Although it's true that it doesn't express itself all the time, it
        manifests whenever one sees a form, hears a sound, smells an odor,
        touches a tactile object or has a thought arise in the mind. On every
        occasion that the feeling of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot; arises,
        we can take it to be the disease fully developed, regardless of whether
        it's dependent upon seeing a form, hearing a sound, smelling an odor, or
        whatever. When at the moment of contact, the feeling &quot;I&quot; and
        &quot;mine&quot; arises, it is the disease fully developed. The feeling
        of selfishness has strongly arisen.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">At this point we no longer call it
        egoism but selfishness, because it is an agitated egoism that leads one
        into low, false ways, into a state of thinking only of oneself without
        consideration for others, so that everything one does is selfish. One is
        completely ruled by greed, hatred and delusion. The disease expresses
        itself as selfishness and then harms both oneself and others. It is the
        greatest danger to the world. That the world is currently so troubled
        and in such turmoil is due to nothing other than the selfishness of each
        person, of each of the factions forming into competing groups. That they
        are fighting each other without desire to fight, but through compulsion,
        is because they can't control this thing; they can't withstand it's
        force, and so the disease takes root. That the world has taken in this
        &quot;germ&quot; which has then caused the disease, is because no one is
        aware of that which can resist the disease, namely, the heart of the
        Buddhist Teachings.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I would like you to understand this
        phrase, &quot;the heart of the Buddhist Teachings&quot;. Whenever we ask
        what the heart of the Buddhist teachings is, there are so many
        contending replies that it's like a sea of mouths - everyone's got an
        answer! But whether they are correct or not is another matter, for
        people just answer according to what they have remembered or what they
        have worked out for themselves. Please, look and see for yourselves how
        it is these days. Who truly knows the heart of the Buddhist teachings?
        Who has truly reached it?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Whenever we ask what the heart of the
        Buddhist Teachings is, someone will probably say the Four Noble Truths
        (Dukkha, its cause, its extinction, and the path leading to its
        extinction) others will say <i>aniccam-dukkham-anatta </i>(impermanence,
        unsatisfactoriness and selflessness), other may recite the verse:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <i>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Sabba papassa akaranam<br>
          Kusalassupasampada<br>
          Sacitta pariyodapanam<br>
          Etam Buddhasasanam&quot;.<br>
          or,<br>
          &quot;Refraining from doing evil,<br>
          doing only good,<br>
          and purifying the mind,<br>
          that is the heart of the Buddhist Teachings.&quot;</font></p>
          </blockquote>
        </i>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">That's correct, but only very slightly
        so because it is still something repeated by rote; it's not something
        that has truly been seen for oneself.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As to what is the heart of Buddhist
        Teachings, I would like to suggest the short saying, &quot;Nothing
        whatsoever should be clung to&quot;. There is a section in the Majjhima
        Nikaya where someone approached the Buddha and asked him whether he
        could summarize his teachings in one phrase and, if he could, what it
        would be. The Buddha replied that he could<i>: &quot;Sabba dhamma nalam
        abhinivesaya&quot;.</i> &quot;Sabbe dhamm&quot; means &quot;all
        things&quot;, &quot;nalam&quot; means &quot;should not be&quot;,
        &quot;abhinivesaya&quot; means &quot;to be clung to&quot;. <i>Nothing
        whatsoever should be clung to</i>. Then the Buddha emphasized this point
        by saying that whoever had heard this core-phrase had heard all the
        Teachings, who ever put it into practice had practiced all the
        Teachings, and whoever had received the fruits of practicing this point
        had received all of the fruits of the Buddhist Teachings.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, if anyone realizes the truth of
        this point that there is not a single thing to be clung to, it means
        that there is no &quot;germ&quot; to cause the disease of greed, hatred
        and delusion, or of wrong actions of any kind, whether of body, speech
        or mind. So, whatever forms, sounds, odors, flavors, tangible objects
        and mental phenomena crowd in, the antibody &quot;Nothing whatsoever
        should be clung to&quot; will resist the disease. The &quot;germ&quot;
        will not enter, or, if it is allowed to do so, it will be only in order
        to be completely destroyed. The &quot;germ&quot; will not spread and
        cause the disease because of the antibody continually destroying it.
        There will be absolute and perpetual immunity. This then is the heart of
        the Buddhist Teachings, of all Dhamma. </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">Nothing
        whatsoever should be clung to - 'Sabbe dhamma nalam abhinivesaya.'</font></p>
        </i>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">A person who realizes this truth is like
        someone who has an antibody that can resist and destroy disease. It is
        impossible for him or her to suffer from the spiritual disease. But, for
        the ordinary person who doesn't know the heart of the Buddhist
        teachings, it's just the opposite, like someone who hasn't the slightest
        immunity.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">You probably understand by now the
        meaning of the &quot;spiritual disease&quot; and who the doctor is that
        heals it. But it's only when we see that we ourselves have the disease
        that we become really serious about healing ourselves, and in the right
        way, too. Before we know, we just enjoy ourselves as we please. It's
        like someone unaware that they have some serious illness, such as cancer
        or TB, just indulging in pleasure-seeking without bothering to seek
        treatment until it's too late, and then dying of their disease.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We won't be that foolish. We will follow
        the Buddha's instruction<i>, &quot;Don't be heedless. Be well-filled
        with heedfulness.&quot;</i> Being heedful people, we should take a look
        at the way in which we are suffering from the spiritual disease and
        examine the &quot;germ&quot; that is its cause. If you do this correctly
        and unremittingly, you will certainly receive in this life the best
        thing a human being can receive.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We must look more closely into the point
        that clinging is the &quot;germ&quot;, as well as the way that it
        spreads and develops into the disease. If you've observed even to a
        small degree, you will have seen that it's this clinging to
        &quot;I&quot; or &quot;mine&quot; that is the chief of all the
        defilements.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We can divide the defilements up into
        lobha, dosa and moha (or raga, kodha and moha) or group them into
        sixteen or as many catagories as we want -in the end they are all greed,
        hatred and delusion. But these three, too, can be collected into one-the
        feeling of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot;. The feeling of
        &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot; is the inner nucleus which gives
        birth to greed, hatred and delusion. When it emerges as greed, as desire
        and craving, it attracts the sense-object that has come into contact. If
        at another moment it repels the object, then it's hate or dosa. On those
        occasions when it's stupefied and doesn't know what it wants, hovering
        around the object, unsure whether to attract or repel, that is moha.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Defilement behaves in one of these ways
        towards sense-objects, i.e. forms, sounds, odors, flavors, tangible
        objects, mental phenomena, depending on what form the objects takes -
        whether it is clearly apprehendable or hidden, and whether it encourages
        attraction, repulsion, or confusion. But, though they differ, all three
        are defilements because they have their roots in the inner feeling of
        &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot;. Therefore, it can be said that the
        feeling of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot; is the chief of all
        defilements and the root cause of all Dukkha, of all disease.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Having not fully appreciated the
        Buddha's teaching regarding Dukkha, we have misunderstood it. We have
        taken it to mean that birth, old age, and so on are themselves Dukkha,
        but in fact those are just its characteristic vehicles. The Buddha
        summarized his teachings as, &quot;Sankhittena
        panucupadanakkhandadukkha&quot; which translates as, &quot;In short,
        Dukkha is the five clung to &quot;khandas&quot; (the five 'groups' or
        'aggregates' of existence: form, feeling, perception, mental formations,
        and consciousness). This means that anything which clings or is clung to
        as &quot;I&quot; or &quot;mine&quot; is Dukkha. Anything which has no
        clinging to &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot; has no Dukkha. Therefore,
        birth, old age, sickness, death or whatever, if they are not clung to as
        &quot;I&quot; or &quot;mine&quot; has no Dukkha. Therefore, birth, old
        age, sickness, death and whatever, if they are not clung to as
        &quot;I&quot; or &quot;mine&quot; cannot be Dukkha. Only when they are
        clung to as &quot;I&quot; or &quot;mine&quot; are they Dukkha. The body
        and mind are the same. Its not that Dukkha is inherent in body and mind.
        It is only when there is clinging to &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot;
        that they are Dukkha. With the pure and undefiled mind, that of the
        arahant (one freed from all greed, aversion and delusion), there is no
        Dukkha at all.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">We must see that this &quot;I&quot; and
        &quot;mine&quot; is the root cause of all forms of Dukkha. Whenever
        there is clinging, then there is the darkness of ignorance. There is no
        clarity because the mind is not empty; it is shaken up, frothing and
        foaming with the feeling of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot;. In
        direct contrast, the mind that is free of clinging to &quot;I&quot; and
        &quot;mine&quot; is serene, filled full of truth-discerning awareness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, we must firmly grasp the fact that
        there are two kinds of feeling: that of &quot;I&quot; and
        &quot;mine&quot;, and that of truth discerning-awareness, and that they
        are totally antagonistic. If one enters the mind, the other springs out.
        Only one can be present at a time. If the mind is brimful of
        &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot;, truth-discerning awareness cannot
        enter: if there is truth-discerning awareness, the &quot;I&quot; and
        &quot;mine&quot; disappears, freedom from &quot;I&quot; and
        &quot;mine&quot; is truth discerning awareness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus if one speaks intelligently -which
        is to say, concisely, although it is somewhat frightening, one says
        along with Huang Po, along with the Zen sect, that Emptiness is the
        Dhamma, Emptiness is the Buddha and Emptiness is the Primal Mind.
        Confusion, the absence of Emptiness, is not the Buddha, is not the
        Dhamma, and not the Primal Mind. There are these two opposing feelings
        that arise. Once we have understood them, we will understand all Dhamma
        easily.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Right now, you who are sitting here
        listening are empty, you are not confecting the feeling &quot;I&quot;
        and &quot;mine&quot;. You are listening, and you have truth-discerning
        awareness; the feeling &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot; cannot enter.
        But if on another occasion something impinges and gives rise to the
        feeling of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot;, the emptiness or
        truth-discerning awareness you feel here will disappear.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we are empty of egoism, there is no
        consciousness of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot;. We have
        truth-discerning awareness that can extinguish Dukkha and is the cure
        for the spiritual disease. At that moment the disease cannot be born,
        and the disease that has already arisen will disappear as if picked up
        and thrown away. At that moment, the mind will be completely filled with
        Dhamma. This accords with the remark that emptiness is the Buddha,
        because in that moment of being empty of &quot;I&quot; and
        &quot;mine&quot;, there will be present every desirable virtue of the
        whole Tripitaka (Buddhist scriptures)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">To put it simply, there will be perfect
        satisampajanna (mindfulness and self-awareness); perfect hiri (sense of
        shame); perfect ottappa (fear of evil); perfect khanti (patience and
        endurance); and perfect soracca (gentleness). There will be perfect
        katannukatavedi (gratitude) and perfect honesty right up to
        yathabhutananadassa (the knowledge and vision according to reality) that
        is the cause for the attainment of Nibbana.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I've come down to the basics, saying
        that there must be satisampajanna, hiri, ottappa, khanti, soracca, and
        katannukata vedi, because these things are also Dhamma, they too can be
        a refuge for the world. Even hiri and otappa alone, the aversion and
        shame towards doing evil and the fear of doing evil, with just these the
        world would be tranquil with lasting peace.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Every one of the many methods for wiping
        out the disease of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot; works. It depends
        on how you wish to practice. One of the many ways is to constantly
        contemplate &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot; as maya, an illusion or
        hallucination. This will enable you to see the feeling of self, a
        seemingly solid entity that we are familiar with as &quot;I&quot; and
        &quot;mine&quot;, is in fact a mere illusion. This is achieved by
        contemplating self in terms of <i>Paticcasamuppada</i> (the process of
        dependent origination)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">To explain the Paticcasamuppada
        theoretically or technically takes a long time. It could take one or two
        months for just this single matter, because in the field of theory it's
        been expounded more and more as a subject of psychology and philosophy,
        until it's reached a state of excessive complexity. But in the field of
        practice, the Paticcasamuppada is, as the Buddha said, just a handful.
        When there is contact with forms, sounds, odors, flavors, or whatever at
        one of the sense doors, that contact is called in Pali phassa. This
        phassa develops into vedana (feeling). Vedana develops into tanha
        (craving). Tanha develops into upadana (clinging). Upadana develops into
        bhava (becoming). Bhava develops into jati, which is &quot;birth&quot;,
        and following on from birth there is the suffering of old age, sickness
        and death, which are Dukkha.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Please see that as soon as there is
        contact with a sense object there is phassa, and that the subsequent
        development of phassa into vedana, tanha and so on is called
        Paticcasamuppada i.e. the process by which various things, existing in
        dependence on one thing, condition the arising of another thing, which
        in turn conditions the development of a further thing, and so on. This
        process or state is called Paticcasamuppada. It is dependent arising
        with no self or &quot;me&quot; found, merely dependence followed by
        arising.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">(<i>phassa</i>, contact, sense
        experience: the meeting and working together of inner sense media +
        outer sense media + sense-consciousness. e.g. eye + form + eye
        consciousness. There are six kinds of phassa corresponding to the six
        senses.)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">(vedana, feeling, sensation: the mental
        reaction to or coloring of sense experiences (phassa). There are three
        kinds of vedana: pleasant, nice, agreeable feeling; unpleasant,
        disagreeable, painful feeling; and neither painful or pleasant,
        indeterminate feeling. Vedana is not 'emotion&quot; If vedana arises
        through ignorance or lack or truth-discerning awareness in the moment it
        will condition craving as it then next arises.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The way of making use of it is not to
        allow the dependent arising to take place; cutting it off right at the
        moment of sense-contact, not allowing the development of vedana, not
        allowing feelings of satisfaction or dissatisfaction to arise. When
        there is no production of vedana, then there is no birth of the craving
        and clinging that is the &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot;. The
        &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot; lie right there at the birth of the
        craving and clinging; illusion lies right there. If at the moment of
        sense-contact when there is nothing but phassa, it is stopped just
        there, there is no way for &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot; to arise
        in truth-discerning awareness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another method: For the average person,
        it is extremely difficult to prevent phassa from developing into vedana.
        As soon as there is sense-contact, the feelings of satisfaction or
        dissatisfaction always follow immediately. It doesn't stop at phassa
        because there as never been any training in Dhamma. But, when vedana has
        already developed, when there are already feelings of satisfaction and
        dissatisfaction, stop it right there. Let feeling remain as merely
        feeling and let it pass away. Don't allow the reaction to go on and
        become tanha, wanting this and that in response to the satisfaction or
        dissatisfaction. Because, if there is satisfaction, then there will be
        desire, craving, indulgence, possessiveness, envy etc. in consequence.
        Once there is dissatisfaction, then there is the desire to beat to
        death, to devastate, and kill. If there are these sorts of desires on
        the mind, it means that vedana has already developed into tanha. If so,
        then you must suffer the spiritual disease of Dukkha and nobody can
        help. All the gods together cannot help. The Buddha said that even he
        could not help. He has no power over the laws of nature, he is merely
        one who reveals them so that others can practice in accordance with
        them. If one practices wrongly one must have Dukkha. If one practices
        correctly, one has no Dukkha. Thus it is said that if vedana has
        developed into tanha then nobody can help. As soon as any form of
        craving has arisen then nobody can help and there will inevitably be
        Dukkha.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In that turbulent wanting that arises in
        the mind, see how to distinguish the feeling of the desirer
        &quot;I&quot;, of the self that wants this or wants that, wants to do it
        like this or like that, or who has acted in this way or that way, or has
        received the results of those actions. That one who desires is
        &quot;I&quot;; wanting things, it grasps them as &quot;mine&quot; in one
        way or another -as &quot;my&quot; status, my property, &quot;my&quot;
        victory, &quot;my&quot; ideas and opinions - and in all of those
        feelings the &quot;I&quot; is present.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The feeling of &quot;I&quot; and
        &quot;mine&quot; is called upadana, and arises from tanha. tanha
        develops into upadana. If the Paticcasamuppada has progressed as far as
        tanha and upadana, the germ that enters through the ear, eye, nose,
        tongue or body has matured to the extent that it can express itself as
        the symptoms of the disease, because upadana is followed by bhava. Bhava
        means &quot;having and being&quot;. The having and being of what? The
        having and being of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot;. Kammabhava is
        the action that conditions the arising of &quot;I&quot; and
        &quot;mine&quot;. If it is simply &quot;bhava&quot;, it means the
        condition of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot; full-blown, the disease
        full-blown.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In our practice we must stop it right at
        the point of preventing phassa from developing into vedana, or if we
        fail there, by preventing vedana from developing into tanha. After that,
        it's hopeless. We try to have Dhamma right there at the meeting of eye
        and forms, ear and sounds, of tongue and flavors, etc. by continually
        training in the point that nothing whatsoever should be clung to. With
        ordinary people, once phassa takes place, then vedana arise followed by
        tanha, upadana, bhava and jati. This is a path that is so well worn that
        it is extremely easy to follow. But we don't take that path. As soon as
        there is sense-contact, we turn around and take the form of
        truth-discerning awareness. We don't take the path of &quot;I&quot; and
        &quot;mine&quot; or, even if we do follow it as far as vedana, we will
        turn back there to the path of truth-discerning awareness. We don't just
        float along with the stream of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot;. In
        this way, there is never any dukkha. If we can do it well, and follow
        the correct method, perfectly, we can realize Arahantship.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we wish to go by the Buddha's words,
        there is an easy principle that the Buddha taught to a disciple called
        Bahiya.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;O Bahiya, whenever you see a form,
        let there be just the seeing; whenever you hear a sound, let there be
        just the hearing; when you smell an odor, let there be just the
        smelling, when you taste a flavor, let there be just the tasting; when
        you experience a physical sensation, let it merely be sensation; and
        when a thought arises, let it be just a natural phenomenon (feeling)
        arising in the mind. When it's like this there will be no self, no
        &quot;I&quot;. When there is no self, there will be no moving about here
        and there, and no stopping anywhere. And that is the end of Dukkha. That
        is Nibbana.&quot; Whenever it's like that, then it is Nibbana. If it is
        lasting, then it is lasting Nibbana; if it is temporary, then it's
        temporary Nibbana. In other words, it is just one principle./.</font></p>
