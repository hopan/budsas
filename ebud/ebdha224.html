      <td width="100%"><b></b><b><em><font face="Times New Roman">- Joseph,
        after practicing in India for ten years and teaching in this country for
        more than twenty, you have recently returned from a well-earned teaching
        sabbatical, in which I understand you did quite a bit of personal
        meditation practice. Has anything emerged from this experience, in terms
        of greater clarity?</font></em></b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">- I think one of the pieces that has
        emerged from the time off is a greater clarity about where I’d like to
        put my energy in the following years. With so many newer teachers coming
        along who are well qualified to teach the shorter (nine- and ten-day)
        retreats, I’m feeling that I would like to devote more of my time to
        teaching yogis [meditators] who are more committed to longer term
        situations.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I feel that there is a need, given the
        development of the dharma in the West in the last quarter century or so,
        for some group of people to immerse themselves in long-term practice.
        There are some who have the time, the commitment, and the experience to
        do this, and I would like to help support this deepening of practice.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">And why is that? What happens on a
        long retreat that doesn’t happen on a shorter retreat?</font></em></p>
        </b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Well, lots of things. It works on so
        many levels, and there are many models for talking about it. In an
        obvious way, it’s more of a chance for the mind to quiet down, and to
        actually develop a deepening power of concentration and attentiveness—and
        that really makes possible the opening to different levels of insight
        and understanding.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The deepening of concentration and the
        quieting down of the mind provides the stability of attention, of
        attentiveness, which is necessary for deeper seeing of the nature of the
        mind and the body. When the mind is quite scattered or distracted, and
        we’re struggling to keep bringing it back, it’s very difficult to
        develop penetrating insight.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">For most of us, the development of
        concentration, of an undistracted quality of mind, takes time. There are
        some few people who seem to have a natural ability, and can settle right
        into it; but from my own experience in practice, and working with so
        many others, I know it doesn’t often come naturally. So a longer
        retreat provides the space for people to cultivate this important skill.
        A focused mind then allows us to see more clearly, both the more obvious
        and the very many subtle places of attachment.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha was very straightforward in
        his teaching: liberation happens through not clinging to anything. That’s
        a very radical and uncompromising statement. But to me it’s also very
        inspiring. OK, this is the work to do, and the first step is using the
        power of increased concentration to actually begin seeing all the places
        of attachment, identification and fixation of mind that are there.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">So much of what we hear from dharma
        teachers these days has to do with the integration of mindfulness with
        the details of a layperson’s complex daily life. This interest of
        yours for longer term semi-renunciate practice seems to go somewhat
        against that grain.</font></em></p>
        </b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Clearly, it’s really important for
        people to bring what they’ve learned in practice to their lives in the
        world; otherwise, both their spiritual lives and their worldly lives are
        very fragmented. On one level, the point of practice is to be able to
        live with greater freedom, greater integrity, and greater compassion in
        the world. And I think that the deeper people go in their practice and
        understanding, the more complete that integration becomes.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is easy to say that daily life is our
        practice, and as an ideal, it’s admirable. But whether in fact we’re
        actually doing it in a way that’s meaningful, in terms of deepening
        spiritual understanding -- I think that’s something we all have to
        look at for ourselves. It’s perhaps the most difficult of the paths to
        follow with real integrity.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of my teachers was once asked, Is it
        really necessary to renounce the world in order to get liberated? He
        said, &quot;Well, even the Buddha had to renounce the world!&quot; And
        he had a few <i>paramis</i> [previously developed spiritual qualities]!
        So to minimize the difficulty of it, I think, is to miss the level of
        commitment it actually takes. When there is an opportunity for long-term
        practice, it allows our practice to go deeper—so that there is
        actually something to integrate.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">It sounds paradoxical: We need to
        retreat from worldly lifestyles to see more deeply into our experience,
        and the more we are able to do that, the more depth we can then bring
        back into our worldly lives.</font></em></p>
        </b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">That’s right. And the cycle of retreat
        and going back in the world, of going inside and then bringing it out—we
        all have different rhythms for that at different times in our lives. So
        much depends upon our interest, our motivation, our circumstances, lots
        of factors. But I think there will always be some people for whom the
        conditions would be right for long, uninterrupted practice. And right
        now, that opportunity is not easily available in the West.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the traditional models of the Asian
        monastic tradition, people would leave the world, devote themselves to
        practice, and lead the holy life. Here in this country, at this point
        anyway, it’s not necessarily going to take the outward form of
        monasticism, with many people ordaining as monks or nuns. But still I
        think there is a great interest in having the chance for long term
        practice.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I know for myself, whenever I’ve done
        what in this country would be considered a long retreat (two or three
        months), it always feels like I’m just getting started -- and then it’s
        over. I’ve always felt sorry that the retreat was coming to an end. So
        both for myself and others, it would be a great opportunity for yogis to
        have a place that supports longer practice. That’s really my vision
        for what could happen at the Forest Refuge.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>The Forest Refuge, your new
        project for creating a long-term practice center in the forest between
        IMS and BCBS, sounds like an exciting development for the dharma in the
        West. </b>[IMS: Insight Meditation Society; BCBS: Barre Center for
        Buddhist Studies]</font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It’s tremendously exciting to me. It’s
        something I have a great love for, both as something I would like to do
        myself, and imagining the possibility of other western yogis in that
        setting. Somehow, it resonates in me: The vision of people in all the
        Buddhist cultures over the last twenty-five hundred years, just doing
        this -- going off, for longer periods of time, and devoting themselves
        to the practice of awakening.</font></p>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Do you think there are enough
        people in America today who are willing and able to do that?</b></font></em></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, I do. I don’t have any doubt
        about it at all. In fact, although we are beginning with the idea of
        perhaps twenty-five or thirty people in long-term practice of varying
        lengths, I don’t have any problem imagining a hundred people -- even
        hundreds of people! I think the dharma is well-enough established in the
        West now. As I go around teaching in so many places, I continually hear
        from people that this is just the sort of thing they are looking for: a
        quiet, supportive environment for settling into their practice. There
        are enough people who have undergone significant basic training in
        practice, and who are really inspired by the possibility of genuine
        awakening.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">So much of what we’ve learned
        about awakening or liberation has been represented in traditional terms.
        Now that you have spent so much of your life practicing the dharma in
        English, so to speak, and in American culture, I wonder: Do you have a
        sense yourself, in contemporary terms, of what that awakening means? How
        might it manifest in a contemporary western personality?</font></em></p>
        </b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">That’s a complex question which can be
        approached on a couple of different levels. Whether or not we can tell
        whether somebody’s enlightened or awakened is always problematic, for
        a variety of reasons.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One is that we often confuse expressions
        of personality with an assessment of spiritual realization. I don’t
        think that all personality quirks are somehow leveled out in the process
        of awakening. But we’re so used to reacting and responding to the more
        superficial levels of personality that we can miss the deeper
        understandings that might be there. So that’s on one side.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the other side, when someone is in a
        certain role, it’s very easy to project onto them some great awakened
        experience which may or may not be true. We may miss it when it’s
        there, and we may attribute it when it’s not.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">And the middle way?</font></em></p>
        </b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Well, the middle way, I think, is one of
        the key reference points for me -- both in my own practice, just
        watching my own mind, and then being with others: It is just to see the
        degree of self-reference that is present. To see if the self is really
        at the center of our life and our actions and our motivations, or to see
        that there is less of that. My understanding is that the deep
        realization of emptiness, in the Buddhist sense, really means emptiness
        of self. So one becomes less and less self-referential.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is a long process, and I think we
        are all somewhere along a continuum, from totally self-absorbed to
        completely selfless. My hope is that as we all continue in our practice,
        whether in daily life or on long retreats, we are moving in the
        direction of becoming more selfless, and express that understanding by
        greater compassionate responsiveness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is not that we eliminate the
        personality; rather it is being not so attached or identified with it.
        And in that non-identification is the space to be responsive, and to
        help lighten the suffering that’s in the world. I don’t see that
        there’s any one way to be responsive. We each will have our own
        expression of that.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">As one reaches a certain
        understanding, is it natural that a person will, as they become less
        self-referential, be more inclined to public service?</font></em></p>
        </b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I question whether there is any one
        model or any one way to manifest (though I hesitate to use this phrase)
        enlightened behavior. I can imagine someone staying as a recluse their
        whole life, yet managing from that place of great compassion and
        openness to influence things on other levels. I don’t think we should
        become too dogmatic in our views of how wisdom expresses itself. For one
        thing, if the core piece is there -- real wisdom -- and if we view
        things from the perspective of rebirth and many lives, then there is
        lots of time to manifest wisdom in a wide variety of ways. The Jataka
        tales [stories of the Buddha’s many previous births] provide good
        examples of this.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another model for thinking about what
        happens in practice has to do with weakening, and hopefully finally
        eradicating greed, hatred, and ignorance as motive forces in the mind.
        Still another image that comes to mind to express the deepening of
        practice is the ripening or the balancing of the five spiritual
        faculties: faith, wisdom, concentration, energy and mindfulness.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">What models of awakening do you find
        most compelling?</font></em></p>
        </b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Something that has been of increasing
        interest to me lately is the relationship of compassion and emptiness --
        or perhaps you could say wisdom and compassion -- as the two core
        principles of the awakened mind. What I have been inspired by, and what
        has transformed my own practice, is a growing understanding that
        compassion and emptiness are not two different things. Compassion is not
        a stance, but is the simple responsiveness to circumstances from a place
        of selflessness. So it is not that some<i><b>one</b></i> becomes more
        compassionate. Rather, the emptier we are of self, the more responsive
        we are.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">So it is a matter of getting out of
        the way so compassion can manifest itself?</font></em></p>
        </b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, exactly. Compassion is the
        manifestation of emptiness. And that feels very liberating and inspiring
        to me, because when I think of a self responding to all the suffering in
        the world, it feels too overwhelming. There’s too much suffering --
        how could a self hold it? It feels like the burden is just too immense.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">But when I think of compassionate action
        being the expression of emptiness, then it’s not resting on the
        shoulders of any<i><b>one. </b></i>It feels big enough to hold it all.
        And that’s how I now understand the whole bodhisattva notion, the
        bodhisattva vow, in a way that makes sense to me. It’s not a self, it’s
        not someone doing it. It’s just a natural manifestation …</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">Students new to the Buddhist
        tradition always seem to eventually ask the question, If all is
        emptiness, why is there compassion? How is it that this ethical quality
        is somehow built into the fabric of the universe?</font></em></p>
        </b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">For a few reasons, I think; and maybe
        this also can be seen on a couple of different levels.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One might come out of an investigation
        of what the root of greed or fear or hatred in the mind really is. Even
        looking at the matter conceptually, but then more experientially from a
        meditative awareness, these afflicted states seem to me very clearly
        rooted in a sense of self. Someone is greedy for something, or someone
        is angry, or fearful, or whatever -- in each case it is the notion of
        the self that actually feeds those unwholesome states. And so, in the
        absence of that sense of self, in emptiness, from where would greed
        arise? From where would hatred or anger arise?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">This perspective is expressed in the
        traditional teachings when they speak of the effects of seeing through
        the illusion of self. Even though the other defilements, out of habit,
        may still arise, the root has been cut. And from that point forward
        those defilements will wither away, because they are no longer nourished
        by the sense of self. This is one way of looking at it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">From another perspective, we can see
        compassion arising out of an experience of non-separation. As long as
        there remains a sense of self, the very notion of self predicates other.
        With the self, there’s other than self. And other than self is
        everyone else and everything else! And so the very notion of self
        carries within it, implicitly, the notion of separation. From the
        perspective of absence of self, there’s no one there to be separate.
        So then it’s just the interplay, the dance of elements, experience,
        phenomena; there’s just the dance of all this -- interconnected,
        interrelated -- with a real sense of non-separation. And non-separation,
        I think, is another word for love. Again, it is not a matter of someone
        loving someone else, but goes beyond this to a simple manifestation of
        love.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">And have you felt this yourself?</font></em></p>
        </b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Oh yes, at times. At times. I am
        definitely a long way from the continuous experience of this simple
        clarity, but I have tasted it enough to know it’s a possibility.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I think we want to be careful about not
        romanticizing or -- I don’t quite know what the right word is --
        perhaps glorifying this stage, because in a way I see one aspect of it
        as being quite commonplace. I think we all experience it a lot more than
        we actually acknowledge. Going though our lives, we are very often quite
        naturally responsive to situations of suffering. In simple ways, with no
        great dramatic statement, we may just feel a natural, caring connection—without
        a sense of acting from self, or ego, but just as a natural response to
        the situation. So that’s one piece. I don’t want to see it only in
        terms of some extraordinary state that we may have glimpses of, because
        I think that puts it in the wrong frame.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the other side, even though we may be
        in that place of natural responsiveness more and more often, we don’t
        want to become complacent and miss the very many moments when the mind
        does get fixated in a sense of self. It can be very subtle -- even when
        our basic response is wholesome, there can often be all sorts of
        unskillful motives mixed in.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">So while I don’t want to make it
        something extraordinary, I also think it takes an incredible quality of
        attentiveness not to delude ourselves, and to really be watching, in the
        course of the day, when we are acting from that place of ego. It happens
        a lot more than we think it does.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">During long-term practice, we do develop
        a very refined sensibility of what’s happening in our own lives. We
        can more easily catch those moments when the mind is self-referential,
        when it gets caught, fixated or attached. There is definitely the
        possibility of long retreats preparing the ground for genuine and deep
        transformative experiences, what I call moments of enlightenment or
        moments of awakening.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It’s also important to recognize that
        these experiences are themselves something to which the self can attach,
        and we must take care that the self doesn’t co-opt them -- as I’ve
        seen happen. All of a sudden, our life can start revolving around an
        experience of selflessness [laughter]. So I become the person who’s
        had this experience of selflessness! It can be very subtle. And, it
        happens. Hopefully, if the experience is genuine, that eventually will
        be seen through and we let go of that as well.</font></p>

        </b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">With pleasure! On a physical plane, I’m
        excited by the possibility of designing this center, from the ground up,
        specifically for the purpose of long-term practice. We want to create

        well.&quot;</font></p>

        So the whole environment, both the physical structure and the natural
        environment, will be designed to support the practice in beautiful ways.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">And we are also hoping to create a style
        of practice that supports people finding their own individual rhythm.
        Not everyone will follow a particular pre-set schedule, but each will
        sit and walk throughout the day as suits them best. But with the timely
        use of the meditation hall and the dining room, practitioners will also
        find the support of other people doing the same thing. I see the
        possibility of a wonderful combination of solitude and support of sangha
        at the same time. It is the way I would love to practice. It is the way
        I do love to practice!</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">So we will see you out there! And
        what about the teaching component? How will the Dharma be brought to
        this environment and to this community?</font></em></p>
        </b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Well, I certainly am planning to devote
        a fair amount of my time to it. I see it as a place for experienced
        practitioners who are quite independent in their practice and don’t
        need the level of support usually provided for shorter retreats. But, I
        can imagine perhaps weekly check-ins, occasional talks, and also a small
        dharma library. With the Barre Center for Buddhist Studies just next
        door, some people might do some simple reading or study of the classical
        tradition to help support and direct their practice.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Do you see the Forest Refuge as
        continuing IMS’s tendency to be thoroughly grounded in the Theravada
        tradition, or would this be an opportunity to bring in a more diverse
        Buddhist presence?</em> </font></b><font face="Times New Roman"><em>[IMS:
        Insight Meditation Society]</em></font><b></p>
        </b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I think all the traditions of Buddhism
        are rooted in the basic teachings of the Four Noble Truths, the Noble
        Eightfold Path and the Four Foundations of Mindfulness -- these are the
        core teachings of Buddhism, and I see these basic principles being the
        foundation of the center. The principle of liberation—the cultivation
        of a mind of no clinging -- is also universal to Buddhism, and will be a
        primary focus.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">But these principles have been
        elaborated in many different ways over the centuries in different
        traditions, and some of these other modes of expression can be very
        helpful. The particular ways that we might work with these are not
        immediately clear to me. I think we’re going to draw primarily on the
        IMS teachers and the cadre of senior vipassana teachers to be guiding
        people. But I could also imagine having some guest teachers from other
        traditions for periods of time if it felt appropriate. All such details
        are still very much in the visioning stage. But the basic foundation of
        where it’s rooted seems quite clear to me.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I am <i>very</i> inspired by the whole
        project. And I’m hopeful that many of my colleagues will also join in.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">So this new practice center is an
        important part of your legacy, is it not? You will have a leading role
        in setting it up, and you will have a continuing role -- for some
        decades we hope -- in guiding it along. But then you’re also
        presumably looking towards passing it all on…</font></em></p>
        </b>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">And coming back to sit in it. I’m
        really just preparing for my next life here. If I help to get things in
        place now, I’ll have a place to sit when I come back next time…</font></p>
