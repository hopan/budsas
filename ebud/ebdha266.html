      <TD WIDTH="100%"><FONT SIZE="6">T</FONT>he four noble truths are not 
      something far away from this mundane life, but the things that we can see, 
      observe and experiment in our daily activities. Those activities are 
      manifested through the interrelationship between the internal senses and 
      the external objects. When the six senses come into contact with the six 
      external objects, there arise the six kinds of consciousness. The meeting 
      of these three factors, i.e., senses, objects, and consciousness, is 
      contact (phassa), and because of this contact arises feeling [S. II.273.].
      <P>In the suttas, the Buddha differentiated feelings as mental (cetasika) 
      and bodily (k<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#257;yika); he also spok</FONT>e of 
      three kinds of feelings as pleasant (sukha), unpleasant (dukkha), and 
      neutral (adukkhamasukha). Sometimes he spoke of five kinds of feelings: 
      pleasure (sukha), pain (dukkha), joy (somanassa), displeasure (domanassa) 
      and equanimity (upekkh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#257;) [S.IV. 231.]. </P>
      </FONT>
      <P>Even as there are pleasant and neutral feelings, the Buddha added, 
      &quot;Whatever is felt is concluded in suffering&quot; (yam kiñci vedayitam tam 
      dukkhasmin) [S.IV.216]. The question arising here is how dukkha 
      (suffering) is caused from feelings.</P>
      <P>Firstly, how does an unpleasant feeling lead to dukkha? It should be 
      noted here that even the Buddha and the noble persons (ariyapuggal<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#257;) 
      experience unpleasant feeling, or more exactly, physical painful feelings. 
      As long as they have a physical body they still have to suffer from 
      different kinds of sickness and experience painful feelings, but to them 
      the unpleasant feeling does not lead to dukkha. This is the difference 
      between an uninstructed worldling (assutav&#257; puthujjano) and an instructed 
      noble disciple (sutav&#257; ariyas&#257;vako) when feeling an unpleasant feeling. An 
      ordinary person, when experiencing an unpleasant feeling, under the impact 
      of the latent tendency of aversion (patigh&#257;nusaya), he makes an effort to 
      get rid of it as soon as possible. </FONT>&quot;Being contacted by a painful 
      feeling, he sorrows, grieves, and laments; he weeps beating his breasts 
      and becomes distraught&quot; [S.IV.207]. Thus over the physical painful feeling 
      (dukkhavedan<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#257;) he puts another layer of 
      mental feeling (domanassavedan&#257;), and consequently he feels tw</FONT>o 
      feelings – a bodily one and a mental one. In this case he is experiencing 
      dukkha-dukkha (suffering as suffering). </P>
      <P>In the Sammohavinodan<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#299;, the commentator 
      explained that bodily and mental painful feelings are called dukkha-dukkha 
      because of their individual essence, because of their names and because of 
      painfulness (tattha k&#257;yikacetasik&#257; dukkhavedan&#257; sabh&#257;vato ca n&#257;mato ca 
      dukkhatt&#257; </FONT>'dukkhadukkham'n<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#257;ma) 
      [Vibh.A.93.]. But in a simple way we may say that it is called 
      dukkha-dukkha because there are two laye</FONT>rs of dukkha here, one is 
      physical and the other is mental. Between these two layers, physical 
      painful feelings are due to bile disorder, phlegm disorder, wind disorder, 
      the imbalance of the bodily humors, change of climate, careless 
      behaviours, attacks from without or due to kamma done in the past 
      [S.IV.231], while the mental painful feeling is caused by aversion. This 
      aversion is also sort of craving (tanh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#257;), 
      that is, vibhava-tanh&#257;. Here, it means the craving for the non-existence 
      of painful feeling. When</FONT> an ordinary person has a painful feeling, 
      he doesn't want to have it, but he wants to have a pleasant feeling 
      instead. The reason for this is, according to the Buddha, that &quot;he does 
      not know of any escape from painful feeling other than sensual pleasure&quot; 
      [S.IV.208]. So what is the escape from this kind of dukkha? In the Vedan<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#257;samyutta, 
      the Buddha showed the bhikkhus a way out. If there arises in him a painful 
      feeling, he should understand that </FONT>&quot;there has arisen in me a 
      painful feeling&quot;. He should understand that this painful feeling is 
      dependent on contact, and therefore it is impermanent, conditioned, 
      dependently arisen. He knows that it arises and passes away; it is not 
      permanent. By contemplating impermanence and cessation of feeling, he 
      abandons the latent tendency to aversion in regard to painful feeling 
      [S.IV.213]. So, if he feels a painful feeling, he feels it detached, and 
      he feels only one feeling – a bodily one, not a mental one.</P>
      <P>Secondly, how does a pleasant feeling lead to dukkha? When an ordinary 
      person experiences a pleasant feeling, he does not stop at the level of 
      just observing it. He tends to attach to it, due to his latent tendency of 
      lust (k<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#257;mar&#257;g&#257;nusaya). He does not know that 
      this pleasant feeling is transitory, and it is bound to pass away. He 
      takes pleasure in it and wants to prolong it. This is caused by 
      bhava-tanh&#257;, craving for the existence of the pleasant feeling. But things 
      always change; no pleasant feeling can last endlessly, which leads to 
      disappointment and suffering. This kind of suffering is called 
      viparin&#257;madukkha, </FONT>&quot;suffering in change&quot;. The Sammohavinodan<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#299; 
      said, </FONT>&quot;bodily and mental pleasant feelings are called &quot;suffering in 
      change&quot; because of being the cause of the arising of pain through their 
      change (sukhavedan<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#257; viparin&#257;mena 
      dukkhuppattihetuto </FONT>'viparin<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#257;madukkham</FONT>' 
      n<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#257;ma.) [Vibh.A. 93.] The escape from this 
      kind of dukkha is </FONT>&quot;understanding as it really is the origin and 
      passing away, the gratification, the danger and the escape in the case of 
      these feelings.&quot; [S.IV.209] Seeing its nature of arising and passing away, 
      and all other aspects, when one feels a pleasant feeling, he feels it 
      detached, and therefore, he is detached from suffering, too.</P>
      <P>Finally, how does a neutral feeling lead to dukkha? When an ordinary 
      person experiences a neutral feeling, as this feeling is too light, too 
      subtle, he feels it so boring, and he wants to do something to get a 
      stronger feeling. This desire of getting a stronger sensual pleasure is 
      also sort of craving; in this case, it is k<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#257;matanh&#257;, 
      craving for sensual pleasures. This kind of craving is influenced by the 
      latent tendency of ignorance (avijj&#257;nusaya), not understanding the origin 
      and the passing away, the gratification, the danger and the escape in the 
      case of these feelings. [Ibid.] In his effort of looking for some strong 
      feelings, he creates sankh&#257;radukkha, </FONT>&quot;suffering in formations&quot;. The 
      Sammohavinodan<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#299; explains that indifferent 
      feeling and the remaining formations of the three planes are called </FONT>
      &quot;suffering in formations&quot; because of being oppressed by arising and 
      passing away (upekkh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#257;vedan&#257; ceva avases&#257; ca 
      tebh&#363;</FONT>mak<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#257; sankh&#257;r&#257; udayabbayap&#299;</FONT>litatt<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#257;
      </FONT>'sankh<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#257;radukkham</FONT>' n<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#257;ma.) 
      [Vibh.A.93] </P>
      </FONT>
      <P>Thus mental suffering is caused by craving towards feelings. Therefore, 
      the way to escape from mental suffering is to see feelings as they really 
      are, without grasping or rejecting them. This may be done by contemplation 
      on feeling (vedan<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#257;nupassnan&#257;) as described 
      very clearly in the Mah&#257;satipatth&#257;nasutta of the D&#299;gha Nik&#257;ya [D.II.290], 
      which is a very important sutta for practice. In this sutta, the Buddha 
      showed us the only way for the purification of beings, for overcoming 
      sorrow, for extinguishing suffering, for walking on the path of truth and 
      for realizing Nibb&#257;na. </P>
      </FONT>
      <P>May all beings be well, happy and peaceful.</P>
