    <p><a name="intro"></a><font face="Times New Roman">INTRODUCTION</font></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Malukyaputta Sutta supplies us with the fundamental
    knowledge about the principles and practice of Vipassana, insight-meditation. It has been
    incorporated in the Pali Canon as Samyutta Nikaya, and the twenty-four stanzas given in it
    can also be found in Visati Nipata of Thera Gatha. It was preached by Buddha at the
    request of bhikkhu Malukyaputta, the son of a female devotee by the name of Malukya, or
    Malunkya, if we go according to the Ceylonese texts. His request is in the following
    words.</font></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Sadhu me bhante bhagava samkhittena
    dhamman detesu. Yamaham bhagavato dhammam sutva e ko vnpakattho appamatto atapi pahitatto
    vihareyam.&quot;</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Reverend Sir! I stand to be benefited by
    your preaching of the Dhamma in brief. Having heard its essence I will abide in it in
    solitude, practising it with vigilance, right exertion and singleness of purpose.&quot;</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In effect Malukyaputta was asking the Blessed One to
    prescribe for him succinctly any of the subjects of meditation, //kammatthana//, as he was
    bent on practising it in the right way in a quiet place. Solitude is very essential for
    meditation, for it rewards one with //samadhi//, power of concentration, which may be
    disturbed if one lives in the company with others. But when one can hardly hope to get it,
    one should mind one's own business while others theirs. Under such circumstances it will
    do well for one if one does not speak to them or even look at what others are doing,
    fixing the mind on the dhamma.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">APPAMATTO</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Text the word //appamatto// occurs. It means
    &quot;vigilant&quot;. This is also very important. Yogis who meditate in this Yeiktha may
    be ordinarily held to be vigilant, never forgetting for a moment that they are striving
    after the realization of the dhamma. When they see an object they note it with vigilance.
    When they hear, when they smell, when they taste, when they touch or when they think, they
    are always mindful of hearing, smelling, tasting, touching or thinking. Their slightest
    behaviour or movement never goes unnoticed or unobserved. They keep their minds alert,
    never allowing forgetfulness to get the better of them.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">ATAPI</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Text also mentions //atapi// the root meaning of which
    is to heat up. When one is fired with enthusiasm, //atapi// may be said to be at work
    feverishly. Heat causes the evaporation of water or moisture. Enthusiasm causes the
    evaporation of all //kilesas//, a collective term for all kinds of defilements. No flies
    can hover around a piece of hot iron. Defilements may be compared to flies and enthusiasm
    to red-hot iron. Where enthusiasm is wanting, defilements gain entry into the inner self
    via the six sense-doors and torment ordinary folks who fail to note the phenomena of
    arising and passing away of all conditioned things. Defilements have no place for a
    meditating yogi. In the scriptures wetness is attributed to //kilesa//. When meditational
    exertions take place with the utmost zeal and enthusiasm, it disappears leaving one's mind
    absolutely dry and clean.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">FOUR RIGHT EXERTIONS</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are four categories of right exertion called
    //sammappadhana//.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(1) Firstly, there is exertion to prevent unwholesome
    actions that have not arisen from arising. Its application is for the purpose of
    preventive action comparable to that taken by medical and health personnel in their
    campaigns against contagious diseases. As you are wont to encounter evil in your everyday
    life, you must be wary of contact with it and take especial care to prevent yourself from
    being contaminated by it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(2) Secondly, there is exertion to prevent unwholesome
    actions that have already arisen from arising again. This is to deter evil from recurring.
    Besides, we must exert ourselves to have nothing to do with //anusayas// or inclinations
    towards //kilesa//, for, even though you can avoid evil for the moment, if you still have
    predispositions to it, you may be overpowered by it in the long run. The act of seeing or
    hearing prompts the arising of inclinations for sense-objects and such inclinations are
    known as //arammananusayas//, which are the root causes of //kilesa//. With the meditating
    yogi they are incompatible. When he treads the Path all prototypes of //kilesa// called
    //santananusaya// that infest the inner self cease altogether.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(3) Thirdly there is exertion for the accomplishment of
    wholesome actions which have not yet been taken up. If you have not done good as yet do it
    now. //Kusala dhammas//, good deeds, must be acquired through the practice of
    charitableness, morality and mental culture. I urge you especially to practise
    insight-meditation if you have not as yet done it. If you are doing it with a mind to
    vipassana nana, insight-knowledge, continue doing it till the Path is attained.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(4) Lastly there is exertion for the development of
    accumulated wholesome actions till the Path is trodden. Usually a yogi is accomplished in
    all these four kinds of exertions to safeguard himself from committing evil, avoiding the
    recurrence of it, acquiring merit where he has not yet acquired it and developing it when
    it has been acquired.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">PAHITATTO</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Old writers usually render the word, //pahitatto//, as
    &quot;with a mind despatched to Nibbana.&quot; Taking it in its literal sense, some would
    like to put forward the proposition that there is no need for a yogi to practise the
    dhamma once he has despatched his mind to the concept of Nibbana. This is contrary to the
    tenets of Buddhist teaching expounded in the Texts. What the word connotes is exertion in
    the practice regardless of life and limb in the effort, fixing the mind on the Path, the
    Fruition and Nibbana. This agrees with the commentaries on Silakkhandha Sutta regarding
    the subject of mental culture.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">BUDDHA'S ADMONITION</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddha acceded to Malukyaputta's request saying:</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;How now, Malukyaputta! What shall I say to
    other bhikkhus when you are thus making this request? You are old; you have gone far
    advanced in age; you have reached the last half of the span of human life. Even so you ask
    for a gist of the dhamma as my admonition!&quot;</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddha's words can both mean reproach and approbation. The
    old monk had not striven for the dhamma while young. Only when he was one foot in the
    grave he spoke of abiding in it. If Buddha's admonition were to be taken in that light,
    Malukyaputta may be held to have been censored.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But here is Malukyaputta to lead the life of a recluse in
    search of truth in spite of his senility. What would young Bhikkhus say to it? They would
    certainly emulate him. In this context it may be interpreted that Buddha was full of
    praise for him. Today if a young man encounters old men and women striving strenuously for
    the realization of the dhamma he should follow in their footsteps.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As Malukyaputta repeatedly made the request, the Blessed
    One preached him the fundamentals of the practice of insight meditation by posing a series
    of questions which, when answered, could reveal the method relating to vipassana.</font></p>

    <p><font COLOR="#7f007f"><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a name="vip1"></a><font face="Times New Roman">VIPASSANA QUESTION I</font></b></font></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Tam kim mannasi Malukyaputta. Ye te
    cakkhuvinneyya rupa adittha aditthapubba, na ca passati. Na ca te hoti passeyyant; atthi
    te tattha chando va rago va pemam va.&quot;</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;How do you answer this, Malukyaputta? Answer
    me as best you can. There are certain visible objects which you have never previously seen
    either in the immediate or remote past, or even at the present moment or in the future.
    Can such objects arouse desire, lust and affection in you?&quot;</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The //rupa//, form, which one can see with one's naked
    eyes are a reality or //paramattha//. But there may also be others which present a
    verisimilitude of reality to the mind without being real, for instance, objects that
    appear in one's imagination or dreams. They are all known as //pannatti//, conceptual
    image. In the Text reference is made of objects of the past existence which are remembered
    in the present. In Buddha's days there was a woman by the name of Patipujika, who could
    recall her past. In her previous existence, her husband was a deva called Malabari. She
    kept on remembering him in the present existence. It was with reference to persons like
    her that remote past is mentioned in the text.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">That man can develop attachment to things dreamt of or
    imagined is understandable. But no attachment can arise in relation to objects which
    cannot be dreamt of or imagined. No love develops in man for a woman he has never thought
    of or met in his imagination; and the same applies to woman.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To Buddha's question Malukyaputta replied: &quot;Surely,
    Reverend Sir, no desire, or lust, or affection can be developed in me for objects which I
    have never seen in the remote or immediate past, or in the present, or for objects which I
    can never hope to see in the future.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">THE STORY OF ANITTHIGANDHA KUMARA</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Dhammapada Commentary there is mentioned a story
    about Anitthigandha Kumara in whom love developed for the kind of feminine beauty which he
    worked up in his mind. This means that if one can visualize an image in one's dreams or
    thoughts, desire, lust and affection can arise in one's mind. The story goes as follows.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Anitthagandha Kumara was born in Savatthi. He was a Brahma
    in his previous existence. While in the plane of the Brahmas, he was free from the
    shackles of sensual desire and lust. Reborn a human being, he had no tendency to have
    anything to do with the opposite sex. When he came of age, his parents told him to marry.
    But the misogamist refused saying, &quot;I do not want a wife.&quot; As the parents
    insisted him on his taking a wife, he devised a stratagem by which he hoped to evade
    marriage. He sought the services of sculptors to make a golden image for him of a
    beautiful girl and, that having been done, he told his parents that he would marry anyone
    who looked like his golden image. The parents, being rich and capable, hired the services
    of brahmins to go about the world and search for a bride whose beauty conformed to what
    their son had conceptualised in his sculpture done in gold.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the brahmins got to Sagala City in Madda Kingdom they
    heard the people talk of the beauty of a sixteen-year-old girl kept in seclusion in a
    seven-tiered tower. Having traced her, they requested her parents to allow them to assess
    her beauty; and were amazed by the fact that her beauty far excelled that of the golden
    image.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The go-betweens then disclosed their true intentions to
    the parents and asked for the hand of the beauty-queen to be given in marriage to
    Anitthigandha Kumara. Gaining consent, the emissaries gave the information to the parents
    of the bridegroom, who, on hearing the news that the bride was more beautiful than the
    figurine he had caused to be sculptured, was all agog to have her brought to his native
    town as quickly as possible. This is an instance of the kind of attachment that arises out
    of one's pure imagination.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sagala and Savatthi are more than five or six hundred
    miles apart; and in those days the system of transportation was very much antiquated.
    Perhaps she was brought in a horse-drawn carriage. She became utterly exhausted during the
    journey, and when, unfortunately, she fell ill, she died.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Anitthigandha Kumara heard this news, he became
    sorely distressed for having missed the opportunity even just to see her renowned beauty.
    He could not eat or sleep. On knowing this Buddha took pity on him and so came to his
    house during the rounds for alms. The parents respectfully offered meals to Buddha and
    produced their son before the Enlightened One.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The root of sorrow and anxiety lies in //raga//, lust and
    the five constituents of sensual desires. Explaining this, Buddha said:</font></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Kamato jayate soko; Kamato jayate
    bhayam; Kamato vippamuttassa; Natthi soko kuto bhayam.&quot;</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Because of sensual desires, grief arises and
    so does fear or anxiety. He who has been released from their dominance know neither grief
    nor fear.&quot;</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Having heard this the young man attained to the stage of
    //sotapatti magga//, the path of a stream-winner. Previously he was against women, and
    thought that he would be able to hoodwink his parents with the impossible. Now that the
    impossible had been made possible with the discovery of a beauty who surpassed his own
    creation, attachment grew in him to torment his innocent mind.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">MALUKYAPUTTA'S ANSWER</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Malukyaputta answered Buddha's question to the effect that
    no desire, nor lust, nor affection can arise from sense-objects that one has never
    experienced before, or from those that one is not experiencing for the moment, or from
    those that one can never hope to experience in the future even in one's imagination. The
    meditating yogis here in this Yeiktha understand this; but this may be a puzzlement to
    those who have not had the experience in insight-meditation. In 1313 B.E. I preached
    Malukyaputta Sutta in Thaddhamma Thitagu Yeiktha in Bassein, when the Thaddhamma Thitagu
    Sayadaw's sister was one among the audience. She confessed that she became confused when
    mention was made of //rupa// which one had not been seeing or which one had not been able
    to visualize in the mind. She wondered what sort of //rupa// that might be. She was an
    intelligent person but her mind was unreceptive before she had practised
    insight-meditation. After she had, she became convinced of the truth of the dhamma. She
    was so pleased with the discourse that she disseminated the knowledge she gained from what
    had been preached to other devotees.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But I thin every thoughtful person can accept the fact
    that unseen sense-objects cannot incite //raga//. Is it possible for you to conceive
    affection for an individual whom you have never met before? Not only affection, but also
    hatred cannot arise in such a case. Neither can delusion or wrong views. I have laid down
    the following aphorisms relating to this subject to aid your memory.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(1) Where visible objects remain unseen, there //kilesa//
    ceases by itself.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(2) Where visible objects are seen there //kilesa// lies
    in wait.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(3) Recollect with mindfulness whatever is seen and dispel
    //kilesa// that lurks in the mind.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(4) The question posed by the Buddha for Malukyaputta to
    answer formulates the work-programme for insight-meditation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It may now be clear that objects which one has never
    before encountered cannot bring up desire, lust and affection that arouse //kilesa//. From
    this statement can be adduced the fact that objects previously seen or known excite
    //kilesa//. Buddha intended to draw Malukyaputta's attention to it by formulating the
    question. But this is not the end of the matter. He wanted him to know that //kilesa//
    continues to arise every time the sense-object is recalled. Having seen a picture of
    someone smiling or scowling, you may recall it to mind, and every time you do it, the
    smiling or scowling face reappears. At each reappearance your mind reacts to it according
    to the impression that it creates. In the same way when you recall to mind the objects you
    have seen, they incite lust, and you become lustful. Anger and delusion may similarly be
    aroused. Failure to note each phenomenon of seeing tends to produce unmindfulness of
    impermanency and unsubstantiality of conditioned things, when //kilesa// gets stuck to
    your inner self. If you diligently note it, you will come to the realization that it
    arises just to get dissolved; and when the nature of //anicca//, impermanency, becomes
    known, it can no longer torment you.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So whenever you look at a thing note what you see, mindful
    of its impermanency, giving no chance for //kilesa// to assert. It does not usually reside
    in your body, but, characteristically, it lies in wait for the opportunity to possess you.
    If you are mindful of its nature by noting the phenomenon of seeing, you will realize its
    transience; and it will subside. And your mind will remain unperturbed as if it has never
    perceived the object.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And this understanding will enable you to formulate for
    yourself how best to perform the task of insight-meditation. That is why I say that
    Buddha's catechism reveals a working plan for vipassana. Anon you shall hear more about
    Buddha's questions in regard to ear-object and ear-basis. Meanwhile I shall give you a
    brief account of insight-meditation exercises as instructed by the Buddha.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">A Brief Work-Programme</font></b></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Ettha ca te Malukyaputta dittha suta
    muta vinnatesu dhammesu ditthe ditthamattam bhavissati; sute sutamattam bhavissati. mute
    mutamattam bhavissati; vinnate vinnatamattam bhavissati.&quot;</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Malukyaputta! As dhammas are seen, heard,
    thought or known, just let them be as they are seen, heard, thought or known at the
    moment. When you see, you just see it; when you hear, you just hear it; when you think,
    you just think it; and when you know, you just know it.&quot;</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the foregoing it has been shown that //kilesa// is
    denied the opportunity to arise when sense-objects cannot gain entry through the six
    sense-doors. The question now arises as to how to exert in repelling it when sense-objects
    do appear at the six sense-doors. Hence Buddha lays down the gist of the task of
    insight-meditation in relation to four modes of seeing, hearing, thinking and knowing.
    Here it may be noted that sense-fields of smell, taste and touch are included for
    brevity's sake in the category of //muta// or thought. Meditation on the Three Marks of
    impermanence, suffering and unsubstantiality centres on the four modes of seeing, hearing,
    thinking and knowing. These senses and the sense-objects are not &quot;I&quot;, not
    &quot;Mine&quot;, not &quot;My ego-entity&quot;. The objects just appear for a moment at
    the sense-doors and the subject just see or hears them for that moment, and nothing more.
    This is the gist of the method of insight-meditation.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">THE STREAM OF EYE-CONSCIOUSNESS</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Seeing is the phenomenon of contact between the eye-object
    and the eye-basis which brings about //cakkhuvinnana//, visual consciousness or
    eye-consciousness which is usually rendered into plain Burmese as literally seeing-knowing
    suggesting perception by the eye. Let me begin with the sequences of a thought-process
    that operate as a visible object presents itself to the eye-basis through the eye-door.
    Several thought-moments occur in their psychic order in each thought-process. Firstly,
    when the eye-basis receives the image of the eye-objects, //bhavanga// consciousness, life
    continuum, wakes up and starts working the process of seeing in three thought-moments.
    This excites //cakkhudvaravajjana//, eye-door consciousness, that turns towards the
    eye-object. The image that is cast on the eye-basis by the eye-object in this manner is
    cognized by //cakkhuvinnana//, eye-consciousness, which, on its first arising, remains
    unperturbed by //kilesa//. It is immediately followed by //sampathiccha na// which
    receives or accepts the image. After the acceptance, //santirana// takes over and
    investigates it so that //votthapana// can determine who is who and what is what. Till
    now, //kilesa//, which has been lying in wait for the opportunity to rear its head, is as
    yet unable to operate. But as soon as the determining consciousness has made the verdict
    that the object is agreeable or disagreeable to the senses, affinity or repulsion develops
    accordingly when //javana//, impulsion, is brought into play. Normally it runs its full
    course of seven thought-moments. At this stage action is judged according to the moral or
    immoral tendencies; and now //kilesa// makes its debut as greed, anger and ignorance and
    shows its true colour. Then the two thought-moments of //tadarammana// occur. This
    thought-process describes the working of the mind on seeing an object. It is called
    //vithi//, the path or course that consciousness takes in establishing itself.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">THE STREAM OF EAR-CONSCIOUSNESS</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(All repetitious statements are re-arranged for better
    understanding and translated, supplemented by Narada Thera's explanations on //vithi// and
    //bhavanga//).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The stream of consciousness that flows when hearing or
    tasting or smelling or touching or thinking is the same as that explained so far regarding
    that of eye consciousness. But I shall here review the whole process at the risk of
    repetition.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">//Bhavanga// is a state of mind that works during sleep.
    (The closest English equivalent for it is life continuum, for, it is an essential
    condition for continued subjective existence). It does not turn itself towards
    sense-objects contacted in the present existence, but towards sense-objects to which the
    subject was attached at the time of death-consciousness in his previous existence. It is
    in contiguity with //patisandhi citta//, rebirth-linking consciousness, of the present
    existence, which is the first and foremost that arises at conception. It is assumed to be
    arising continuously, but, being passive, it subsides whenever thought-moments of other
    varieties of consciousness emerge. For instance, when a sense-object enters the stream of
    consciousness through one of the six sense-doors, //bhavanga// is arrested to make room
    for //dvaravajjana//, sense-door consciousness, which at once takes up the function of
    reflection on the nature of the image cast by the sense-object that passes through the
    sense-doors. Then //cakkhuvinnana// or //sotavinnana// (ear-consciousness), as the case
    may be, occurs to be followed in its wake by //sampaticchana//, receiving consciousness,
    which hands over charge of the image to //santirana// that investigates into its nature.
    On the result of this investigation //votthapana//, determining consciousness, makes the
    decision as to who is who or what is what. At the end of the process, //javana//,
    impulsion, vibrates for seven thought-moments in an effort to deliver, as it were, the
    report of the decision to //tadarammana//, registering consciousness or retentive
    resultant, which vibrates for two thought-moments (when it is running its full cycle) and
    subsides into //bhavanga//; and this subsidence is compared to the state of falling
    asleep.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When //votthapana// determines that an object is worthy of
    affection and love, immoral actions like anger and greed are aroused at the instance of
    desire for that object. This is the working of the unwholesome //javanas//. But this may
    not always be the case. At times the object may be adjudged repugnant when the subject
    might become inclined to doing wholesome deeds in order to avoid the consequences of
    unpleasurable experiences. At other times a beautiful object may be viewed by the subject
    with compassion and benevolence when moral actions are brought into play. In such cases
    //javanas// lend themselves to morality. It may be noted that there are 14 thought-moments
    from //avajjana// to //tadarammana//. When sense-objects are weak and not impressionable,
    the thought-moments of //javana// may end up with only five or six impulsions although
    normally they run to seven.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the phenomenon of seeing occurs you just see it; do
    nothing more. The Text says: &quot;Ditthe ditthamattam bhavissti,&quot; (On seeing, let
    seeing be). The working of the thought-process on hearing or tasting a sense-object is the
    same as that of seeing. So when the phenomenon of hearing occurs, you just hear it. On
    hearing, let hearing be; do nothing more. This agrees with the saying: &quot;Sute
    sutamattam bhavissati&quot;. You shall hear more about it later, but now I shall deal with
    the abstract knowledge to be gained from noting eye-objects.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">SEEING ABSTRACT REALITY</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When all thought-moments of eye-consciousness, sense-door
    consciousness, determining consciousness, impulsions and registering consciousness have
    all done their part in the process of seeing, the abstract reality of the form and shape
    of the sense-object (or sense impressions) becomes manifest. Here the subject who is
    looking at the thing has not bent his mind on the concept of masculinity or femininity. At
    this juncture, //akusala javana//, impulsion towards immoral actions, may, perhaps, take
    place. But as it is weak it is unable to cause strong reactions. That is to say, the
    results of immoral actions may not be so prominent. If, therefore, at this initial stage,
    when action-results have not yet gathered momentum, you will be able to take note of the
    object just as you see it, or in other words, just as your eye-cognition occurs. You will
    then experience the abstract reality of both the subject that sees as well as the object
    that is seen. The subject is, of course, //nama// and the object //rupa//. You have now
    come face to face with //namarupa// in the //paramattha// (abstract) sense. Thus far you
    have not yet ruminated in your mind as to the masculinity or femininity of the object you
    are looking at. It means that you have not yet gone to the length of gaining conceptual
    knowledge or //pannatti// of what you see. So, at this stage, although it is true that you
    are seeing a thing, you can leave seeing alone as it is, as you have not started
    a-thinking. This agrees with the statement: &quot;When you see, just see it&quot;.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">FROM EYE-DOOR TO MIND-DOOR</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is no easy matter to stop short at seeing just as it
    happens. A beginner will not be able to catch up the thought-moments that make up the
    thought-process. Not being able to take in the phenomenon instantaneously as it arises, he
    has to think over the object that appears in his mind's eye if he really wants to know it.
    What passes through the mind-door needs normally to be identified, but the novice finds
    difficulty in adjusting his eye-consciousness to the object he is looking at in his
    efforts to identify it. So he has to fall back upon his mind-consciousness to do some
    thinking for him relating to what his eye-consciousness has encountered. This is how
    //vithi// relating to mind-consciousness arises which may be elaborated as follows. First,
    //avajjana// sets itself in motion prompting the seven impulsions or //javanas// that
    report the findings to two //tadarammanas//. Thus there are now altogether ten
    thought-moments in this part of the process. But if the sense-object is able to create
    only weak impressions, //javana// vibrates for less than seven moments. Mind-consciousness
    may be cut off only after five or six vibrations. When eye-consciousness has done its
    part, mind-consciousness takes over the former's job; but even then the latter is yet
    unable to distinguish the visible object into male and female. This stage is still in the
    realm of //paramattha// as before when eye-consciousness was working. But here note this
    one difference: whereas eye-consciousness cognizes the visible object of the present
    moment, mind-consciousness cognizes it as it recedes into the past. That is to say that
    mind-consciousness has to recall the past image as previously seen by eye-consciousness.
    Even now the image still remains //paramattha//. It is, therefore, extremely difficult for
    a beginner to be able to note the visible object as it passes through the first //vithi//
    of mind-consciousness.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">THE BIRTH OF CONCEPTUAL KNOWLEDGE</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Failure to note with mindfulness the object as it enters
    the avenue of sense at the first //vithi// of mind-consciousness prompts the arising of
    the second //vithi//. At this stage, //pannatti//, conceptual knowledge regarding the
    shape and form of the visible object, begins to emerge, which, at the following third
    //vithi//, becomes firmly established. The subject is now able to distinguish it into male
    and female. This clear cognition relates to both form and name. So //rupa pannatti// and
    //nama pannatti// are conceived. This concept comes naturally in quick succession during
    the second and third //vithi//; but it is a concept gained through //avijja//, delusion,
    which covers up the true nature of things. The commentaries say that delusion has the
    tendency to hide. //Satipatthana//, basic exercise in mindfulness, exhorts a yogi to
    observe and note every time he sees an object, because such observation and noting enable
    him to come face to face with //paramattha// reality before delusion works him up with
    //pannatti// concept. In the beginning, however, he will find it difficult to grasp the
    reality as he has not mastered enough strength in mindfulness, concentration and
    understanding. But when these three qualities become firmly rooted in him, he will be
    quick to realize the true nature of things even at the moment of the lapse of the first
    //vithi// of eye-consciousness. When he is able to establish himself in //bhanga nana//,
    knowledge of dissolution, and //sankhaupekkha nana//, knowledge of equanimity towards
    conditioned things, he will find that it is not imperative for the stream of
    mind-consciousness to flow up to //javana//, and that after two or three //votthapanas//
    he can realize insight relating to //chalangupekkha vipassana nana//, six qualities of
    equanimity towards all the senses of seeing, hearing etc. Thus it has been shown in Mula
    Pannasa Commentary; for fuller details please refer to my discourse on Vipassana Practice.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">POTTHILA THERA</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the time of Buddha there was an elder monk named
    Potthila who was learned in the Three Baskets of the Law. But as he neglected the practice
    of mind-culture, Buddha used to chide him calling him Tuccha Potthila -- vain and useless
    Potthila. Realizing his shortcomings in the field of mind-culture, the monk visited the
    monastery of 30 Arahats in a forest and requested them to prescribe meditation exercises
    for him. A senior Arahat knew his pride of learning and refused to give him personally any
    advice, but directed him to approach other Arahats, who, likewise, told him to go to other
    juniors. So in the end he had only a seven-year old Arahat to rely on for the
    //kammatthana// he was seeking.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The young samanera told him that he was young and
    inexperienced; but Potthila would have none of it. So the former gave him this
    instruction.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Reverend Thera! There are six openings in a
    mound which an iguana makes his home. If you want to catch the animal, close up the five
    exits of the mound, and wait for it to come out from the last exit. There are six
    mind-doors through which six sense-objects can enter. If you close five of them and keep
    the mind-door open, you task will be accomplished.&quot;</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What the young Arahat suggested was for Potthila not to
    allow //javana// merely to hang on to the five sense-doors of eye, ear, nose, tongue, and
    touch, but to shut them up and note only the mind-door so that impulsion could lead him on
    to insight-meditation. This gave the learned monk a clue to the method of
    vipassana-practice. When one sees, one must stop at the thought-moment of //votthapana//
    and note all phenomena with mindfulness. It is the same as saying: When you see, you just
    see it. Having practised meditation as suggested, Potthila attained Arahatship.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">SEIZE THE RIGHT MOMENT</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here one must seize the critical moment when sense-door
    consciousness first arises. If one fails to do so one stands to be deluded by conceptual
    knowledge. If you fail to note seeing as it happens, you shall live in the world of
    //pannatta//. For easy understanding, let me summarize the four stages of the process that
    I have explained.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. First //avajjana// reflects as the object enters the
    avenue of mind-door consciousness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. That moment of reflection constitutes the first
    //vithi// which tries to gain cognition through consciousness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. Then concept is formed in the next //vithi//.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. Finally the nature of the object is known by its name
    or //pannatti//.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">//Nama// and //rupa// in the //paramattha// sense can be
    known through meditation on the nature of the phenomenon as soon as it arises. As one
    knows instantly what is actually happening, one gains conviction in the Three Marks of
    //anicca, dukkha and anatta//. The following four points should also be noted.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Seize the first moment in the act of seeing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. Arrest the flow of consciousness at the first //vithi//
    (to conform to the requirement of //ditthe ditthamattam bhavissati//).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. Differentiate //nama//, mind, from //rupa//, matter.
    (This is knowing the reality that mind is distinct from matter.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. Recognize the Three Marks of //anicca, dukkha and
    anatta//.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As development of insight-knowledge sets the pace, //rupa
    paramattha//, form or matter in the abstract, will be rendered distinguishable from //nama
    paramattha//, name or mind in the abstract. At this stage dissolution becomes clearly
    manifest. Progressively, as //bhanga nana// gets sharpened, the mind is able to appreciate
    dissolution arising in a state of flux when both the seeing subject and the seen object
    pass away together at tremendous pace. A yogi contemplating dissolution may even have the
    feeling of actually seeing mind-consciousness a-fluttering as it resolves into
    nothingness. The image of dissolution thus created is so hazy that he might have thought
    something is wrong with his eyesight. Now that he has gained the experience of seeing how
    dissolution works, he stands to be benefited by his first-hand knowledge about //anicca//.
    This knowledge will lead him on to the revelation that what is not permanent is
    unsatisfactory and unsubstantial as he has virtually no control over his //nama// and
    //rupa//. It is the nature of //namarupa// just to happen. This, indeed, is reality.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we are mindful of the phenomena of seeing, hearing
    etc., according to Buddha's instructions, we may realize that they just occur and nothing
    more can be said about it. Things just happen. The meditating yogi need not go any further
    beyond seeing or hearing to examine whether what he has seen or heard is a male or a
    female. His mind does not dwell on //pannatti// or concepts.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">ANSWERING A CRITIC</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Among those not used to contemplation or meditation there
    are doubting Thomases who question the propriety of noting the phenomenon. Some of them
    even advance the proposition that the whole process of contemplation is wrong. While at
    Chauk a man approached me with the criticism that //cakkhuvinnana//, eye-consciousness,
    fails to recognize the genesis, //upada//, and dissolution, //bhanga//, on the arising and
    passing away of //nama// and //rupa//. It can recognize only the visible object that
    enters its avenue. It cannot appreciate how that visible object is behaving. His criticism
    runs on the following lines; &quot;As //cakkhuvinnana// fails to see the visible object
    actually happening, how can observation and noting it contribute to the knowledge of
    genesis and dissolution of matter?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the Commentaries and Abhidhamma, //rupa//,
    form, comes into being four or five instants of //citta// before the event of
    eye-consciousness, and dissolves twelve, or at least ten or nine, instants after its
    subsidence. It is, therefore, correct to say that the eye-consciousness fails to notice
    the genesis and dissolution of the eye-object at the moment of seeing. But here //sati//,
    mindfulness or recollection, comes in. It has the ability to recall the genesis and
    dissolution of the actual phenomenon perceived by the eye-consciousness. According to
    //sutta desana//, if the phenomenon is made known by virtue of //sati//, the genesis and
    dissolution of the sense-object may be said to have been cognized by the eye-consciousness
    too.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Jhana Sutta in Anguttara Nikaya mentions the fact that,
    when a yogi arises from //jhanic// trance, he is able to recall the //jhanic citta//,
    mind, //cetasika//, its concomitant, and //nama//, aggregate of mind, which he meditated
    upon during the state of //jhana//. He was aware of them with perspicacity as if he were
    observing them actually with his own eye-consciousness. However, the genesis and
    dissolution of //rupa// could not be distinctly perceived for he had not concentrated his
    mind on it during the trance. But when //jhanic citta//, //cetasika//, and //nama// have
    been clearly understood, the nature of //rupa// that depends upon //jhana//, or that
    arises because of //jhana//, can be understood by inference.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So on the authority of the same Sutta it may be shown
    that, when one is noting the phenomenon of seeing, one is aware of the genesis and
    dissolution of //rupa// that forms the eye-object and that depends on the
    eye-consciousness. When a yogi meditates on //rupa//, he sees its arising and
    disappearance just as he sees lightning. So it has been said:</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Mental formations renew their appearance,
    and just as they are renewed they perish in much the same way as a flash of lightning
    appears and disappears.&quot;</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now consider that flash of lightning. Who can truly say
    that he can see its //upada// and //bhanga//, although it is a fact that he sees the whole
    phenomenon. Certainly he cannot see its beginning nor its end. But actually he sees it
    happen. To a yogi who possesses //bhanga// and //sankhaupekkha nanas//, the fact is clear
    that the eye-object makes its appearance to vanish at the next instant in the same way
    lightning appears and disappears. This is all the more evident when sounds or tactile
    sensations form the subjects of meditation. When he realizes the Three Marks of //anicca,
    dukkha and anatta// through first-hand knowledge of the phenomenon of arising and passing
    away of //nama// and //rupa//, he may be certain that he has acquired vipassana-knowledge.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Furthermore, if he continues to meditate in the way now
    suggested, //nibbida nana//, knowledge of baneful things as disgusting, will be developed
    in him. When he gets bored with the aggregates, craving will be expelled; and in the
    absence of craving, the Noble Path can be reached, when he will become a //sotapanna//.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">//Rupa// that is cognized by eye-consciousness arises
    simultaneously with //atita bhavanga//, passive consciousness inherited from the past. It
    also dissolves simultaneously with the second thought-moment of //tadarammana// during the
    formation of the thinking-process. It is not, however, possible for one to be directly
    aware of these two aspects of consciousness called //upada// and //bhanga//. They can only
    be understood through applied knowledge or //sutamaya//. Learning things at second hand,
    however, may not contribute to the awakening of insight-knowledge, and consequently to the
    realization of //nibbida nana//. Ordinarily no one can actually say precisely how or in
    what manner //rupa// arises whether along with the first, second, or third aspect of
    //atita bhavanga//, or dissolves, whether along with the second thought-moment of
    //tadarammana//, or with the seventh thought-moment of //javana//. If insight-knowledge
    were to mean strict accuracy in regard to these types of thought-process, a yogi can
    hardly hope to attain it. But what the Commentaries on Abhidhamma aim at is for the yogi
    to gain knowledge through applied methods if necessary. Such details do not matter in the
    practice of insight-meditation. Suffice it to say that it is essential for a meditating
    yogi to note the phenomenon as it arises in the same way as he notes the phenomenon of
    lightning. This agrees with the instruction: Note your going as you go.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">MEDITATING ON HEARING, ETC.</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Malukyaputta undertook to apply mindfulness to the
    activities of the six senses. If one is constantly mindful, one will just hear what
    appears on his ear-door, and no more. Now as I am delivering this discourse, you are
    hearing each sound or syllable of the words that I am uttering. If you concentrate your
    mind on each syllable that I am pronouncing, you will certainly miss the import and
    meaning of what I am trying to convey to you. If you just stop short at cognition of the
    sounds that I make, you will not be able to note them in the //pannatti// way. That is to
    say you will not be able to form any concept of what you hear. In like manner if you sniff
    a smell, you just end up with that smell. The stream of consciousness will not flow
    further than the sense of smell. When you receive tactile sensations and stop short at
    receiving them, you will just feel that you have touched something or something has
    touched you, and you will not go beyond that feeling.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the phenomenon of ideation, too, you will just stop at
    the point where mind-consciousness arises without proceeding to arrive at formulating
    concepts. In that case //kilesa// will be denied the opportunity of rearing its head. You
    shall hear more about it later.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now let me bring to your mind the passage cited earlier
    regarding the phenomena of seeing, hearing, etc. &quot;When you see, you just see it; when
    you hear, you just hear it; when you think, you just think it; and when you know, you just
    know it.&quot; This is insight-meditation put succinctly and it means that when
    consciousness of sense-objects arises, note the arising so that it just stops there. You
    may not be able to do so without noting the phenomena with mindfulness. Even when you are
    trying to note them in this way, it may so happen that your mind deviates from its main
    objective to investigating whether the object observed is a male or a female, especially
    when you are just a beginner in meditation. Some would like to assert that, by merely
    making an introspection into the characteristics of the Three Marks of //anicca, dukkha
    and anatta//, one can render consciousness remain as it is as it arises. Some go so far as
    to maintain that the mind should be kept as it is when it will automatically stop itself
    at cognition of things seen or heard. That amounts to saying that the mind should be
    allowed to go free without any agency to watch over it. This means that mindfulness will
    be discarded. To such dissenters let me ask this question: How would your mind react to
    harsh words that grind your ears, or to trash that inflames you, or to physical and mental
    pain that undermine your equanimity? Without noting the psyche with mindfulness, how can
    anyone keep it as it is? Let these people judge for themselves the true worth of their own
    asseverations.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When a yogi meditates constantly on the phenomena of
    seeing, hearing, etc., he will realize //bhanga nana// which will reveal to him the moment
    when dissolution occurs. If he abides in that moment, insight-knowledge will be
    established showering on him its benefits.</font></p>

    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Malukyaputta! If, when you see, you just see
    it, when you hear, you just hear it, when you think, you just think it, and when you know
    you just know it, then you will arrive at the understanding that the objects of sense that
    you perceive have nothing to do with you.&quot;</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This means that you can in no way get involved with the
    sense-objects whenever you perceive them. You wash your hands of //raga//, lust, //dosa//,
    anger, and //moha//, delusion, that the sense-objects generate. When you fail to stop
    short at seeing, hearing, etc., your mind will cling to those passions, and whenever you
    recall them they will lead you all over again to //raga, dosa and moha//. Those failing to
    note the phenomena of seeing, hearing, etc., get heavily involved in sights, sounds, etc.,
    with which they come into contact. Those who have developed //bhanga// and //vipassana
    nana// with the practice of meditation realize the nature of the dissolution of both the
    objects of sense and the mind that takes note of them, and are able to grasp the mind that
    takes note of them, and are able to grasp the significance of the Three Marks. As
    sense-objects fail to generate attachment during meditation, no occasion arises for the
    meditator to recall them; and consequently //kilesa// becomes discarded. Inclination to
    //kilesa// caused by sense-object is known as //arrammananusaya//.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Commentaries enjoin a meditator to give a wide berth
    to unwholesome //javanas//. In fact abandoning such kind of impulsions comes naturally to
    him, for he requires no special effort in shunning evil. When insight-knowledge becomes
    keen and sharp, //javanas// fail to arise as the stream of consciousness flows only up to
    //votthapana// and no more. In other words, subsidence of the flow of consciousness occurs
    at the determining stage of //votthapana//, before impulsions can start operating.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddha continued:</font></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yato tvam Malukyaputta na tena, Tato
    tvam Malukyaputta na tattha.&quot;</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Malukyaputta! When you have nothing to do
    with the sense-objects that you perceive, you will get no foothold on them.&quot;</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">INCLINATION TO NIBBANA</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Commentaries on Udana Katha elaborate on the word,
    &quot;foothold&quot;. When a yogi loses hold of craving and egoistic views, absolving
    himself from the ideas of &quot;I&quot;, or &quot;Mine&quot;, or &quot;My
    ego-entity&quot;, he cannot get rooted in sense-objects. About this Buddha has this to
    say:</font></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yato tvam Malukyaputta na tattha, tato
    tvam Malukyaputta neviaha, na huram, na ubhayamantarena, esevanto dukkhassa.&quot;</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Malukyaputta! When you lose your foothold on
    the objects of sense, your //namarupa// (aggregates of mind and matter) will neither be
    here in this world, nor there in the other world. And this being not anywhere in both
    worlds means the end of suffering.&quot;</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When ego-entity has no standing //namarupa// ceases to
    exist in all possible worlds either in this or the other world; and this cessation means
    the end of suffering. It becomes apparent when the yogi's mind gets inclined to Nibbana
    through the realization of the Noble Path. When an Arahat enters Nibbana no vestiges of
    //namarupa// remain. As soon as death consciousness occurs at the time of //parinibbana//,
    he achieves //anupadisesa nibbana//, all strata of existence not remaining. Regarding this
    the Commentaries say that when a yogi loses his foothold on //rupa//, he is neither here
    in the six organs of the senses, nor there in the six sense-doors nor anywhere in the six
    types of consciousness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This agrees with the actual experience of the meditating
    yogi who has acquired //bhanga// and //sankhaupekkha nana//. No //kilesa// can arise in
    him on his realization of the truth of the nature of matter in a state of flux. He takes a
    highly impersonal and objective view of the sights and sounds that he sees and hears.
    After that the attainment of //anuloma nana//, knowledge of adaptation, will qualify him
    for the higher path. Then he enters the stream of //gotrabhu// consciousness that exalts
    him to a sublime stage, overcoming the Sense Sphere lineage. On the abandonment of the
    Sphere of the Senses, he actually realizes Nibbana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Regarding this, Milinda Panha has this to say:</font></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Tassa tam cittam aparaparam manasikarota
    pavattam samatikkamitva appavattam okkamati, apavattamanuppatto maharaja sammapatipanna
    nibbanam sacchikarotiti vuccati.&quot;</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;A yogi, developing mindfulness step by step
    reaches the stage of non-occurrence (of //namarupa//) having crossed over the stage of
    continual occurrence. O King! One who has entered the stage of non-occurrence with correct
    meditational practice may be said to have come face to face with Nibbana.&quot;</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">A SUMMARY OF THE SUTTA</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The following is a summary of what Buddha taught
    Malukyaputta with regard to meditation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. When you note with mindfulness what you see, or hear,
    or think, or know, you remain just conscious of your seeing, hearing, thinking and
    knowing, and nothing more.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. If thus, you just see or hear or think or know what you
    are seeing, hearing, thinking or knowing you shall not get yourself involved in those
    phenomena.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. Since you have nothing whatever to do with them, you
    shall have no foothold on the sense-objects that you perceive.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. As you have no foothold on them, you are neither here
    nor there, nor anywhere, and the very fact that you exist nowhere means that you have
    realized Nibbana where all sufferings end.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Malukyaputta had had the benefit of Buddha's advice,
    he expressed his satisfaction in 24 stanzas. Saying &quot;Well done, Malukyaputta!&quot;
    Buddha elaborated on them himself stanza by stanza, and I shall now make an exposition on
    them part by part.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">FAILURE TO MEDITATE ON RUPA WHILE SEEING</font></strong></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">1. Rupam disva sati muttha, Piyam nimittam
    manasi karoto. Sarattacitto vedeti, tanca ajjhosa titthati.</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">1. Having seen rupa, form, one loses mindfulness,
    and getting absorbed in the charms created by it, one feels the onset of desire that tries
    to imbibe it.</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is human nature to get attracted to objects that appeal
    to the senses. You look at a thing because you derive pleasure out of it. At the moment of
    looking at it you forget the practice of the dhamma. Even a meditating yogi may be moved
    by visible objects that give pleasurable sensations; and his attention may be diverted
    from his noble purpose. Those not used to meditational practice would easily give
    themselves away to alluring //rupa//. As soon as the concept of beauty and loveliness
    overpowers them, they will be forgetful of the dhamma. //Rupa//, therefore, makes one
    forgetful or unmindful.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A pleasing smile usually gets ingrained in the heart of
    the subject who sees it. It is always a pleasure to recall it. He, therefore, keeps
    remembering it for days, months and years. His mind is now taking in //rupa// as if trying
    to ingest or imbibe it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I am speaking about this reaction to //rupa// in general
    terms. Of course there are occasions when a man feels repugnant towards the object that he
    sees. At times he may be indifferent to it. Whatever be the case, the crux of the matter
    is that //rupa// generates various kinds of feelings such as pain, pleasure, greed, anger
    and the like which bring about kamma-actions, action-results and eventually rounds of
    suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Suffering brought about by //rupa// is shown hereunder:</font></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">2. Tassa vaddhunti vedana, aneka rupasambhava;
    Abhijjha ca vihesa ca, cittamassupahannati. Evam acinato dukkham, ara nibbana vuccati.</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">2. A multitude of passions such as covetousness
    and rage, springing from //rupa//, torments him who takes a firm hold of it, with the
    consequence that his mind becomes burdened with vexation. Nibbana, therefore, remains far
    away from him who would carry the load of suffering rather than meditate.</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All //rupas// give rise to //vedana//, feeling or passion.
    When an agreeable object is presented to an individual, he delights in it; but it is after
    all //sukha vedana//. When a repugnant object is presented to him, he feels miserable, and
    that is //dukkha vedana//. Such //vedanas// are the cause of vexation that torments him.
    If he sees a beautiful object, desire to possess it arises in him. He will get annoyed if
    he thinks that someone is thwarting his wishes to acquire it. Such dispositions of the
    mind are the results of the working of greed and anger. They worry him, and so he is
    forever busily engaged in malevolent activities against people whom he thinks are opposing
    him in the fulfilment of his desires. Prompted by greed and anger, he becomes almost worn
    out in his efforts to counter the opposition of his adversaries, real or imaginary.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Most people are not used to mindfulness throughout their
    lives. For them a change over from an unmindful to a mindful state will be difficult of
    achievement. One who cannot accept mindfulness will be accepting defilements which bring
    about the round of suffering. In that case Nibbana remains far removed from him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Failure to meditate will deprive one of the knowledge
    about the Three Marks of //anicca//, etc., inviting //kilesa// to add miseries to
    suffering, in the same way as adding fuel to the fire.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I give below a summary of these points relating to
    //rupa//.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(A) //Rupa// engenders tender passions that send
    mindfulness into oblivion.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(B) The impassioned mind imbibes //rupa//.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(C) //Rupa// gives rise to feelings of pain and pleasure.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(D) Conditioned by greed, anger arises causing anxiety and
    worry.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(E) He who thus accepts conditions that create suffering
    will always have suffering as his companion.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(F) The round of suffering keeps Nibbana away.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">MEDITATING ON RUPA BRINGS NIBBANA NEAR</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The foregoing stanzas paint a darker side of the issue;
    but I shall also give you the brighter side of it.</font></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">3. Na so rajjati rupesu, rupam disva
    patissato; Virattacitto vedeti, tanca najjhosa titthati.</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">3. Passion remains undeveloped in him who
    recollects with mindfulness the //rupa// that he has seen. Thus freed from lust, he
    refuses to imbibe it.</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This stanza reveals the essence of the practice of
    insight-meditation. It enjoins the yogi to recollect with mindfulness the object he has
    seen and to meditate on it. From this it is clear that insight-meditation means noting the
    object that he has actually seen, and not the object that he has not. It can be
    accomplished only through practical wisdom and not through //sutamaya// or knowledge
    acquired from hearing what others say.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Commentaries on Thera Gatha say that a meditator must
    try to recollect the eye-object that he perceives as it presents itself through his
    eye-door to his eye-consciousness being mindful of the four factors of enlightenment or
    //sampajannas//, namely, knowing what is beneficial, what is proper, what is objective and
    what is free from delusion.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Earlier I have told you about the //vithi// relating to
    eye-consciousness. What I am speaking about now is the same thing. If you miss noting the
    process of seeing just as it occurs, try to catch up with the thought-moment of the
    mind-consciousness. One who can seize that moment and recollect the absolute reality of
    form or //rupa paramattha//, may notice the dissolution of both the sense-object and the
    eye-consciousness at the moment of seeing. When one concentrates only on the act of seeing
    without thinking over what one has seen, visual perception will last only for an instant.
    This agrees with the saying: Ditthe ditthamattam bhavissati. In that case defilements will
    have no time to assert themselves. In the absence of defilements lust or craving subsides.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Desire works up //vedana//, sensations, or passions in
    this case, which begets craving, //tanha//, by means of which the individual embraces
    //rupa//. A non-meditator, although fully aware of seeing the object, fails to note it
    with mindfulness, and he permits craving to arise. But a meditator does not actually see
    what he sees; and so he gives no chance for desire or craving to arise, for he has always
    been mindful of the dissolution. In that state, delusion is eliminated and wisdom arises.
    In the absence of defilements such as craving, kamma-actions, action-results and new
    becoming cannot be formed. He will be emancipated from suffering. This fact is emphasised
    in the next stanza.</font></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">4. Yathassa passato rupam, sevato capi
    vedanam; Khiyati nopaciyati, evam so caratissato. Evam apacinato dukkham, santike nibbana
    vuccati.</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">4. Looking at an eye-object, a yogi just sees it
    and just feels that he sees it, without assimilating //rupa//, form cast by it. With him
    suffering ceases. He should practise meditation in this way; and if he so practises it, he
    is said to be within sight of Nibbana.</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As the yogi has not been assimilating //rupa// which he
    notes with mindfulness, he is not inviting //kilesa// which brings about kamma-actions and
    action-results.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Commentaries on Thera Gatha emphasise the fact that
    &quot;seeing the form (//rupa//)&quot; means seeing it with the strength of conviction
    that what one sees is //anicca//, impermanence. Eye-consciousness brings about sensations
    of seeing which mind-consciousness takes to heart. The mind collects them and stores them
    up in the same way as a greedy person amasses wealth. The result is the upsurgence of
    abhijjha, covetousness, one of the manifestations of //kilesa// on which kamma-actions and
    action-results depend. A meditating yogi refuses to accept eye-consciousness and its
    consequences in this way. In other words, he abstains from assimilating defilements that
    lead him to rounds of suffering. Each time he meditates on the phenomenon of seeing,
    insight-knowledge is developed. Each time insight-knowledge is developed, defilements are
    discarded. So he is said to be enjoying //tadanga nibbana// -- peaceful bliss attained at
    the instant when pollution of the mind is eliminated.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A meditator, who is living in the world of realities or
    //paramattha//, will gradually realize insight-knowledge stage by stage. He will proceed
    from //namarupa pariccheda nana//, knowledge of distinction between mind and matter, to
    //gotrabhu nana//, knowledge of higher lineage, through //anuloma nana//, knowledge of
    adaptation. According to the sayings of Patthana, this will ultimately lead one to the
    knowledge of the Path and its Fruition. It must be noted that //anuloma nana// is the
    highest of the ten stages of insight-knowledge. Aspirants to Nibbana must therefore engage
    themselves in the practice of vipassana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The following is a summary of the points discussed so far.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">i. On recollecting //rupa// with mindfulness, //raga//,
      lust, is eliminated.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">ii. In the absence of lust or desire, the mind refuses to
      imbibe //rupa//.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">iii. Note as soon as one sees and be conscious of seeing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">iv. If one meditates in that way, the round of suffering
      will cease.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">v. This is the way for a yogi to practise.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">vi. On the cessation of suffering, Nibbana will come into

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now I shall deal with the second question posed by Buddha
    for Malukyaputta to answer.</font></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Ye te sotavinnaeyya sadda assuta
    assutapubba, na ca sunasi, na ca te hoti suneyyanti, atthi te tattha chando va rago va
    pemam va.&quot;</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;How do you answer this, Malukyaputta? Answer
    me as best you can. There are certain audible objects which you have never heard
    previously, either in the immediate or remote past, or at the present moment. Neither can
    you hope to hear them in the future. Can such objects arouse desire, lust and affection in
    you?&quot;</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Malukyaputta replied that no desire or lust or affection
    could possibly arise out of sounds or voices that one had never heard before in the recent
    or remote past, or that one had not been hearing at present, or that one could not hope to
    hear in the future. This answer is appropriate. On hearing a pleasant voice and cognizing
    the individual who makes it, the hearer develops affection or attachment for the owner of
    the voice. As attachment is developed //kilesa// is brought into play and the consequences
    mentioned before follow. If one meditates on hearing, //kilesa// will be kept away.
    Reference is invited to what I have previously spoken about the phenomenon of seeing.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">PANNATTI AND PARAMATTHA</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What has been discussed earlier about the //vithi//
    relating to eye-consciousness applies //mutatis mutandis// to the stream of consciousness
    that I am now talking about; and so I give below the gist of the //vithi// relating to
    ear-consciousness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the phenomenon of hearing an audible object enters the
    avenue of the ear-door; and we say that the sound is heard. This is the first //vithi//
    relating to ear-consciousness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the ear-consciousness makes due investigation as to
    the nature of the sound it receives. This is the first //vithi// relating to
    mind-consciousness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the second //vithi// of mind-consciousness, //nama//,
    name, suggested by the sound is cognized.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the last //vithi// of mind-consciousness, //pannatti//,
    concept conveyed by the name given to the sound, is apperceived.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As an object makes the sound, the ear just hears it. If
    you note this with mindfulness not going beyond it, you call a halt to the process of
    hearing. The stream of ear-consciousness stops flowing then and there. But if you are
    unmindful, your mental formations and activities will be brought into play when you may
    recall the sound you hear and think over it. That means the stream of mind-consciousness
    has taken over. Even then, this //vithi// of mind-consciousness is only aware of the
    sound. //Pannatti//, concept, has not yet formed. If you can note this with mindfulness,
    your apperception ends here, stopping at the stage of the abstract (//paramattha//) idea
    of sound. If you fail to call a halt to further mental activities, the second //vithi//
    would apperceive the concept of the individual making the sound, and furthermore, the
    third //vithi// will proceed to distinguish the sex of the individual, and this will be
    followed by the development of affinity or repulsion that he instils in your mind. In this
    way //vithi// conjures up //kilesa//. It is, therefore, imperative that you meditate on
    hearing just as you hear. I have summarised these statements as follows:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you fail to note the phenomenon with mindfulness, you
    end up with //pannatti// knowledge.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To obtain //paramattha// knowledge the following should be
    borne in mind.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Note with mindfulness the instant you hear. (Note as soon
    as the //vithi// of ear-consciousness occurs. Or, failing that, note as soon as the
    //vithi// of mind-consciousness occurs).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Stop the flow of the process of thought at hearing. (If
    you can do this, the second //vithi// of mind-consciousness cannot arise.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is in accordance with the saying: Sute Sutamattam
    bhavissati.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then you can distinguish //nama//, mind, from //rupa//,
    matter. (What you hear is matter at work. When you are noting, mind is at work. Mind and
    matter are thus distinguished. Both the hearing and the noting appear to dissolve at the
    next instant.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the end you will recognize the Three Marks of //anicca,
    dukkha and anatta//.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">FAILURE TO MEDITATE ON SADDA ON HEARING</font></strong></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">5. Saddam sutva sati muttha, piyam nimittam
    manasi karoto. Sarattacitto vedeti, tanca ajjhosa titthati.</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">5. Having heard Sadda, sound, one loses
    mindfulness, and, getting absorbed in the charms created by it, one feels the onset of
    desire that tries to imbibe it.</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When an audible object presents itself at the ear-door,
    the hearer tries to appreciate it, generally expecting it to be sweet and agreeable. But
    it usually tends to induce unwholesome thoughts, speech and actions. While he is paying
    attention to what he is hearing, he loses mindfulness. Desire arises in him if it is a
    pleasant sound. He takes in what he hears as if he is ingesting or imbibing it. Whenever
    he recalls it, desire re-appears and torments him again. The story of Prince Nanda
    illustrates this point.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">NANDA THERA</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Prince Siddhattha and Prince Nanda were half-brothers, the
    former being born of Maha Maya, and the latter of Maha Pajapati Gotami, both being sisters
    wedded to King Suddhodana. Prince Nanda is four or five days younger. When Maha Maya died
    seven days after the birth of her son, Maha Pajapati Gotami left her own son in the care
    of royal wet-nurses and brought up Siddhattha breast-feeding him herself.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Prince Siddhattha became Buddha after enlightenment, and
    came to Rajagaha to spend the first Retreat there. Three days after his arrival King
    Suddhodana arranged a wedding feast for his second son, Prince Nanda, betrothed to
    Princess Janapada Kalyani. As Buddha was invited, he came to the palace where he had his
    meals offered to him. When he was about to return to the monastery, he told Prince Nanda
    to take his (Buddha's) bowl and come with him. The Prince, out of fear and awe for his
    elder brother, did as he was told, expecting that Buddha would take back his bowl and
    discharge him at any time. As he was about to leave the palace, Princess //Janapada
    Kalyani// called out to him requesting, &quot;My Lord Prince, come back quickly!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But, once at the monastery, Buddha asked his younger
    brother if he would become a monk. The Prince had no mind to don the yellow robe, but
    overwhelmed by awe he said, &quot;Yes.&quot; So he was ordained. But he was never happy.
    So, one day, he complained, &quot;I am not happy in the practice of this noble conduct. I
    can no longer abide in it. I shall revert to laymanship.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now it came to the knowledge of Buddha that Nanda Thera
    was not happy in his monkhood. The Enlightened One, therefore, asked him why. The
    newly-ordained monk told him that Janapada Kalyani's words calling him to come back soon
    were ringing in his ears.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddha took his younger brother by the hand and led him to
    a desolate field, recently burnt out by forest fire, and showed him a maimed old hag of a
    monkey sitting by the side of a smouldering log. From there he went to Tavatimsa, the
    abode of the first Plane of Devas, and introduced the love-lorn Prince to a bevy of five
    hundred beauties, all deities. Then Buddha asked for Nanda Thera's opinion as to who was
    beautiful, Princess Janapada or any one of the deities. &quot;Reverend Sir!&quot; he
    replied, &quot;Janapada Kalyani, when compared to the deities, is very much like that old
    monkey I saw previously.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Nanda&quot;, said Buddha, &quot;Remain happy as a
    bhikkhu! I promise you that you shall win one of the beauties you are seeing now.&quot;
    When the two came back from the abode of the Devas, Nanda Thera became diligent in the
    practice of priestly conduct in the fond hope that one day he would have his desire for a
    deity fulfilled.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now words went round the monastery that Nanda Thera was
    practising the dhamma with an eye to getting a beautiful deity for a wife. He was likened
    by his associates to a daily wage earner, or even a bonded slave, who worked for material
    benefits. He became greatly mortified. He secluded himself, bent his mind on the object of
    //kammatthana// and with the utmost effort and determination practised meditation till all
    //kilesas// dried up in his inner self. Ultimately he won the Path and its Fruition and
    became an Arahat.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The lesson to be gained from this story is that, before
    being able to note with mindfulness the sound that one hears, one tends to hear it again
    and again as one recalls it. Then it gets stuck to the mind. The mind takes in all
    //vedana//, sensations, conjured up by //tanha//, craving.</font></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">6. Tassa vaddhunti vedana, aneka
    saddasambhava. Abhijjha ca vihesa ca, citta massupahannati. Evam acinato dukkham, Ara
    Nibbana vuccati.</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">6. A multitude of passions such as covetousness
    and rage, springing from //sadda//, sound, torments him who takes a firm hold of it, with
    the consequence that his mind becomes burdened with vexation. Nibbana, therefore, remains
    far away from him who would carry the load of suffering rather than meditate.</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This needs no further elucidation as enough has been said
    about the attitude of mind on seeing, which, in the present context, may be substituted by
    hearing.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">MEDITATING ON SADDA BRINGS NIBBANA NEAR</font></strong></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">7. Na so rajjati saddesu, sadda sutva
    patissato. Virattacitto vedeti, tanca najjhosa titthati.</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">7. Passion remains undeveloped in him who
    recollects with mindfulness the //sadda// that he has heard. Thus freed from lust, he
    refuses to imbibe it.</font></strong></p>

    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">8. Listening to an ear-object, a yogi just hears
    it and just feels that he hears it, without assimilating //sadda//, created by it. With
    him suffering ceases. He should practise meditation in that way; and if he so practises
    it, he is said to be within sight of Nibbana.</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All these stanzas need no further elucidation, What has
    been said about seeing applies //mulatis mutandis// to hearing, and this also applies to
    summaries given in the form of aphorisms.</font></p>

    QUESTION III</font></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddha posed the following third question for Malukyaputta
    to answer.</font></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Ye te ghanavinneyya gandha aghayita
    aghayitapubba, na ca ghayasi, na ca te hoti ghayeyyanti, atthi te tattha chando va rago va
    pemam va.&quot;</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;How do you answer this, Malukyaputta? Answer
    me as best you can. There are certain odorous objects, //gandha//, which you have never
    smelled previously, either in the immediate or remote past, or even at the present moment.
    Neither can you hope to smell them in the future. Can such objects arouse desire, lust and
    affection in you?&quot;</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Malukyaputta replied that it was impossible for desire, or
    lust, or affection to arise out of //gandha// which had never been smelled or which one
    could never hope to smell in the future. As desire cannot be developed out of an unknown
    quality, it is not necessary for a yogi to meditate on it. But those failing to meditate
    on nose-object and nose-consciousness will remain removed from Nibbana.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">FAILURE TO MEDITATE ON GANDHA ON SMELLING</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddha, satisfied with Malukyaputta's answer, said,
    &quot;Sadhu!&quot; and uttered the four stanzas in the same manner as before.</font></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">9. Gandhim ghatva sati muttha, Piyam nimittam
    manasi karoto. Sarattacitto vedeti, tanca ajjhosa titthati.</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">9. Having smelled //gandha//, odour, one loses
    mindfulness, and getting absorbed in the charms created by it, one feels the onset of
    desire that tries to imbibe it.</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Meditating yogis can rarely enjoy fragrant smell. They are
    mainly concerned with disagreeable odour which they receive with repugnance. Therefore it
    is quite usual for them to have a longing for fragrance. This is attachment which makes
    one forgetful of the dhamma.</font></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">10. Tassa vaddhunti vedana, aneka
    gandhasambhava; Abhijjha ca vihesa ca, cittamassupahannati. Evam acinato dukkham, ara
    nibbana vuccati.</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">10. A multitude of passions such as covetousness
    and rage, springing from //gandha//, odour, torments him who takes a firm hold of it, with
    the consequence that his mind becomes burdened with vexation. Nibbana, therefore, remains
    far away from him who would carry the load of suffering rather than meditate.</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here, as previously, the emphasis is on the fact that
    failure to meditate keeps Nibbana away.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">MEDITATING ON GANDHA BRINGS NIBBANA NEAR</font></strong></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">11. Na so rajjati gandhesu, gandham ghatva
    patissato; Virattacitto vedeti, tanca najjhosa titthati.</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">11. Passion remains undeveloped in him who
    recollects with mindfulness the //gandha// that he has smelled. Thus freed from lust, he
    refuses to imbibe it.</font></strong></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">12. Yathassa ghayato gandham, sevato capi
    vedanam; Khiyati nopaciyati, evam so caratissato. Evam apacinato dukkham, santike nibbana
    vuccati.</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">12. Smelling a nose-object, a yogi just gets the
    smell and just feels that he gets it, without assimilating //gandha// created by it. With
    him suffering ceases. He should practise meditation in this way; and if he so practises
    it, he is said to be within sight of Nibbana.</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To wash your hands of //dukkha//, suffering, note with
    mindfulness everytime the sense of smell presents itself to your mind. Now I shall go onto
    the next subject relating to the sense of taste. It will show you how to practise
    Vipassana.</font></p>
