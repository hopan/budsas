    QUESTION IV</font></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddha posed the next question for Malukyaputta to answer.</font></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Ye te jivhavinneyya rasa asayita,
    asayitapubba, na ca sayasi, na ca te hoti sayeyyanti, atthi te tattha chando va rago va
    pemam va.&quot;</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;How do you answer this, Malukyaputta? Answer
    me as best you can. There are certain gustatory objects which you have never tasted
    previously, either in the immediate or remote past, or even at the present moment. Neither
    can you hope to taste them in the future. Can such objects arouse desire, lust and
    affection in you?&quot;</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here let me make a passing reference to human weakness for
    pleasures derived from the sense of taste. Those who have never tasted fruits and cakes
    imported from other countries have no desire to eat them since they do not have the
    experience of enjoying them. But people who know how tasteful they are develop a craving
    for them. In the scriptures there are many instances of people giving up their lives just
    to satisfy their palate. Defilements can be dispelled if one meditates on eating or
    tasting, noting the instant when taste just occurs.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>FAILURE TO MEDITATE ON RASA ON TASTING</strong></font></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">13. Rasam bhotva sati muttha, Piyam nimittam
    manasi karoto. Sarattacitto vedeti, tanca ajjhosa titthati.</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">13. Having tasted rasa, flavour, one loses
    mindfulness, and getting absorbed in the charms created by it, one feels the onset of
    desire that tries to imbibe it.</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Few ever meditate on eating and taste. Ordinary laymen are
    not aware of this practice of meditation. Even learned persons do not pay heed to it with
    the assumption that as one gets the taste of food as it is taken, there is no need to note
    it with mindfulness. This amounts to being irreverential to the teachings of
    insight-meditation. Others go so far as to say that meditating on taste is a sheer waste
    of time. Eating, they say, should be done quickly so that more time can be devoted to
    meditation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A majority of the meditating yogis also are guilty of this
    unmindfulness. Once they fail to note the sense of taste as they take food, they lose
    mindfulness and become attached to it. And that means they cherish the desire to enjoy
    pleasure out of eating.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All eatables, therefore, are prepared and cooked so that
    they are delicious to the taste. When laymen offer food to the monks they take especial
    care to make it appealing to the palate. This shows how much we give importance to the
    development of gustatory consciousness. I remember the observation made by the Sayadaw of
    Taungwaing Galay Taik Kyaung of Moulmein. Once he preached one of his devotees who offered
    food to him that it was usual for monks to partake of food offered to them with a sense of
    mindfulness which negates taste, as if what is delectable is repugnant. This drew a
    protest from the devotee who said, &quot;Reverend Sir! It is most improper that you should
    view tasteful objects that I have prepared for your enjoyment as repugnant.&quot; It is
    quite logical for him to say so, because food for the monks is usually prepared by donors
    so that recipients could eat them with relish. Here the preparation of food to appeal to
    the sense of taste of those who are going to eat it is the responsibility of the
    //dayaka//, the donor. For us monks we abide by the principle to regard what is tasteful
    as repugnant so that defilements cannot take their hold on us.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Priestly conduct, therefore, requires that when monks eat
    they eat with introspection in accordance with the principles of //paccavekkhana//,
    self-examination. Unlike laymen monks take food not for enjoyment, not for indulgence, not
    for physical development, and not for opulence, but for maintenance of the body, for
    supporting life, for quenching hunger and thirst and for pursuance of the practice of
    purity of mind. If one can practise //kammatthana// which prescribes concentration on the
    perception of the impurity of material food, //ahare patikulasanna//, it is all the more
    to be commended. Regarding this please see Visuddhi Magga. But for our purpose the best
    would be to go according to Satipatthana Sutta.</font></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">14. Tassa vaddhunti vedana, aneka
    rasasambhava; Abhijjha ca vihesa ca, cittamassupahannati. Evam acinato dukkham, ara
    Nibbana vuccati.</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">14. A multitude of passions such as covetousness
    and rage, springing from //rasa//, taste, torments him who takes a firm hold of it, with
    the consequence that his mind becomes burdened with vexation. Nibbana, therefore, remains
    far away from him who would carry the load of suffering rather than meditate.</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">No elaboration is needed beyond the fact that smell here
    is substituted by taste.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are three basic necessities in life - food, clothing
    and shelter. The whole world is teemed with hungry millions. The search for food is a
    great burden for them. People go hell for leather to get it. In the struggle for a living
    one tries to grab what one wants by all manner of means, fair or foul and one's anger is
    aroused when one encounters competitions or opposition from one's rivals. The result is a
    troubled mind for everyone. All these stem from the development of desire and attachment
    on the occasion of failure to meditate, in this case, on taste. When one is overpowered by
    defilements, one becomes tormented by kamma-actions and action-results that bring about
    the round of sufferings.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Most people do not care to meditate on food or on eating.
    It is almost a habit with them to keep food out of his meditating mind. This habit usually
    hardens. In that case they would be accumulating suffering which burns continually like
    fire for times to come.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>MEDITATING ON RASA BRINGS NIBBANA NEAR</strong></font></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">15. Na so rajjati rasesu, rasam bhotva
    patissato; Virattacitto vedeti, tanca najjhosa titthati.</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">15. Passion remains undeveloped in him who
    recollects with mindfulness the //rasa//, taste, that he has savoured. Thus freed from
    lust, he refuses to imbibe it.</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is a clear instruction to the yogi to apply
    insight-meditation to the phenomenon of tongue-consciousness as soon as food has been
    tasted. It does not say that taste that one has never experienced should be noted with
    mindfulness. I shall give you an example as to how to meditate on it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When a monk sits before the table and sees the eatables
    laid on it, he notes the phenomenon of seeing. As he raises his hand to pick up food, he
    notes his raising of the hand. As he takes a morsel of food in his hand, he notes that he
    is taking it. As it is brought towards his mouth, he notes that he is bringing it. As it
    touches his mouth, he notes the touching. As he opens his mouth, puts the food in it,
    closes it, brings his hand down, touches the plate with his hands, and in the meanwhile,
    masticates the food, he notes each of all these proceedings. As his hands move and as he
    masticates food, he is conscious of the fact that //vayo//, element of motion, is
    operating. As his hands touch the hot food, he is aware of the working of //tejo//,
    element of heat. When he feels sweet or sour on the tongue, he notes the qualities of
    taste. As he is thus noting all the phenomena connected with eating or tasting, he dispels
    desire, and eventually, lust or //raga//.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When his concentration gets strengthened, he knows taste
    only as taste and nothing more. It does not occur to him that a particular dish of chicken
    curry is delicious. It means that he has abandoned the pleasurable tongue-object; and in
    this manner he does away with defilements.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The experience of the yogis in this Thathana Yeiktha can
    bear it out. When a meditator eats, he becomes conscious of the fragrant smell and sweet
    taste that the food generates. But as soon as he feels that he has come to know of this
    phenomena, the smell, the taste, the nose and tongue-consciousness and the //citta//, mind
    that notes the consciousness, dissolve away. Under such circumstances //raga// has no
    opportunity to assert itself, for the yogi has cognized taste just as taste and nothing
    more. Some of the yogis used to say that as they had been noting the phenomena of tasting,
    they even failed to recognize the kind of flavour that the food gave. This is quite
    possible. For, in the absence of such defilements as desire and attachment, no pleasure
    can be derived out of the food that is taken. Where there is no attachment, one does not
    take a firm hold of //vedana//, feeling, as if one is going to devour it.</font></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">16. Yathassa sayato rasam, sevato capi
    vedanam; Khiyati nopaciyati, evam so caratissato. Evam apacinato dukkham, santike nibbana
    vuccati.</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">16. Tasting a tongue-object, a yogi just gets the
    taste, and just feels that he gets it without assimilating it. With him suffering ceases.
    He should practise meditation in this way; and if he so practises it, he is said to be
    within sight of Nibbana.</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A meditating yogi eats and feels the taste of food like
    any other individual; but as he denies himself the wherewithal to enjoy that taste, he
    does not commit either wholesome or unwholesome deeds in relation to taste. It means that
    taste here cannot bring about formation of Kamma-actions and action-results. Without them
    no new becoming can arise. And that will be the end of the round of sufferings.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Paticcasamuppada says: //Vedana paccaya tanha// (Feeling
    begets craving). But as no craving arises when feeling has subsided, //upadana//,
    clinging, remains unformed. Hence defilements, kamma-actions and action-results become
    inoperative.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As such causes of suffering are eliminated, a yogi,
    steadfast in the practice of insight meditation, attains to the stage of //tadanga
    Nibbana// when peace is established for the duration of that elimination. This can
    eventually lead to the fulfilment of the Noble Path and its Fruition.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>REALIZATION OF THE DHAMMA</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many examples are cited in the Commentaries regarding the
    attainment of Nibbana as one meditates on the phenomenon of eating. In Sri Lanka of the
    olden days, there were built many rest houses where monks on their daily rounds for alms
    could stop awhile to eat. It was usual for them to have their early morning gruel there,
    and set out for alms-food in the day, coming back again to the same place to have their
    full meal. Most of them practised insight-meditation while eating and became Arahats. In
    those days this was the general rule rather than the exception.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Commentaries on Puggalapannatti, the following
    occurs:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Making strenuous efforts in insight-meditation with
    the strength of implicit faith in it, an individual can realize the knowledge of the Path
    and its Fruition while walking, standing, sitting, lying down, or taking light food or
    heavy meals. No instances exist where he fails to attain wisdom when he so practises
    it.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I would like to urge you to note in detail the entire
    process of eating while you eat. If you are having your meals alone, this can be easily
    done. For each mouthful of food that you take, you may have about sixty incidents worth
    noting, and if you go on noting them, it may take you about an hour to finish your meals.
    But when you happen to eat along with others, this may not be possible; but I urge you to
    try.</font></p>

    <p><font COLOR="#7f007f"><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="vip5"></a>VIPASSANA QUESTION V</font></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fifth question put to Malukyaputta is as follows.</font></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Ye te kayavinneyya photthabba
    asamphuttha asamphutthapubba, na ca phusasi, na ca te hoti phuseyyanti, atthi te tattha
    chando va rago va pemam va.&quot;</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;How do you answer this, Malukyaputta? Answer
    me as best you can. There are certain tangible objects which you have never touched
    previously, either in the immediate or remote past, or at the present moment. Neither can
    you hope to touch them in the future. Can such objects arouse desire, lust and affection
    in you?&quot;</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Malukyaputta replied this in the negative. This is as it
    should be. Here it may again be emphasised that no //kilesa// can arise for sense-objects
    with which one is not familiar. Indigenous peoples develop no taste for foreign-made
    dresses which they have never seen before. The same analogy applies to friendship -- one
    never makes friends with people whom one has never met or seen before.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For most of us seeing or hearing is generally infrequent.
    We are not seeing or hearing things all the time. Since we are not occupied with eating
    all the time, tasting is also less frequent. Tactile sensations however, occur every now
    and then. They are far more prominent than other sensations. They may be felt even when
    one is sitting or standing still, or when eating or drinking. So we are always involved
    with contact, day in and day out. When yogis meditate, they usually meditate more on
    contact than on any other sense-objects.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Text says: //Gacchanto va gacchamiti pajanati// --
    Know that you are going when you go. When you note the act of walking -- extending legs,
    raising them up and putting them down, you are conscious of the entire movement connected
    with the process of walking. That means to say that the knowledge of walking has arisen,
    in which case let that knowledge remain as it is according to the instruction: //Mute
    mutamattam bhavissati// -- When you know, let that knowing be. Do not go any further than
    that. This meditation is on the activities of //vayo//, element of motion, although at
    times //tejo//, element of heat and //pathavi//, element of hardness, may get
    automatically involved. But what is to be concentrated upon is //vayo//.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Text further goes on to say: //Thito va thitomhiti
    pajanati; nisinno va nisinnomhiti pajanati -- Know that you are standing when you stand.
    Know that you are sitting when you sit. Here, too, you are being instructed to note the
    nature of //vayo//.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you are not satisfied with this method, note the
    activity of //vayo// by watching the rise and fall of the belly as you are standing,
    sitting or lying down.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>WHY MINDFULNESS ON RESPIRATION IS NOT SUGGESTED</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the ten //anussatis// or recollections,
    //anapanasati//, concentration on respiration, is included. It is concentration on
    breathing in and breathing out. Breathing is an act of //vayo//. It may now be asked why I
    do not make any suggestion to take up the exercise of breathing in and out. In my own
    opinion, I agree that //anapana// method could lead to the establishment of //vipassana
    nana//. But it must be noted that Visuddhi Magga puts it in the category of //samatha//,
    concentration, as distinct from //vipassana//, insight-meditation, when it enumerates the
    14 //kayanupassanas//, mindfulness of the physical body as follows:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The three chapters relating to the four postures,
    the four factors of knowledge and the four methods of fixing the mind on //dhatu//,
    primary elements, are said to fall under the category of //vipassana//,
    insight-meditation....Whereas the two chapters dealing with mindfulness on respiration and
    fixing the mind on loathsomeness of the physical body are said to fall under the category
    of //samatha//, concentration.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus it has been clearly and unequivocally stated that
    //anapana// belongs to //samadhi bhavana//, development of concentration, //samadhi
    kammatthana//, exercises in concentration. Therefore, if we advocate breathing exercises
    we would certainly be open to criticism that we are teaching not //vipassana// but
    //samatha kammatthana//, in which case we will be unable to make a rebuttal of the charge
    made without going against the teaching of Visuddhi Magga. But we allow those who would
    like to take up mindfulness on respiration to have their wish. We impose no restrictions
    on them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Patisambhida Magga and Visuddhi Magga are explicit on the
    point that, when doing breathing exercises, one must concentrate his mind on the nose
    without letting the mind follow the course of the stream of air breathed in. The object is
    to enable the meditator to develop //upacara samadhi//, approximate concentration, and
    //appana samadhi//, ecstatic concentration, to become enrapt in //jhana//. In the practice
    of insight-meditation, there is no restriction that directs the meditator to note only one
    phenomenon at a stretch. But if we instruct the meditator to note all the phenomena of
    contact that take place in various parts of the body while breathing in and out, we will
    again be open to the criticism that we are going against the two authorities that I have
    cited. These are the reasons why we refrain from encouraging meditators to indulge in
    //anapana// for insight-meditation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>MEDITATION ON ABDOMINAL MOVEMENTS CONFORMS TO
    CANONICAL INSTRUCTIONS</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It has been questioned if instructions to meditate on the
    rising and falling of the abdomen really conform to the requirements of the Pali Canon. It
    may be answered in the affirmative on the authority of Sallayatana Vagga Samyutta where it
    is stated that failure to note the arising and passing away of //nama// and //rupa// that
    come up at the six sense-doors results in the upsurgence of //kilesa//, while meditating
    on them brings Nibbana closer through the realization of the Path and its Fruition with
    the suppression of //kilesa//. The present Malukyaputta which I am discussing is also very
    clear on this point. I shall give reasons in support of the conformity.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Satipatthana teaching prescribes observing the four
    //dhatus//, it is advocating the observance of the apparent phenomena created by the four
    primary elements. Abdominal movements indicate the working of //vayo// to note which one
    fixes one's mind on one of the //dhatus// conforming to the requirement of //dhatu
    manasikara//. I prefer using ordinary language to highly technical Pali terms; and so,
    instead of saying //vayo dhatu//, I say the rising and falling movements of the abdomen.
    My employment of the ordinary conversational language agrees with Buddha's preference to
    simple speech when he gave the advice: //Gacchamiti pajanati//. As the yogi's
    concentration gets strong with the continued practice of insight-meditation, he will come
    to realize the nature of the element of motion represented by movements of the abdomen.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the authority of Satipatthana Sutta and other Suttas in
    Samyutta Nikaya, we also take it that a meditator should concentrate not only on the four
    postures usually mentioned in the scriptures but also on other postures or physical
    behaviour that can be met with in the ordinary course of nature.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If a yogi does not feel satisfied with noting the rising
    and falling of the abdomen, he can try with meditating on sitting as he sits, or on
    standing as he stands, or no lying down as he lies down. But we do not insist a yogi to
    practise //anapana// as we hold that it goes against statements in Visuddhi Magga and
    Commentaries on Satipatthana Sutta, which speak of insight-meditation after the attainment
    to the state of //jhana// through noting breathing in and breathing out. But we do not
    deter anybody from practising //anapana//. Now I shall revert to my original theme.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>FAILURE TO MEDITATE ON PHASSA ON TOUCHING</strong></font></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">17. Phassam phussa sati muttha, Piyam nimittam
    manasi karoto. Sarattacitto vedeti, tanca ajjhosa titthati.</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">17. Having touched //phassa//, tangible object,
    one loses mindfulness, and getting absorbed in the charms created by it, one feels the
    onset of desire that tries to imbibe it.</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Tactile sensations arise everywhere in the physical body.
    When a living body touches an inanimate object, such sensations arise. When limbs of the
    body touch one another, the same thing happens. Those are external sensations of touch.
    Likewise there are internal sensations which usually pass our notice. For instance, we are
    unaware of the fact that blood comes into contact with muscular tissues imbedded in the
    body. Those not used to the practice of //satipatthana// cannot take full note of the
    external senses of touch, let alone the internal. So when you practise meditation loosely,
    you are liable to be forgetful of the dhamma although you will be remembering the
    beautiful when you see beauty. It is human nature to hanker after pleasurable
    sense-objects; and when they are discovered you forget to note the arising and passing
    away of the aggregates. At times you may feel repugnant to disagreeable sights you see or
    disturbing sounds you hear. This also makes you to be forgetful of the dhamma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The five constituents of pleasure invite //kilesa// for
    all unmindful persons. Our way of living is one of enjoyment of pleasure. When we sleep on
    soft beds we are pleased with the comfort it gives. Latest fashions in dress give us a
    feeling of luxury. Even when we are doing the daily constitutional for health we are prone
    to get delighted with the thought that it is contributing to our body beautiful. All these
    delights and pleasures are a product of our surroundings which almost worship the five
    constituents of the senses. They generate //kilesa//. Nibbana remains far removed from
    those with a mind of defilements. Hence the following stanza.</font></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">18. Tassa vaddhunti vedana, aneka
    phassasambhava; Abhijjha ca vihesa ca, cittamassupahannati. Evam acinato dukkham, ara
    nibbana vuccati.</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">18. A multitude of passions such as covetousness
    and rage, springing from //phassa//, contact, torments him who takes a firm hold of it,
    with the consequence that his mind becomes burdened with vexation. Nibbana, therefore,
    remains far away from him who would carry the load of suffering rather than meditate.</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All that have been said about seeing, hearing, etc. apply
    to touching. What may be emphasised as usual is the fact that bowing to the wishes of
    //kilesa// one accumulates the mass of suffering which keeps one away from the path to
    Nibbana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>MEDITATION ON PHASSA BRINGS NIBBANA NEAR</strong></font></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">19. Na so rajjati phassesu, phassam phussa
    patissato; Virattacitto vedeti, tanca najjhosa titthati.</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">19. Passion remains undeveloped in him who
    recollects with mindfulness //phassa//, contact, that he has experienced. Thus freed from
    lust, he refuses to imbibe it.</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the course of meditating on the phenomenon of standing
    a yogi may feel tired or stuffy or painful or itchy. These are unpleasant sensations
    called //dukkha vedanas//. When they appear you must concentrate on the source of
    uncomfortableness and note in your mind the nature of tiredness or pain etc. As this
    constitutes meditating on //dukkha vedana//, this method is called //vedananupassana//.
    When you note heat that is generated, you meditate on //tejo//; and when you feel that you
    are touching a hard and rough surface, you meditate on //pathavi//. At times you may feel
    that the element of motion gets merged with the element of heat. You note this also and
    meditate on it. You may note every physical behaviour that occurs. You may bend or stretch
    your arms and legs. You may throw your head backwards and forwards. You may shut or open
    your eyes. You may wink. You may indulge in various kinds of movements as you dress, or as
    you wash your face, or as you take a bath. Even when you are urinating or evacuating your
    bowels, you must not forget to note the manifestation of //vayo//. With practice you may
    be able to note even speaking as you speak.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Our injunction to note the rise and fall of the belly is
    for the benefit of beginners in meditation. If he likes he can take up noting the
    respiration. But in our experience we have come to know that some who began the practice
    of breathing in and out endedup with meditating on the rise and fall of the belly, and
    that they did realize the dhamma. We used to instruct the yogi whose powers of
    concentration have strengthened to extend his method of meditation to noting all that
    happens at his six sense-doors.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When //raga// is abandoned through the practice of
    mindfulness, you will have no desire to grab //photthapha//, tactile sensation, and
    swallow it up.</font></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">20. Yathassa phusato phassam, sevato capi
    vedanam; Khiyati nopaciyati, evam so caratissato. Evam apacinato dukkham, santike nibbana
    vuccati.</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">20. On contact with a tangible object, a yogi just
    touches it and just gets the feeling of touch without assimilating //phassa//, created by
    the touch. With him suffering ceases. He should practise meditation in this way; and if he
    so practises it, he is said to be within sight of Nibbana.</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What has been discussed in the foregoing relating to other
    senses applies in the present case.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>NEGATION OF CORRECT METHOD</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Among us there are some dissidents who neither practise
    the dhamma nor accommodate others practising it. They reject the methods relating to
    meditation saying that as everybody has been aware of his own physical behaviour, it is
    unnecessary for him to note with mindfulness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The purpose of meditation is to prevent //kilesa// from
    arising from the time consciousness occurs in relation to sense-objects that actually come
    into contact with the sense-base. Meditation on things which have never been seen or heard
    is excluded. Dissidents, in their attempts to pass strictures on our method of teaching,
    maintain that noting the rise and fall of the belly is superfluous. This goes against what
    is prescribed in Malukyaputta Sutta or Maha Satipatthana Sutta. Everybody is aware that he
    breathes. It would be preposterous to say that he should be made to be unaware of his own
    breathing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who put forward the proposition that one should not
    meditate on this physical body or parts of it such as head, limbs, abdomen are going dead
    against Buddha's teaching. Perhaps they do so because they have never experienced insight
    knowledge. When you see and note //rupa// reflected by your own body, it perfectly accords
    with the instruction: //Rupam disva patissato// -- Note //rupa// when you see it. In the
    same way you must meditate on contact in accordance with the instruction: //Phassam phussa
    patissato// -- Note contact when you touch. There is nothing in the Pali Canon and their
    Commentaries to suggest that anyone is to be deterred from noting his physical behaviour.
    All sense-bases, sense-objects and sense-consciousness originate in the body, and if we
    are to be prevented from noting them, it will go against the teaching. Those who advocate
    such ideas are preaching adhamma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I give below the method of insight-meditation in brief:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Note every time //rupa// and //nama// arise. This will
    lead you to gaining knowledge about their causes and effects. In the end you will
    recognize the Three Marks of //anicca//, impermanence, //dukkha//, suffering or
    unsatisfactoriness, and //anatta//, unsubstantiality. He who practises in this manner can
    enter Nibbana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now I shall give you the task laid down by Buddha
    regarding meditation on mind-objects that cause mind-consciousness to arise.</font></p>

    va pemam va.&quot;</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;How do you understand this, Malukyaputta?
    Answer me as best you can. There are certain mind-objects, //dhamma//, which you have
    never apperceived previously, either in the immediate or remote past, or even at the
    present moment. Neither can you hope to apperceive them in the future. Can such objects
    arouse desire, lust and affection in you?&quot;</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As before Malukyaputta answered this in the negative, and
    Buddha laid down the task for him to practise insight-meditation. For a summary of what
    Buddha taught him, please refer to the earlier section entitled &quot;A Brief
    Work-Programme&quot;.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>FAILURE TO MEDITATE ON MIND-OBJECT ON THINKING</strong></font></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">21. Dhammam natva sati muttha, Piyam nimittam
    manasi karoto. Sarattacitto vedeti, tanca ajjhosa titthati.</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">21. Having thought of //dhamma//, mind-object, one
    loses mindfulness, and getting absorbed in the charms created by it, one feels the onset
    of desire that tries to imbibe it.</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here the term //dhamma// meaning mind-object, is not used
    in the //paramattha// or abstract sense. It relates to the six bases of eye, ear, nose,
    tongue, body and heart. It creates the idea of male or female. It embraces the material
    qualities of life and nutrition. It includes all concepts of humanity or divinity and of
    animals like cattle, etc. and of things like pots and pans, and of places like houses. All
    sense-objects, whether real or imaginary, are //dhammas//. When ordinary individuals see
    things that exist in nature, they recognize them by concepts as trees, forests and
    mountains. Those accomplished in //sammasana nana//, investigating knowledge, and
    //udayabbaya nana//, knowledge of arising and dissolution of conditioned things, often see
    in their mind's eye visions of deities, Arahats and Buddhas, besides seeing real objects
    in flesh and blood. In whatever way they are seen, the individual who sees them develops
    attachment or repugnance in accordance with his feelings of agreeableness or
    disagreeableness. Once these //vedanas// arise, he becomes forgetful of the practice of
    meditation, virtually assimilating, or ingesting, or imbibing what he sees. Then
    //kilesa// arises. This is explained in the following stanza.</font></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">22. Tassa vaddhunti vedana, aneka dhamma
    sambhava; Abhijjha ca vihesa ca, cittamassupahannati. Evam acinato dukkham, ara nibbana
    vuccati.</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">22. A multitude of passions such as covetousness
    and rage, springing from //dhamma//, mind-object, torments him who takes a firm hold of
    it, with the consequence that his mind becomes burdened with vexation. Nibbana, therefore,
    remains far away from him who would carry the load of suffering rather than meditate.</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This shows the darker side of the life of a non-meditator.
    There is a brighter side for the meditating yogis, and this is given in the following
    stanza.</font></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">23. Na so rajjati dhammesu, dhammam natva
    patissato; Virattacitto vedeti, tanca najjhosa titthati.</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">23. Passion remains undeveloped in him who
    recollects with mindfulness the //dhamma//, mind-object, that he has apperceived. Thus
    freed from lust, he refuses to imbibe it.</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here //dhammas//, or, in other words, //dhammarammanas//,
    mind-objects, are not //paramatthas// but //pannattis//. But mind-consciousness is
    //paramattha//. It comprises thoughts and ideas created by the mind-object. It appears,
    and disappears the next moment after its appearance. It is //anicca//, impermanence. When
    a yogi sees an object in his mind and notes it mindfully, it disappears as soon as it has
    been noted. What actually happens is the disappearance of mind-consciousness that
    constitutes //nama//. As the observer is intent upon the object, he loses sight of
    //citta// or //nama// created by it. As he notes it in this manner, no attachment arises
    in his mind. In other words, mindfulness dispels //raga//, lust or passion. In such
    circumstances consciousness just takes place. It does not go beyond that. This is in
    accordance with the statement: //Vinnatam vinnanamatta bhavissati// -- When you know, let
    knowing be. If one fails to meditate on the mind-object, //vedana//, feeling, arises to
    incite //kilesa//.</font></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">24. Yathassa janato dhammam, sevato capi
    vedanam; Khiyati nopaciyatam, evam so caratissato. Evam apacinato dukkham, santiko nibbana
    vuccati.</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">24. Thinking of a mind-object, a yogi just knows
    it and just feels that he knows it, without assimilating //dhamma// created by it. With
    him suffering ceases. He should practise meditation in this way; and if he so practises
    it, he is said to be within sight of Nibbana.</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">An idea must be noted as it is formed so that inclination
    to //kilesa// can have no opportunity to arise. When the round of //kilesa// ceases, other
    rounds of kamma-actions and action-results also cease; and that particular moment of
    cessation of all kinds of defilements rewards the meditator with peaceful bliss; and that
    moment is the moment of //tadanga nibbana//. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Be it noted that Nibbana is within easy reach of everyone
    who practises insight-meditation. Conversely, it remains aloof from a non-meditator.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="epi"></a>EPILOGUE</font></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Having uttered the 24 stanzas, Buddha concluded saying;</font></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Imassa kho Malukyaputta maya samkhittena
    bhasitassa evam vittharena attho datthabbo.&quot;</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I have, Malukyaputta, given you a very
    succinct account of the method of noting the sense-objects, and you must try to understand
    the wider meaning of it according to the 24 gathas that have now been explained.&quot;</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Rejoicing in what Buddha taught, Malukyaputta expressed
    his satisfaction, paid his homage to the Blessed One and departed. Then he retired to a
    place of solitude, applied himself with mindfulness, zeal and singleness of purpose to the
    practice of meditation, and, not long after, enjoyed the fruits of the sanctity of
    //Brahmacariya// (noble conduct), having gained insight on the spot. Now he had come face
    to face with Truth. For him no new becoming could arise. He had abided in the holiness of
    the Eightfold Noble Path, having done all there was to be done, leaving nothing undone.
    And all this he knew. Now our Malukyaputta had become an Arahat.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once when Buddha was in Savatthi for his daily round for
    alms, he was approached by a monk by the name of Bahiya Daruciriya who insisted that the
    Enlightened One prescribe for him a brief religious instruction. Buddha, therefore,
    advised him to note seeing just as he saw, hearing just as he heard, knowing just as he
    knew, and thinking just as he thought in relation to sense-objects he encountered. These
    are his words:</font></p>
    <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Ditthe ditthamattam bhavissati; sute
    sutamattam bhavissati; mute mutamattam bhavissati, vinnate vinnanamattam bhavissati.&quot;</font></strong></em></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this Malukyaputta Sutta, the instructions are the same.
    And so this method of vipassana to note with mindfulness every time the phenomena of
    sight, sound, odour, taste, touch and consciousness occur is far-reaching although very
    brief. For nearly forty years since 1300 B.E. (c. 1938 A.D.) I have been preaching this
    sermon for the enlightenment of thousands of devotees relating to the subjects of the
    Noble Path and its Fruition and of //paccavekkhana nana//, knowledge on self-examination.
    I believe many among them have by now come to realize knowledge that can lead them to the
    Path and its Fruition.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now I shall wind up this discourse with a wish and a
    prayer, sharing merits we have performed in relation to charity, morality and mental
    development to our parents, relatives and well-wishers present here, to all humanity, to
    all devas and to all sentient beings in the whole universe. May they rejoice in these
    //kusala// wholesome actions, and gain happiness both in mind and in body!</font></p>
