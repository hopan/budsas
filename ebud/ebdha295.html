      <TD WIDTH="100%"><FONT SIZE="6">I</FONT>n the past several decades, 
      Buddhism has captured the popular imagination in the West with the image 
      of a serene Buddha sitting imperturbably in meditation—motionless, silent, 
      free from thought. How popular would the image be if the Buddha were 
      wearing glasses that slid down his nose as he pored over a text to discern 
      its intricate meaning?<P>All Buddhist traditions agree that the Buddha’s 
      realization is beyond words and books, and yet the Buddha tells us in the
      <I>Diamond Sutra</I> that untold merit will accrue from memorizing even 
      one stanza from the sutra and sharing it with others. In fact, all 
      Buddhist traditions regard texts as sacred. They all draw on a rich 
      library of sutras, commentaries, biographies, songs, chants, lists and 
      diagrams. The intricate psychological analyses contained in the Abhidharma 
      alone fill many volumes. What is the purpose of these teachings? Is it 
      necessary to study them in order to inform and deepen meditation practice? 
      Can one achieve realization through study alone or, conversely, is it 
      possible to achieve realization without any study at all? Do some people 
      “study Buddhism” while others practice it?</P>
      <P>Prior to the 1960’s, Buddhism in the West was largely an intellectual 
      and academic enterprise. Early commentators frequently fit Buddhism into 
      Western religious and philosophical frameworks, making study of authentic 
      Buddhism difficult. Then, during the countercultural revolution that 
      sprang up in the sixties, new adherents of Buddhism sought enlightenment 
      experiences. Nirvana, satori, kensho—these were the watchwords of the day. 
      For many, the study of Buddhism and the adoption of its ethical framework 
      smacked of the traditions they were rebelling against. They sought 
      something that was deeper than words and doctrines.</P>
      <P>Forty years later, many Buddhist institutions have established 
      themselves in the West. Early students have discovered that enlightenment 
      does not come merely at the drop of a flower. As more and more students 
      recognize that sitting by itself does not lead to direct realization for 
      most people, teachers are finding there is a renewed interest in the study 
      of Buddhism. This has created the need to adapt the curricula of 
      Buddhism’s ancient traditions to today’s practitioners, many of whom are 
      not following the monastic lifestyle that previously supported in-depth 
      study.</P>
      <P>At the center of Buddhist study is the cultivation of prajna, 
      discriminating awareness. Without it, any peacefulness attained in 
      meditation may remain superficial. But how is the cultivation of prajna 
      any different from conventional intellectual pursuits? Is there a core 
      curriculum for Buddhism? Is it necessary for a practitioner of Buddhism to 
      know precisely what the Buddha taught—to understand dependent origination, 
      non-ego, emptiness and all the rest—before meditation practice can give 
      way to deep realization? Given that Buddhist realization is beyond words 
      and concepts—the tools we must use to study—how precisely does study aid 
      in bringing about the enlightenment exemplified by the Buddha? </P>
      <P ALIGN="center">-ooOoo-</P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000080"><I><STRONG>Buddhadharma</STRONG><B>: Buddhism is 
      known as a tradition that places great value on meditative experience and 
      yet it is replete with doctrines and teachings. There are also a number of 
      distinct traditions of Buddhist study. In light of that, how important is 
      study to the practice of Buddhism? </B></I></FONT></P>
      <P><STRONG>Bhante Gunaratana</STRONG>: In the Theravada tradition, there 
      are two systems: one is typically academic and the other is monastic and 
      meditative. There has been debate in the past between these two. Since the 
      academicians were very erudite speakers, they of course won the debate. 
      But in reality it is the practice that survives. That is what has made 
      Buddhism survive up to this date. Our ideal situation is to have good 
      knowledge of the dhamma and a good amount of practice, combined 
      together—there must be a balance. We cannot do one at the expense of the 
      other.</P>
      <P>That being said, there has been a problem in the West in that many 
      people don&#39;t study the dhamma. They think that they can learn dhamma by 
      focusing the mind on breathing and doing nothing else. They have no 
      knowledge of what the Buddha taught. People who are neglecting study are 
      not that spiritually mature, though, and until their perfections are 
      complete, they need to know what the Buddha taught. </P>
      <P>When we start learning meditation, we all come across situations where 
      we get confused. We don&#39;t really know how to solve the problems we 
      encounter. So then we have to look at the texts and see how Buddha solved 
      those problems. Before he had any enlightenment, he was very much like us. 
      He always had problems, just like we have, and whenever he had problems, 
      he found a solution. Since we are not enlightened, when we have a problem 
      we must go to see the way the Buddha solved his problems. This is how 
      knowledge of dhamma comes in handy when we do the practice. If we don&#39;t 
      have any knowledge of dhamma, we get completely bewildered, confused and 
      come out with wrong views and wrong understanding. Therefore, my position 
      is that there must be a good knowledge of at least the theory of 
      meditation and that must be balanced with good practice.</P>
      <P><STRONG>John Daido Loori</STRONG>: The Zen tradition is probably the 
      one best known for special transmission outside of words and letters, a 
      direct pointing to the human mind and realization of buddhahood derived 
      from Bodhidharma, around 500 CE. That special transmission has for the 
      most part defined Zen in both China and Japan. In fact, I&#39;ve actually 
      studied in Rinzai monasteries where the library was locked most of the 
      time, and people were discouraged from putting too much emphasis on words 
      and letters.</P>
      <P>However, I&#39;ve found that because we&#39;re not in a Buddhist culture in 
      America, people know very little if anything about Buddhism, so it is 
      necessary to include a pretty comprehensive training in academic study. At 
      Zen Mountain Monastery, our Eight Gates of training, which is for all 
      students, includes a good dose of what we call &quot;academic study.&quot; This is 
      not only for the monastics but also for lay practitioners. There are, of 
      course, different types of study for monastics and lay practitioners 
      because they need to know different sorts of things. </P>
      <P>The tendency of students in the West has been, when they hear certain 
      words and terms in Buddhism, to equate those with the Judeo-Christian 
      tradition, which is what we&#39;re familiar with. As a result, they can come 
      to conclusions that aren&#39;t accurate. So, in addition to studying the 
      sutras that are important to Zen training—such as the <I>Prajnaparamita</I>,
      <I>Lankavatara, Avatamsaka, Pundarika </I>and<I> Vimalakirti</I> sutras—we 
      also study the Abhidharma teachings and some of the sutras from Theravada 
      Buddhism, because these are sutras that were taken up by some of the 
      ancient Zen masters, such as Dogen. We also have Buddhist Studies, which 
      pays particular regard to &quot;Buddhist philosophy&quot; and provides a little bit 
      about its history. The monastics are required to study comparative 
      religion and they also do tantric studies.</P>
      <P>In Zen Buddhism there was a traditional saying that &quot;painted 
      cakes&quot;—that is, words—&quot;do not satisfy hunger.&quot; Dogen, in the thirteenth 
      century, said painted cakes do indeed satisfy hunger, and aside from 
      painted cakes there&#39;s no way to satisfy hunger. So he took a very 
      different point of view from that normally found in Zen. In our order, the 
      Mountains and Rivers Order, academic study is part of the training 
      curriculum for all students—residents, non-residents, lay practitioners 
      and monastics.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Georges Dreyfus</STRONG>: I would distinguish pretty sharply 
      between what has been done traditionally in Asia and what&#39;s been done in 
      the modern West, and even in some sectors of modern society in Asia. In 
      the Tibetan tradition, one can distinguish two main approaches: one where 
      establishing the view precedes meditation practice (“from the view looking 
      through meditation”) and one where the view arises from meditation 
      practice (“looking for the view through meditation”). The first is a 
      classical, scholastic approach in which one first studies and then one 
      practices. The second one is reserved for a few people who, under the 
      guidance of a teacher, practice meditation without extensive study and 
      then attempt to gain realization in that way.</P>
      <P>Contrary to what is often thought, the more scholastic approach is 
      found in all four traditions of Tibetan Buddhism. It&#39;s not the case that 
      one tradition does this approach well and the other does that approach 
      well. In fact, the dominant approach has been the one laid out by 
      Bhante—studying extensively and from there trying to meditate and gain 
      realization.</P>
      <P>There are, however, in all traditions, people who have dispensed with 
      study and have more resolutely attempted to gain realization without much 
      study. The point that Daido Loori Roshi made is very relevant. It&#39;s quite 
      misleading to take these rare examples of people from traditional cultures 
      gaining realization without extensive study and apply these to modern 
      Western practitioners. In the Tibetan tradition, the dominant model by far 
      is the first one, where one first studies and then practices. This would 
      also be a good model for the West. Among the various Tibetan groups 
      operating in the West, an evolving question has concerned what type of 
      curriculum to use. More and more groups have developed curricula of 
      varying complexity and sophistication that attempt to provide knowledge of 
      basic Buddhist culture and Buddhist philosophy. This gives Western 
      students an orientation to basic Buddhist culture that they do not have 
      access to through their own cultural background.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Christina Feldman</STRONG>: My experience is drawn mainly from 
      two traditions. When I first began to practice in the Gelukpa tradition, I 
      anticipated being immediately introduced into great tantric initiations 
      and so forth, but my teacher at that time didn&#39;t encourage much meditation 
      practice at all. The emphasis was much more on the scholastic, academic 
      understanding of Buddhist philosophy. Meditation was introduced slowly. 
      After a time, I began to train more in the Theravadan meditation 
      community, where there was something of a reversal going on at that time. 
      The emphasis in Theravada was more on direct, intuitive experience. I 
      found these to be quite radically different approaches. Having made my 
      home more within the Theravadin tradition, and particularly the meditative 
      tradition, it&#39;s been interesting for me to see how the question of the 
      relationship between practice and study has been evolving. </P>
      <P>I guide students based on an intensive meditative tradition, but that 
      doesn&#39;t mean teaching is absent. Within that context, there&#39;s a great deal 
      of teaching of Buddhist philosophy—<I>sila, samadhi, panna</I>. But it has 
      also been evolving in other directions. Here in England, for example, I&#39;ve 
      been part of Sharpham College. There we present a wider understanding of 
      Buddhist teaching, and I&#39;m currently running a two-year study program for 
      a group of people here. We had sixty applications for the first year, but 
      the program is limited to twenty people. We initiated this program to 
      address a thirst for understanding that I sense in people, many of whom 
      began with intensive meditation experience. They seem to want to put that 
      experience into a meaningful context.</P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000080"><I><STRONG>Buddhadharma</STRONG><B>: Each of you 
      has discussed curricula being offered to Western students, but do you also 
      find that there has been some resistance to study? </B></I></FONT></P>
      <P><STRONG>Bhante Gunaratana</STRONG>: Things have changed from forty or 
      even twenty years ago. Those were the days when people were tired of 
      pursuing an academic career, going to university and getting degrees. Many 
      of them were the ones who became interested in meditation, and they were 
      also the ones who wanted to attain enlightenment very quickly, and who 
      therefore did not think academic study was that important. Of course, when 
      it comes to Buddhist learning, we are not talking about secular academic 
      degrees or qualifications but rather simple learning. More than ever 
      before, it is true that people have begun to realize the importance of 
      learning dhamma. Though there still are some students who think all they 
      have to do is meditation, among the students who practice with us, most 
      are very interested in learning the dhamma.</P>
      <P><STRONG>John Daido Loori</STRONG>: I haven&#39;t experienced that 
      resistance to academic study. In the early days it was a different story; 
      twenty-five or thirty years ago, the student body was quite different from 
      what it is today. Most students these days are professionals of one type 
      or another. They&#39;re college-educated. They&#39;re accustomed to studying. They 
      tend to want to intellectualize things. That&#39;s why the balance is so 
      important. So at Zen Mountain, academic study is just one of eight gates. 
      Zazen, sitting meditation, is the core of the whole thing. Liturgy is an 
      important gate. Ethical teaching is an important gate. Body practice is an 
      important gate. Face-to-face teaching with the teacher is also important. 
      These things all balance themselves out.</P>
      <P>Academic study is a required part of the daily routine during our 
      ninety-day intensives, although people both in residence and at home can 
      select to do the academic study or not. By and large, they choose to do 
      it, because they&#39;re much more comfortable with it than they are with the 
      mysterious realms of sitting meditation, where they don&#39;t have any kind of 
      reference system. With study, it&#39;s something they can nail down. The 
      reason that it wasn&#39;t part of our regular training when I started, I 
      think, had mostly to do with the teacher. I trained with a Japanese master 
      whose command of English was pretty good, but not extensive, so 
      complicated discussions of Buddhist metaphysics were something that just 
      didn&#39;t come up. There was a lot more emphasis on the practical aspects of 
      Zen: sit, work, do the liturgy.</P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000080"><I><STRONG>Buddhadharma</STRONG><B>: Did this 
      also reflect the training that your teacher came out of?</B></I></FONT></P>
      <P><STRONG>John Daido Loori</STRONG>: Yes, because in the training he came 
      out of, most Soto monks are ordained when they&#39;re eleven years old and 
      grow up in a family temple. By the time they are ready to go to high 
      school or college, they&#39;ve been working in the temple, assisting the 
      teacher, doing the liturgy. They are familiar with the language of 
      Buddhism from an early age. Then, they go to Buddhist university and get 
      the equivalent of a Masters degree in Buddhist studies, before they do 
      their intensive stay of two or three years at a training monastery. When 
      they walk into a training monastery they already have a good foundation in 
      Buddhist studies, liturgy and moral teachings, so their focus is more on 
      the practical aspects at that stage.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Georges Dreyfus</STRONG>: In the Tibetan tradition, you have an 
      even more traditional society. Most monks would become ordained in a small 
      village monastery where they would learn basic literacy, ritual and so on. 
      Many of them would then spend time in a more central monastery, where they 
      would receive scholastic training. In all the schools of Tibetan Buddhism, 
      the elite of practitioners—not always, but usually—get some form of 
      scholastic training when they are in their middle or late teens. After 
      that, they may go back to the monastery or they may start a more intensive 
      meditative practice. By the time they start on their meditative career, 
      they have already had several years of systematic scholastic training.</P>
      <P>If I were to compare Nyingma, Kagyü and Geluk, what&#39;s most different is 
      not that one school studies and the other does not. It&#39;s mostly the way 
      they study that differs. The Geluk put more emphasis on debate and the 
      study is longer. The Kagyü and Nyingma put less emphasis on debate and 
      more emphasis on textual study, and the period of study tends to be 
      shorter. There are certainly differences between the schools, but it would 
      not be accurate to say that the Geluk study and the other schools don&#39;t. 
      Many Nyingma scholars I know would be very insulted if things were 
      described in this way.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Christina Feldman</STRONG>: I would agree with Bhante and Daido 
      Loori that twenty to twenty-five years ago one encountered a lot of 
      resistance to study in the West. There was a belief system that valued 
      transcendent mystical experience above everything else—as a kind of fast 
      track to enlightenment. I do think that kind of thinking has changed 
      considerably over the years. Many Westerners who are practicing now have a 
      great deal of respect for investigation as a means to awakening. They have 
      found that investigation is not just about having an experience, but that 
      it&#39;s a much broader, much deeper, much vaster way of coming to understand 
      the dharma.</P>
      <P>I do sense sometimes as I encounter people that there are two schools 
      of thought, although I would acknowledge some convergence between the two. 
      One we could call the &quot;meditation&quot; school, where people think &quot;this is 
      it.&quot; They sit on a cushion, they walk, they practice, and this is 
      essentially what they&#39;re looking for. It fulfills their expectations. It 
      fulfills their needs, their wishes. The other school is the &quot;dharma&quot; 
      school, in which meditation plays a part but it is a part of a larger 
      picture, which is <I>sila</I>, <I>samadhi</I> and <I>panna</I>. My sense 
      at the moment is that the &quot;dharma&quot; school is becoming much more prominent 
      than the school that only values inner experience.</P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000080"><I><STRONG>Buddhadharma</STRONG><B>: Since there 
      are many more lay practitioners than monastics in the West, is there a 
      different course of study that is appropriate for laypeople?</B></I></FONT></P>
      <P><STRONG>Bhante Gunaratana</STRONG>: Whether people are monastics or lay 
      practitioners, there are three levels of development: <I>pariyati</I>, 
      learning what is taught by the Buddha; <I>pattipati</I>, putting it into 
      practice; and <I>pattivedha</I>, realizing. We can do these three at the 
      same time. We don&#39;t have to spend a great deal of time studying first, and 
      then start practicing, and then go on to realizing. As we learn, we 
      practice and we realize. This is the Buddha&#39;s scheme and it is good for 
      both monastics and householders. Some people are so busy, however, that 
      they have become very impatient. They want to achieve something very 
      quickly; therefore, they overlook the first two steps, learning and 
      practicing. They want to realize very quickly. That is the general problem 
      most people face, whether Western or Eastern, so I have been suggesting to 
      monastics and some laypeople that they must follow a curriculum of very 
      rigorous book study. There also has to be ongoing daily practice and that 
      can be followed by anybody without too much academic or rigorous book 
      study. </P>
      <P>These days there are all kinds of modern technologies invented for 
      communication and learning that can be used by laypeople in everyday life. 
      Of course, these are often used for wrongdoing, but I suggest to people 
      that they use them for their own development. In the early morning, 
      instead of listening to all kinds of negative, destructive, painful news, 
      they can start the day with what we call <I>dharmacitta. </I>When the 
      alarm goes off, they can listen to a beautiful, peaceful message of the 
      Buddha. They can wake up to a message about metta, compassion, joy and 
      equanimity, for example. They could keep that with them all day as an 
      object of contemplation. This way we can bring the Buddha&#39;s message into 
      our daily life, in addition to our meditation. Contemplation itself is 
      meditation, because we incorporate the message into our life. These 
      messages must be kept alive in our daily life, in our thoughts, words and 
      deeds. In my upbringing, long before we even knew our alphabet, we knew a 
      lot of Pali chanting and dharma verses from our tradition. The very first 
      thing we heard when we woke up in the morning was our parents reciting 
      something very beautiful, very peaceful, wishing goodwill, peace, solace 
      and comfort for the world.</P>
      <P>The teachings of the Buddha are very practical. The noble eightfold 
      path is not a theory; it is practice. We have to learn to put the 
      teachings into practice. Somebody can philosophize about the teachings, 
      can psychologize about the teachings, but what Buddha taught is a real and 
      practical.</P>
      <P><STRONG>John Daido Loori</STRONG>: Because most people lead very busy 
      lives, many of them will gravitate to the kind of training that just 
      requires sitting fifteen minutes a day or visiting a center once a month 
      to sit or listen to a talk. For example, we have a Sunday program, and it 
      fills a niche in many people&#39;s lives, replacing the Sabbath. That&#39;s the 
      only time we see them, though. They never really enter into training. They 
      come in, they sit for two periods, listen to a talk, have a community 
      lunch and that&#39;s their dose of Buddhism for the week. There are other lay 
      practitioners who are a lot more serious and decide to become students. 
      They&#39;re required to make a commitment not only to meditation practice but 
      also to engage in our program, the Eight Gates of Zen. We track them and 
      we keep student records. After a period of time, we can tell just by 
      reviewing the records what they need to give more attention to. If we find 
      out that they&#39;re just paying dues and not being active, we tell them to 
      save their money and not continue.</P>
      <P>There&#39;s a whole spectrum of students, then, from monastics, who have 
      made a lifetime commitment and will live, die and be buried at the 
      monastery, to lay practitioners who have families and jobs and a very 
      limited amount of time—and everything in between. A realistic training 
      program has to address the needs of this very diverse group. We try to do 
      that by using many different venues, so the training doesn&#39;t only take 
      place at the monastery. It&#39;s on the Web, it&#39;s in journals and books, and 
      it’s available through affiliate groups around the country.</P>
      <P>Also, whether the students are lay or monastic, they need to be clear 
      about what they are committing to. If people are looking for psychological 
      counseling, they should see a psychologist. If they are looking for 
      physical well-being, they should go to a health spa. If, however, they 
      come with a question—Who am I? What is life? What is death?—then they’re 
      asking religious questions, and that’s what we do. That’s what we’re 
      trained for and that’s what we can help them with. Physical and 
      psychological well-being may be by-products, but the initial force for 
      studying and practicing Buddhism must be religious.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Christina Feldman</STRONG>: This is something I&#39;ve been 
      discussing at some length with students on retreats. My sense is that, 
      historically, a dedicated, vigorous religious life was considered to be 
      the territory of monastics, those who had renounced the world. Currently 
      we have a different paradigm. We have a very large lay community trying to 
      find a way to lead a dedicated spiritual life in the midst of a very busy 
      lay life. There has never been a blueprint for how to do this. My sense is 
      that there is a very powerful link between rigor and inspiration. If 
      people feel inspired, a great deal of effort and commitment comes out of 
      that inspiration. It&#39;s a spiritual commitment, and as Daido Loori was just 
      saying, a religious commitment.</P>
      <P>The current role of many meditative communities is not merely to teach 
      people how to sit on the cushion; it&#39;s about how to nurture and cultivate 
      the necessary level of inspiration, so that people find the way to be 
      rigorous and dedicated. In the study program I mentioned earlier, we 
      mentor people throughout the two-year period. They also have homework they 
      have to turn in that is not simply testing knowledge; it is reflective, 
      applied homework. The reports we are getting from the mentors tell us that 
      this study process is nurturing inspiration. People are making far more 
      effort in their practice and the application of the practice than they did 
      previously when they were only attending meditation retreats.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Georges Dreyfus</STRONG>: The Tibetan tradition is in 
      transition. It is a very complex tradition and it has moved pretty 
      abruptly from being situated in a very traditional society to the modern 
      West and exile in India. The various Tibetan Buddhist groups are trying to 
      deal with this transition by developing curricula for this new kind of 
      mostly-lay student, but this is still a work in progress. Even how Western 
      monks should be educated is still not a completely clear and settled 
      question. </P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000080"><I><STRONG>Buddhadharma</STRONG><B>: Do you 
      believe, then, that a philosophical tradition as ancient and complex as 
      Tibetan Buddhism can be adapted without &quot;dumbing down&quot;?</B></I></FONT></P>
      <P><STRONG>Georges Dreyfus</STRONG>: Yes it is adaptable, but it&#39;s not 
      going to be easy, and it&#39;s not going to be quick. Until recently, 
      Westerners have dealt mostly with people who were completely steeped in a 
      traditional culture, who have had less sense of what is required in a 
      modern context. The transition we are talking about does not just involve 
      Tibetans and Westerners, it&#39;s also among Tibetans, who have gone through 
      the trauma of invasion, destruction and exile. How is the Tibetan 
      tradition of learning going to survive and transform when Tibetan society 
      modernizes and changes? I guess we have to be optimistic. Buddhism is, 
      after all, an export product. It remakes itself in very different social 
      and cultural contexts.</P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000080"><I><STRONG>Buddhadharma</STRONG><B>: Finally, how 
      does study, as opposed to meditation practice, contribute to realization?</B></I></FONT></P>
      <P><STRONG>John Daido Loori</STRONG>: We make a mistake if we regard 
      realization as being within the province of either one or the other, 
      meditation or academic study, or for that matter, limit it to Buddhism. 
      I&#39;ve never regarded realization to be solely within the province of 
      Buddhism. There are just too many great historical beings, such as John of 
      the Cross or Theresa of Avila—even Walt Whitman, for that matter—who have 
      clearly had some kind of an awakening, some kind of a realization, some 
      sense of what we in Buddhism would call kensho or satori. That can happen 
      outside of the context of Buddhism. It&#39;s happened probably more so within 
      Buddhism because there&#39;s a specific drive to do that, but it can happen 
      with study or without study. If someone has no understanding of Buddhism, 
      has no awareness of Buddhist teachings, and has some kind of a 
      realization, they may be a little bit lost. But they will have experienced 
      the nature of the self, the nature of the universe. They will understand 
      them clearly.</P>
      <P>Of course, having some kind of a context to fit that into is very 
      helpful. Then it becomes a rational thing, not so odd. I had a dharma 
      sister about fifty years ago who as a child experienced kensho. Her 
      parents thought she was insane and sent her to psychologists. It wasn&#39;t 
      until she was forty years old that she met a Zen master who examined her 
      and decided that what she had experienced was actually an awakening, a 
      realization. She wasn&#39;t a Buddhist. The Sixth Ancestor of Zen wasn&#39;t a 
      Buddhist. He wasn’t even literate, and yet he realized himself. All of the 
      schools of Zen trace their lineage back to him.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Christina Feldman</STRONG>: People tend to transfer the 
      patterns of their lives and their minds both to how they meditate and how 
      they study. There are different ways of approaching study. There are 
      different ways of approaching meditation. They can be approached in a 
      materialistic way, as a way of accumulating more concepts or more 
      meditation experiences. They can be approached in a greedy way. Meditation 
      and study are both means to transform those habitual patterns of mind. 
      Even though our initial approaches may not be so skilled or even so 
      wholesome, they can be transformed through the simple willingness to 
      begin. Then both meditation and study can be approached in a very 
      reflective way. Approaching study in a very reflective way, sitting with 
      some teaching as one would with a koan, can be a way to bring the mind to 
      great stillness and receptivity. At the same time, approaching meditation 
      in a very reflective, investigative way can open us to levels of 
      understanding not previously accessible.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Georges Dreyfus</STRONG>: A great deal depends on how one 
      studies. It&#39;s very important that the study remain connected to practice 
      as much as possible. When I was in the monastery I remember our teachers 
      constantly emphasizing that, because it&#39;s so possible to go astray. It’s 
      also important to be clear about what study means. Study traditionally 
      means <I>hearing</I>, <I>reflecting</I> and <I>meditating</I>. At the 
      basis of hearing, or studying, there is considerable emphasis on 
      memorizing the text one is studying. That way one owns the text, imbuing 
      oneself physically with the words, rather than leaving them in one&#39;s 
      notebook. Once these texts are memorized, one can reflectively go through 
      the most important ideas, and then develop meditation on that basis. 
      Indeed, though, different people gain different things from different 
      aspects of the tradition. A great deal of insight can be attained in study 
      and a great deal of understanding can be developed through practice. Once 
      again, it is important to balance study and meditation, which is the 
      mainstream of the Buddhist tradition, while recognizing that individuals, 
      based on their particular dispositions, may benefit more from one aspect 
      or the other. </P>
