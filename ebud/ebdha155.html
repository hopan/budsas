    face="Times New Roman"><strong>THE HIGH ESTEEM OF ABHIDHAMMA IN BUDDHIST TRADITION</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Abhidhamma Pitaka, or the Philosophical Collection,
    forms the third great section of the Buddhist Pali Canon (Tipitaka). In its most
    characteristic parts it is a system of classifications, analytical enumerations and
    definitions, with no discursive treatment of the subject matter. In particular its two
    important books, the Dhammasangani and the Patthana, have the appearance of huge
    collections of systematically arranged tabulations, accompanied by definitions of the
    terms used in the tables. This, one would expect, is a type of literature scarcely likely
    to gain much popular appreciation, yet there is the fact that the Abhidhamma was, and is,
    highly esteemed and even venerated in the countries of Theravada Buddhism.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Two examples taken from the chronicles of Ceylon
    illustrate that high regard for the Abhidhamma. In the 10th century A.C. on the order of
    king Kassapa V of Ceylon, the whole Abhidhamma Pitaka was inscribed on gold plates, and
    the first of these books, the Dhammasangani, was set with jewels. When the work was
    completed, the precious manuscripts were taken in a huge procession to a beautiful
    monastery and deposited there. Another king of Ceylon, Vijaya Bahu (11th century), used to
    study the Dhammasangani in the early morning before he took up his royal duties, and he
    prepared a translation of it into Sinhalese, which however has not been preserved.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What were the reasons for such an extraordinary esteem for
    material that appears at first glance to consist of no more than dry and unattractive text
    books? And what actual importance do the two basic works of the Abhidhamma in particular,
    the Dhammasangani and the Patthana, still have today? These are the questions that we
    shall attempt to answer here.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In considering the reasons for this high esteem and regard
    for the Abhidhamma, we may leave aside any manifestation of faith, more or less
    unquestioning, that evokes in the devotee a certain awe owing to the very abstruseness and
    bulk of these books. That apart, we may find a first explanation in the immediate
    impression on susceptible minds that they are faced here by a gigantic edifice of
    penetrative insight, which in its foundations and its lay-out cannot well be ascribed to a
    lesser mind than that of a Buddha; and this first impression will find growing
    confirmation in the gradual process of comprehending these teachings.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the Theravada tradition the Abhidhamma is the
    domain proper of the Buddhas (//Buddha-visaya//), and its initial conception in the
    Master's mind (//manasa desana//), according to the //Atthasalini//, is traced to the time
    immediately after the Great Enlightenment. It was in the fourth of the seven weeks spent
    by the Master in the environ of the Bodhi tree that the Abhidhamma was conceived. These
    seven days were called by the teachers of old 'The Week of the House of Gems
    (//ratana-ghara-sattaha//)'. 'The House of Gems' is indeed a very befitting expression for
    the crystal-clear edifice of Abhidhamma-thought in which the Buddha dwelt during that
    period.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>THE ABHIDHAMMA AS SYSTEM AND
    METHOD</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who have an eye for the ingenious and the
    significant in the architecture of great edifices of thought will probably be impressed
    first by the Abhidhamma's structural qualities, its wide compass, its inner consistency,
    and its far-reaching implications. The Abhidhamma offers an impressive systematisation of
    the whole of reality as far as it is of concern to man's liberation from passion and
    suffering, and the way thereto; for it deals with actuality from an exclusively ethical
    and psychological view-point, and with a definite practical purpose.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A very striking and deeply impressive feature of the
    Abhidhamma is the analysis of the entire realm of consciousness. It is the first time in
    the history of human thought that this was undertaken so thoroughly and realistically,
    without admixture of any metaphysics and mythology. This system provides a method by which
    the enormous welter of facts included or implied in it, can be subordinated to, and be
    utilized by, the //liberating// function of knowledge, which in the Buddha's teaching is
    the essential task and the greatest value of true understanding. This organizing and
    mustering of knowledge for such a purpose cannot fail to appeal to the practical thinker.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Abhidhamma may also be regarded as a systematisation
    of the doctrines contained, or implied, in the Sutta-Pitaka, the Collection of Discourses.
    It formulates these Sutta-doctrines in strictly philosophical (//paramattha//) or truly
    realistic (//yatha-bhuta//) language that as far as possible employs terms of a function
    or process without any of the conventional (//vohara//) and unrealistic concepts assuming
    a personality, an agent (as different from the act), a soul or a substance.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These remarks about the systematising import of the
    Abhidhamma may perhaps create the impression in the reader that the Abhidhamma is no more
    than 'a mere method with only a formalistic function'. Leaving aside the fact that this is
    not so, as we shall see later, let us first quote, against this somewhat belittling
    attitude, a word of Nietzsche, himself certainly no friend of rigid systematisation:
    'Scientific spirit rests upon insight into the method'.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For the preeminently practical needs of the Buddhist the
    Abhidhamma fulfils the requirements stated by Bertrand Russell 'A complete description of
    the existing world would require not only a catalogue of things, but also a mention of all
    their qualities and relations' ('//Our Knowledge of the External World//'). A systematical
    'catalogue of things' together with their qualities, or better 'functions', is given in
    the first book of the Abhidhamma, the Dhammasangani, a title that could well be rendered
    by 'A Catalogue (or Compendium) of Things'; and the relations, or the conditionality, of
    these things are treated in the Patthana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some who deem themselves 'strong-minded' have called
    systems 'a refuge of feeble minds'. It is to be admitted that the conceptual labels
    supplied by systems (and also in Abhidhamma) have often been misused as a surrogate for
    the true comprehension of a changing, and not at all rigid, world. But if cautiously and
    critically used, it is precisely one of the advantages of systematic thought that it
    provides, as it were, 'weapons of defence', means of protection , against the overwhelming
    assault of innumerable internal and external impressions on the human mind. This unceasing
    influx of impressions, by sheer weight of number and diversity alone, has an influence,
    even on 'strong minds', that tends to be either overpowering and fascinating, or
    confusing, intimidating, distracting, even dissolving, unless this vast world of plurality
    (//papanca//) is at least partly assimilated by the human mind with the help of systematic
    and methodical thought. But systems may also be 'aggressive weapons' when wielded by a
    mind that through its power of understanding tries to control and master the numerous
    experiences, actions and reactions occurring in man's inner and outer world, subordinating
    them to his own purpose.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Abhidhamma system, however, is not concerned with an
    artificial abstract world of 'objects in themselves'. In so far as it deals with external
    facts at all, the respective concepts refer to the relation of those 'external facts' to
    the bondage or liberation of the human mind; or they are terms auxiliary to the tasks of
    the understanding and mental training connected with the work of liberation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The basically dynamic character of the Abhidhamma system,
    and of the concepts it employs, goes far in preventing both rigidity and any artificial
    simplification of a complex and ever-changing world - the faults that those inimical to
    them find in all 'systems'.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">System and method bring order, coherence and meaning into
    what often appears to be a world of isolated facts which only becomes amenable to the
    purposes of man by a methodical approach. This holds true for the system of the Abhidhamma
    too, in regard to the highest purpose; man's liberation from ignorance and suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>CLARIFICATION OF TERMS</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many thinkers of all times and climes have insisted that a
    clarification of concepts and terms must be the basis of all realistic and successful
    thought, action, and, as Kungfutse says, even of government. But as shown by the
    widespread confusion of ideas throughout the centuries, this has been neglected in nearly
    all branches of life and thought - a fact responsible for much of man's unhappiness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is another evidence of the scientific spirit of the
    Abhidhamma that the definition of its terms and of their range of application occupies a
    very prominent place. In particular, the Dhammasangani is essentially a book of
    classifications and definitions. In addition, a very elaborate and cautious delimitation
    of terms is given in the sixth book of Abhidhamma the 'Yamaka', which to our modern taste
    appears even over-elaborate and over-cautious in that respect.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Suttas, serving mainly the purpose of offering
    guidance for the actual daily life of the disciple, are mostly (though not entirely)
    couched in terms of conventional language (//vohara-vacana//), making reference to
    persons, their qualities, possessions, etc. In the Abhidhamma, this Sutta terminology is
    turned into correct functional forms of thought, which accord with the true 'impersonal'
    and everchanging nature of actuality; and in that strict, or highest, sense
    (//paramattha//) the main tenets of the Dhamma are explained.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While vague definitions and loosely used terms are like
    blunt tools unfit to do the work they are meant for, while concepts based on wrong notions
    will necessarily beg the question to be scrutinized and will thus prejudice the issue, the
    use of appropriate and carefully tempered conceptual tools will greatly facilitate the
    quest for liberating knowledge, and is an indispensable condition of success in that
    quest.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hence the fact that Abhidhamma literature is a rich source
    of exact terminology, is a feature not to be underestimated.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>ANALYSIS OF CONSCIOUSNESS</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the Abhidhamma's most important contributions to
    human thought, though still insufficiently known and utilized, is the analysis and
    classification of consciousness undertaken in the first of the //Dhammasangani//. Here the
    human mind, so evanescent and elusive, has for the first time been subjected to a
    comprehensive, thorough and unprejudiced scrutiny, which definitely disposes of the notion
    that any kind of static unity or underlying substance can be traced in mind. However, the
    basic ethical lay-out and purpose of this psychology effectively prevents conclusions of
    ethical materialism or theoretical and practical amoralism being derived from its
    realistic and unmetaphysical analysis of mind.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The method of investigation applied in the Abhidhamma is
    //inductive//, being based exclusively on an unprejudiced and subtle introspective
    observation of mental processes. The procedure used in the //Dhammasangani// for the
    analysis of consciousness is precisely that postulated by the English philosopher and
    mathematician, A. N. Whitehead: 'It is impossible to over-emphasize the point that the key
    to the process of induction, as used either in science or in our ordinary life, is to be
    found in the right understanding of the immediate occasion of knowledge in its full
    concreteness...In any occasion of cognition, that which is known is an actual occasion of
    experience, as diversified by reference to a realm of entities which transcend that
    immediate occasion in that they have analogous or different connections with other
    occasions of experience' ('Science and the Modern World').</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Whitehead's term 'occasion' corresponds to the Abhidhamma
    concept //samaya// (time, occasion, conjunction of circumstances), which occurs in all
    principal paragraphs of the //Dhammasangani//, and there denotes the starting point of the
    analysis. The term receives a detailed and very instructive treatment in the Atthasalini
    the commentary to the aforementioned work.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha succeeded in reducing this 'immediate occasion'
    of an act of cognition to a single moment of consciousness, which, however, in its
    subtlety and evanescence, cannot be observed, directly and separately, by a mind untrained
    in introspective meditation. Just as the minute living beings in the microcosm of a drop
    of water become visible only through a microscope, so, too, the exceedingly short-lived
    processes in the world of mind become cognizable only with the help of a very subtle
    instrument of mental scrutiny, and that only obtains as a result of meditative training.
    None but the kind of introspective mindfulness or attention (//sati//) that has acquired,
    in meditative absorption, a high degree of inner equipoise, purity and firmness
    (//upekkha-sati-parisuddhi//), will possess the keenness, subtlety and quickness of
    cognitive response required for such delicate mental microscopy. Without that meditative
    preparation only the way of inference from comparisons between various complete or
    fragmentary series of thought moments will be open as a means of research. But this
    approach too may yield important and reliable results, if cautious and intelligent use is
    made of one's own introspective results and of the psychological data of meditative
    experience found in Sutta and Abhidhamma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the //Anupada Sutta// (Majjhima Nikaya 111) it is
    reported that the Venerable Sariputta Thera, after rising from meditative absorption
    (jhana) was able to analyse the respective jhanic consciousness into its constituent
    mental factors. This may be regarded as a precursor of the more detailed analysis given in
    the Dhammasangani.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let us listen to a voice from Indian antiquity
    appreciating the difficulty of that analytical work and the greatness of its achievement.
    We read in the 'Questions of King Milinda'; &quot;A difficult feat indeed was
    accomplished, O great King, by the Exalted One&quot; -- &quot;Which was that difficult
    feat, O venerable Nagasena?&quot; - &quot;The Exalted One, O king, has accomplished a
    difficult task when he analysed a mental process having a single object as consisting of
    consciousness with its concomitants, as follows: 'This is sense-impression, this is
    feeling, perception, volition, consciousness.&quot; - &quot;Give an illustration of it,
    venerable sir&quot; - &quot;Suppose, O king, a man has gone to the sea by boat and takes
    with the hollow of his hand a little sea water and tastes it. Will this man know, 'This is
    water from the Ganges, this is water from such other rivers as Jamuna, Aciravati
    etc.?&quot; - &quot;He can hardly know that.&quot; - &quot;But a still more difficult
    task, O king, was accomplished by the Exalted One when he analysed a mental process having
    a single object, as consisting of consciousness with its concomitants.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The rather terse and abstract form in which the
    //Dhammasangani// presents its subject matter, the analysis of mind, should not mislead
    the reader into making him believe that he is confronted with a typical product of late
    scholastic thought. When, in the course of closer study, he notices the admirable inner
    consistency of the system, and gradually becomes aware of many of its subtle points and
    far-reaching implications, he will become convinced that at least the fundamental outlines
    and the key notes of Abhidhamma psychology must be the result of a profound intuition
    gained through direct and penetrative introspection. It will appear to him increasingly
    improbable that the essence of the Abhidhamma should be the product of a cumbersome
    process of discursive thinking and artificial thought-constructions. This impression of
    the essentially intuitive origin of the Abhidhammic mind-doctrine will also strengthen his
    conviction that the elements of the //Dhammasangani// and the //Patthana// must be
    ascribed to the Buddha himself and his early great and holy disciples. What is called
    'scholastic thought', which has its merit in its own sphere and does not deserve wholesale
    condemnation, may have had its share later in formulating, elaborating and codifying the
    teachings concerned.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we turn from the Abhidhamma to the highest contemporary
    achievements of non-Buddhist Indian thought in the field of mind and 'soul', i.e. the
    early Upanishads and the early Samkhya, we find that apart from single great intuitions,
    they teem with mythological ritualistic terms, and with abstract speculative concepts.
    Against that background the realistic sober and scientific spirit of Abhidhamma psychology
    (or its nucleus extant in the Sutta period) must have stood out very strongly. To those
    who could appreciate the import of that contrast, it will have sufficed to instil that
    high esteem and admiration for the Abhidhamma of which we have spoken.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But even if compared with most of the later psychological
    teachings of the East or the West, the distance from Abhidhamma psychology remains
    fundamentally the same, for only the Buddha's teaching on mind keeps entirely free from
    the notions of self, ego, soul, or any other permanent entity in, or behind, mind.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>THE ANATTA-DOCTRINE</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is on this very doctrine of Non-self (//anatta//) that
    all Abhidhamma thought converges and this is where it culminates. The elaborate and
    thorough treatment of Anatta is also the most important //practical// contribution of the
    Abhidhamma to the progress of the Buddha's disciple towards liberation. The Abhidhamma
    provides him with ample material for his meditations in the field of insight
    (//vipassana//), concerning Impermanence and Impersonality, and this material has been
    analysed down to the subtlest point and is couched in strictly philosophical language.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There will certainly be many to whom the degree of
    analytical details found in the Suttas will be quite enough for them to understand Anatta,
    and sufficient for their use in meditative practice. But there are also minds that require
    repeated and varied demonstration and illustration of a truth before they are entirely
    satisfied and convinced. There are also others who wish to push their analysis to the
    greatest detail possible and to extend it to the very smallest unit accessible; in order
    to make quite sure that even the realm of the infinitesimal, of the material and psychical
    'atoms', does not hide any self or abiding substance. To such minds the Abhidhamma will be
    of great value. But also those who, in general, are satisfied with the expositions in the
    Suttas, may sometimes wish to investigate more closely a particular point that has roused
    their interest or presents difficulties. To them too the Abhidhamma will prove helpful.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Besides helping such individual cases, the Abhidhamma will
    in general render valuable aid in the slow and difficult change of thought and outlook
    from the view-point of 'self' to that of 'non-self'. Having once grasped intellectually
    the doctrine of non-self, one can certainly succeed in applying it to theoretical and
    practical issues if only one remembers it in time and deliberately directs one's thoughts
    and volitions accordingly. But except for such deliberate directing of thought, which in
    most cases will be relatively rare, the mind will continue to move in the old-accustomed
    ruts of 'I' and 'mine', 'self' and 'substance', which are deeply ingrained in our daily
    language and our modes of thinking; and our actions too will still continue to be
    frequently governed by our ancient egocentric impulses. An occasional intellectual assent
    to the true outlook of Anatta will not effect great changes in that situation. The only
    remedy is for bad or wrong habits of action, speech and thinking to be gradually replaced
    by good and correct habits until the latter become as spontaneous as the former are now.
    It is therefore necessary that right thinking, that is, thinking in terms of Anatta, is
    made the subject of regular and systematic mental training until the power of wrong habits
    of thought is reduced and finally broken. The Abhidhamma in general, and in particular the
    various Triads and Dyads of terms as listed in the //Matika//, 'Schedule', of the
    Abhidhamma Pitaka, provide ample material for such 'fluency exercises' of right thinking.
    Familiarity with the application of the 'impersonal' view-point of the Abhidhamma and with
    the terminology by which it is expressed will exercise a considerable formative influence
    on the mind.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>ABHIDHAMMA AND MEDITATION</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A fertile soil for the origin and persistence of beliefs
    and ideas about a self, soul, god or any other form of an absolute entity, is
    //misinterpreted meditative experience// occurring in devotional rapture or mystical
    trance. Such experience is generally interpreted by the mystic or theologian as revelation
    of, or union with, a godhead; or it is taken for a manifestation of man's true and eternal
    Self. Such interpretations are conceived and accepted all the more readily since such
    meditative experience so greatly transcends the average level of consciousness that the
    temptation is very great, indeed, to connect it in some way or other with a deity or some
    other eternal principle. The overwhelming impact of such meditative experience on the mind
    will produce a strong feeling of certainty of its reality and superiority; and this strong
    feeling of assurance will be extended to the theological or speculative interpretation,
    too. In that way these interpretations will obtain a strong hold on the mind, for they are
    imagined to correspond with actual, irrefutable experience, while, in fact, they are only
    superimposed on the latter.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The analytical method of the Abhidhamma gives immunity
    against such deceptive interpretations. In the //Dhammasangani// the consciousness of
    meditative absorption (//jhana//) is subjected to the same sober analysis as the ordinary
    states of mind. It is shown that meditative consciousness, too, is a transitory
    combination of impermanent, conditioned and impersonal mental factors, which differ from
    their counterparts accompanying ordinary consciousness, only in their greater intensity
    and purity. They do not, therefore, warrant at all any assumption of a divine
    manifestation or an eternal Self. It has already been mentioned how the Venerable
    Sariputta undertook such an analysis of his meditative experience.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is characteristic of the spirit of the Buddha's
    teaching that the disciple is always advised to follow up his meditative absorption by an
    analytical retrospection (//paccavekkhana//) on the mental states just experienced,
    comprehending them by Insight (//vipassana//) as impersonal, evanescent, and therefore not
    to be adhered to.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">By so doing, three main defilements of the mind
    (//kilesa//) are effectively warded off, which otherwise may easily arise along with the
    overwhelming impact of meditative experience on the mind:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1) Craving (//tanha//) for these experiences, clinging to
      them and longing for them for their own sake (//jhana-nikanti//, 'indulgence in Jhana');</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">2) the False View (//ditthi//) that these meditative
      experiences imply a self or a deity;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">3) the Conceit (//mana//) that may arise through having
      attained these exalted states.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These remarks refer to the division of Buddhist meditation
    called Development of Tranquillity (//samatha-bhavana//), aiming at the attainment of
    Jhana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Turning now to the Development of Insight
    (//vipassana-bhavana//), the classificatory terms of the Abhidhamma Schedule (//matika//),
    as explained in the //Dhammasangani//, etc., provide numerous possibilities for including
    in them the various particular subjects of Insight. By such reference to the triads or
    dyads of terms in the Schedule a limited subject of Insight can easily be connected with
    the entire world of actuality, and will thereby gain in significance. Such a particular
    subject of Insight may either be deliberately chosen from the traditional subjects of
    meditation (//kammatthana//) or may consist in some incidental occurrence in life. The
    latter again may be either some deeply stirring inner or outer experience or it may be
    quite an ordinary happening of every-day life taken as an object of Right Mindfulness and
    Clear Comprehension (//sati-sampajanna//), as is often reported of meditating monks of
    old. The impulse to deep religious commotion (//samvega//) or the stimulation for Insight
    derived from such incidental events may be easier retained, utilized and extended to
    general, universal significance, if that event can be referred at once to one of the
    triads or dyads of Abhidhammic terms, which comprise the entire actuality. Thus a single
    act of penetrative understanding starting from a limited object may acquire such
    intensity, width and depth as to either lead to, or effectively prepare for, that
    liberating Insight of which a great Buddhist thinker has said:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">'The understanding of one single thing means the
    understanding of all; the voidness of one single thing is the voidness of all.' - Aryadeva
    (Catuhsataka, v.191).</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>KNOWLEDGE OF ABHIDHAMMA, A
    REQUIREMENT FOR THE PREACHER AND TEACHER OF DHAMMA</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The preceding pages will have shown the importance of the
    Abhidhamma for clarity of thought, for correct understanding of actuality, and for
    individual inner progress. Yet as far as those are concerned whose life is devoted
    exclusively to the realisation of Deliverance, a knowledge of the Abhidhamma, at least in
    the sense of the seven books so called, might well be regarded as optional. But it is
    different for those who wish to teach and explain the Dhamma to others. Here a familiarity
    with the Abhidhamma is deemed quite indispensable by the Theravada tradition. We read in
    the //Atthasalini//: 'Only monks who are proficient in Abhidhamma can be regarded as
    'preachers of Dhamma (//dhammakathika//)'. Others, even if they actually engage in
    preaching, cannot truly be so called. When giving a doctrinal exposition, they may, for
    instance, mix up the various kinds of karma and karmic results or the various factors
    found when analysing body and mind. But those proficient in Abhidhamma do not make such
    mistakes.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Features that make the Abhidhamma so important for
    teachers of the Dhamma are especially these: systematisation of the huge amount of
    doctrinal material contained in the Sutta Pitaka; education in orderly and methodical
    thinking; clarification of terms; proficiency in, and habituation to, the application of
    the view-point of ultimate truth (//paramattha//) to various subjects of thought and
    situations of life; mastery of doctrinal detail.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>THE EVALUATION OF ABHIDHAMMA AND
    THE QUESTION OF ITS AUTHENTICITY</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even in olden days opinions about the Abhidhamma Pitaka
    moved between the extremes of unquestioning veneration and entire repudiation. Very early
    there were doubts about the authenticity of the Abhidhamma Pitaka as genuine Buddha word.
    The early sect of the Sautrantikas regarded, as their name indicates, only Sutta and
    Vinaya as canonical, but not the Abhidhamma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It may have been a follower of that sect who is introduced
    in the //Atthasalini// as criticising the Abhidhamma lecture of a monk thus: 'You have
    quoted, O preacher, a long Sutta that seems to girdle Mount Meru. What is the name of it?'
    - 'It is an Abhidhamma Sutta.' - 'But why did you quote an Abhidhamma Sutta? Is it not
    befitting to cite a Sutta that has been proclaimed by the Buddha?' - 'And by whom do you
    think the Abhidhamma was proclaimed?' - 'It was not proclaimed by the Buddha.' Thereupon
    that monk is severely rebuked by the preacher, and after that the //Atthasalini//
    continues: 'He who excludes the Abhidhamma (from the Buddha-Word) damages the Conqueror's
    Wheel of Dhamma (//jina-cakkam paharam deti//). He excludes thereby the Omniscience of the
    Tathagata and impoverishes the grounds of the Master's Knowledge of Self-confidence'
    (//vesarajja-nana// to which Omniscience belongs); he deceives an audience anxious to
    learn; he obstructs (progress to) the Noble Paths of Holiness; he makes all the eighteen
    causes of discord appear at once. By so doing he deserves the disciplinary punishment of
    temporary segregation, or the reproof of the assembly of monks.' This very severe attitude
    seems somewhat extreme, but it may be explained as a defensive reaction against sectarian
    tendencies at that period.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The main arguments of Theravada against those who deny the
    authenticity of the Abhidhamma, are as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1) The Buddha has to be regarded as the first
      Abhidhammika, because, according to the //Atthasalini//, 'he had already penetrated the
      Abhidhamma when sitting under the tree of Enlightenment.'</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">2) 'The Abhidhamma, the ultimate doctrine, is the domain
      of the omniscient Buddhas only, not the domain of others' (Asl). These profound teachings
      are unmistakably the property of an enlightened being, a Buddha. To deny this is as
      senseless as stealing the horse of a World Ruler, unique in its excellency, or any other
      possession of his, and showing oneself in public with it. And why? Because they obviously
      belong to and are befitting for a king (Asl).</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even to non-Buddhists who do not regard the Buddha as an
    omniscient Enlightened One, but recognize him as a great and profound thinker it should
    appear improbable that the Buddha would have remained unaware of the philosophical and
    psychological implications of his teachings, even if he did not speak of them at the very
    start and to all his followers. Considering the undeniable profundity of the Abhidhamma,
    the world-wide horizons of that gigantic system, and the inexhaustible impulses to thought
    which it offers - in view of all this it seems much more probable that at least the basic
    teachings of Abhidhamma derive from that highest intuition that the Buddha calls
    //Samma-sambodhi//, Perfect Enlightenment. It appears therefore a quite credible as well
    as a reasonable and cautious statement when the old Theravada tradition ascribes the
    fundamental intuitions and the framework of the Abhidhamma (not more than that) to the
    Buddha himself. A quite different question, of course, is the origin of the codified
    Abhidhamma literature as we have it at present. But this problem cannot be dealt with
    here, and in any case the sources and facts at our disposal do not allow very much to be
    said about it with any definiteness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Theravada tradition holds that the Buddha preached the
    Abhidhamma first to the assembled gods of the Tavatimsa heaven, headed by his mother.
    After that, having returned to earth again, he conveyed the bare method to the Arahat
    Sariputta. Whatever one may think about this tradition, whether, as the devout Eastern
    Buddhist does, one regards it as a historical account, or whether one takes it as a
    significant legend, one fact emerges fairly clearly from it; the originators of this very
    early tradition did not assume the Abhidhamma texts to have been expounded by the Buddha
    to human beings in the same way and as literally as the Sutta texts. If one wishes to give
    a psychological interpretation to that traditional account, one might say that the sojourn
    in the world of gods may refer to periods of intense contemplation transcending the
    reaches of an earth-bound mentality; and that from the heights of that contemplation its
    fundamental teachings were brought back to the world of normal human consciousness and
    handed over to philosophically gifted disciples like the Venerable Sariputta.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In a comparative evaluation of Abhidhamma and Sutta texts,
    the fact is often overlooked - which, however, has been repeatedly stressed by the
    Venerable Nyanatiloka-Mahathera - that the Sutta Pitaka too contains a considerable amount
    of pure Abhidhamma. This comprises all those numerous Suttas and passages where ultimate
    (//paramattha//) terms are used, expressing the impersonal (//anatta//) or functional way
    of thinking, for example, when dealing with the khandhas, dhatus, ayatanas, etc.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One also frequently hears the question asked whether the
    Abhidhamma is necessary for a full understanding of the Dhamma or for final liberation. In
    this general form, the question is not quite adequately put. Even in the Sutta Pitaka many
    different methods of practice, many 'gates' to the understanding of the same four Truths
    and to the final goal, Nibbana, are shown. Not all of them are 'necessary' or suitable in
    their entirety for all individual disciples, who will make their personal choice among
    these various methods of approach according to circumstances, inclination and growing
    maturity. The same holds true for the Abhidhamma both as a whole and in its single aspects
    and teachings.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><strong>CONCLUDING REMARKS AND A WARNING</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Taking a middle path between overrating or underrating the
    Abhidhamma, we may say: The Abhidhammic parts of the Sutta, namely the teachings given
    there in ultimate (//paramattha//) terms, are certainly indispensable for the
    understanding and practice of the Dhamma; and the additional explanations of these
    teachings given in the Abhidhamma proper may prove very helpful, and in some cases even
    necessary, for both these purposes. As to the codified Abhidhamma Pitaka, familiarity with
    all its details is certainly not a general necessity; but if it is studied and knowledge
    of it is applied in the way briefly indicated in these pages, this will surely richly
    enhance a true understanding of actuality and aid the work of liberation. Also, if
    suitably presented, the Abhidhamma can provide for philosophical minds a stimulating
    approach to the Dhamma that will prove helpful to them provided they take care to
    compensate it adequately with the practical aspects of the Dhamma. Such an approach to the
    Dhamma should certainly not be blocked by the wholesale disparagement of Abhidhamma study
    sometimes found nowadays among Buddhists of the West, and even of the East. Dangers of
    one-sided emphasis and development lurk not only in the Abhidhamma but also in other ways
    of approach to the Dhamma, and they cannot be entirely avoided until a very high level of
    harmonious integration of mental qualities has been attained (cf. the 'Balance of the Five
    Spiritual Faculties'; //indriya-samata//).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To be sure, without an earnest attempt to apply the
    Abhidhamma teachings in such ways as intimated above, they may easily become a rigid
    system of lifeless concepts. Like other philosophical systems, the Abhidhamma can very
    easily lead to dogmatic and superstitious belief in words, for example, to the opinion
    that one really knows something about an object of cognition if one tacks a conceptual
    label on to it. The study of the Abhidhamma should therefore not be allowed to degenerate
    to a mere collecting, counting and arranging of such conceptual labels. In that way,
    Abhidhamma study (but, of course, not the Abhidhamma itself) would become just one more
    among the many existing intellectual 'play-things' which serve as an escape from facing
    stark reality, or as a 'respectable excuse' with which to try and evade hard work for
    one's own inner progress towards liberation, for which purpose alone the Abhidhamma is
    meant. A merely abstract and conceptual approach to the Abhidhamma may also lead to that
    kind of intellectual pride which often goes together with specialised knowledge.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If these pitfalls are avoided, there is a good chance that
    the Abhidhamma may again become a living force which stimulates thought and aids the
    meditative endeavour for the mind's liberation. To achieve that, it is necessary, however,
    that the Abhidhamma teachings, which are extremely condensed in parts, are not merely
    accepted and transmitted verbally, but that they are carefully examined and contemplated
    in their philosophical and practical implications. This again requires the devotion of
    searching and imaginative minds; and as they will have to work on neglected and difficult
    ground, they should not lack the courage to make initial mistakes, which can be rectified
    by discussion and constant reference to the teachings of the Sutta Pitaka.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As to the relation of the teachings of the Abhidhamma to
    those of the Sutta Pitaka, two very apt comparisons given in a conversation by the late
    Venerable Pelene Vajiranana, Maha-Nayakathera of Vajirarama, Colombo, may be added, in
    conclusion:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Abhidhamma is like a powerful magnifying-glass, but
    the understanding gained from the Suttas is the eye itself, which performs the act of
    seeing. Again, the Abhidhamma is like a medicine container with a label giving an exact
    analysis of the medicine; but the knowledge gained from the Suttas is the medicine itself
    which alone is able to cure the illness and its symptoms, namely craving rooted in
    ignorance, and the suffering caused by it./.</font></p>
