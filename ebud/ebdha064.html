<blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although Theravada Buddhism is
    known more widely than before nowadays, there are still some
    misunderstandings concerning it. There are still people who
    believe and say (or rather write) that Theravada is for
    Arahantship only. Before we talk about this subject, we must
    understand the meaning of the word <i>arahant. </i>According
    to Theravada Buddhist teachings, an arahant is a person who
    has reached the fourth and highest stage of enlightenment.
    All those who have reached this stage are called <i>arahants,
    </i>worthy ones. Worthy of what? Worthy of accepting gifts
    from devotees, because gifts made to those persons bring
    abundant results. According to this definition, all those who
    have reached this stage, both disciples and Buddhas (and
    Pacceka-Buddhas also), are called <i>arahants</i>. There are
    numerous places in the Pali Canon where the Buddha is
    referred to as <i>arahant</i>, see for instance the formula
    of homage which Buddhists say everyday: &quot;Namo Tassa
    Bhagavato <i>Arahato</i> Sammasambuddhassa!&quot;; observe
    also the statement in the Mahavagga of Vinaya Pitaka,
    &quot;There are now six <i>arahant</i>s in the world&quot;,
    i.e., the five first disciples and the Buddha. But <i>arahant</i>
    is also used to refer to the disciples only, and it is in
    this sense that the word <i>arahant</i> is used hereafter in
    this article. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to Theravada teachings,
    there are three kinds of beings who have reached the fourth
    stage of enlightenment: Buddhas, Pacceka-Buddhas, and
    Arahants. Arahants are also called Savakas or Disciples; they
    are subdivided into Aggasavaka (the Best Disciples),
    Mahasavaka (the Great Disciples) and Pakatisavaka (the
    Ordinary Disciples). All of these beings are enlightened
    persons, but their quality of enlightenment differs from one
    another. The enlightenment of the Buddhas is the best, that
    of Pacceka-Buddhas is inferior to the enlightenment of the
    Buddhas, but is superior to the enlightenment of the
    Arahants, and the enlightenment of the Arahants is the lowest
    of them all. Buddhas can &#145;save&#146; many beings, or
    rather they can help many beings &#145;save&#146; themselves
    by giving them instructions, but Pacceka-Buddhas do not
    &#145;save&#146; beings because they are solitary Buddhas and
    do not teach as a rule. The Arahants can and do
    &#145;save&#146;<i>'</i>beings, but not as many beings as
    Buddhas do. And the time required for the maturity of the
    qualities of these beings differ greatly. To become a Buddha,
    one has to fulfill the Paramis (necessary qualities for
    becoming a Buddha) for four, eight or sixteen Incalculables
    and 100,000 worlds cycles; but for a Pacceka-Buddha the time
    is only two Incalculables and 100,000 world cycles. Among the
    Disciples, for an Aggasavaka, the time required is one
    Incalculable and 100,000 world cycles, while for a
    Mahasavaka, it is only 100,000. But for the Pakatisavaka, it
    may be just one life, or a hundred lives, or a thousand
    lives, or more. It is important to note that once a person
    becomes an <i>arahant</i>, he will not become a Buddha in
    that life; and since there is no more rebirth for him, he
    will not become a Buddha in the future either. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Theravada Buddhism one is not
    forced to follow the path to Buddhahood only, but is given a
    choice from among the paths mentioned above. So a Theravada
    Buddhist can aspire for and eventually reach Buddhahood;
    indeed he must be determined to fulfill the Paramis for the
    long, long time required for the fulfillment of Buddhahood.
    Or if he so desires, he may aspire for Pacceka-Buddhahood, or
    one of the states of Arahantship and suffer in the round of
    rebirths for the time required for his particular choice of
    the path accumulating the necessary Paramis and
    &#145;save&#146; as many beings as they can. So a Theravada
    Buddhist is free to choose what suits his willingness to go
    through the round of rebirths and suffering. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>In brief,</b><b><i> a Theravada
    Buddhist can become a Buddha, or a Pacceka-Buddha, or an
    Arahant according to his choice. So Theravada Buddhism is for
    all three paths and not for the path to Arahantship only.</i></b>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here comes another question: If a
    Theravada Buddhist can choose any path, why is the attainment
    of Arahantship so much talked about in Theravada Buddhism? It
    is because only very few can become Buddhas. As you know (if
    you have read so far, of course), an aspirant for Buddhahood
    has to undergo a lot of suffering for a long, long time in
    the round of rebirths making sacrifices no other being even
    dreams of; and there can be only one Buddha at a time in the
    whole world, so that the appearance of a Buddha is very, very
    rare. Therefore, for every being to aspire for Buddhahood is
    impractical; it would be like all native citizens of the
    United States trying to become a President of the United
    States. Moreover, the purpose of becoming a Buddha is to <i>&#145;</i>save&#146;
    beings or &#145;help beings save themselves.&#146; But if
    everybody were to become a Buddha, there would be no beings
    for a Buddha to &#145;save&#146;&#150;please note that
    Buddhas do not need any instructions from anybody&#150;and so
    the original purpose would not be served. On the contrary, to
    become an Arahant is very practical, and millions of beings
    attained Arahantship during the time of a Buddha. That is
    why, in Theravada Buddhism, beings are encouraged to try to
    become Arahants which is practical rather than to become
    Buddhas which is not so. But as stated before, beings are
    given freedom to follow the path of their choice in their
    endeavor for attainment of enlightenment. After all, what is
    important for all beings is to get free from suffering in the
    round of rebirths no matter which path they choose. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Still another question: Are there
    Theravada Buddhists who aspire for Buddhahood? We are glad to
    answer in the affirmative. But since not many of them are on
    record, we cannot say how many. At least there was a king in
    Myanmar during the Pagan Period who built a pagoda and
    dedicated it to the Dispensation of the Buddha. In that
    pagoda he left an inscription where he clearly declared his
    aspiration for Buddhahood; and almost all kings of ancient
    Myanmar considered themselves to be aspirants for Buddhahood.
    There are also authors of religious books, mostly monks, who
    mentioned their aspiration for Buddhahood at the end of their
    books. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">So, we can say that
    there are not a few Theravada Buddhists who aspire for
    Buddhahood ./.</font></p>
