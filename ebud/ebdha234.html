      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">T</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">here 
      is at present a view, widely prevalent especially among the educated 
      Buddhists, that Buddhism is a rationalist teaching based on scientifically 
      verifiable evidence. Much has been written to substantiate this view-point 
      and, undoubtedly, such writings have immensely contributed to the further 
      strengthening and spreading of this view. Most of the proponents of this 
      view cite the Kalama Sutta of the Anguttara-nikaya as providing 
      unassailable evidence to prove that Buddhism is a rationalistic teaching 
      with an absolutely scientific basis, and that the Buddha advocated a 
      rationalistic approach as the sole method of understanding all his 
      teachings. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is no exaggeration to say that it is 
      Western scholarship that highlighted the importance of the Kalama Sutta as 
      some kind of &quot;Charter of Free Inquiry.&quot; This &quot;new finding&quot; was 
      enthusiastically taken up and strongly supported by the predominantly 
      Western-trained Buddhist scholarship of the time to bring to light that 
      the Buddha denounced adherence to blind faith and dogmatism and instead 
      encouraged free inquiry and investigation. In further support of such a 
      position, these writers cited the Buddha's rejection of the belief in a 
      divine creator, his acceptance of free will, his anthropocentric approach 
      to the human predicament, his acceptance of the superiority of man, his 
      invitation to the followers to inquire about the Dhamma as well as his own 
      claim to enlightenment and so on. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">While the serious Buddhist scholarship was 
      engaged in evaluating the Kalama Sutta in order to find out the Buddha's 
      attitude to freedom of thought and inquiry and to ascertain the parameters 
      within which this freedom could be put into practise, the 
      over-enthusiastic Buddhists lost in the euphoria of this &quot;new finding&quot;, 
      made indiscriminate use of the Kalama Sutta in their devoted attempt to 
      hail Buddhism as an out and out rationalist teaching, based purely on 
      scientific facts. In this attempt they found strong support from staunch 
      rationalists, who also freely cited the Kalama Sutta to show that even the 
      Buddha advocated free inquiry as the only valid means of obtaining 
      knowledge. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Those who strongly held the view that 
      Buddhism is entirely a form of rationalism were so convinced of the 
      validity of their position that they unhesitatingly and hurriedly arrived 
      at two significant conclusions. First, they concluded that Buddhism is 
      absolutely rationalist in its approach and that this is evident from the 
      Kalama Sutta, which advocates the complete rejection of the then generally 
      accepted ten means of knowledge, which also served as criteria to 
      establish the truth and wholesomeness of teachings and views. Second, they 
      concluded that the Kalama Sutta advocates the use of free, independent 
      thinking as the only valid means of deciding what is right and wrong with 
      regard to all matters, religious as well as otherwise. As these 
      conclusions have much bearing on both the theory and practise of Buddhism, 
      they should be examined and evaluated carefully. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">An unbiased and a careful reading of the 
      Sutta makes it clear that there is no evidence in it, either implicit or 
      explicit, to show that the Buddha advocated the &quot;rejection&quot; of the ten 
      means (criteria) of knowledge (truth). On the contrary, Sutta contains 
      evidence, corroborated by canonical references, to accept the fact that 
      the Buddha himself made appropriate use of many of these means as aids to 
      get at the truth and to distinguish between right and wrong. The following 
      are the ten means of criteria and their general meanings. </FONT></P>
      <DIR>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">1. <I>Anussava</I> = Vedic textual 
        tradition <BR>
        2. <I>Parampara</I> = Unbroken tradition maintained by a successive 
        generation of teachers. <BR>
        3. <I>Itikira</I> = Hearsay <BR>
        4. <I>Pitakasampada</I> = Any approved textual tradition <BR>
        5. <I>Takkahetu</I> = Logic <BR>
        6. <I>Nayahetu</I> = Reasoning <BR>
        7. <I>Akaraparivitakka</I> = Validity of the reasons contained in the 
        teaching <BR>
        8. <I>Ditthinijjhanakkhati</I>= Agreement between the teaching and the 
        views of the individual <BR>
        9. <I>Bhabbarupata</I> = Competence of the teacher <BR>
        10. <I>Samano no garu</I>= Respectability and reputation of the teacher.
        </FONT></P>
      </DIR>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">These ten could be broadly divided into 
      two groups with No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 9 and 10 as means or criteria depending on 
      some kind of &quot;authority&quot; and the remaining four, i.e No. 5, 6, 7 and 8, 
      depending on &quot;reason.&quot; </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In fact unlike some of the <I>Samana</I> 
      teachers the Buddha did not totally condemn the Vedas as foolish babb1e. 
      Instead, in Suttas such as Tevijja of the Digha-nikaya the Buddha 
      criticized the Vedas on different grounds, pointing out their limitations 
      and shortcomings, thus cautioning the people against blindly accepting 
      them as containing infallible, gospel truth. Similar was the attitude of 
      the Buddha with regard other means coming under the category of 
      &quot;authority.&quot; In the Buddha's view all kinds of tradition, whether it is 
      the unbroken traditions maintained by generation of teachers, texts or any 
      other traditions, need be neither discarded nor blindly clung to. The four
      <I>Mahapadesas</I> (great authorities) referred to in the Mahaparinibbana 
      Sutta of the Digha-nikaya clearly show the importance attached by the 
      Buddha to such traditions. The Payasi Sutta of Digha-nikaya shows the 
      Buddha's general attitude to all kinds of tradition. It is the slavish 
      acceptance of traditions that the Buddha condemned. It is seen that even 
      hearsay was not considered as being intrinsically useless, for even that 
      could be made use of after verification. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There is ample evidence in the canon to 
      show that the Buddha did never reject outright the use of logic and 
      reason. He has made it quite clear, as he did in the Sandaka Sutta of 
      Majjhima-nikaya, that both these have their own inherent limitations and, 
      therefore, he vividly brought out how logic and reason often lead to 
      endless conflicts. Suttas such as Kalahavivada, Culavyuha, Mahaviyuha, all 
      in the Suttanipata, provide concrete evidence to the Buddha's attitude to 
      all means of knowledge falling under &quot;reason.&quot; </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Yet, textual evidence shows that the 
      Buddha did not discard the use logic and reason as totally invalid and 
      useless. The Upali, Apannaka and Culamalunkya Suttas of Majjhima-nikaya 
      show how the Buddha very aptly used logic and reason, well keeping in mind 
      their limitations and the pitfalls into which they could lead 
      indiscriminate users of such means. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The four <I>Mahapadesas</I> show also the 
      important place assigned to both <I>&quot;Bhabbarupata&quot; </I>and <I>&quot;Samano no 
      garu.&quot;</I> Nowhere did the Buddha advocate the total rejection of the 
      authority of teachers. In fact, the Buddha named &quot;<I>paratoghosa</I>&quot;, 
      that is teaching coming from outside which includes instruction and 
      guidance of teachers, as one of the two factors that is essential to 
      develop right view (<I>sammaditthi</I>); the other factor being proper 
      reflection (<I>yoniso manasikaro</I>). </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If this is the true position, then there 
      is no ground whatsoever to hold that in the Kalama Sutta the Buddha 
      advocates the rejection of any of the ten means (criteria) of knowledge 
      (truth). If so, what does the Buddha advocates? From the content of the 
      Sutta what is clear is that the Buddha admonishes the Kalamas not to adopt 
      any of the above mentioned ten means of knowledge as absolute criteria or 
      standards or measurements in evaluating the quality of a religious 
      teaching, specially of teachings pertaining to ethics. The mere fact that 
      a teaching is found in the texts considered sacred, or taught by an 
      honoured, reputed teacher, or is in total agreement with logic and reason 
      and so on should not be taken as sufficient and valid grounds to accept 
      any teaching as true and wholesome. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Instead the Buddha presents a new 
      criterion, which is also found often referred to in such other Suttas such 
      as the Bahitika, Ambalatthikarahulovada (both in the Majjhima-nikaya). 
      This criterion is to be applied by carrying out a personal test of the 
      teaching by using one's understanding and experience. This is a very 
      simple, straight forward, and easily applicable test. The Buddha while 
      asking the Kalamas not to depend on any of the earlier mentioned criteria 
      says: <I>&quot;But, Kalamas, when you know for yourselves, these things are 
      unprofitable, these things are blameworthy, these things are censured by 
      the wise; these things when performed and undertaken, conduce to loss and 
      sorrow – then indeed you should reject them.&quot;</I> And the Buddha adds that
      <I>&quot; ... when you know for yourselves that these things are profitable, 
      blameless, praised by the wise, when performed and undertaken conduce to 
      profit and happiness, then having undertaken them, abide in them.&quot;</I>
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Now what is the position with regard to 
      the second conclusion? This concerns the scope of application of this 
      criterion. When considered broadly, there appear to be two view-points on 
      this. One is that, it is applicable to all matters concerned with the 
      dhamma, the other is that it is applicable to Dhamma as well as &quot;all other 
      matters.&quot; It is necessary that one should consider the specific context in 
      which the Kalama Sutta was preached. The Sutta says that the Kalamas were 
      perplexed and confused by the claims put forward by different religious 
      teachers who visited their village, praising each one's teachings and 
      denouncing the rest as false. When the Buddha visited the village of 
      Kesaputa, its residents, the Kalamas, came up to him and said: </FONT><I>
      <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Sir, certain recluses and brahmins come to 
      Kesaputta. As to their own view they proclaim and expound it in full, but 
      as to the views of others, they abuse, revile, depreciate and condemn... 
      when we listen to them, Sir, we have doubt and wavering, as to which of 
      these teachers speaks the truth and which speaks falsehood.&quot; </FONT></P>
      </I>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is to allay this specific &quot;doubt and 
      wavering&quot; that the Buddha presented the novel criterion, involving a 
      personal test of the teachings concerned. From the answer given by the 
      Buddha it appears that he considered the question as pertaining to an 
      ethical issue. The Buddha's admonition to Kalamas is to find out for 
      themselves, whether any of these teachings leads to the growth of greed, 
      malice and delusion. These are the three root-causes of evil, and the 
      avoidance of these is the assured way to a moral life, finally leading to 
      Nibbana. The injunction: <I><B>&quot;when you know for yourselves&quot;</B></I> (<I>attanava 
      janeyyatha</I>) has necessarily to be taken as being limited to this 
      context. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Sutta itself does not provide any 
      justification to expand the ambit of its application, either to cover all 
      matters pertaining to the Dhamma, or in general to all matters. This 
      second assumption is obviously very farfetched.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There are many matters that we all cannot 
      understand and know for ourselves. Yet, we accept them and take them for 
      granted reposing &quot;faith&quot; on the competence of those who pronounce views on 
      them. We would not be able to conduct even affairs of day to day life if 
      we ourselves try to understand and know all issues and problems that we 
      have to face. This is why we seek the help, and advice of those who are 
      more knowledgeable, and possessing expertise in different areas. </FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Even the first assumption is questionable. 
      The Buddha made this admonition to an ordinary set of people. Therefore, 
      it is apparent that he did not expect them to use a any expertise or 
      super-knowledge in deciding on the issues concerned. His advice was to use 
      common sense and personal experience they have had with regard to ordinary 
      situations, leading them to greed, hate and delusion. The Buddha very 
      clearly said in the Kitagiri Sutta of the Majjhima-nikaya that final 
      knowledge is not achievable at the beginning itself, but it is an outcome 
      of gradual training. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It should be remembered that the Buddha's 
      teachings contains fundamentals, which are not within the comprehension of 
      the beginners, or of the untrained. There is quite a lot of textual 
      evidence showing even liberated senior disciples of the Buddha approaching 
      the Buddha for clarification regarding certain basic issues. They clear 
      their knowledge and obtain clear vision on such issues only after 
      listening to the Buddha's explanations. Question pertaining to <I>kamma</I>, 
      rebirth etc. necessarily have to be understood through forms 
      superknowledge, which are above the capability of ordinary human beings. 
      Until such knowledge is gained we have to accept them on &quot;faith.&quot; </FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In this context is it possible to justify 
      the assumption that the Kalama Sutta gives a blanket approval for all to 
      use free inquiry to obtain knowledge regarding all matters pertaining to 
      the Dhamma? Neither the evidence found in the Kalama Sutta nor evidence in 
      other canonical texts supports such an assumption. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This does not mean that we are not allowed 
      to inquire into these issues. We could, but we should not hurriedly 
      conclude that we have arrived at the truth and, then not only cling to it, 
      but engage in pronouncing it loud, denouncing every other view as false. 
      This is really what happens when one arrives at truth through free 
      inquiry. Then one's conclusion becomes one's &quot;own view&quot; which prompts a 
      person to proclaim it and defend it at any cost. This, on the one hand, 
      leads to conflict on the other, to misrepresentation of the teaching. 
      Results of both are harmful. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A very strong reason why a majority wish 
      to widen the parameters of free inquiry is the belief that &quot;faith&quot; is a 
      feature of primitive and undeveloped religions and that Buddhism which is 
      a novel teaching denounces all forms of faith. This again is a little far 
      from the truth. It is well known that <I>Saddha</I>, in whichever manner 
      it is translated - confidence, trust, faith etc. - is an essential feature 
      of Buddhist practice. It is not a kind of blind faith (<I>amulika saddha</I>) 
      but faith founded on reasonable grounds, (<I>akaravati saddha</I>). To 
      develop <I>saddha</I> one need not have absolute proof, but reasonably 
      acceptable evidence. Free inquiry comes very much later, after <I>saddha</I>.
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Canka Sutta of Majjhima-nikaya clearly 
      lays down the proper procedure for the application of this free inquiry. 
      This procedure starts with <I>saddha</I>, which finally gives way to <I>
      panna</I> (wisdom). In between, there is a gradual process that leads a 
      person, step by step, towards the truth, which is beneficial and 
      wholesome. There is no reason for the Buddhists to shy away from the fact 
      that Buddhism accepts the usefulness of <I>saddha</I> as an essential, 
      primary element in its practice. <I>Saddha</I> provides us with a good 
      start to properly grasp the doctrine. It certainly will be good to 
      remember what the Alagaddupama Sutta of Majjhima-nikaya says would be the 
      fate of those who wrongly grasp the Dhamma. It says that just as a man who 
      catches a snake by its coil or tail would be stung by the snake, similarly 
      a man who wrongly grasp the teaching would also come to harm and 
      suffering. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Free inquiry has become almost a fad among 
      the Buddhists. There is a proliferation of literature giving fascinating 
      and novel interpretations, which are not only far-fetched, but total 
      misrepresentations of the Buddha's teachings. Some balanced writers have 
      attempted to caution these over-enthusiastic propagators of Buddhism by 
      presenting the true significance of the Kalama Sutta (eg. Buddhist 
      Publication Society, News Letter, No. 09, Spring, 1988) [*]. But 
      unfortunately, these warnings have gone unnoticed. Unlimited freedom of 
      thought is being brandished as the &quot;trade mark&quot; of Buddhism, thus further 
      opening the flood-gates for more misrepresentations to flow out. </FONT>
