      <P><FONT SIZE="6">M</FONT>ost writings on the doctrine of kamma emphasize 
      the strict lawfulness governing kammic action, ensuring a close 
      correspondence between our deeds and their fruits. While this emphasis is 
      perfectly in place, there is another side to the working of kamma - a side 
      rarely noted, but highly important. This is the modifiability of kamma, 
      the fact that the lawfulness which governs kamma does not operate with 
      mechanical rigidity but allows for a considerably wide range of 
      modifications in the ripening of the fruit.</P>
      <P>If kammic action were always to bear fruits of invariably the same 
      magnitude, and if modification or annulment of kamma-result were excluded, 
      liberation from the samsaric cycle of suffering would be impossible; for 
      an inexhaustible past would ever throw up new obstructive results of 
      unwholesome kamma. Hence the Buddha said:</P>
      <P><I>&quot;If one says that in whatever way a person performs a kammic action, 
      in that very same way he will experience the result - in that case there 
      will be no (possibility for a) religious life and no opportunity would 
      appear for the complete ending of suffering.&quot;</I></P>
      <P><I>But if one says that a person who performs a kammic action (with a 
      result) that is variably experienceable, will reap its results accordingly 
      - in that case there will be (a possibility for) a religious life and an 
      opportunity for making a complete end of suffering.&quot; -- AN 3:110</I></P>
      </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2"></FONT>
      <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">
      <P>Like any physical event, the mental process constituting a kammic 
      action never exists in isolation but in a field, and thus its efficacy in 
      producing a result depends not only on its own potential, but also upon 
      the variable factors of its field, which can modify it in numerous ways. 
      We see, for example, that a particular kamma, either good or bad, may 
      sometimes have its result strengthened by supportive kamma, weakened by 
      counteractive kamma, or even annulled by destructive kamma. The occurrence 
      of the result can also be delayed if the conjunction of outer 
      circumstances required for its ripening is not complete; and that delay 
      may again give a chance for counteractive or destructive kamma to operate.</P>
      <P>It is, however, not only these extraneous conditions which can cause 
      modification. The ripening also reflects the kamma's &quot;internal field&quot; or 
      internal conditions - that is, the total qualitative structure of the mind 
      from which the action issues. To one rich in moral or spiritual qualities, 
      a single offence may not entail the weighty results that the same offence 
      will have for one who is poor in such protective virtues. Also, 
      analogously to human law, a first offender's punishment will be milder 
      than that of a reconvicted criminal.</P>
      <P>Of this type of modified reaction the Buddha speaks in the continuation 
      of the discourse quoted above:</P>
      <P><I>&quot;Now take the case when a minor evil deed has been committed by a 
      certain person and it takes him to hell. But if the same minor offence is 
      committed by another person, its result might be experienced during his 
      lifetime and not even the least (residue of a reaction) will appear (in 
      the future), not to speak about a major (reaction).</I></P>
      <P><I>&quot;Now what is the kind of person whom a minor offence takes to hell? 
      It is one who has not cultivated (restraint of) the body, not cultivated 
      virtue and thought, nor has he developed any wisdom; he is narrow-minded, 
      of low character and even for trifling things he suffers. It is such a 
      person whom even a minor offence may take to hell.</I></P>
      <P><I>&quot;And what is the person by whom the result of the same small offence 
      will be experienced in his lifetime, wihtout the least (future residue)? 
      He is one who has cultivated (restraint of) the body, who has cultivated 
      virtue and thought and who has developed wisdom; he is not limited by 
      (vices), is a great character and he lives unbounded (by evil). It is such 
      a person who experiences the result of the same small offence during his 
      lifetime, without the least future residue.</I></P>
      <P><I>&quot;Now suppose a man throws a lump of salt into a small cup of water. 
      What do you think, monks: would that small quantity of water in the cup 
      become salty and undrinkable through that lump of salt?&quot; - &quot;It would, 
      Lord.&quot; - &quot;And why so?&quot; - &quot;The water in the cup is so little that a lump of 
      salt can make it salty and undrinkable.&quot; - &quot;But suppose, monks, that lump 
      of salt is thrown into the river Ganges. Would it make the river Ganges 
      salty and undrinkable?&quot; - &quot;Certainly not, Lord.&quot; - &quot;And why not?&quot; - 
      &quot;Great, Lord, is the mass of water in the Ganges. It will not become salty 
      and undrinkable by a lump of salt.&quot;</I></P>
      <P><I>&quot;Further, O monks, suppose a person has to go to jail for a matter 
      of a halfpenny, a penny or a hundred pence, and another man does not have 
      to go to jail on that account.</I></P>
      <P><I>&quot;Now what is the kind of person that has to go to jail for a matter 
      of a halfpenny, a penny or a hundred pence? It is one who is poor, without 
      means or property. But he who is rich, a man of means and property, does 
      not have to go to jail for such a matter.&quot; -- AN 3:110</I></P>
      <P>Hence we must say that it is an individual's accumulation of good or 
      evil kamma and also his dominating character traits, good or evil, which 
      affect the kammic result. They determine the greater or lesser weight of 
      the result and may even spell the difference between whether or not it 
      occurs at all.</P>
      <P>But even this does not exhaust the existing possibilities of 
      modifications in the weight of kammic reaction. A glance into the life 
      histories of people we know may well show us a person of good and 
      blameless character, living in secure circumstances; yet a single mistake, 
      perhaps even a minor one, suffices to ruin his entire life - his 
      reputation, his career, and his happiness - and it may also lead to a 
      serious deterioration of his character. This seemingly disproportionate 
      crisis might have been due to a chain-reaction of aggravating 
      circumstances beyond his control, to be ascribed to a powerful 
      counteractive kamma of his past. But the chain of bad results may have 
      been precipitated by the person's own action - decisively triggered by his 
      initial mistake and reinforced by subsequent carelessness, indecision or 
      wrong decisions, which, of course, are unskillful kamma in themselves. 
      This is a case when even a predominantly good character cannot prevent the 
      ripening of bad kamma or soften the full force of the results. The good 
      qualities and deeds of that person will certainly not remain ineffective; 
      but their future outcome might well be weakened by any presently arisen 
      negative character changes or actions, which might form a bad 
      counteractive kamma.</P>
      <P>Consider too the converse situation: A person deserving to be called a 
      thoroughly bad character, may, on a rare occasion, act on an impulse of 
      generosity and kindness. This action may turn out to have unexpectedly 
      wide and favourable repercussions on his life. It might bring about a 
      decisive improvement in his external circumstances, soften his character, 
      and even initiate a thorough &quot;change of heart.&quot;</P>
      <P>How complex, indeed, are situations in human life, even when they 
      appear deceptively simple! This is so because the situations and their 
      outcome mirror the still greater complexity of the mind, their 
      inexhaustible source. The Buddha himself has said: <I>&quot;The mind's 
      complexity surpasses even the countless varieties of the animal kingdom.&quot; 
      (SN 22:100)</I> For any single individual, the mind is a stream of 
      ever-changing mental processes driven by the currents and cross-currents 
      of kamma accumulated in countless past existences. But this complexity, 
      already great, is increased still very much more by the fact that each 
      individual life-stream is interwoven with many other individual 
      life-streams through the interaction of their respective kammas. So 
      intricate is the net of kammic conditioning that the Buddha declared 
      kamma-result to be one of the four &quot;unthinkables&quot; (//acinteyya//) and 
      warned against creating it as a subject of speculation. But though the 
      detailed workings of kamma escape our intellection, the practically 
      important message is clear: the fact that kammic results are modifiable 
      frees us from the bane of determinism and its ethical corollary, fatalism, 
      and keeps the road to liberation constantly open before us.</P>
      <P>The potential &quot;openness&quot; of a given situation, however, also has a 
      negative side, the element of risk and danger a wrong response to the 
      situation might open a downward path. It is our own response which removes 
      the ambiguity of the situation, for better or worse. This reveals the 
      kamma doctrine of the Buddha as a teaching of moral and spiritual 
      responsibility for oneself and others. It is truly a &quot;human teaching&quot; 
      because it corresponds to and reflects man's wide range of choices, a 
      range much wider than that of an animal. Any individual's moral choice may 
      be severely limited by the varying load of greed, hatred and delusion and 
      their results which he carries around; yet every time he stops to make a 
      decision or a choice, he has the opportunity to rise above all the 
      menacing complexities and pressures of his unfathomable kammic past. 
      Indeed, in one short moment he can transcend aeons of kammic bondage. It 
      is through right mindfulness that man can firmly grasp that fleeting 
      moment, and it is mindfulness again that enables him to use it for making 
      wise choices.</P>
      </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">
      <P ALIGN="center"><B>II</B></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="6">E</FONT>very kammic action, as soon as it is performed, 
      first of all affects the doer of the deed himself. This holds with as much 
      truth for bodily and verbal deeds directed towards others as it does for 
      volitional thoughts that do not find outward expression. To some extent we 
      can control our own response to our actions, but we cannot control the way 
      others respond to them. Their response may turn out to be quite different 
      from what we expect or desire. A good deed of ours might be met with 
      ingratitude, a kind word may find a cold or even hostile reception. But 
      though these good deeds and kind words will then be lost to the recipient, 
      to his own disadvantage, they will not be lost to the doer. The good 
      thoughts that inspired them will ennoble his mind, even more so if he 
      responds to the negative reception with forgiveness and forbearance rather 
      than anger and resentment.</P>
      <P>Again, an act or word meant to harm or hurt another may not provoke him 
      to a hostile reaction but only meet with self-possessed calmness. Then 
      this &quot;unaccepted present will fall back to the giver,&quot; as the Buddha once 
      told a brahmin who had abused him. The bad deed and words, and the 
      thoughts motivating them may fail to harm the other, but they will not 
      fail to have a damaging effect on the character of the doer; and it will 
      affect him even worse if he reacts to the unexpected response by rage or a 
      feeling of resentful frustration. Hence the Buddha says that beings are 
      the responsible owners of their kamma which is their inalienable property. 
      They are the only legitimate heirs of their actions, inheriting their 
      legacy of good or bad fruits.</P>
      <P>It will be a wholesome practice to remind oneself often of the fact 
      that one's deeds, words and thoughts first of all act upon and alter one's 
      own mind. Reflecting thus will give a strong impetus to true self-respect, 
      which is preserved by protecting oneself against everything mean and evil. 
      To do so will also open a new, practical understanding of a profound 
      saying of the Buddha:</P>
      <P><I>&quot;In this fathom-long body with its perceptions and thoughts there is 
      the world, the origin of the world, the ending of the world and the path 
      leading to the ending of the world.&quot; -- AN 4:45</I></P>

      <P ALIGN="center"><B>III</B></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="6">T</FONT>he &quot;world&quot; of which the Buddha speaks is 
      comprised in this aggregate of body-and-mind. For it is only by the 
      activity of our physical and mental sense faculties that a world can be 
      experienced and known at all. The sights, sounds, smells, tastes and 
      bodily impressions which we perceive, and our various mental functions, 
      conscious and unconscious - this is the world in which we live. And this 
      world of ours has its origin in that very aggregate of physical and mental 
      processes that produces the kammic act of craving for the six physical and 
      mental sense objects.</P>
      <P><I>&quot;If, Ananda, their were no kamma ripening in the sphere of the 
      senses, would there appear any sense-sphere existence?&quot; - &quot;Surely, not 
      Lord.&quot; -- AN 3:76</I></P>
      </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2"></FONT>
      <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">
      <P>Thus kamma is the womb from which we spring (//kamma-yoni//), the true 
      creator of the world and of ourselves as the experiencer of the world. And 
      through our kammic actions in deed, word and thought, we unceasingly 
      engage in building and rebuilding this world and worlds beyond. Even our 
      good actions, as long as they are still under the influence of craving, 
      conceit and ignorance, contribute to the creation and preservation of this 
      world of suffering. The Wheel of Life is like a treadmill set in perpetual 
      motion by kamma, chiefly by its three unwholesome roots - greed, hatred 
      and delusion. The &quot;end of the world&quot; cannot be reached by walking on a 
      treadmill; this only creates the illusion of progress. It is only by 
      stopping that vain effort that the end can be reached.</P>
      <P>It is <I>&quot;through the elimination of greed, hatred and delusion that 
      the concatenation of kamma comes to an end&quot; (AN 10:174).</I> And this 
      again can happen nowhere else than in the same aggregate of body-and-mind 
      where suffering and its causes originate. It is the hopeful message of the 
      third noble truth that we can step out of the weary round of vain effort 
      and misery. If, despite our knowledge of the possibility of release, we 
      keep walking on the treadmill of life, that is because of an age-old 
      addiction hard to break, the deeply rooted habit of clinging to the 
      notions of &quot;I,&quot; &quot;mine&quot; and &quot;self.&quot; But here again there is the hopeful 
      message in the fourth noble truth with its Noble Eightfold Path, the 
      therapy that can cure the addiction and gradually lead us to the final 
      cessation of suffering. And all that is required for the therapy is again 
      found in our own body and mind.</P>
      <P>The treatment proper starts with correctly understanding the true 
      nature of kamma and thereby our situation in the world. This understanding 
      will provide a strong motivation for ensuring a prevalence of good kamma 
      in one's life. And as it deepens by seeing the human condition still more 
      clearly, this same understanding will become the spur for breaking the 
      chains of kammic bondage. It will impel one to strive diligently along the 
      path, and to dedicate all one's actions and their fruits to the greatest 
      end of action - the final liberation of oneself and all sentient beings.</P>
