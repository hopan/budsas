    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><FONT SIZE="6">T</FONT>he most important thing in our 
      lives is the cultivation of the mind. If we are honest we will see that 
      most of the time we are concerned only with our bodies. The greater 
      portion of our lives is spent cultivating protecting, clothing, 
      sheltering, comforting, warming and feeding our bodies.<P>But a healthy 
      body does not always mean a healthy mind. When we begin to look, listen 
      and become aware of ourselves we recognise that the mind is far from 
      healthy. What does this mean? It means that we are not at all happy, 
      joyful or peaceful in the mind. It is filled with all sorts of nagging 
      complaints, irritations, negativity, pettiness, jealousies, envy, desires, 
      expectations, fears and worries. These are what we call the nagging 
      problems or ailments of the mind.</P>
      <P>These days, especially in the West, more and more people are becoming 
      aware of these ailments of the mind and are seeking for a way to cure or 
      at least to reduce these ailments so that the mind can be truly peaceful, 
      happy and joyful. This is why people are now turning towards the practice 
      of meditation and to different paths of spiritual training and 
      cultivation. Whichever path we choose, the aim of all people is basically 
      the same. We all seek happiness. We all strive to have a peaceful and 
      happy mind.</P>
      <P>Christmas is traditionally a time of love and peace, peace for all the 
      world and love for humanity. It is a time when we are supposed to be 
      loving everyone with a peaceful and loving heart. But then we may notice 
      that our lives are not quite up to this ideal, and so there is this 
      seeking, this interest in mind cultivation. And which path should we 
      tread? This we must find out for ourselves as the great Teachers only 
      point the way.</P>
      <P>So one comes to this Buddhist Centre and hears a description of the 
      path in Buddhist terminology; we practice Buddhist meditation using a 
      specific technique and method of training. But remember that one&#39;s aim and 
      interest <B>is</B> to realise peace and happiness and each one of you must 
      reflect on your own experience. We are all different yet we are all the 
      same.</P>
      <P>When the Lord Buddha described a human being he did not say that some 
      are made up like this and others are made up like that. He said that all 
      bodies are composed of the four elements - water, earth, heat and air - 
      and that all humans also have feelings, they have the ability to perceive 
      and remember, to conceive and construct, and all have consciousness. All 
      human beings who are as yet unenlightened have the same problems, they are 
      not really happy or really peaceful. So as human beings there is this 
      great affinity which we have for each other, this sense that we all aspire 
      for peace and happiness and we are all in the same boat together.</P>
      <P>How can we find this peace? A very important thing in our lives is our 
      attitude. Right attitude, I would say, is the most important thing. If you 
      have the wrong attitude there is suffering and difficulty, but if you have 
      the right attitude there is peace. We have all sat in meditation tonight 
      concentrating on our breath and what have we experienced? Peacefulness or 
      tension? It just depends on your attitude, doesn&#39;t it?</P>
      <P>What does it mean to be peaceful? Sometimes we have such ideals about 
      what it means. If we think that our mind must always be still and 
      completely steady that is very difficult to sustain in our ordinary lives 
      with so many contacts and conflicts.</P>
      <P>So we have to have a different idea of peace, we must change our 
      attitude. What is the right attitude we should develop which will bring 
      about peace and relaxation of the mind? It is <I><B>the attitude of 
      accepting things as they are right now</B></I>. By allowing things to be 
      as they are right now brings about this relaxation and peace of mind. If 
      you don&#39;t accept and are working from the idea of expectation, having to 
      have, this has to be, this has to happen or this is the way it should be, 
      you are refusing the present. When you refuse the present, there is always 
      tension and you are even further away from peace.</P>
      <P>So the first thing is just accepting and learning acceptance. When 
      thoughts come, you know them, let them go. You accept that that is quite 
      natural, that&#39;s just the way of the mind. That is the way it is, right 
      now. This accepting attitude immediately gives you a sense of peace and 
      relaxation. Now this is very, very important because if you approach 
      meditation with a sense of gain and achievement, expectation or force then 
      it&#39;s no longer an exercise in peace.</P>
      <P>We are meditating to be peaceful, so be peaceful from the very start, 
      by having a peaceful approach. We practice the spiritual path to be 
      peaceful so the important thing is to be peaceful in this one moment. Now 
      the stress here on peacefulness is not necessarily stillness. It does not 
      mean emptiness, stillness of mind with no thoughts. To be peaceful does 
      not mean that we have to go through the whole day without getting uptight 
      in the slightest way, without any friction, restlessness or conflict. It 
      does not mean that we go through the whole day smiling like the Buddha 
      statue. You are not that, you are a human being. with feelings and senses, 
      living in a sensitive body. So if you have this ideal that to be peaceful 
      means to go around like the Buddha statue you are just going to be more 
      and more disappointed, which means less and less peaceful. So again, this 
      accepting attitude, accepting situation, yourself and what you are 
      experiencing in life brings relaxation. There is relaxation if you can 
      just accept.</P>
      <P>This attitude of acceptance is also the means to develop love. We all 
      have this very high ideal of what love should be, that we should love 
      others and all humanity. To love you simply means I can accept you and 
      give you space to be without developing aversion or being overly critical, 
      without wanting to do something to change you. This is the first step in 
      loving, accepting, allowing others to be, to give them space and not 
      dwelling in aversion. Dwelling in aversion means that you&#39;re picking the 
      faults, picking what you don&#39;t like or agree with and dwelling on it.</P>
      <P>You become obsessed with the faults so that rather than loving you are 
      trying to destroy the other person in your mind. So acceptance here is a 
      foundation for love to arise. Just as we accept the present situation now 
      within what we are experiencing in the mind, so we accept people as they 
      are with their limitations and differences, giving them room to exist.</P>
      <P>When we begin to develop this attitude, peace arises in the mind, peace 
      with ourselves and others and out of that peacefulness arises all that is 
      noble, worthy and skilful. From peace comes mindfulness.</P>
      <P>The Lord Buddha said that just as the footprint of an elephant can 
      encompass the footprint of every other living animal, in the same way, 
      from the basis of peacefulness and mindfulness all other skilful <I>
      Dhammas</I> can grow, be cultivated and developed.</P>
      <P>I remember when I first started meditating this accepting attitude was 
      the one thing that was so hard. While training under Ven Ajahn Chah, there 
      were two things which he seemed to me to stress greatly. Firstly was 
      morality and secondly, attitude. Morality or discipline was just the way 
      of doing things, a way of living that was orderly, so that we could live 
      together and then around that discipline was the cultivation of right 
      attitude. Whether one is living in a monastery or within a family, until 
      one has this right attitude it will always be difficult and a struggle. 
      But as soon as one develops this right attitude there is peace and a sense 
      of relief. Don&#39;t have such high ideals of peace and love that they are 
      impossible to attain in this human form with all our limitations.</P>
      <P>With a new attitude begin to see that peace does not mean always being 
      blissed out, loving everybody and everything. This attitude of acceptance 
      means accepting things just as they are now, relaxing into and giving 
      space to people and situations.</P>
