      this paper I would like to look at a travel story of a different kind. It 
      describes a physical journey, but begins a collection of stories about 
      travel in a larger sense: the journey of one individual, and his 
      followers,across many lifetimes and rebirths as different kinds ofanimal, 
      human and god. The Jatakas, or birth stories as they are sometimes known, 
      are a collection of 547 tales dating from about the third century BCE. 
      Each describes the bodhisatta, the future Buddha,as he is reborn in 
      different conditions in preparation for his final rebirth, in which he 
      becomes not only enlightened but, on the basis of these countless 
      lifetimes of experience, able to teach others. All are linked by the 
      narrator’s<I>aha</I><I STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">m</I>, or “I”, 
      the method by which the Buddha, fully enlightened, discloses and 
      acknowledges as his own a particular identity or character at the end of 
      each tale. The tales are intended to inform, encourage and inspire 
      Buddhist practitioners and are constantly told to children and adults 
      throughout Buddhist countries.Several come to be associated with one of 
      ten perfections, moral qualities that need to be developed in the 
      preparation for Buddhahood. Vigour is for instance developed when the 
      bodhisatta is a prince who swims for days at sea after a shipwreck, loving 
      kindness, when the Bodhisatta, born as a deer, by his fearlessness 
      deflects the aggression of a king who wants to kill him.</SPAN><A TITLE HREF="#_ftn1" NAME="_ftnref1"><SPAN CLASS="MsoFootnoteReference"><SUP><![IF !supportFootnotes]>[1]<![ENDIF]></SUP></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-GB" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
      Buddhists in Sri Lanka and South East Asia who may not know anything of 
      other canonical texts grow up with Jataka<I> </I>stories, and they are 
      repositories of afolk Buddhism that informs the thinking, customs and even 
      legal systems of these countries: in Laos for instance precedents from 
      Jataka tales have even been used in courts of law.</SPAN><A TITLE HREF="#_ftn2" NAME="_ftnref2"><SPAN CLASS="MsoFootnoteReference"><SUP><![IF !supportFootnotes]>[2]<![ENDIF]></SUP></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-GB" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">

      tales are painted, carved and drawn in temples throughout the east 
      suggests a kind of travel. Episodes from these tales, with the bodhisatta 
      in different guises, as human, monkey, elephant, goose, cat, hare or even 
      mouse make friezes which adorn shrine rooms throughout Burma, Thailand, 
      Sri Lanka, Laos and Cambodia, as well as the ancient Buddhist sites of 
      Ajanta and Sañchi in India and Borobodur in Indonesia.</SPAN><A TITLE HREF="#_ftn3" NAME="_ftnref3"><SPAN CLASS="MsoFootnoteReference"><SUP><![IF !supportFootnotes]>[3]<![ENDIF]></SUP></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-GB" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
      A visitor walks past and may stop to look at depictions of them as he 
      makes his way into a shrine hall: murals shown on the outside wall or in 
      the approach to the temple accompany the movement from the world of 
      activity outside to the quiet space of the interior where the figure of 
      the Buddha is placed and respected on a shrine.Here the stories are also 
      sometimes painted on the walls as one approaches the shrine itself.In a 
      site such as Borobodur this walking becomes a kind of meditative journey: 
      in order to see all the reliefs on the outside of the stËpa in their 
      correct order, the visitor needs to circumambulate it ten times, through 
      depictions of past lives of the Buddha and the realms of existence.</SPAN><A TITLE HREF="#_ftn4" NAME="_ftnref4"><SPAN CLASS="MsoFootnoteReference"><SUP><![IF !supportFootnotes]>[4]<![ENDIF]></SUP></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-GB" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
      The monumentally long Vessantara Jataka, the last of the tales and the 
      only one that has been well translated in recent years, is simply the most 
      popular story in most Buddhist countries.</SPAN><A TITLE HREF="#_ftn5" NAME="_ftnref5"><SPAN CLASS="MsoFootnoteReference"><SUP><![IF !supportFootnotes]>[5]<![ENDIF]></SUP></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-GB" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
      Friezes depicting scenes from it are frequent at the entrance into a 
      shrine hall. The stories as a whole are, as Richard Gombrich points out, 
      “one of the world’s oldest and largest collection of folk tales.”</SPAN><A TITLE HREF="#_ftn6" NAME="_ftnref6"><SPAN CLASS="MsoFootnoteReference"><SUP><![IF !supportFootnotes]>[6]<![ENDIF]></SUP></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-GB" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">They 
      are also interesting from a narrative point of view: they must be the only 
      collection of stories in the world linked by the experiences of one 
      central characterthrough many lives. It is in this more far-reaching 
      sense, of travel across many lives, that the idea of a journey informs 
      early Buddhist understanding about the nature of our experience of 
      existence and of the way to be free within it. </SPAN></P>

      before we move any further I should explain a little the textual history 
      of the Jataka stories, and the way that this highly varied collection of 
      tales about the past lives of the Buddha is held together. The evolution, 
      structure and historical dating of strata of the text raise issues which 
      are rather complex so I will try to summarise them in as concise a way as 
      I can – with apologies for any inevitable omissions or generalisations. 
      The earliest form of the Jatakas are the verses which accompany the 
      stories, which are very old, some possibly predating Buddhism.</SPAN><A TITLE HREF="#_ftn7" NAME="_ftnref7"><SPAN CLASS="MsoFootnoteReference"><SUP><![IF !supportFootnotes]>[7]<![ENDIF]></SUP></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-GB" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
      The Jatakas, like other early Buddhist texts, arose as part of an oral 
      tradition and were not written down for centuries. The language they are 
      composed in is Pali, a form of middle Indo-Aryan that seems to be close to 
      the language spoken by the historical Buddha.It seems that the verses at 
      an early date became settled and regarded as canonical. Perhaps because 
      good storytelling is so often an extemporising art, the stories themselves 
      did not become fixed then, though their presence is implied in the verses, 
      which make little sense without them. The stories that we have are later 
      formulations and technically known as commentary. There is also a long 
      frame narrative, usually regarded as a book in itself, which is a later 
      addition, though a beautifully simple and helpful one.</SPAN><A TITLE HREF="#_ftn8" NAME="_ftnref8"><SPAN CLASS="MsoFootnoteReference"><SUP><![IF !supportFootnotes]>[8]<![ENDIF]></SUP></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-GB" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
      It supplies what the stories do not: a full life story of the Buddha in 
      his last lifetime, preceded by description of a life in the far past in 
      which he makes the resolve to become a bodhisatta and to develop the ten 
      perfections through countless lives. It gives us a clear point of origin 
      for the tales, a linking device that clarifies the intention of the 
      stories as a whole and the “present” context of the Buddha’s teaching. It 
      is in many ways though an independent work, and its description of the 
      taking of the bodhisatta vow, the undertaking to fulfil the perfections 
      and the presence of a particular figure, Dipa∫kara, an earlier Buddha who 
      witnesses the vow, has woven in some elements in Buddhist thought that 
      emerged a little later in the tradition.</SPAN><A TITLE HREF="#_ftn9" NAME="_ftnref9"><SPAN CLASS="MsoFootnoteReference"><SUP><![IF !supportFootnotes]>[9]<![ENDIF]></SUP></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-GB" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
      The fact that the stories describe a series of lives of a central 
      character searching for enlightenment, though,suggests the presence of 
      some sort of tale that explains why he started doing this: perhaps the 
      work existed from the earliest times, though it is unlikely it was in this 
      form.As it stands it is a work in its own right, and for the purposes of 
      this paper I am not including it here but will refer to it as ‘the frame 
      story’.</SPAN></P>
      <P CLASS="MsoNormal" ALIGN="left">
      <SPAN LANG="EN-GB" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;Instead I am 
      looking at the first story and the unifying principles which are provided 
      by the pattern governing the structure of each of the tales. This is 
      extremely effective and, to an audience used to hearing the tales, gives a 
      pleasing familiarity to any story, as elements that are repeated 
      throughout would be recognised whenever any Jataka is told:they always 
      begin, continue and end in a similar way. It starts with the Buddha, 
      described in the third person, as a participant or watcher in a particular 
      incident in the “present”: perhaps some monks are quarrelling or an odd 
      marital feud has erupted. On the basis of this incident (<I>paccuppannavatthu</I>) 
      the Buddha decides to tell a story of an earlier life from which it soon 
      emerges that the characters, usually under different names or even in a 
      different form of rebirth such as an animal, had a tendency to get into 
      the same sort of problem long ago. This gives us the main body of the 
      story (<I>at</I><I STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i</I><I>tavatthu</I>), 
      and most of the tales start with the evocative <I>at</I><I STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i</I><I>te</I>, 
      once upon a time, or “in times long past”. Only the Buddha, with his 
      omniscient knowledge of the past lives of the characters involved, is in a 
      position to recollect all the details of the past for those who are 
      listening. In this past story he appears as a character like any other, is 
      described in the third person and has another name in that rebirth, though 
      frequent use of terms such as bodhisatta or the <I>mah</I><I STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a</I><I>satta</I> 
      – a word rather like “our hero”-ensure that the reader knows who is meant.</SPAN><A TITLE HREF="#_ftn10" NAME="_ftnref10"><SPAN CLASS="MsoFootnoteReference"><SUP><![IF !supportFootnotes]>[10]<![ENDIF]></SUP></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-GB" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">His 
      behaviour also marks him out as different: he will be the one who is more 
      heroic, or skilled or kind-hearted in some way, though he features 
      sometimes just as a witness to the action. As he is not enlightened, his 
      actions are not always perfect: because the material is drawn from such a 
      diversity of folk sources he really does have a distinct character and 
      different identity in his various rebirths, though he is usually treated 
      as in some way exemplary. The story always includes verses (<I>g</I><I STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a</I><I>th</I><I STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a</I>), 
      the earliest layer of the texts: these vary in function and quality from 
      simple folk homily to what are sometimes extended lyrical and emotional 
      accompaniments to the story. They do not tend to be mechanisms for moving 
      the plot, and sometimes include poetic interjections and comments 
      attributed to the Buddha in the present, though this is always noted when 
      it occurs.At the end of the tale the threads from the different aspects of 
      the story are tied together. The Buddha, still described in the third 
      person, gives a short speech making appropriate connections (<I>samodh</I><I STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a</I><I>na</I>). 
      He assigns each character a counterpart in the present life and then 
      reveals last the part he has played himself, with the first person, <I>aha</I><I STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">m</I>.This 
      revelation and acknowledgement of the earlier identity of the Buddha 
      occurs at the end of each tale and provides us, along with the structure 
      of the stories, an underlying pattern that links together what would 
      otherwise be an unusually diverse group of stories, of many different 
      genres and narrative methods. </SPAN></P>
      <P CLASS="MsoNormal" ALIGN="left">
      <SPAN LANG="EN-GB" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;There are a 
      number of points to consider about the Jatakas, and the place of the first 
      tale in particular, but rather than discussing them in the abstract I will 
      go straight into the tale itself, and use that as the basis from which to 
      explore its place in the collection as a whole.</SPAN></P>

      <P CLASS="MsoNormal" ALIGN="left">
      <SPAN LANG="EN-GB" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the 
      first section, the story from the present, is quite long, and consists in 
      large part of a eulogy of the Buddha himself, the character in the present 
      who has become fully awakened, is able to teach and inspire others and who 
      has spent countless lifetimes in preparation for the job of disseminating 
      a teaching that will enable others to free themselves. In this regard it 
      is clearly intended as an opening to the tales as a whole. It is, as one 
      could argue is the frame story, in many ways an elaboration of a device 
      found throughout the Pali canon, whereby a homage is paid to the Buddha at 
      the beginning of the text. We do not know at what stage it became routine 
      as an introduction but the short preliminary, <I>Namo tassa bhagavato 
      arahato samm</I><I STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a</I> <I>
      sambuddhassa</I>, “Homage to the exalted one, the enlightened one, the 
      fully awakened Buddha”, prefaces all the collections in the Pali Text 
      Society: it precedes both the frame story and the first Jataka itself. It 
      is the usual way of beginning any auspicious undertaking in a Buddhist 
      country: I once heard it chanted on a coach in Sri Lanka as the village 
      set off on a pilgrimage. Considering the aspects of the Buddha in all his 
      different characteristics is also one of the meditation practices of the 
      Pali canon. A single meditation subject, <I>Buddh</I><I STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a</I><I>nussati</I>, 
      it often accompanies two other meditations, the recollection of the <I>
      dhamma</I>, the teaching, and the <I>sa</I><I STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ng</I><I>ha</I>, 
      the assembly of monks, nuns and those who have followed the teaching in 
      the past: the three are called the Triple Gem. These <I>samatha</I>, or 
      calming, practices are particularly recommended for the laity in the canon 
      for arousing cheerfulness and happiness in daily life and are constantly 
      taught as ways of keeping the mind awake and in good spirits during the 
      day.</SPAN><A TITLE HREF="#_ftn11" NAME="_ftnref11"><SPAN CLASS="MsoFootnoteReference"><SUP><![IF !supportFootnotes]>[11]<![ENDIF]></SUP></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-GB" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
      In this preliminary tale we are presented with the Buddha as the teacher, 
      and five hundred disciples of other teachers, who are friends of the 
      treasurer Anathapidika. These are proponents of views that are famous 
      within the canon for their opinionatedness: they hold beliefs that our 
      fates are fixed and predestined, for instance, or that there are no good 
      or bad consequences to our actions.</SPAN><A TITLE HREF="#_ftn12" NAME="_ftnref12"><SPAN CLASS="MsoFootnoteReference"><SUP><![IF !supportFootnotes]>[12]<![ENDIF]></SUP></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-GB" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
      Converted once by the Buddha, these five hundred followers have relapsed 
      and the story describes the Buddha’s response to this before they join him 
      again: he tells them that they have given themselves up into a wilderness 
      of views and opinions, and that they have sought refuge where there is 
      none.By recollecting the qualities of the Triple Gem, they will attain 
      complete freedom. This preliminary story arouses consideration of the 
      figure of the glorious appearance and inspiring teaching of the Buddha, 
      the hero whose contemplation would arouse great confidence in his 
      followers. It also, as was pointed out to me by a research student here in 
      Oxford, makes an unusual claim for meditations which are always felt to be 
      helpful, but not generally regarded as salvific.</SPAN><A TITLE HREF="#_ftn13" NAME="_ftnref13"><SPAN CLASS="MsoFootnoteReference"><SUP><![IF !supportFootnotes]>[13]<![ENDIF]></SUP></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-GB" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It 
      stresses that recollection of the qualities of the Triple Gem are the only 
      true refuge, and that they lead to enlightenment. The text is emphasising, 
      &nbsp;right at the beginning, a series of popular meditation practices which 
      are particularly aimed at laymen, and which seem here to be accorded 
      unlimited potential. This perhaps does not mean they are the only 
      practices one should do: there are many other meditations advised in the 
      canon. In a Buddhist context it is a striking claim, though, and one which 
      distinguishes the first part of the first story on its own: I do not think 
      it is made elsewhere amongst the tales. The Buddha then asks the treasurer 
      to listen, explaining that he has spent countless lifetimes cultivating 
      the perfections so that he can help other beings. In order to illustrate 
      his points about the followers, the Buddha compares the situation now to a 
      series of events in the past, which he proceeds to relate in a formula we 
      again do not find elsewhere in the tales: “as if breaking open the 
      birthplace of the snow and releasing the full moon, he made clear what the 
      gap between this and the previous life had kept hidden”.</SPAN></P>
      <P CLASS="MsoNormal" ALIGN="left">
      <SPAN LANG="EN-GB" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;This section of 
      the narrative has been indisputably Buddhist.The extended description of 
      the teacher, the references to the recollection of the Triple Gem and the 
      formula with which the story from the past is introduced all point to a 
      preliminary story carefully designed to awaken faith in the figure of the 
      Buddha, his teaching and his followers.The first story set in the past, 
      like many of the collection, is more of a folk tale, describing a journey. 
      The bodhisatta, a caravan leader who trades with five hundred carts, going 
      from east to west and west back to east, loads up all his carts with 
      merchandise and prepares to cross a wilderness. Another foolish trader 
      does exactly the same thing and intends to set off at the same time. The 
      bodhisatta, seeing the danger in having too many waggons on the road at 
      the same time, all using wood, grass and water, offers the other the 
      choice of going first or second. The other, greedily perceiving an 
      advantage in beating the bodhisatta to market, opts for going first. The 
      bodhisatta however sees some advantages in going second; wells are dug, 
      there will be a fresh, new growth of herbs and prices will already be 
      fixed.The foolish merchant sets off on the desert wilderness well 
      prepared, with sixty jars of water. On the way however he meets a yakkha, 
      or demon, who decides to play a trick on them. He conjures up a magic 
      carriage drawn by white bulls and surrounds himself with a retinue of more 
      demons with bows and arrows, with clothes and hair all dripping wet, 
      lotuses in their hair, chewing luscious lotus stalks themselves. 
      Persuading the caravan trader that there is water where there is a dark 
      streak ahead – presumably a mirage – the yakkha successfully enjoins him 
      to empty out all his water so that he can make faster progress. When they 
      come to pitch tent, exhausted, thirsty and dried out, the demon eats them 
      all. The same trick is tried on the bodhisatta, who is not so gullible. He 
      dissuades his followers from doing what the demon asks by asking questions 
      to which they find the answers themselves: why are there no rain clouds, 
      no sound of thunder and no evidence of the winds that accompany rain? 
      Realising himself that he is dealing with demons – whose red eyes and the 
      fact they cast no shadow always betray their true identity to the 
      observant – he persuades his followers to see for themselves the defects 
      in the arguments, not to throw away their water, and to keep vigilant at 
      night. Because of this they all cross the wilderness safely, add the goods 
      of the dead merchants to their own, and make a very tidy profit when they 
      reach the city.The story, which is entitled “A True Story”, or“a Story 
      about Truth” elaborates this idea of truth in a single verse, commenting 
      on the wisdom of following what is true rather than clever falsity. The 
      final, connecting statement is made by the Buddha, in which he says that 
      Devadatta, his rival over many lifetimes, was the foolish merchant; his 
      followers those that accompanied him. The Buddha and his followers were 
      the wise ones.</SPAN></P>

      as they pass from one life to another without ceasing, until they find 
      release. Within Buddhism, words connected with a more directed form of 
      travel are also used to express the means by which we can free ourselves 
      from that <I>sa</I><I STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">m</I><I>s</I><I STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a</I><I>ra</I>.</SPAN><A TITLE HREF="#_ftn15" NAME="_ftnref15"><SPAN CLASS="MsoFootnoteReference"><SUP><![IF !supportFootnotes]>[15]<![ENDIF]></SUP></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-GB" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
      The content of the first sermon of the Buddha describes this eightfold 
      path of right view, understanding, speech, livelihood, action, 
      mindfulness, effort and concentration. It uses the same word, <I>magga</I>, 
      one would apply to a local thoroughfare like the Cowley Road, for 
      instance, and is employed for the “road” in this first tale; the word 
      applies to any path that takes people from one place to another. The 
      Buddha&#39;s teaching is elsewhere likened to a path that the Buddha has found 
      just as a man might cut through an overgrown track in a jungle, which 
      leads to a beautiful forgotten city.</SPAN><A TITLE HREF="#_ftn16" NAME="_ftnref16"><SPAN CLASS="MsoFootnoteReference"><SUP><![IF !supportFootnotes]>[16]<![ENDIF]></SUP></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-GB" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The 
      word path has levels of meaning according to the particular area of 
      Buddhist thought: in the philosophical tradition of <I>abhidhamma</I>, it 
      refers to the attainment of stages along the way to enlightenment and, 
      specifically, the moment of enlightenment itself.To travel along this path 
      is to find the means of release and escape from wandering. It refers also 
      to the attainment of the four graded spiritual states of which the last is 
      full enlightenment: stream entry, the moment when one first perceives the 
      path, one-return, non-return, and arahatship. These are mentioned in the 
      first part of the story in connection with the recollection of the Triple 
      Gem. So “path” applies to the daily practice of life as a Buddhist, the 
      way to the end of suffering and to the final fruition of all factors of 
      the path in the awakened mind: only enlightenment itself reveals it in its 
      entirety. Travel and movement from one place to another are certainly not 
      the only analogies used by the Buddha to describe his teaching: metaphors 
      and similes in Buddhism tend to be used in richly various ways, as these 
      stories show us.But the idea that how we behave, speak, think and deal 
      with others places us on some sort of road and gives us the means to 
      travel, and that this path will lead eventually to the end of suffering, 
      indicates how deeply the association of movement in a certain direction is 
      equated to the means and the end of spiritual development.Further images 
      employed within early Buddhism reinforce this association. The word of 
      crossing over for instance, with its associations of finding a further 
      shore and passing over a gulf, is used to describe the way to 
      enlightenment.</SPAN><A TITLE HREF="#_ftn17" NAME="_ftnref17"><SPAN CLASS="MsoFootnoteReference"><SUP><![IF !supportFootnotes]>[17]<![ENDIF]></SUP></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-GB" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">

      <SPAN LANG="EN-GB" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The first story 
      and its preliminary are fairly simple and self–explanatory: the 
      preliminary in the present gives a paeon to the teacher and describes him 
      encountering a situation of doubt, while the story itself gives an 
      imaginative embodiment of the problem in a journey across a literal 
      wilderness. The story describes the triumph of common sense, care in 
      testing all new propositions and the ability not to take the obvious or 
      seductive course of action. The followers discover the truth through their 
      own questioning, and take nothing on faith – one of the central tenets of 
      the Buddhist teaching which is described as <I>ehipassiko</I>, come and 
      see, or come and see for yourself. These are very pragmatic, careful and 
      even unassuming virtues, and bring us to a feature that is worth examining 
      a little further. During the course of the stories the bodhisatta 
      undergoes many transformations, and is reborn in all classes of society as 
      well as in animal rebirths.In those near the beginning of the collection 
      he is quite often an animal, while in those towards the end he is usually 
      human and often royal, though there is not much more of a pattern to be 
      discerned in this: the tales are collected on the Ùg Vedic scheme of an 
      ascending number of verses, so that the first hundred and fifty are all 
      grouped together only because they have one verse. The second <I>vagga</I> 
      includes those with two, and so on in an ascending sequence. The last <I>
      vagga</I> of ten tales has the ones with the most verses. This does not at 
      first sight accompany any other aesthetic sequence, nor is there any 
      obvious development or “progress” in the type of rebirth. For instance the 
      bodhisatta is a prince, a god,a king and usually a human in some of the 
      early Jatakas, which have only one verse; while in one of the very late 
      stories in the twenty-first <I>vagga</I> (533), which has many verses, he 
      is born as a goose, though a very noble one. </SPAN></P>

      <SPAN LANG="EN-GB" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;The last ten 
      stories have acquired a particular importance, particularly in South East 
      Asia. A great deal of verse suggests a large amount of poetry, and a 
      likely debt to traditions such as epic and drama: generalisations are 
      crude in this context but a story with many verses is more likely to have 
      affinities with such genres. So these last ten are in many ways extended 
      folk epics.</SPAN><A TITLE HREF="#_ftn22" NAME="_ftnref22"><SPAN CLASS="MsoFootnoteReference"><SUP><![IF !supportFootnotes]>[22]<![ENDIF]></SUP></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-GB" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
      For whatever reason, they are the most popular and widely depicted of the 
      tales: their length and complexity certainly allows for a great deal of 
      drama, ambiguity, characterisation and detailed explorations of moral 
      dilemmas and doctrinal points. Chronology does not seem to be much of a 
      factor in this arrangement, though Vessantara is usually regarded as the 
      “last” human birth in a temporal sense, as are all the last ten, which are

      the beginning? Is that significant? The first <I>vagga</I>, of stories 
      with single verses, which includes many very popular tales like the Maccha 
      Jataka (75), in which the bodhisatta is a kindly fish, does not seem to 
      have any aesthetic “shape”.The rebirths do not follow any pattern or 
      apparently involve a sense of progress. The Aesop-like pithiness of the 
      single verse method is well suited to the moral fables concerning an 
      animal rebirth. Although there are not as many as the human, there are 
      quite a few of these, though without any obvious pattern in their 
      arrangement.</SPAN><A TITLE HREF="#_ftn25" NAME="_ftnref25"><SPAN CLASS="MsoFootnoteReference"><SUP><![IF !supportFootnotes]>[25]<![ENDIF]></SUP></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-GB" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The 
      stories tend to involve situations which can be summarised by a short 
      formulation of the teaching: the single verse is often in practice a 
      general homily or folk truth, expressed in a catchy and memorable form 
      which for obvious reasons does not involve lengthy poetic or lyric 
      description. All of this is inconclusive and does not suggest any obvious 
      chronological beginning, or any sense of “progress”: there are quite a few 
      lower rebirths, but they do not predominate. As we have seen there are 
      nonetheless various thematic reasons for this as the choice of the first 
      tale. It includes in the first part a homage to the Buddha and a statement 
      of the efficacy of recollecting his virtues, his teaching and his 
      followers. It then, in describing one of the lives that have contributed 
      to these, includes a literal path, a wilderness, and a journey through 
      inhospitable terrain.The teaching is enacted in his method of dealing with 
      the yakkha and his followers. </SPAN></P>

      <SPAN LANG="EN-GB" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;So the choice of 
      a hero for the first tale also to me suggests deliberation. It is a kind 
      of middle ground in rebirths: it is not regal, courtly nor heavenly; it is 
      not an animal one either, technically known as a descent. We do know that 
      many early Buddhists were drawn from the mercantile class. Donations are 
      recorded from merchants on early inscriptions, who seem to have acquired a 
      social status higher than they had in Vedic times.</SPAN><A TITLE HREF="#_ftn26" NAME="_ftnref26"><SPAN CLASS="MsoFootnoteReference"><SUP><![IF !supportFootnotes]>[26]<![ENDIF]></SUP></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-GB" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
      It would be fitting that the first story in this collection speaks to an 
      audience who appear to have received Buddhism so favourably. A practical, 
      shrewd and kindly trader, not averse to making a good profit yet mindful 
      of his responsibilities to his dependents, seems to me the ancient Indian 
      counterpart of the bourgeois “common man”, intent on applying Buddhist 
      principles of generosity and restraint to his own circumstances and making 
      them work. It is just these careful qualities which, it is suggested, keep 
      those in the higher life, as monks, on the right path so that they do not 
      fall into harm. It implies also not just a certain target audience, but 
      also a means by which the tales may have become so widespread. We do not 
      know the nature of the audience to whom the Jatakas were addressed, but we 
      do know that while they have remained rooted within the countries of 
      Buddhist practice they themselves tended to travel too.</SPAN><A TITLE HREF="#_ftn27" NAME="_ftnref27"><SPAN CLASS="MsoFootnoteReference"><SUP><![IF !supportFootnotes]><![ENDIF]>[27]</SUP></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-GB" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">

      It is a notoriously difficult area of research, but I would imagine that

      must be in part responsible for this.It seems likely that the merchants 
      appropriated such popularly accessible tales and that the laity drawn from 
      this class will have been well represented amongst their early audiences.

      <SPAN LANG="EN-GB" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">If we open an 
      anthology of poems or collection of stories in the west, we assume that 
      the choice of the first text is in some sense significant. The first poem 
      or story in a collection interests us: it may not be the best, but we 
      would feel that it has been chosen to awaken a mood for the collection as 
      a whole, perhaps setting in motion themes and ideas which come into play 
      or are explored through the rest of the work. It lingers in the mind as in 
      some sense our initial and most important contact with the text as a 
      whole.Indeed there are many books, poems, plays and novels memorable 
      precisely because of the way the author interested us first. We do not 
      make such assumptions about collections of early Buddhist texts. In the 
      first place, they are not apparently the product of a single creative 
      mind, but were, according to tradition, collected by the followers of the 
      Buddha at various councils after his death. From a historical point of 
      view it is generally agreed that in practice they evolved over a period of 
      time as they were chanted and handed down by various <I>bh</I><I STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a</I><I>ˆaka</I> 
      traditions of reciters – groups of monks entrusted with this task. As the 
      text that may be chanted on any occasion may not be the first one in a 
      collection it could be argued that no mood needs to be set at all by the 
      one placed at the beginning. &nbsp;Texts were not composed or grouped together 
      with an eye to a reader, but to an audience who would be listening to them 
      over what may have been a long period of time, such as an overnight 
      session. Constant contact with texts chanted in this way is part of a 
      South East Asian Buddhist background; peace and reassurance would be found 
      just by hearing them, and recognising the familiar features of the oral 
      tradition.</SPAN><A TITLE HREF="#_ftn30" NAME="_ftnref30"><SPAN CLASS="MsoFootnoteReference"><SUP><![IF !supportFootnotes]>[30]<![ENDIF]></SUP></SPAN></A><SPAN LANG="EN-GB" STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
      Perhaps because of this we do not usually speak of the texts’ “author” and 
      do not tend to focus on the artistry in the composition of the suttas, as 
      they are called, or other canonical Buddhist texts. But these factors need 
      not preclude artistic considerations, or the exercise of care in making a 
      good beginning. Indeed the phrase <I>eva</I><I STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">m
      </I><I>me suta</I><I STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">m</I><I>, </I>
      thus have I heard, begins many, if not most, of the suttas<I> </I>and is 
      both a preparation for the hearer and an acknowledgement of those who have 
      sustained the teaching. A highly personal statement, it nonetheless pays 
      respects to those from whom the texts have been heard and who have shaped 
      the form they take. While the history of the tradition has tended to 
      stress other aspects of the text, such as the spiritual, the philosophical 
      or the ethical, there is evidence of great care and skill employed by 
      these unknown compilers, which has contributed to the texts’ construction. 
      &nbsp;If we examine this craft further we find that in the course of the 
      process of transmission various emphases and excellences also seem to have

      It seems to me that all the major collections of early Buddhist texts have 
      significant and pertinent beginnings, and that when we come to look at

      become clear that such an appraisal need not detract from our sense of the 
      Buddha’s creativity as a teacher. It rather enhances it, by placing it in 
      a context where humour, drama and poetry and a sense of the aesthetic 
      shape of a collection as a whole give substance to our interpretation of

      texts. It has, though, a decidedly low-key frame story, involving a 
      curious interchange between a teacher and his disciple as they follow, 
      literally, in the footsteps of the Buddha on the road to Nalanda. It is a 
      simple and very human beginning to the major Buddhist text on wrong views.

      designates the beginning of a larger one.A description of a simple 
      merchant, it represents the bodhisatta as the common man before the

      It seems to me that one way this method is so successful is through the 
      flexibility of the narrative method, with its shifts of perspective that 
      allow us to move from the present to the past and back again within each 
      tale, before that identity is dissolved and a new story begins. The 
      contradiction between the self that finds out that there is no self is one 
      that provides a dramatic thread throughout this journey of lives: each 
      story starts with the awakened mind, describes it at one remove so to 
      speak in a past in which the bodhisatta was not enlightened, and then 
      returns to the awakened mind at the end.Sue Hamilton, in <I>Early

      In the Jatakas the Buddha travels through and experiences many identities, 
      but is the only character in the tales who remembers and is free from them 
      all. The reader, or hearer, does not really think much about the doctrine 
      of no-self at all: it is enacted for him through the separate and distinct 
      experiences of the Bodhisatta, recollected by the Buddha in the present. 
      The Jatakas then seem to me to be a skilfully constructed journey through 
      a wilderness of lives, linking the Buddha with all kinds of conditions, 
      yet starting with the common man, the kind of person very likely to be 
      listening to them. &nbsp;Like the entrance to a temple in the East, the tales 
      give us a way of travelling through an extended recollection of his

          itself is used in a technical sense to describe the moment of each of

          Dhammasa</I><I STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">n</I><I>gani</I>, 
          a canonical <I>abhidhamma</I> text, path factors may exist severally

          but cannot exist altogether as a fully activated path until one of 
          these four stages has been attained (DhS 277ff). My impression is that 
          the tales take the more conventional point of view of the path as a
