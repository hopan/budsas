<blockquote>
  <h3><font color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">Introduction</font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">For more than 2,500 years, the religion we know today as
  Buddhism has been the primary inspiration behind many successful civilizations, the source
  of great cultural achievements and a lasting and meaningful guide to the very purpose of
  life for millions of people. Today, large numbers of men and women from diverse
  backgrounds throughout our world are following the Teachings of the Buddha. So who was the
  Buddha and what are His Teachings? </font></p>
  <h3><font color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">The Buddha</font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The man who was to become the Buddha was born Siddhattha
  Gotama around 2,600 years ago as a Prince of a small territory near what is now the
  Indian-Nepalese border. Though he was raised in splendid comfort, enjoying aristocratic
  status, no amount of material pleasure could satisify the enquiring and philosophic nature
  of the young man. At the age of 29 he left palace and family to search for a deeper
  meaning in the secluded forests and remote mountains of North-East India. He studied under
  the wisest religious teachers and philosophers of his time, learning all they had to
  offer, but he found it was not enough. He then struggled alone with the path of self-
  mortification, taking that practice to the extremes of asceticism, but still to no avail. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then, at the age of 35, on the full moon night of May, he
  sat beneath the branches of what is now known as the Bodhi Tree, in a secluded grove by
  the banks of the river Neranjara, and developed his mind in deep but luminous, tranquil
  meditation. Using the extraordinary clarity of such a mind with its sharp penetrative
  power generated by states of deep inner stillness, he turned his attention to investigate
  upon the hidden meanings of mind, universe and life. Thus he gained the supreme
  Enlightenment experience and from that time on he was known as the Buddha. His
  Enlightenment consisted of the most profound and all-embracing insight into the nature of
  mind and all phenomena. This Enlightenment was not a revelation from some divine being,
  but a discovery made by Himself and based on the deepest level of meditation and the
  clearest experience of the mind. It meant that He was no longer subject to craving,
  ill-will and delusion but was free from their shackles, having attained the complete
  ending of all forms of inner suffering and acquired unshakeable peace. </font></p>
  <h3><font color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">The Teachings of the Buddha</font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Having realized the goal of Perfect Enlightenment, the
  Buddha spent the next 45 years teaching a Path which, when diligently followed, will take
  anyone regardless of race, class or gender to that same Perfect Enlightenment. The
  Teachings about this Path are called the <b>Dhamma</b>, literally meaning &quot;the nature
  of all things&quot; or &quot;the truth underlying existence&quot;. It is beyond the scope
  of this pamphlet to present a thorough description of all of these Teachings but the
  following 7 topics will give you an overview of what the Buddha taught: </font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><em><strong><i>1. The way of Inquiry</i></strong></em></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha warned strongly against blind faith and
  encouraged the way of truthful inquiry. In one of His best known sermons, the Kalama
  Sutta, the Buddha pointed out the danger in fashioning one's beliefs merely on the
  following grounds: on hearsay, on tradition, because many others say it is so, on the
  authority of ancient scriptures, on the word of a supernatural being, or out of trust in
  one's teachers, elders, or priests. Instead one maintains an open mind and thoroughly
  investigates one's own experience of life. When one sees for oneself that a particular
  view agrees with both experience and reason, and leads to the happiness of one and all,
  then one should accept that view and live up to it! </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This principle, of course, applies to the Buddha's own
  Teachings. They should be considered and inquired into using the clarity of mind born of
  meditation. Only when one sees these Teachings for oneself in the experience of insight,
  do these Teachings become one's Truth and give blissful liberation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The traveller on the way of inquiry needs the practice of
  tolerance. Tolerance does not mean that one embraces every idea or view but means one
  doesn't get angry at what one can't accept. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Further along the journey, what one once disagreed with
  might later be seen to be true. So in the spirit of tolerant inquiry, here are some more
  of the basic Teachings as the Buddha gave them. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><em><strong><i>2. The Four Noble Truths</i></strong></em></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The main Teaching of the Buddha focuses not on
  philosophical speculations about a Creator God or the origin of the universe, nor on a
  heaven world ever after. The Teaching, instead, is centred on the down-to- earth reality
  of human suffering and the urgent need to find lasting relief from all forms of
  discontent. The Buddha gave the simile of a man shot by a poison-tipped arrow who, before
  he would call a doctor to treat him, demanded to know first who shot the arrow and where
  the arrow was made and of what and by whom and when and where ... this foolish man would
  surely die before his questions could be well answered. In the same way, the Buddha said,
  the urgent need of our existence is to find lasting relief from recurrent suffering which
  robs us of happiness and leaves us in strife. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Philosophical speculations are of secondary importance
  and, anyway, they are best left until after one has well trained the mind in meditation to
  the stage where one has the ability to examine the matter clearly and find the Truth for
  oneself. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, the central Teaching of the Buddha, around which all
  other teachings revolve is the <em><b>Four Noble Truths</b></em>: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. That all forms of being, human and otherwise, are
    afflicted with suffering.<br>
    2. That the cause of this suffering is Craving, born of the illusion of a soul (see below,
    note 7).<br>
    3. That this suffering has a lasting end in the Experience of Enlightenment (Nibbana)
    which is the complete letting go of the illusion of soul and all consequent desire and
    aversion.<br>
    4. That this peaceful and blissful Enlightenment is achieved through a gradual training, a
    Path which is called the Middle Way or the Eightfold Path. </font></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It would be mistaken to label this Teaching as <b>'pessimistic'</b>
  on the grounds that it begins by centring on suffering. Rather, Buddhism is <b>'realistic'</b>
  in that it unflinchingly faces up to the truth of life's many sufferings and it is <b>'optimistic'</b>
  in that it shows a final end of the problem of suffering - <b>Nibbana</b>, Enlightenment
  in this very life! Those who have achieved this ultimate peace are the inspiring examples
  who demonstrate once and for all that Buddhism is far from pessimistic, but it is <b>a
  Path to true Happiness</b>. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><em><strong><i>3. The Middle Way or
  Eightfold Path</i></strong></em></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Way to end all suffering is called the Middle Way
  because it avoids the two extremes of sensual indulgence and self-mortification. Only when
  the body is in reasonable comfort but not over-indulged has the mind the clarity and
  strength to meditate deeply and discover the Truth. This Middle Way consists of the
  diligent cultivation of Virtue, Meditation and Wisdom, which is explained in more detail
  as the <b>Noble Eightfold Path</b>. </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Right Understanding <br>
    2. Right Thought <br>
    3. Right Speech <br>
    4. Right Action <br>
    5. Right Livelihood <br>
    6. Right Effort <br>
    7. Right Mindfulness <br>
    8. Right Concentration </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Right Speech, Action and Livelihood constitute the
  training in Virtue or Morality. For a p<b>ractising Buddhist it consists of maintaining
  the five Buddhist Precepts, which are to refrain from:</b> </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Deliberately causing the death of any living being; <br>
    2. Intentionally taking for one's own the property of another; <br>
    3. Sexual misconduct, in particular adultery; <br>
    4. Lying and breaking promises; <br>
    5. Drinking alcohol or taking stupefying drugs which lead to lack of mindfulness. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Right Effort, Mindfulness and Concentration refer to the
  practice of Meditation, which purifies the mind through the experience of blissful states
  of inner stillness and empowers the mind to penetrate the meaning of life through profound
  moments of insight. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Right Understanding and Thought are the manifestation of
  Buddha-Wisdom which ends all suffering, transforms the personality and produces
  unshakeable serenity and tireless compassion. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the Buddha, without perfecting the practice
  of Virtue it is impossible to perfect Meditation, and without perfecting Meditation it is
  impossible to arrive at Enlightenment Wisdom. Thus the Buddhist Path is a Gradual Path, a
  Middle Way consisting of <b>Virtue, Meditation and Wisdom</b> as explained in the Noble
  Eightfold Path leading to happiness and liberation. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><em><strong><i>4. Kamma</i></strong></em></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kamma means 'action'. The Law of Kamma means that there
  are inescapable results of our actions. There are deeds of body, speech or mind that lead
  to others' harm, one's own harm, or to the harm of both. Such deeds are called bad (or
  'unwholesome') kamma. They are usually motivated by greed, hatred or delusion. Because
  they bring painful results, they should not be done. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are also deeds of body, speech or mind that lead to
  others' well being, one's own well being, or to the well being of both. Such deeds are
  called good (or 'wholesome') kamma. They are usually motivated by generosity, compassion
  or wisdom. Because they bring happy results, they should be done as often as possible. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus much of what one experiences is the result of one's
  own previous kamma. When misfortune occurs, instead of blaming someone else, one can look
  for any fault in one's own past conduct. If a fault is found, the experience of its
  consequences will make one more careful in the future. When happiness occurs, instead of
  taking it for granted, one can look to see if it is the result of good kamma. If so, the
  experience of its pleasant results will encourage more good kamma in the future. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha pointed out that no being whatsoever, divine or
  otherwise, has any power to stop the consequences of good and bad kamma. The fact that one
  reaps just what one sows gives to the Buddhist a greater incentive to avoid all forms of
  bad kamma while doing as much good kamma as possible. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Though one cannot escape the results of bad kamma, one can
  lessen their effect. A spoon of salt mixed in a glass of pure water makes the whole very
  salty, whereas the same spoon of salt mixed in a freshwater lake hardly changes the taste
  of the water. Similarly, the result of a bad kamma in a person habitually doing only a
  small amount of good kamma is painful indeed, whereas the result of the same bad kamma in
  a person habitually doing a great deal of good kamma is only mildly felt. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This natural Law of Kamma becomes the force behind, and
  reason for, the practice of morality and compassion in our society. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><em><strong><i>5. Rebirth</i></strong></em></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha remembered clearly many of His past lives. Even
  today, many Buddhist monks, nuns and others also remember their past lives. Such a strong
  memory is a result of deep meditation. For those who remember their past life, Rebirth is
  an established fact which puts this life in a meaningful perspective. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Law of Kamma can only be understood in the framework
  of many lifetimes, because it sometimes takes this long for Kamma to bear its fruit. Thus
  Kamma and Rebirth offer a plausible explanation to the obvious inequalities of birth; why
  some are born into great wealth whereas others are born into pathetic poverty; why some
  children enter this world healthy and full-limbed whereas others enter deformed and
  diseased... The fruits of bad Kamma are not regarded as a punishment for evil deeds but as
  lessons from which to learn, for example, how much better to learn about the need for
  generosity than to be reborn among the poor! </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Rebirth takes place not only within this human realm. The
  Buddha pointed out that the realm of human beings is but one among many. There are many
  separate heavenly realms and grim lower realms, too, realms of the animals and realms of
  the ghosts. Not only can human beings go to any of these realms in the next life, but we
  can come from any of these realms into our present life. This explains a common objection
  against Rebirth that argues &quot;How can there be Rebirth when there are 10 times as many
  people alive today than there were 50 years ago?&quot; The answer is that people alive
  today have come from many different realms. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Understanding that we can come and go between these
  different realms, gives us more respect and compassion for the beings in these realms. It
  is unlikely, for example, that one would exploit animals when one has seen the link of
  Rebirth that connects them with us. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><em><strong><i>6. No Creator God</i></strong></em></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha pointed out that no God or priest nor any other
  kind of being has the power to interfere in the working out of someone else's Kamma.
  Buddhism, therefore, teaches the individual to take full responsibility for themselves.
  For example, if you want to be wealthy then be trustworthy, diligent and frugal, or if you
  want to live in a heaven realm then always be kind to others. There is no God to ask
  favours from, or to put it another way, there is no corruption possible in the workings of
  Kamma. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Do Buddhists believe that a Supreme Being created the
  universe? Buddhists would first ask which universe do you mean? This present universe,
  from the moment of the 'big bang' up to now, is but one among countless millions in
  Buddhist cosmology. The Buddha gave an estimate of the age of a single universe-cycle of
  around 37,000 million years which is quite plausible when compared to modern astrophysics.
  After one universe- cycle ends another begins, again and again, according to impersonal
  law. A Creator God is redundant in this scheme. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">No being is a Supreme Saviour, according to the Buddha,
  because whether God, human, animal or whatever, all are subject to the Law of Kamma. Even
  the Buddha had no power to save. He could only point out the Truth so that the wise could
  see it for themselves. Everyone must take responsibility for their own future well being,
  and it is dangerous to give that responsibility to another. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><em><strong><i>7. The Illusion of Soul</i></strong></em></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha taught that there is no soul, no essential and
  permanent core to a living being. Instead, that which we call a 'living being', human or
  other, can be seen to be but a temporary coming together of many activities and parts -
  when complete it is called a 'living being', but after the parts separate and the
  activities cease it is not called a 'living being' anymore. Like an advanced computer
  assembled of many parts and activities, only when it is complete and performs coherent
  tasks is it called a 'computer', but after the parts are disconnected and the activities
  cease it is no longer called a 'computer'. No essential permanent core can be found which
  we can truly call 'the computer', just so, no essential permanent core can be found which
  we can call 'the soul'. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yet Rebirth still occurs without a soul. Consider this
  simile: on a Buddhist shrine one candle, burnt low, is about to expire. A monk takes a new
  candle and lights it from the old. The old candle dies, the new candle burns bright. What
  went across from the old candle to the new? There was a causal link but no thing went
  across! In the same way, there was a causal link between your previous life and your
  present life, but no soul has gone across. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Indeed, the illusion of a soul is said by the Buddha to be
  the root cause of all human suffering. The illusion of 'soul' manifests as the 'Ego'. The
  natural unstoppable function of the Ego is to control. Big Egos want to control the world,
  average Egos try to control their immediate surroundings of home, family and workplace,
  and almost all Egos strive to control what they take to be their own body and mind. Such
  control manifests as desire and aversion, it results in a lack of both inner peace and
  outer harmony. It is this Ego that seeks to acquire possessions, manipulate others and
  exploit the environment. Its aim is its own happiness but it invariably produces
  suffering. It craves for satisfaction but it experiences discontent. Such deep- rooted
  suffering cannot come to an end until one sees, through deep and powerful meditation, that
  the idea 'me and mine' is no more than a mirage. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">These seven topics are a sample of what the Buddha taught.
  Now, to complete this brief sketch of Buddhism, let's look at how these Teachings are
  practised today. </font></p>
  <h3><font color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">Types of Buddhism</font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One could say that there is only one type of Buddhism and
  that is the huge collection of Teachings that were spoken by the Buddha. The original
  Teachings are found in the 'Pali Canon', the ancient scripture of <em><b>Theravada
  Buddhism</b></em>, which is widely accepted as the oldest reliable record of the Buddha's
  words. Theravada Buddhism is the dominant religion in Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia
  and Laos. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Between 100 to 200 years after the passing away of the
  Buddha, the Sangha (the monastic community) split over the political question of 'Who runs
  the Sangha?' A controversy over some monastic rules was decided by a committee of Arahats
  (fully Enlightened monks or nuns) against the views of the majority of monks. The
  disgruntled majority resented what they saw as the excessive influence of the small number
  of Arahats in monastery affairs. From then on, over a period of several decades, the
  disaffected majority partially succeeded in lowering the exalted status of the Arahat and
  raising in its place the ideal of the Bodhisattva (an unenlightened being training to be a
  Buddha). Previously unknown scriptures, supposedly spoken by the Buddha and hidden in the
  dragon world, then appeared giving a philosophical justification for the superiority of
  the Bodhisattva over the allegedly 'selfish' Arahat. This group of monks and nuns were
  first known as the 'Maha Sangha', meaning 'the great (part) of the monastic community'.
  Later, after impressive development, they called themselves the '<em><strong>Mahayana</strong></em>',
  the 'Greater Vehicle' while quite disparagingly calling the older Theravada 'Hinayana',
  the 'Inferior Vehicle'. Mahayana still retains most of the original teachings of the
  Buddha (in the Chinese scriptures these are known as the 'Agama' and in the Tibetan
  version as the 'Kangyur') but these core teachings were mostly overwhelmed by layers of
  expansive interpretations and wholly new ideas. The Mahayana of China, still vibrant in
  Taiwan, reflects an earlier phase of this development, the Mahayana of Vietnam, Korea and
  Japan (mostly Zen) is a later development, and the Mahayana of Tibet and Mongolia is a
  much later development still. </font></p>
  <h3><font color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">Buddhism's relevance to the world today</font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Today, Buddhism continues to gain ever wider acceptance in
  many lands far beyond its original home. Here in Australia, many Australians through their
  own careful choice are adopting Buddhism's peaceful, compassionate and responsible ways. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddhist Teaching of the Law of Kamma offers our
  society a just and incorruptible foundation and reason for the practice of a moral life.
  It is easy to see how a wider embracing of the Law of Kamma would lead any country towards
  a stronger, more caring and virtuous society. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Teaching of Rebirth places this present short lifetime
  of ours in a broader perspective, giving more meaning to the vital events of birth and
  death. The understanding of Rebirth removes so much of the tragedy and grief surrounding
  death and turns one's attention to the quality of a lifetime, rather than its mere length.
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">From the very beginning, the practice of meditation has
  been at the very heart of the Buddhist Way. Today, meditation grows increasingly popular
  as the proven benefits to both mental and physical well being become more widely known.
  When stress is shown to be such a major cause of human suffering, the quieting practice of
  meditation becomes ever more valued. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Today's world is too small and vulnerable to live angry
  and alone, thus the need for tolerance, love and compassion is so very important. These
  qualities of mind, essential for happiness are formally developed in Buddhist meditation
  and then diligently put into practice in everyday life. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Forgiveness and gentle tolerance, harmlessness and
  peaceful compassion are well known trademarks of Buddhism, they are given freely and
  broadly to all kinds of beings, including animals of course, and also, most importantly,
  to oneself. There is no place for dwelling in guilt or self-hatred in Buddhism, not even a
  place for feeling guilty about feeling guilty! </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Teachings and practices such as these are what bring about
  qualities of gentle kindness and unshakeable serenity, identified with the Buddhist
  religion for 25 centuries and sorely needed in today's world. In all its long history, no
  war has ever been fought in the name of Buddhism. It is this peace and this tolerance,
  growing out of a profound yet reasonable philosophy, which makes Buddhism so vitally
  relevant to today's world. </font></p>
