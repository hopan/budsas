      <TD WIDTH="100%"><FONT SIZE="6">H</FONT>arold Musson was an only child, 
      born in army barracks in Aldershot, England in 1920. His father was a rich 
      man owning coalmines in Wales, who commanded a battalion of the British 
      Army in Burma where Harold spent a few years as a child of 7 years.
      <P>One day, he asked, &quot;Who is the Buddha?&quot; and when told, 'The Buddha was 
      a man who sat under a tree and got enlightened&quot;, the little boy had said, 
      &quot;That is what I want to do!&quot; Harold graduated from Cambridge University at 
      the age of 21 years with First Class Honours in Modern Languages and in 
      mathematics. </P>
      <P>In the last World War, he served as a captain assigned to interrogate 
      prisoners of war in Italy. In 1945, he fell ill and in his hospital bed in 
      Sorrento, he read the book 'La Dottrina del Risveglio' by Julius Evola, a 
      born Catholic. Evola had written that his aim was to illuminate the true 
      nature of original Buddhism, weakened to the point of obscurity in 
      subsequent forms whereas the essential spirit of the doctrine was 
      determined by a will for the unconditioned, confirmed by investigation 
      that leads to mastery over life and death. Impressed by the book, and by 
      Evola, a well-known rebel in Italy and Germany, Harold translated it to 
      English as the ' The Doctrine of Awakening - A Study in Buddhist Ascesis'. 
      [Luzac, London, 1951]. </P>
      <P>Osbert Moore was with Harold in Italy at the time. [See biography of 
      Nanamoli Thera]. After the war, Harold had no need to do a job. He led a 
      bohemian life indulging in 'wine, women and song', chain smoking 40 
      cigarettes a day, when, walking in Hyde Park one evening, he gave up 
      smoking with grim determination. </P>
      <P>The words of the Buddha on self-discipline haunted him and he saw the 
      futility of his mode of life as a rich playboy. So when he met his army 
      friend Osbert at a London pub one night, they both decided to explore the 
      Teaching of the Buddha. They arrived in Ceylon in 1948 and became pupils 
      of Venerable Nyanatiloka Maha Thera of the Island Hermitage, Dodanduwa. 
      Harold, ordained as Nanavira, and later studied under Palane Sri 
      Vajiranana Maha Nayake Thera of Vajiraramaya (to whom he dedicated the 
      only book he wrote). </P>
      <P>Nanavira from his young days, was a person who regarded other people 
      not as 'we' but as 'they' and was inclined to solitude. He did not like 
      curious visitors at the Hermitage, and because of a bowel disorder, he 
      went to various aranyayas [forest monasteries]. He regarded them a charade 
      and found the ideal place in the Bundala Forest Reserve, 13 miles away 
      from Hambantota. </P>
      <P>A local dayaka, [lay supporter], Mr. Hilton Perera, helped to build a 
      zinc shed. Bundala is supposed to be the village of the washerwomen and 
      men of Dutugemunu. It was then a remote, poor community living in wattle 
      and daub houses. The gravel road off the highway to Tissamaharama, running 
      in a straight line through sand and scrub and forest and lagoons where 
      flamingos nest when it is winter in Europe, ended in a fishing wadiya 
      [camp]. About halfway is a culvert over a shallow perennial pond of water, 
      and hidden by thorn brush and gnarled trees, is a narrow footpath to the 
      kuti with a corridor and one room of brick and mud, built later. Here 
      Nanavira Thera lived, strived, achieved and died. </P>
      <P>Nanavira started to beg for his food and meditate 14 hours a day. He 
      was more than 6 feet tall, with a handsome figure, like a statue of the 
      Buddha. My striking memory is the metta [loving-kindness] in his eyes and 
      satisampajanna [mindfulness &amp; awareness] in everything he did. There was 
      nothing that he wanted whenever I asked him, except medicine for his 
      illness, though I once saw him writing with a pencil stub about one inch 
      long. </P>
      <P>His mother came to take home her only son because she was lonely after 
      the father died, and when he refused, she flew home and died in two weeks. 
      He was twice brought to Colombo to syringe mud from his ears from bathing 
      in muddy water at the culvert and for swelling of the knee joints from 
      relentless anapanasati [in-out breathing meditation] on a hard cement 
      floor. He later damaged his sciatic nerve permanently. </P>
      <P>The villagers regarded him as their 'living god' and took his dana 
      [morning and noon meals] to the kuti by sharing the days between them. The 
      Buddha says, 'Seclusion is happiness to one who is contented, has learnt 
      and seen the Dhamma'. Nanavira Thera attained Sotapatti [Path entry] on 27 
      June 1959 and wrote the following letter in classical Pali, sealed it, <I>
      'To be opened after my death' </I>and sent to the senior monk at the 
      Island Hermitage: - </P>
      <I>
      <P>'Homage to the Auspicious One, Worthy, Fully Awakened. </P>
      <P>At one time the monk Nanavira was staying in a forest hut near Bundala 
      Village. It was during this time, as he was walking up and down in the 
      first watch of the night, that the monk Nanavira made his mind quite pure 
      of constraining things, and kept thinking and pondering and reflexively 
      observing the Dhamma as he had heard and learnt it. Then, while the monk 
      Nanavira was thus engaged in thinking and pondering and reflexively 
      observing the Dhamma as he had heard and learnt it, the clear and 
      stainless Eye of the Dhamma arose in him: 'Whatever has the nature of 
      arising, all that has the nature of ceasing'. Having been a 
      teaching-follower for a month, he became one attained to right view. 
      [27.6.59]'</I>. </P>
      <P>These books, he later wrote, contain the Buddha's Teaching -- they can 
      be trusted absolutely from beginning to end: <I>'(Vinayapitaka:) 
      Suttavibhanga, Mahavagga, Culavagga; (Suttapitaka:) Dighanikaya, 
      Majjimanikaya, Samyuttanikaya, Anguttaranikaya, Suttanipata, Dhammapada, 
      Udana, Itivuttaka, Theratherigatha. No other books whatsoever can be 
      trusted. Leaving aside Vinaya, seek the meaning of these in your own 
      experience. Do not seek their meaning in any other books: if you do, you 
      will be misled'.</I> He rejected the Abhidhammapitaka, the commentaries 
      and texts as 'leaving less to be unlearned' and also as not being the 
      words of the Buddha. </P>
      <P>The letter was irresponsibly opened in 1964, one year before he took 
      his own life. He inhaled from a vial of ethyl chloride my mother had 
      supplied after he used one I gave him to use as a local anesthetic for 
      inflamed painful insect bites. He anesthetized himself by wearing an 
      ingenious handmade cellophane facemask. When found by a villager who went 
      with the afternoon beverages, Nanavira Thera was dead, sleeping in the 
      lion's pose, one hand fallen beside the empty vial gently laid on the 
      floor. </P>
      <P>He died on 5th July 1965. Photographs taken one year before, and an 
      eyewitness Ven. Nanasumana tells, &quot;He is an old man of 60 years. He is in 
      constant physical pain but never shows it nor does the peace in his eyes 
      ever change. We spend many hours talking - rather he speaks and I learn&quot;. 
      He was only 44 years! I am shocked to see the emaciated gaunt frame and 
      realise that the bowel condition he had may be, become malignant. </P>
      <P>The entire village mourned. They built a pyre 8 feet high. The women 
      gave their best sarees to drape it and they interned his ashes by the 
      kuti, beside his sanctuary by the sea. Thus ended the life of a solitary 
      genius. No serpent ever harmed him. They would uncoil, move away and watch 
      him pass and wild elephants yet guard his kuti. Nanavira Thera is the 
      legend of Bundala. </P>
      <P>Nanavira Thera used his linguistic skills and disciplined thinking to 
      write on Dhamma when he found that he could not proceed to arahatta. </P>
      <P>With no hope of Nibbana here and now, unable to practise intense 
      samadhi, condemned to a life sentence of pain and distraction, poisoned by 
      the medicine he was given, he wrote, <I>'The only thing I take seriously 
      is the Dhamma. If I cannot practice it as I want, I have no further wish 
      to live&quot;</I>. He rejected an offer of a holiday in London and a suggestion 
      to disrobe. </P>
      <P>He said it is <I>'death in the Dhamma'</I> and no one <I>'has become 
      arahat in the act of disrobing'</I>. Some jealous persons, who cannot get 
      within a mile of him and of the Path, mislead that Nanavira Thera could 
      not have understood the Dhamma - as if the many arahats who took the knife 
      in the time of the Buddha also failed to understand it. Or, that the 
      dialogues of Socrates have no value because he drank poison rather than 
      escape as his friends arranged. All have failed and none has been 'accused 
      of writing the most important book of the century'. </P>
      <P>The truth is in the only book he wrote, 150 pages of 'Notes on Dhamma', 
      250 copies of which were cyclostyled by Lionel Samaratunga, High Court 
      Judge, Balapitiya in 1964. </P>
      <P>The brilliance of Nanavira Thera comes alive to us now when his 
      writings are scrutinized in the expanded book 'Clearing the Path' 
      published in 1987 by the American Samanera [novitiate monk] Bodhesako with 
      assistance from the Department for Creative Writing, University of 
      Colorado. He included 150 selected letters Nanavira Thera wrote to readers 
      who asked to explain items in the 'Notes'. In Europe, it was reviewed 'the 
      most important book of the century' - and Nanavira became a cult figure.
      </P>
      <P>'Clearing the Path' is a difficult book but no less than the Suttas.
      </P>
      <P>Like the Buddha, he used his background education to communicate. There 
      are many western classical quotations, aphorisms, wit and humor written to 
      an elite familiar with writings of Huxley, Joyce, Sartre, Kierkegaard, 
      Kafka, Nietzche and others of that genre. He uses his mathematical and 
      analytical skills, the Laws of Thought and logic to demolish comparisons 
      of Dhamma with quantum mechanics and with the ideas of scientists 
      egregiously quoted by some people to offer character certificates to the 
      Buddha. </P>
      <P>He laments that <I>'people and even monks in Ceylon do not read the 
      Suttas and are ignorant of what the Buddha actually taught'</I>. The 
      European he says, has excess of panna [wisdom] over saddha [faith] and 
      tends to reject things even when true while the Asian with excess of 
      saddha over panna accepts things even when false! </P>
      <P>Venerable Nanavira Thera wrote <I>'my aim is to clear dead matter that 
      is choking the Suttas...and if I do not write it, no one else will'</I>. 
      He has severely criticized well-known scholars such as Rhys Davids, 
      Wijesekera, and Jayatilelke who misconstrue the teaching of the Buddha. 
      Nanavira Thera has given unique precise interpretations of selected core 
      Dhamma such as paticcasamuppada, sankhara, cetana, atta, upadana, 
      namarupa, vinnana, avijja, phassa, the tilakkhana and demolished hallowed 
      traditional books such as Milindapanha &amp; Visuddhimagga. </P>
      <P>The unbiased intelligent reader with a compelling personal reason to 
      study and practice Dhamma is invited to accept his point of view. </P>
      <P>'Clearing the Path' is out of print and I have arranged to publish it 
      in its two separate parts, Vol. I 'Notes' &amp; Vol. II 'Letters', [from 
      photographing the original] by the Buddhist Cultural Centre, Anderson 
      Road, Dehiwela, Sri Lanka with a Foreword &amp; Introduction by my friend, Dr. 
      John Stella, a lecturer in Western Classics in the USA. . </P>
      <P>The book is translated to Dutch and Serbian. All of 576 pages can be 
      downloaded in digital form from the Internet. <I>(See
