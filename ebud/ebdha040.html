<i>This talk was given one evening at the first conference of
Western Buddhist teachers with His Holiness the Dalai Lama, in
Dharamsala, India, March 1993. The reader should imagine a circle
of 25 Buddhist Westerners from several different continents, all
of whom have been teaching for some years. During the course of
the talk, which is at the end of a long day of discussions,
several power cuts occur (this is India. . .), plunging the room
into ever deepening darkness. Eventually Robert Thurman, now
Professor of Indo-Tibetan Buddhist studies at Columbia
University, is persuaded to rise and speak. He is a towering,
shambling, golden whirlwind of a man -- the reader should
therefore regard some of the sweeping statements and
generalizations, as well as some of the liberally rendered
scriptural quotes, as part of the ribald gusto and good-humored
extemporization on important themes that is the beloved
Professor's style ... </i>

<P><HR width="50%"><P>

I was the first monk that His Holiness ordained. I was his first
experiment and, of course, I was a failure because I resigned my
vows about a year and a half after I was ordained, although I had
lived several years before that as a celibate. I therefore have
about three and a half years of monk-time logged, but only one
and a half of formal ordination. Then, being an ex-monk, I became
a kind of 'anti-monk' intellectually; I decided that the New Age
had dawned -- it was the late 60's -- and there was no more need
for monks and nuns or monasteries or any of that. Shambhala was
just around the corner and all these monolithic institutions
could be swept away. . . I then had a long time of studying
different things, thinking about engaged Buddhism and teaching
things over and over again, as a Buddhist academic does. 
<p>
I should say before that I had decided that I felt compelled to
teach the Dharma since the only thing in life I loved was the
Dharma; it had been a saving grace to me and I still think that
it is the only thing the world needs. So I figured that the only
place left to do it was in the universities, and at least there
some people would have a chance to learn something about it and I
would have an excuse to keep studying it, too. In the process of
studying the history of Buddhism and teaching Buddhist texts
again and again, and sending a lot of people from classes to
meditation centers, I discovered, in the early 80's, that
monastic institutions were to me the most revolutionary and the
most important of institutions. When I reported this to His
Holiness he just laughed and laughed. "What is this?" he said.
"An ex-monk is now going on and on about monasteries? You can
afford to do that now. You know, with your beloved wife and your
four children, that now you're safe -- you'll never be back! You
can go and promote them as much as you want, knowing you won't
have to go there -- ha, ha, ha. . ." He thought that was very
funny. 
<p>
We were also talking then about his frustration with the
conservatism within the monastic communities -- not only the
Tibetan ones but others, too -- and how they were acting as
though they were still in their original cultural matrix in Asia
and were unwilling to modify things, and so on. He wished to find
some kind of basis on which they could improve things but he did
not really have the time to do that. So slowly I began to
organize, at Amherst, what I called "monasticism conferences." I
brought a lot of Christian and Buddhist monastics of different
traditions, a few Hindus and a few Sufis, together in conference
after conference. 
<p>
We had over half a dozen conferences and they began to discover,
beyond ideology, at a level of practice and daily living, that
there was a real commonality. The monastic effort, irrespective
of religious ideology, was a globe-spanning effort that had been
trying to restrain what I consider has been the arch-enemy of
monasticism for thousands of years -- the other global,
universalizing institution that started when the Buddha started
monasticism -- militarism. Modern militarism also began 2,500
years ago, with Ajatashatru, the King of Magadha, the empire
building of the Kamineds, and the Axial Age, the Trojan War and
all that. It's actually been neck and neck ever since then, if
you look at the planet in a global way. 
<p>
Discovering that was a terrible shock, because if you follow the
traditional Buddhist view that the existence of the Dharma on the
planet depends upon its rootedness in a Sangha which includes the
four-fold Sangha of Bhikshu, Bhikshuni, Upasaka and Upasika, you
see that there is practically no Buddhism left. It was destroyed
and wiped out in almost every country -- apart from two or three
Theravadan countries and a couple of secularized countries. There
are a few monasteries in Japan, for example, but the Vinaya was
destroyed there a century ago by forcing all the monks to marry,
which was a government policy to disempower the monasteries,
though that might be shocking to hear for modern Zen Buddhists.
It has become important in my mind that we rediscover this. 
<p>
* * * 
<p>
I feel one of the things we have a tremendous lack of in our
Buddhism in the West is knowledge. It is very fortunate that
Western populations became fascinated with Buddhism through
contacting what I call 'the three educations': ethics, meditation
and wisdom (I don't like the word training', which I consider an
army word, or one for experimental rats or dogs). But the central
education of samadhi is the one that has really caught the
Western masses. That is very good and very necessary. It is, of
course, the central one of the three. There is a great lack of
knowledge on the wisdom side and on the ethical side and a base
of knowledge needs to be built. I feel that, although I myself do
not know that much about the Vinaya, if we learn more about it we
will find that just as the Buddhist tradition produced that
magnificent repertoire of meditational teachings that have been
so illuminating and so liberating for so many of us, Buddhism
taught many things about society and about organizations and
communities that will also be liberating. 
<p>
It is our typical Western thing to think, "Oh well, yes,
meditation, we've got that from Buddhism but we're Westerners and
so we know about organizations, and of course about intellectual
matters." We may find that Buddhist civilization has a lot to
contribute to us on both of those other levels, just as it did on
the meditational level. 
<p>
So I think we have to work on our own knowledge base. I would
therefore like to invite everyone to Columbia University, or to
whatever other venue, and to gather some academics, because they
too have quite a lot of knowledge about different Vinaya
practices in Buddhist countries. The Vinaya was transformed by
very enlightened masters when they went to China and to different
countries; they modified it to suit the country. 
<p>
Remember that in the first instance the Buddha refused to
establish the Patimokkha in one sitting by just spouting it. He
said, "No, Buddhas don't just give a dogmatic set of rules. They
wait until problems arise in the community; they wait for the
law-suits and then they give rulings which define the focus for
the community." That gives the basis for creating a flexible
Vinaya. On the other hand, we shouldn't be like modern people and
think that we need to reinvent the wheel. We should discover how
they were modified in relation to earlier circumstances and then
we can extrapolate that into our present circumstance. I would
like to offer that as a suggestion, although I think that it is a
long process. 
<p>

<p>
Shakyamuni Buddha was an engaged Buddhist -- there cannot be any
question. He was unengaged for about a week or two under the
trees in the Bodhi forest. In the Tibetan tradition they have him
saying this thing about "How profound, deep, peaceful,
untroubled... clear light... how neat, I love this... like an
elixir of immortality... I'm totally stoned out here in the
woods." And then he says, "Oh, I don't think I should tell this
to anybody because whoever I tell it to certainly won't
understand it." That was his unengaged Buddhism; he had about
five minutes of it. Then Brahma and Indra showed up and said,
"Hey, come on, get down there." So he walks to Saranath to found
a monastery -- that is engaged Buddhism. We think of a monastery
as a place for dead people. We have to realize that our culture
is formed by Protestantism. Martin Luther slammed the
monasteries, saying, "Shut down all the monasteries in northern
Europe." So you shut down the counter-force against militarism on
the planet in those countries of northern Europe and what
happens? The planet gets conquered by a bunch of berserk
militarists. That is what we have been doing, and America is the
most rabidly berserk militarist country in history; even with our
ideals of liberty, we have the biggest army and defense system
and the most nuclear weapons. It's totally unbelievable. Look at
the business in Iraq. 
<p>
I admit it's a weird analysis (and my sociological colleagues
blink when I tell them about it) but if you remove monasticism
from a social mix, what happens is that all the productive energy
of people has nowhere to go but into over-production of
everything. So they go out and conquer the whole world. No one
wants to produce a spiritual state to invert and internalize the
energy, to produce a different, higher world, so they just
transform this world and they wreck the whole place -- it is
within an inch of being wrecked, as we know. 
<p>
Therefore, the Buddha was like the founder of a peace corps. We
have to stop seeing him as some pious person in the hills, just
speaking in dulcet tones. The Buddha was founding a peace corps
and was risking being burnt at the stake. He said, "Hey, go out
and tell everyone the gates to Nirvana are OPEN. Tell people from
any caste." Don't forget that Buddha was a West Point-er. He was
29; he was a military cadet in a palace. Princes in India studied
in the army, in warfare; they were Kshatriya -- the
warrior-nobles. So naturally when he wanted to conquer the world
for the Dharma he wanted an army. 
<p>
* * * 
<p>
In the near future there will be more wars like this one in Iraq,
I fear. So to meet (Bhikkhu) Amaro and to hear about his
community was such a treat for me, because the idea of going back
to the primary thing is important. Remember how one was
originally ordained by the Buddha -- the Buddha just said, "Ehi
bhikkhu" -- that's all. "Come here, beggar. Come here,
mendicant." 
<p>
Now, enlightenment is the deconstruction of identity. If you
attain enlightenment, in a way you don't even know who you are
any more, much less "Where am I going to wash the dishes?" You
might even wonder "What is my name?" If you have no idea of what
your name is, you might as well have no hair and wear a weird
robe because you don't even know who you are. If he is going to
teach you something that will give you the realization of the
total deconstruction of identity, he has to take care of you and
reconstruct some sort of useful pattern within your own
relativities -- because otherwise he is not fulfilling his
responsibility. 
<p>
This is the purpose of the Vinaya. He can't just deconstruct your
identity and leave you standing in the middle of the traffic. So
he would say "Ehi bhikkhu" and your hair flew off and your robes
would change. There you were, floating around happily, living
your life as a monk, and people would give you a free lunch. 
<p>
So we have to go back to the primary thing and forget all that
nonsense about hierarchy and who is the big boss -- that is all
nonsense. The Buddha was deconstructing the serious Brahmanical
family/father/patriarch/serious authority/guru business and was
liberating people. He was not putting them under rules and
authorities at all. In all of the cultures where it has become
like that -- if you feel that the Buddhist monastic orders are
solely trying to prop up the culture -- I am sure that we are
just seeing corruption in the tradition. Essentially, they are
all trying to unravel the culture they are in. 
<p>
My appeal to you is, in the process of your work, please try at
least to entertain what is, I grant you, this slightly demented
vision: that the most activist thing -- the peace movement, the
engaged movement -- would be if one group of Westerners could
crank up the generosity to provide a permanent free lunch to any
group of people who want to take serious ordination -- even if
they're not that brilliant, not that great a yogi, not a great
intellectual scholar. Remember that the key to monasticism is
that you can be useless. You can be honored and supported for
simply restraining certain negativities. By doing that, you
represent a channel to Nirvana for other people and the
generosity they devote to you is an essential practice for them
-- it is not just some side thing they do now, and then later
they do real practice. Dana is the first paramita; it is
practice. 
<p>
If you build a monastery at Spirit Rock, I hope it will be called
"Free Lunch Monastery". There is almost no such thing in the
West. Everyone in a monastery is justifying their existence --
"We are offering services; we are going to do 'Dying'; we will
help you; we will have therapy. . ." It is always the production
thing of our barbaric Protestant civilization. Everyone has to
work and justify themselves because there is no ounce of
Dharmakaya anywhere -- that's elsewhere, out there with Jehovah,
some place outside. You have to do something all the time -- so
if you are going to be a monk, you have got to do something and
produce. But the beautiful thing about Buddhist monasticism is
the acknowledgment by people that any human being is like a
flower, and of total value in itself. Even if they do not do
anything positive but just genuinely and sincerely restrain their
negativities -- put the iron wall of the monk's robe of corpse
cloth around themselves -- they will be developing, and they will
represent a point of positive development for the whole
community. 
<p>
* * * 
<p>
That is a deep, foundational vision, not a superficial, social
vision, and I hope that you will all work with His Holiness over
the next 40 years of conferences and we will develop one
free-lunch monastery in the Protestant West. That would be the
turning point for this battle between monasticism and militarism,
which monasticism, at the moment, has lost the planet is totally
devoted to militarism. When militarism shows its real face, when
the Bosnias have spread, people will be ready to go into that
mentality of "face your death, drop your identity, drop your
hair, get out there on the English street-corners with your bowl
and wait until someone drops something other than bird-shit into
it or else be willing to starve". That's the key. Your life is on
the line, you are not going to produce anything but a spiritual
state and therefore people will feed you. That way they recognize
the value of you as an individual achieving a spiritual state.
That is the foundation of real individualism, real generosity and
social Dharma practice, to which individual Dharma practice must
lead in order for it to have any positive result. 
<p>

<p>
<b>Q:</b> How do you see the role of modern lay people? 
<p>
<b>A:</b> The role of modern lay people is just as it is -- go straight
ahead, gung ho. But they are also empowered by having monastics.
They can move back and forth between them and they are empowered
by that. 
<p>
Lay people are ready to meditate, to live differently, be
eccentric and non-conformist in their Western countries. They are
ready to challenge their own mind and go into their unconscious.
Why can they not explore the paramita of Dana and try to break
out of the mold of the Protestant culture where you never give
anybody something for nothing? You give them something for
nothing -- just let them wear a rag or two, that's something.
Shave their hair and look grubby and then give them something.
There are a lot of homeless people in Western countries and the
monastics can be like honored homeless people. That kind of
generosity will enrich the Western people immeasurably. 
<p>
"I" am not IT -- "I" am not the center of my community. Why are
we supposed to be the center? In Buddhism we are learning not to
be the center of everything. We are learning to de-centrify
ourselves. Even to have a person who is an idiot and support them
with a free lunch because they are doing some minimal, exemplary
self-restraint activities and cutting down on the usual
reactionaryism of people, is of tremendous benefit to us. To
proclaim "I wish to be useless" in the world of samsara is the
beginning of liberation. To allow people to do nothing, in a
society that is collectivist and demands production and obedience
from all of its members in some rigid type of control system, is
a kind of total liberation.
