<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>This message is for relative beginners to Buddhism. It
  may be insufficiently sophisticated for the tastes of advanced practitioners, seasoned
  scholars and self-styled lobsters. It is also long, so you may wish to print it out and
  read it at your leisure</i>.<br>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhism comes in a bewildering variety of schools and
  traditions, and a necomer can spend quite some time being lost in apparently meaningless
  detail. Even after thirty years of studying Buddhism as an academic and practising in
  several different traditions, I still find myself overwhelmed by the complexity of it all
  and have long since resigned myself to having a very superficial understanding of most of
  Buddhism and an only slightly less superficial understanding of a few specific traditions.
  So, since my understanding is superficial, it may be of some use to a few others who are
  also just beginning to scratch the surface. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is helpful to think of Buddhism by picturing a very
  large and old tree. Such a tree usually has a single trunk, a number of main branches
  rising out of the trunk, some limbs on each branch, some twigs on each limb and some
  leaves on each twig. Beneath the surface of the earth is a root system that, like the part
  above the ground, branches into ever smaller units. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In imagining such a tree, think first of the single trunk
  that arises out of the roots and that supports all the many branches, limbs and twigs.
  This trunk is the action of going for refuge. It is the one thing that every Buddhist
  does, and it is the most important aspect of any Buddhist's study and practice. Every
  doctrine within Buddhism, every school and every practice can be seen as a particular
  outgrowth of this one essential action, which a Buddhist repeats again and again, namely,
  the action of going for refuge. In Pali this action is called <b>sarana-gamana</b>. Gamana
  means going. Sarana means shelter, support, help or guidance. Going for refuge to
  something means going to it for help and guidance and support. Almost invariably, it is
  something that one first does as a result of some crisis in one's life, some bit of
  unwelcome reality that one just cannot deal adequately with on one's own. So one turns to
  something outside oneself for help. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What makes a Buddhist a Buddhist is not just the fact of
  going for refuge. Most people go for refuge to something or another: acquaintances,
  alcohol, their careers, drugs, education, entertainment, experts, family, physical fitness
  clubs, psychiatrists, religion, sexual conquests, study, support <i>groups, travel, or
  even the zoo. <b>What makes a Buddhist a Buddhist is that he or she goes for refuge to the
  Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha.</b></i> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The three principal roots of the tree, therefore, are the
  Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha. But there is not any one single meaning to any of these
  words. Each of them has many meanings to a Buddhist, so we can imagine each of the three
  main roots in the root system sending out branches. To describe each main root in detail
  is not necessary just now. Let's just sketch out each one briefly. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The central root is <b>the Dharma</b>. This word has
  several meanings. The most important meaning in a Buddhist context is Nirvana, which is
  seen by all Buddhists as the greatest possible good. Nirvana means the eradication
  (uprooting) of the root causes of all dissatisfaction. All Buddhists are striving for that
  final elimination of dissatisfaction. So that is the principal meaning of dharma. But the
  word Dharma also means that which helps one to achieve that final goal of Nirvana. What
  helps one to achieve that goal is a positive and healthy mentality; a single word for that
  is the word &quot;virtue&quot;. So a secondary meaning of the word &quot;dharma&quot; is
  &quot;virtue&quot; in the sense of good character. But &quot;dharma&quot; also means that
  which helps one acquire virtue. So a tertiary meaning of &quot;dharma&quot; is a teaching.
  Any teachings that help one achieve Nirvana can be considered dharma, but usually
  Buddhists take refuge especially in the teachings preserved in the Sutras (recorded
  sermons and conversations of the Buddha and his most trusted male and female disciples)
  and in the Vinaya (the disciplinary code for monks and nuns, people who renounced the
  household life in order to dedicate all their time and energy to working for Dharma). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The other two main roots are <b>the Buddha and the Sangha</b>.
  There are several different views about what exactly the nature of a Buddha is, but
  everyone agrees that there have been many Buddhas throughout history and that the most
  recent was Siddhartha Gautama (or in Pali, Siddhattha Gotama), also know as the silent
  sage (muni) of the Sakiya (Sanskrit, Shakya) people; the Sakiyas were a tribal people,
  probably racially and certainly culturally distinct from the Aryans. So when Siddhartha
  Gautama went into the cities of Benares and so forth in the Ganges valley, he probably
  looked and talked like a foreigner and acted in ways that people found a bit odd. There
  are several texts in which people comment on the fact that he is a barbarian and therefore
  unworthy of the kind of respect that one normally shows to civilized people. But, despite
  his foreign origins and a certain amount of prejudice against him, the Buddha managed to
  win the the respect of quite a few important people, including several Kings and military
  leaders and wealthy merchants and learned scholars of his day. All of these people
  respected him as a teacher and guide. So when one goes for refuge to the Buddha, one
  honours him as the best teacher of human beings and gods, the finest man to walk on two
  feet. In other words, he is a Buddhist's principal role model. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The word <b>&quot;Sangha&quot;</b> means a group or
  community. The Sangha to which a Buddhist goes for refuge is the <b>ariya-sangha</b>,
  which means the Noble Community of people who have attained insight and virtue and who
  have either attained or come very close to attaining Nirvana. It is important to realize
  that not all members of the Noble Community are monks or nuns, and that not all monks or
  nuns are members of the Noble Community. So a Buddhist does not go for refuge to the
  community of monks or nuns or even to the community of people who declare themselves to be
  Buddhists, but to the community of all excellent people everywhere whose insight and
  purity of character is significantly superior to that of the average human being. The word
  &quot;Sangha&quot; can also refer to other communities, such as the community of monks
  (bhikkhu-sangha), the community of nuns (bhikkhuni-sangha), the community of householders
  who support the monks and nuns (upasaka-sangha) and to the entire community of people who
  heard the Buddha and formally went to him for refuge (savaka-sangha). Sometimes some
  Buddhists find it convenient to think of the community of Buddhists as a whole as a kind
  of concrete symbol of the much more abstract notion of the Noble Sangha of excellent
  people to which they go for refuge. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">These three roots support the trunk of the tree, which is
  the single act of going for refuge, the essence of Buddhism as an organized religion.
  There are many different ways of going for refuge. Ultimately, you could say that there
  are as many ways as there have been individual Buddhists throught the history of Buddhism,
  because ultimately going for refuge is an individual decision that each individual has to
  figure out how to put into practice is his or her life. We can think of the individual
  Buddhists as the leaves on the tree. Leaves grow on twigs attached to limbs that grow out
  of branches out of the main trunk. So now let's look at the main branches. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The branches of the tree can be seen as being based mostly
  on collections of books that are believed to contain teachings of the Buddha and his most
  trusted disciples (and disciples of his disciples down through the ages). One main branch
  was known as the <b>Savaka</b> (Sanskrit Shravaka) branch. These people chose to base
  their practice on doctrines that were believed by everyone to be the public teachings of
  the Buddha to his monks and lay disciples. At one time there were many limbs of this
  Savaka branch, but only one of them has lived to modern times. That is the limb known as <b>Theravada</b>,
  which means the teachings of the elders. An elder is a monk who has been ordained for a
  minimum of ten years and who is acknowledged to have attained insight. Officially, the
  Theravada school is based only on what has been transmitted by these elders down through
  the ages. This body of teachings have been preserved in a pali, a word that means a
  straight line. The English word &quot;canon&quot; comes from a Greek word meaning a
  straight line or a straight-edge, so early translators of Buddhist texts translated the
  word &quot;pali&quot; as &quot;canon&quot; and reduntantly named the works of this school
  the Pali Canon. The language in which that canon is preserved is called the Pali language.
  While many Theravadin teachers admire and study and refer to individuals and writings that
  are not in the Pali canon, the framework within which all teachings are interpreted is
  provided by the Pali canon. The Theravada school exists nowadays in Sri Lanka (formerly
  called Ceylon), Myanmar (formerly called Burma), Thailand (formerly called Siam), Laos,
  Cambodia and parts of Vietnam. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A second branch of the tree is one that itself immediately
  branches into a lot of different limbs. What all the limbs on this branch have in common
  is that they accept the authority of texts that the Shravaka branch explicitly rejected as
  being the teachings of the historical Buddha. This branch can be called the <b>Mahayana</b>
  branch. The number of Mahayana texts is so large that no one can hope to read them all
  within a single lifetime, so usually Mahayana Buddhists specialize by focusing on just a
  few texts or sometimes only one text. The Zen school, for example, is said to have
  originally been based on the transmission of one text, called the Lankavatara Sutra (the
  full title of which means the introduction of the true dharma into Sri Lanka, a country
  that had both Theravada and Mahayana branches of Buddhism). The so-called Pure Land
  schools of Buddhism were based on texts describing beautiful realms into which one could
  be reborn in order to pursue dharma more easily than is possible in our difficult world.
  There are several twigs growing out of a limb known as Lotus Buddhism, which is based on
  the White Lotus of the True Dharma, a sutra that attempts to reconcile all the branches of
  Buddhism into one; one of the best known twigs on this limb is Nichiren Buddhism, out of
  which has grown a twiglet known as Soka Gakkai International, which has made quite an
  impact in the United States (and throughout the world) through its energetic
  prosyletizing. Quite a lot of these limbs interwine and grown together in various ways,
  rather like the tangled mess of a banyan tree or a briar patch. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mahayana Buddhism once thrived in China, Korea, Japan,
  Vietnam and Indonesia. It is now very weak in China and has been for most of this century.
  It has completely disappeared from Indonesia, which is now a Muslim country. Only about
  one-third of the population of Korea is still Buddhist; the majority of Koreans are now
  Christians. In Vietnam, there is now one single form of Buddhism, which resulted from
  combining Theravada and Mahayana into a single school. It has been considerably weakened
  by all the wars and revolutions in that country, and by the recent passion for
  modernization. In Japan interest in Buddhism is rapidly declining in most sectors of the
  population and is being displaced by hundreds of so-called New Religions (some of which
  pay at least a token respect to something vaguely Buddhist in character). It is quite
  possible that Mahayana Buddhism could disappear from Asia within the next twenty-five
  years. Sadly, this once-strong and healthy branch is now rotting and may collapse of its
  own weight. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third branch of the tree is the <b>Vajra</b> branch.
  (It might be more accurate to say this this is a limb growing out of Mahayana, but it has
  become distinctive enough to be regarded now as a separate branch unto itself.) The word
  vajra means a clap of thunder. It also means a diamond. The texts upon which this branch
  is based are known as tantras, so this form of Buddhism is also called Tantric Buddhism.
  Tantras are usually written in a kind of code so that their meaning is not apparent to
  someone who has not been initiated into them. Unlike other forms of Buddhism, tantric
  Buddhism is therefore esoteric. One cannot study it or practice it without a special
  teacher, who confers special baptisms (abhisheka) that give people a special grace or
  power by which they can put the teachings into practice. Tantric Buddhism is the main form
  of Buddhism in Tibet and Mongolia (which got it from Tibet). There are also tantric forms
  of Buddhism in China, which in turn transmitted tantric forms to Vietnam, Korea and Japan.
  Even forms of Buddhism that are not strictly speaking purely tantric (if there is such a
  thing) have been influenced by tantric thinking and some tantric practices. So, for
  example, Vietnamese Buddhism is now a very interesting and healthy synthesis of Theravada,
  several limbs of Mahayana such as Zen and Pure Land and scholasticism, and tantric
  Buddhism. Korean Buddhism is now a synthesis of Zen, Pure Land and various scholastic
  forms of Mahayana Buddhism, with elements of tantra appearing here and there. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The roots, the single trunk and the branches have now all
  been explained. All that remains is to discuss what the whole tree is made of. It is made
  of two ingedients, wood and sap. The wood, which is the substantial core of all Buddhism,
  is Wisdom. The sap, which keeps the tree alive by transmitting nourishment from the deep
  roots to the individual leaves, is Compassion. Without the sap of compassion running
  throughout the tree, the whole tree would quickly die. Without the wood of wisdom, the sap
  would have no means of flowing and would quickly evaporate. So neither can be seen as more
  essential than the other. The two together are the life force of the tree of dharma. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If I may, I would like to end by recommending two books,
  one that is full of information, and the other that has tips about practice. Both are
  easily ordered through your local bookstore or directly from their publisher, Windhorse
  Publications. </font></p>
