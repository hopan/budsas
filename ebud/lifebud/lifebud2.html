  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>COMPASSION </strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">After a short period of quiet reflection in a grove near
  the river bank where he had parted from Channa, the young Prince who was now only a
  wandering beggar, turned his steps southward towards the Magadha country, and in due time
  reached the chief city of that country, Rajagaha by name, where the King of the country,
  Bimbisara, had his principal palace. Here, with begging bowl in hand, Siddhattha went
  round the streets of the city, begging his food from door to door like any other religious
  mendicant. But he did not look like a common beggar. Those who saw him pass along could
  see by his very look that he was no ordinary religious mendicant, and they put into his
  bowl the best food they had. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he had gathered enough, the prince-beggar left the
  city again, and in a retired spot outside the walls, sat down to eat what he had
  collected. But O, what a meal it was! Never in his life before had he, a prince by birth,
  and accustomed to the best of food served up in the most attractive and tempting way, had
  such a mixed mess as this set before him. His stomach simply turned in disgust at the
  sight of that bowl full of scraps and portions of all kinds of different foods, all flung
  together into one dish. He simply could not bring himself to eat the repulsive mixture. He
  wanted to throw it away and eat nothing rather than such a mess. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And then he stopped and began to think: and this is what
  he thought and said to himself: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Siddhattha, you were born of a good family, in a
  king's house, where you got everything good to eat that you could wish, the very best of
  rice, the richest and tastiest of curries, in all abundance. But in spite of this you made
  up your mind deliberately to live the life of a homeless beggar, and fare the same as
  every such beggar fares on what-ever was given you by the charitable. And you carried out
  your resolve: you became a homeless beggar: yet now, what are you doing? You do not want
  to eat the food proper for homeless beggars to eat -- the food that is given them,
  whatever it may be. Do you think that is a right thing to do?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In these and in other words the prince-beggar reasoned
  with himself, chiding and scolding himself for his daintiness and fastidiousness in the
  matter of food, so unfitting in a beggar. And in the end, after a struggle with himself,
  he succeeded in overcoming his repugnance to the food lying in his bowl before him, and he
  ate it up without further ado, and never afterwards had any more trouble about eating what
  was given him to eat. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Meanwhile, the people of Rajagaha, King Bimbisara's city,
  were all talking about the new religious mendicant who had been begging in their streets
  that morning, he had looked so different from the common run of religious mendicants, so
  refined, so noble looking! The talk even reached the ears of King Bimbisara in his palace,
  and he sent his servants to make enquiries and find out who the stranger mendicant could
  be. Very soon his messengers learned all about Siddhattha, and came back and told their
  master that he was the eldest son of the King of the Sakyas, the heir to the throne; and
  that he had left everything behind him in order to become a beggar and try to discover if
  he could, some way that would lead men beyond the reach of old age and sickness and death.
  As his servants told King Bimbisara this, he listened to them very much perplexed. Never
  before had he heard of a religious mendicant looking for anything so strange, so
  extraordinary. But it sounded great and grand, and worthy of a prince's looking for it and
  perhaps is was not so impossible as it seemed, he thought. So he sent his men to ask the
  prince-beggar to stay in his city, and and he would provide a place for him to live in,
  and food, and everything else he required for his comfort; and he could settle down there
  and study and meditate and carry on his search. But Siddhattha declined the King's kind
  offer, saying that he could not stay still anywhere until he had found what he sought.
  After he had found it, perhaps then he might be able to stay in one place. So then the
  King made him promise that when he had found what he was seeking, he would come and stay
  in his city and let him and his people know about it first. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So the prince-beggar left Rajagaha behind him, and passed
  upon his wandering way into the open country towards a hill on which a great many hermits
  were living from whom he thought he might be able to learn something about life and death
  and how all the ills connected with them might be overcome. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And as he went along the road, he saw a cloud of dust
  coming down the mountain side, and heard the patter of feet; and then out of the dust
  there came into sight a herd of sheep and goats making their way to the plain. But behind
  them all, painfully limping along, came a little lamb, its leg hurt, and bleeding, but
  still trying hard to keep up with its mates. And when Siddhattha saw it, and noticed how
  anxious about it the mother sheep was, his heart was filled with pity. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">He picked up the little creature and walked alongside the
  rest of the sheep carrying the lame lamb in his arms. &quot;Poor little thing,&quot; he
  said, speaking to the lamb, &quot;I was going to join the hermits on the hills, but it is
  at least as good a deed to ease your little heart of suffering as to sit up there with
  these praying hermits.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then he saw the men who were driving the herd and he asked
  them where they were going and why they were driving their flocks away from pasture in the
  heat of the day instead of in the cool of the evening. They answered him that they had
  been ordered to bring a hundred sheep and a hundred goats down to the city during the day
  in order that they might be on hand and ready for the great sacrifice that was going to be
  offered that night by the King. &quot;I will go with you,&quot; said the prince-beggar;
  and he walked along with them and their flock, still carrying the lame lamb in his arms. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And now, as he came near to the riverside, a young woman
  came up to him, and after saluting him with great respect, said to him: &quot;O Reverend
  Lord, have pity on me and tell me where I shall be able to find that seed which keeps away
  death.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Siddhattha looked at her as if he would ask her what she
  meant. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The woman noticed his look, and went on: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Do you not remember, Lord? Yesterday I brought you
  my little son who was sick, so sick that he was near to dying, and asked your reverence if
  there was no medicine at all that would keep him alive, for he is my only son. And your
  reverence said yes, there was something that might save him from dying, if I could get it
  -- a tola's weight of black mustard seed got from a house in which no one ever had
  died.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And did you get that seed, sister?&quot; said
  Siddhattha with a tender, wistful smile. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Nay, Lord, I did not,&quot; said the woman sadly.
  &quot;I went round all our village to every house asking for black mustard seed, and
  everybody was very willing to give me some, but when I told them that I only wanted it
  from them if no one had ever died in their house, they said that that was a queer thing
  for me to say, for everybody knew there had been a death in their house, and sometimes
  more then one death. Some said a slave had died with them. In some houses it was the
  father who had died; in some the son; in some the mother; in some the daughter. But in
  every home, every house, some one had died. I could not get my seed. O Reverend Sir, tell
  me where I may get that seed before my little son dies. Are there no homes at all where
  death has not been?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;You have said it,&quot; Siddhattha answered the now
  weeping woman. &quot;In all the wide world there are no homes where death has not been.
  Now you have found this out for yourself. Now you know that yours is not the only grief in
  the world. Now you know with your own knowledge that all the world weeps along with you
  for some dear one dead. Go home and bury your child. As for me, sister, I go to find if I
  can, what will put an end to your and all men's sorrow; and if I find it, I will come
  again and tell it to you.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So Siddhattha passed on his way and entered the city along
  with the herd of animals that were going to be killed, and still went with them right up
  to the palace where the sacrifice was to be made. Here the King was standing with the
  priests all round him chanting their hymns to the gods; and soon the altar fires were lit
  and the priests made ready to kill the animals that had now arrived. But just as the chief
  priest was about to plunge his knife into the throat of the first goat that had been
  picked for the sacrifice, Siddhattha stepped forward and stopped him. &quot;No, Maharaja,'
  he said to King Bimbisara, &quot;do not let the priest strike that poor goat.&quot; And
  before any one knew what he was going to do, he untied the rope of grass with which it was
  fastened, and let it go back to its mates. And no one, not even the King nor the chief
  priest, thought of trying to stop him from doing it, so great and noble did he look as he
  set the goat free and allowed it to run back to the rest of its fellows. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the Prince-beggar began to speak to the King and the
  priests and all who had gathered there to see the great sacrifice of blood, about what a
  wonderful thing life is; how anybody can destroy it, but how impossible it is for any one
  to restore it once it has been destroyed. Every creature that lives, so he told those
  round him, is fond of its life, fears to die, just as much as men do. Why then should men
  use their power over these poor brothers of theirs only to rob them of what man himself is
  most fond of -- the wonderful thing, life. If men wish to receive mercy, he said, they
  ought to show mercy. If men kill, then according to the law that rules in the world, they
  will be killed. And what kind of gods, he asked them, can they be who are pleased with and
  take delight in blood? Certainly not good gods, he said. Rather they must be demons to
  take pleasure in suffering and death. No, he ended, if men wish to taste happiness
  themselves in the hereafter, they must not cause unhappiness to any living creature, even
  the meanest, here in this world. Those who sow the seed of unhappiness, of pain and
  suffering, will certainly have to reap a full-grown crop of the same in the future. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this way did Siddhattha speak to the King and the
  priests and people of Rajagaha, and did it so gently and kindly, and yet so powerfully,
  that the minds and hearts of the King and the priests were quite changed. There and then
  the King issued an order that henceforth throughout the whole of his Kingdom there were to
  be no more sacrifices in which living creatures were deprived of life. After this day,
  everybody in his realm, King and priests and people alike, were to offer to the gods only
  such gifts as did not involve the taking of any living creature's life. They were only to
  offer as sacrifices to gods, flowers and fruits and cakes, and other similarly bloodless
  offerings. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And now once more King Bimbisara begged Siddhattha to stay
  in his kingdom and teach him and his people the good way of kindliness and pity and
  compassion towards everything that has life. The prince-beggar thanked him for his kind
  offer but told him that he had not yet found what he was seeking, and until he had found
  it, he could not rest, but must still go on searching for it everywhere among all the wise
  men of India, in case any of them knew or in any way could help him in his search. </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">* * * </font></p>
  <h3 align="center"><font color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">Chapter VI </font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>FIRST ENDEAVORS </strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In those days in ancient India there were very, many
  different teachers of religion, the same as there are now, who took pupils and taught
  these pupils all they themselves knew. One of these religious teachers, well known for his
  knowledge and attainments, was called Alara Kalama, and to this teacher Siddhattha now
  went in order to learn what he had to teach. And Siddhattha stayed with Alara Kalama a
  long time and studied under him and practiced the practices his master taught him so
  diligently that at length he had learned and practiced everything his master knew and
  practiced. And his master Alara Kalama thought so highly of him and of his great ability
  that one day he said to him: &quot;Now you know everything I know. Whether you teach my
  doctrine or whether I teach it, it is all the same. You are the same as I: I am the same
  as you. There is no difference between us. Stay with me and take my place as teacher to my
  disciples along with me.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;But have you nothing more you can teach me?&quot;
  said Siddhattha. &quot;Can you not teach me the way to get beyond the reach of life and
  death?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;No,&quot; said Alara Kalama. &quot;That is a thing I
  do not know myself, so how can I teach it to you? I do not believe that anybody in the
  whole world knows that.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Alara Kalama only knew what he had already taught
  Siddhattha -- the way to a state of consciousness called &quot;the realm of neither
  perception nor nonperception,&quot; which was a very high state of consciousness, but one
  which does not save the man who reaches it from the necessity of being born, and therefore
  of growing old, and falling ill, and eventually dying, over and over again. So, very much
  disappointed, Siddhattha left his master Alara Kalama, and went away again to wander this
  way and that throughout the country, looking for some one who knew and could teach him
  more than he had learned from Alara Kalama. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And after a time he came to hear of another famous teacher
  of the name of Uddaka, who was said by everybody to possess great knowledge and powers. So
  Siddhattha now went to this Uddaka and became his pupil and diligently studied and
  practiced under him until as with Alara Kalama, he was as clever and learned as his
  master, and knew and practiced all that his master knew and practiced. And Uddaka also,
  just like Alara Kalama, was so pleased with Siddhattha's quickness and ability, that he
  also wanted him to stay with him, and along with him become the leader and teacher of his
  band of disciples. And Siddhattha asked him the same question that he had asked of Alara
  Kalama. He asked him if he had no more to teach him, if he could not teach him how to
  overcome birth and death and all the disagreeable things connected with the same. But
  Uddaka was in the same position as Alara Kalama in this matter. He did not know how men
  could get out of the round of birth and death altogether, and had never heard of any one
  who did know such a thing. So disappointed once more, Siddhattha took leave of Uddaka too,
  and made up his mind that he would not go to any more teachers to ask about what he wanted
  to know but henceforth would try to find it out for himself, by his own labor and efforts.
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now it was quite a common thing then in India, as indeed
  it still is to-day, for those men who leave their homes and follow a religious life to
  imagine that by going without food and making their bodies uncomfortable and miserable in
  a number of other ways, that they would earn the right to a long period of peace and
  happiness hereafter in the world of the gods. They thought that if only a man made himself
  unhappy enough here, he would make sure of being happy hereafter; and that the more
  unhappy he made himself now, the more happy he would be in the future. And they carried
  out this belief of theirs in actual practice just as many of them still do in India
  to-day. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some of them reduced the quantity of food they ate, little
  by little, day after day, until at last they were eating hardly anything at all, so that
  their poor bodies became mere skin and bones. Some practiced standing on one leg all the
  time until it turned stiff and lifeless with the continual strain. Others held one arm up
  in the air all the time until it withered and dried up through the blood not flowing into
  it properly in that unnatural position. Others, again, held their fists tightly clenched,
  never letting them loose, until the nails at the ends of their fingers actually grew into
  the palms of their hands, and through the flesh, and out at the backs of their hands!
  Others never lay down at night except on a bed of thorns, or else on a board with sharp
  nails all over it, their points sticking upwards. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And Siddhattha, because he was anxious and determined to
  find out what he wanted to know, and did not care how much trouble and pain he had to go
  through if only at last he might succeed, did very much the same as these other ascetics
  who were seeking religious truth. He did not know any better way than to do just as the
  others did. He honestly hoped and believed that if only he tortured and tormented his body
  enough, at last as reward he would obtain enlightenment of mind. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here is part of the story of what he did in those days, as
  he told it himself in after years to one of his foremost disciples, the Thera Sariputta. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I practiced the holding in of my breath,&quot; said
  the Buddha to Sariputta, &quot;until it made a great roaring in my ears, and gave me a
  pain in my head as if some one was boring into it with a sharp sword, or lashing me over
  the head with a leather whip. In my body also, I suffered pains as if a butcher were
  ripping me up with a knife, or some one had flung me into a pit of red-hot coals. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And then I practiced loneliness. On the nights of
  the new moon and of the full moon, I went out to lonely places among the trees where the
  dead lay buried, and stayed there all the night through hearing the leaves rustling and
  the twigs dropping when a breeze blew, with my hair all standing on end with fright. When
  a bird came and lighted on a bough, or a deer or other animal came running past, I shook
  with terror, for I did not know what it was that was coming up to me in the dark. But I
  did not run away. I made myself stay there and face the fear and terror I felt until I had
  mastered it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I also went without food. I practiced eating only
  once a day, then only once in two days, then only once in three days, and so on until I
  was only eating once in fourteen days. I have lived eating nothing but grass, nothing but
  moss, wild fruits and roots, wild herbs and mushrooms, wild rice, and the dust I scraped
  up of thrashing floors. I covered my body only with garments made out of rags from
  graveyards and dust-heaps, with old skins of animals that had died in the fields, with
  woven grass, with patches made of birds' wings and tails that I found lying here and
  there. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In the lonely forests I lived alone never seeing a
  human being for weeks and months. In winter, when it was cold at night, I stayed out in
  the open without a fire to keep me warm. And in the day-time, when the sun came out, I hid
  myself among the cold trees. And in the burning heat of summer, I stayed out by day in the
  open under the hot sun; and at night I went into the close, stifling thickets. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I also practiced what was called 'purification by
  food'. I lived on nothing but beans, then on nothing but sesamum seed, then on nothing but
  rice. And I reduced the quantity I ate of these day by day, until at last I was eating
  only one bean a day, one sesamum seed a day, one grain of rice a day. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And through eating so little food, my body became
  terribly thin and lean. My legs became like reeds, my hips like camel's hoofs. My backbone
  stood out on my back like a rope, and on my sides my ribs showed like the rafters of a
  ruined house. My eyes sank so far in my head that they looked like water at the bottom of
  a deep well and almost disappeared altogether. The skin of my head grew all withered and
  shrunken like a pumpkin that has been cut and laid out in the sun. And when I tried to rub
  my arms and legs to make them feel a little better, the hair on them was so rotted at the
  roots that it all came away in my hands. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And yet, Sariputta, in spite of all these pains and
  sufferings, I did not reach the knowledge I wanted to reach, because that knowledge and
  insight was not to be found that way, but could only be got by profound reasoning and
  reflection, and by turning away from everything in the world.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this way, for six or seven long years, Siddhattha put
  his body to all kinds of torment, thinking that by doing this, if only he went on long
  enough, at last he would get to know what he wanted, all the while wandering about here
  and there through the country of Northern India. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At length, in the course of these wanderings, he came to
  the land of Magadha again, to a nice quiet place in a bamboo grove beside a broad,
  smooth-flowing river, with a good bathing-place, and a village close by where he could
  easily go and beg food. He liked the look of this place as soon as he saw it. &quot;This
  is a good place to stay in,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;for any ascetic like myself
  who wants to strive and struggle for knowledge. Here I will stay.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So in this place, called Uruvela, Siddhattha now took up
  his fixed residence, under the trees meditating and striving hard, fasting and otherwise
  treating his poor body very badly, all in the hope that by such pains and endeavors he
  would gain a knowledge of the truth he sought. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Meanwhile there had gathered round him a little band of
  disciples who admired him very much as they saw how he starved himself and otherwise made
  himself undergo severe hardships. And these disciples, five in number, waited upon him and
  attended to his few wants, for they thought that an ascetic who could make himself suffer
  such pains and privations, and persevere in them as did Siddhattha, must be no common man.
  They thought, indeed, they felt sure, that an ascetic with so much endurance and
  determination, must be certain to get what he was looking for, and that when he had found
  it, then he would tell it to them, his pupils and followers. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But one day it happened that as he sat alone under a tree,
  the poor prince-ascetic, all worn out with fasting and hardships, and added to that, the
  strain of intense and prolonged meditation, fell down in a dead faint, and lay there on
  the ground so completely exhausted and without strength that perhaps he would never have
  risen again but died there just where he lay. Fortunately, however, a boy who was watching
  some goats near by happened to come along by the tree under which Siddhattha lay in a
  swoon; and when he saw the holy man lying there, the boy at once guessed that he was dying
  for want of proper food, for everybody round about knew that he was a very holy man, and
  went without food for days and days. So the boy ran back to his goats and brought up one
  of them, and milked some milk from its teats into the half-open mouth of the holy man,
  without touching him with his hands, for he did not dare, he a common herd-boy, to lay his
  hands on a saint. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Very soon the good, fresh milk began to produce its effect
  upon the half-dead Siddhattha. After a little while he was able to sit up, feeling very
  much better than he had felt for a long time. And he began to think about why it was he
  had fainted, and why he was now feeling so much refreshed in body and mind. And these are
  the thoughts that passed through his mind: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;O how foolish I have been! I left my wife and family
  and home and everything, and became a homeless wanderer because I wanted to get to know
  the truth about man's life and how he must live it to the best purpose. But in order to
  gain a knowledge so difficult to gain as this, I needed to have a brain and a mind as
  strong and vigorous as I possibly could get, so that I might be able to think and meditate
  steadily and strongly. And then I went and made my body weak and wretched with starvation
  and those other practices I practiced! But how can a man have a strong and healthy mind if
  his body is weak and miserable and unhealthy? O how foolish I have been to make myself
  weak just when I need all the strength I can get to carry through the great task I have
  set myself to perform! After this I shall eat all the food my body requires to keep it in
  god condition. I shall not eat too much, for that will make me dull and heavy and sleepy,
  and then I shall not be able to think and meditate properly. But I shall eat enough to
  keep me well and strong, so that I may have a clear, unclouded mind, and so perhaps, at
  last, I shall be able to gain the truth I want to reach.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, with thoughts like this in his mind, Siddhattha turned
  to the goat-herd boy who now was kneeling before him in veneration, and asked him if he
  would kindly give him a little more of his goat's milk in a dish, as it was doing him very
  much good. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;O Reverend Lord,&quot; said the boy, &quot;I cannot
  do that. I cannot give you milk in a dish that has been touched by my hand. I am only a
  common herd-boy of low caste, and you are a holy man, a Brahmin. If I were to touch you
  with anything I had touched, it would be a crime.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But Siddhattha replied: &quot;My dear boy, I am not asking
  you for caste: I am asking you for milk. There is no real difference between us two, even
  although you are a goat-herd and I am a hermit. It is blood that flows in the veins of
  both of us. If some robbers were to come and cut us both with swords, the blood that would
  flow from both our bodies would be of the same red colour. And if it went on running and
  nobody stopped it, we should both of us die with no difference between us. If a man does
  high and noble deeds, then he is a high and noble man. And if a man does low and ignoble
  deeds, then he is a low and ignoble man. That is all the real caste there is. You have
  done a good kind deed in giving me milk when I was almost dead for want of food; therefore
  you are of good caste to me. Give me some more milk in a dish.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The herd-boy did not know what to say to these strange but
  so very pleasant words from this extraordinary hermit who did not send him away from him
  because he was a low-caste herd-boy, but instead wanted more milk from him, and would take
  it out of a dish. But he went off, and soon came back with a bowl full of his best goat's
  milk which he joyfully offered to the kind hermit who had told him that he was of as good
  a caste to him. Then he took back his empty bowl, and after bowing down before the hermit
  and asking his blessing, went back glad and happy to his goats. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But the prince-ascetic, now thoroughly refreshed with the
  good drink of milk, sat on beneath the tree, meditating more successfully than he had done
  for a long time. And as he still sat there in the dark after the sun had gone down, he
  heard the sound of girls' voices singing. It was a band of professional singers and
  dancers going to a neighboring town to give an entertainment; and as they passed along
  close to where he sat, he distinctly heard the words of their song which was about the
  instrument they played when they sang, called a lute. They were saying, in their song,
  that if the strings of the lute were hung too slack, they made very poor music; and if
  they were stretched too tight, then they broke and made no music at all. Therefore, so
  they sang, it was best to stretch the strings neither too slack nor too tight, but just
  medium, and then they would give proper music. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;That is true what these girls sing,&quot; thought
  the prince-ascetic as he heard them. &quot;These girls have taught me something. I have
  been stretching the strings of my poor body far too tight this long time, and they have
  come very near to breaking altogether. If that boy had not come and brought me the milk
  to-day, I should have died, and then what would have become of my search for the Truth?
  There and then it would have come to an end. My search for that which I and all men need
  to know would have failed miserably just for want of a little food for my body. This harsh
  way of treating the body cannot be the proper way to find Truth. I will give it up at once
  and treat my body with proper care and attention henceforth.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So when, next day, a young woman called Sujata, who lived
  near by, came to him in his hermitage among the trees with a bowl full of extra good rice
  boiled with very good rich milk, which she had specially prepared for him, saying as she
  gave it to him: &quot;May you be successful in obtaining your wishes as I have been!&quot;
  He did not refuse her gift, but accepted it with pleasure, and felt the benefit of it at
  once in a greatly strengthened body and mind. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">After this, Siddhattha went out again every morning to the
  village to beg food, and eating what he got there each day, he soon became strong again
  and his skin became a good colour, almost as clear and golden as it used to be in the old
  days when he lived in his father's palace. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But although he himself now saw that the pains and
  hardships to which he subjected himself were just like trying to tie air into knots, or
  weave ropes out of soft sand, for all the help it was to him in his search for the Truth,
  the five disciples who believed in him and had hitherto stayed with him through everything
  did not think this at all. They still believed, like everybody else in India in those
  days, that the one only way to find the Truth in religious matters was to make yourself
  miserable in body. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So when they saw the master and teacher they had hitherto
  admired, so much for the way in which he starved and in other ways ill-treated and
  tormented his body, beginning to eat all his body required of the rice and curry he got
  when he went out begging, they were very much disappointed with him, and they said among
  themselves: &quot;Ah, this Sakya ascetic has given up striving and struggling. He has gone
  back to a life of ease and comfort.&quot; And the whole five of them turned away from
  their old master and left him, for they felt sure that there was no use in staying any
  longer with a teacher who did not starve himself and in other ways make himself miserable.
  Such an ascetic, they were sure, could never possibly attain to any great knowledge of
  religious truth. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">How very much mistaken, how very far wrong, these five
  disciples of the prince-ascetic were, was soon made clear to them. Their master and
  teacher, far from having turned back from his goal, was now on the very point of reaching
  it. </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">* * * </font></p>
  <h3 align="center"><font color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">Chapter VII </font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>SUCCESS </strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Any one to-day who wishes to see the very spot where,
  twenty-five hundred years ago, Prince Siddhattha of the Sakya race at last found the Truth
  he had sought so long and with such painful efforts, need only go to the town of Buddha
  Gaya in Behar, and from there walk six or seven miles along a road which more or less
  follows the course of a broad, sandy stream now called the river Phalgu, but which in
  those days was called the Neranjara. As he comes near his destination, he will see rising
  above the neighboring flat fields on a slight elevation, a tall solid structure of dark
  stone, with a few terraces running round its oblong form, which rises into the air,
  growing smaller and smaller towards the top where there is a small open platform from
  which rises a spire of stone, of the solid Hindu pattern, the whole structure being
  decorated with a great variety of sculptured work of all descriptions. This is the
  celebrated monument of Buddha Gaya. And in the shadow of this great memorial structure,
  surrounded by a low stone wall, the visitor yet may see the tree beneath whose branches
  Prince Siddhattha at last obtained the light he sought; for it was towards this tree that
  he turned his steps one evening, having resolved to make one last mighty effort of mind
  and will, and penetrate the final secret of life and all existence. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And as he went towards that tree -- in memory of
  Siddhattha's great achievement ever since called the Bodhi Tree, or Tree of Enlightenment
  -- Sujata's words to him must have been in his ears: &quot;May you be successful in
  obtaining your wishes as I have been!&quot; For now he sat down beneath the tree and made
  a solemn vow to himself that even if all the blood in his veins dried up, and all his
  flesh wasted away, and nothing was left of his body but skin and sinews and bones, from
  this seat he would not rise again until he had found what he sought, reached his goal,
  discovered for himself and for all men the way by which they might gain the highest
  happiness, be delivered once and for all from the need to be born and to die, again and
  again in a wearisome, never-ending round of the same pleasures and pains, over and over
  again. He sat down there under the Bodhi Tree, resolved to sit there, no matter what might
  happen to him, until he had discovered the way that leads out of Samsara, the world of
  birth and death and change, to the constant, lasting, deathless state called Nibbana. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This was a tremendous resolve to make. It had never been
  made before by any mortal man of our epoch of the world. There were indeed many other
  ascetics and hermits in Siddhattha's native land of India, who had spent long years of
  bodily hardship and severe mental labor, in order to obtain what they thought was the
  highest good possible. But what they won after all their years of toil and struggle of
  mind and will, was the attainment of a very great happiness, only it was not a constant,
  lasting happiness. It was not permanent. It was not for ever secure against all chance and
  change. After a time, when the energy they had put forth in order to bring them to these
  high states of bliss in the heaven-worlds was all exhausted; all spent, then these people,
  these ascetics and hermits, fell down again from these blissful states to lower states of
  existence, to life on this earth again, with all its unpleasantness and disappointments.
  It was with them as it might be with a man who had gathered together a lot of money in a
  box, and started spending it all. Very soon it would all be spent, the box would be empty,
  and he would have to begin getting more. And so with these hermits and ascetics, if they
  wanted to enjoy great happiness again, they had to begin all over again the painful things
  they had done before, so as to get to the heaven-world again and enjoy its delights. And
  this they would have to do again and again as long as they wanted such delights. Again and
  again they would have to go through a course of misery endured on earth so as to get
  happiness in heaven, and then the same again, always and always, without any end. Their
  way of doing was like that of a man who with great trouble rolls a heavy ball to the top
  of a high hill, only to find it roll back to the bottom again; whereupon he has to go
  through all the labor of rolling it up the hill again, and has to do this over and over
  again, without any end to his labor. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But what Siddhattha wanted was to find some way by which
  he and all men would not need any more to be for ever rolling the ball of life to the top
  of some high peak of happiness, see it roll down again into the valley of unhappiness, and
  then have all their work to do over again, if they wanted happiness again; and this for
  ever and ever, without any end to it. He wanted to find some state that would be permanent
  and lasting, some kind of wellbeing that would not be lost again, so that those who
  reached it once, would not need any more to be always striving and struggling to get it
  again. And on this great night under the Bodhi Tree at Uruvela he was determined to find
  such a state of lasting wellbeing, or perish in trying to find it. And now when Siddhattha
  wished to give the whole force of his mind to this great work, his mind fought against his
  will, and turned itself to dwell upon all the unlasting, all the passing, temporary
  delights and pleasure of life that he ever had tasted. He wanted to leave aside whole
  thoughts of worldly things, and concentrate all his attention upon trying to find out how
  all things arise, but his thoughts, in spite of all he could do, turned back to his former
  pleasant life, and brought before his mind's eye the most attractive pictures of the happy
  life he used to live in his father's palace before he came out on this painful search for
  Truth. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Again he saw before the eye of his mind, the splendid
  rooms and halls of his palace, its beautiful grounds and gardens, its lovely lotus-ponds
  and bowers of delight; and the many attendants who had nothing else to do but wait upon
  his will and minister to his pleasure. And then he saw his beautiful young wife; her
  lovely pleading eyes, her pleasant charming ways rose before him in vision; her very
  voice, so low and sweet, sounded in his ears. And then he saw his little son, his only
  child, a merry little babe who might grow up to be a son of which any father might be
  proud. And he saw his father, too, grey-haired now, and getting on in years, and grieving
  that his eldest son was not beside him to help him to govern the country and take his
  place when soon he would have to give it up through sheer old age. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">With his mind's eye the prince-ascetic Siddhattha Gotama
  saw all this, and his heart misgave him as the thought he did not wish to think, forced
  itself into his mind: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;You might have had great glory and power as a famous
  king if you had stayed in household life like everybody else. But you have gone and left
  behind you all that sensible people prize and value, in search of something nobody but
  yourself has ever even thought about, something that perhaps never can be found at all,
  perhaps does not even exist for anybody to find! How do you know you are not a fool or a
  madman to leave behind all these real, solid things you certainly once had and enjoyed, to
  look for something you cannot even be sure exists for you to find? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;But even if you so want to leave the good things of
  the world behind you and go in search of something beyond them which you think is better,
  why could you not continue to search for it in the same way that other religious men
  search by fasting and mortification and the other religious practices all the other
  ascetics and religious men of the country follow? Is it likely that they are all wrong in
  their way of looking for religious truth, and that only you are right? And any way, why
  cannot you be content to gain the same kind of happiness they are content to gain, even if
  it is not as lasting as you would like it to be? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Life is short. Men soon die: soon you too will die.
  Why do you not use the little time you have to live in getting all the pleasure you can
  out of it before the night of death comes on, when you cannot have pleasure any more?
  There is love: there is fame: there is glory: there is the praise of man: all to be had if
  you try for them: all solid, certain things: all of them things you can feel, not dreams
  and visions made out of thin air. Why should you make yourself wretched in this lonely
  forest looking for something nobody has ever found?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus did Siddhattha's thoughts torment him on that great
  night when he sat down beneath the Bodhi Tree to seek the way of deliverance from birth
  and death, tormenting him with the keen memory of the pleasures he had left behind, with
  doubts about his power ever to find what he sought, with uncertainty about whether he was
  seeking it in the right way. But he did not allow himself to be turned from his purpose.
  Rather did he the more strenuously pull his mind together for a yet stronger effort to
  discover what he wanted. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Begone, Mara, Evil One!&quot; he cried. &quot;I know
  you who you are. You are the evil spirit that would keep men back from everything that is
  good and great and noble. Try no more to keep me back from what I have set out and am
  determined to do. My mind is made up. Here I sit until I have found what I seek, even if I
  have to sit until all the blood in my body dries up, and my flesh wastes all away, and
  nothing is left of my but dry skin and bone.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And there Siddhattha sat and still continued sitting,
  striving and struggling, laboring and wrestling with all his mind and will to find what
  would bring to an end all infelicity, all undesirable and unpleasant things, searching for
  what would end all evil things for ever, and bring in their place a wellbeing, a happiness
  that would not pass away, a felicity that would be sure and lasting, eternally beyond the
  reach of any change. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And he was successful. After a time as he still persisted
  in his meditations, putting away out of his thoughts all evil things that were trying to
  disturb him and distract his mind, at length his mind became still and quiet like a still
  and quiet lake. It ceased to trouble him with memories and suggestions of pleasures he
  once had owned and enjoyed. It vexed him no more with doubts and uncertainties about what
  he now was seeking. In the calm, close concentration of his mind, now wholly calmed and
  collected, in the intense power of his will now directed towards one thing only, there
  where he sat under the Bodhi Tree, Prince Siddhattha, the ascetic of the face of the
  Sakyas, of the family of Gotama, became the Enlightened One, the Awakened One, the
  All-Knowing One; he became Gotama the Buddha, the bringer of the light of truth to the men
  of this epoch of the world, to the whole human race that now lives on the earth. For now
  He was enlightened in a way compared with which all other men were stumbling and groping
  in the dark. Now He was awake in a way compared with which all other men are asleep and
  dreaming. Now He knew with a knowledge compared with which all that other men know is but
  a kind of ignorance. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">For now He had penetrated the real true meaning of life
  through and through from its root upward. Now He knew how and why men were born and died
  again and again, and how they might cease thus to suffer repeated birth and death. But the
  first thing He saw clearly with His new and penetrating insight this night as He sat
  meditating under the Bodhi Tree, was the long line of His own lives and deaths through
  ages after ages, in all kinds of bodies, in all kinds of conditions of life, low and high,
  humble and exalted, gross and refined, until at last He was born in this present life as
  the son of King Suddhodana and Queen Mahamaya. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then with His keen, penetrating power of mind, He next
  perceived how all men are born and pass away again, to be born elsewhere anew, strictly
  according to the deeds they do. He saw how some are born to happy lives because their
  deeds were good deeds; and He saw how others were born to lives of unhappiness because the
  deeds they did were evil. He saw as plainly as anything that it is men's own actions and
  nothing else whatever which make them happy or unhappy in this and in all worlds. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And then, last and greatest of all He saw on this great
  night, He saw and understood clearly, beyond all doubt, that is it not well for men always
  to be at the mercy of the continual changes of the world; that it is not good that they
  should be now happy and now unhappy, now up and now down, like boats tossed on a sea. He
  perceived that the reason why men come in to existence to be thus tossed about on the
  waves of the changing world, is because they are fond of, and cling to all the little bits
  of happiness that existence in the world provides at times. He saw that men are caught in
  the snare of existence in the world because like deer they fling themselves greedily upon
  any little bit of pleasure they see. Then He saw that if men do not want to be caught in
  the snare of existence, the only way for them to do is not to jump heedlessly upon every
  scrap of pleasure they see, not to abandon themselves recklessly to its enjoyment, not to
  set their hearts so eagerly upon the things existence offers. And then He saw the Way by
  following which men at length would be able to refrain from flinging themselves recklessly
  into enjoyment of pleasure, because they would have learnt to know and like something
  better, and so they would no longer be bound to come back to the world where such
  pleasures are found, to the world of change and disappointment and uncertain happiness,
  and would be able to attain the true and certain happiness of Nibbana. And this Way or
  Path, He called the Noble Eightfold Path, because it is the Path followed by everybody who
  has noble aims and desires; and it has eight distinct branches or parts or members. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first branch or part or member of this Noble Eightfold
  Path to deliverance from all things evil taught by the Buddha is called -- Right Seeing.
  This Right Seeing means, to see that everything in the world, even one's own existence, is
  changeable, not really solid and lasting, and so only leads to disappointment and pain
  when we cling to it too closely. Right Seeing also means to see that good deeds always
  lead to happiness and evil deeds to unhappiness, both here and hereafter. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second member of the Noble Eightfold Path was called
  by the Buddha -- Right Mindedness. This means an attitude which, because it sees rightly
  the nature of the world and everything in it, turns away from clinging tightly to it.
  Right Mindedness also means a right attitude of mind in which we have pity and compassion
  for all beings who, through clinging too close to worldly things, are suffering distress
  of body or mind, while at the same time we have a keen desire to relieve their suffering
  and help them as far as possible. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Right Speaking, the third part of the Buddha's Noble
  Eightfold Path, means speaking only what is true and kindly and sensible. It means to
  avoid lying and rude and slanderous and silly talk. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Right Doing, the fourth part of the Noble Eightfold Path,
  means to refrain from killing, and stealing, and impurity, and the drinking of
  intoxicating liquors which make men mad and reckless so that they do things they otherwise
  would never have done. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Right Living, the fifth part of the Eightfold Path, means
  earning one's living in any way that does not cause hurt or harm to any other living
  creature. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Right Endeavour the sixth part of the Noble Eightfold
  Path, means endeavoring, trying to control one's thoughts and feelings in such a way that
  bad, harmful thoughts and feelings may not arise, and that those which unhappily may have
  arisen, may die out. It also means trying to keep alive and strong in our minds all good
  and helpful thoughts and feelings that already are there and causing to arise in our minds
  and hearts as many as we can of new, good and helpful thoughts and feelings. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Right Remembering, the seventh member of the Noble
  Eightfold Path, means always remembering, never forgetting, what our bodies really are,
  not thinking of them as finer and grander than they are actually. It also means
  remembering all the movements and actions and functions of the body as being just the
  movements and actions and functions of the body, and nothing else beside. Right
  Remembering also means remembering what our minds are, a constantly changing succession of
  thoughts and feelings in which nothing is the same for two moments together. And it means,
  lastly, bearing in mind and never forgetting the various steps Buddha has taught us we
  must take in order to set the mind free from all bondage and bring it at last to the state
  of perfect freedom -- Nibbana. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And Right Concentration, the eight and last member of this
  Noble Eightfold Way to Nibbana made known by the Buddha means not allowing our minds to
  wander about as they like, but fixing them firmly upon whatever we are thinking about, so
  as to arrive in this way at a correct understanding or whatever we are trying to
  understand. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Such are all the eight parts or members of the Noble
  Eightfold Path which Prince Siddhattha Gotama, who now became the Buddha Gotama,
  discovered under the Bodhi Tree at Uruvela twenty-five hundred years ago. The last three
  parts or members, Right Endeavoring, Right Remembering and Right Concentration, in their
  full and perfect meaning are mainly intended to be practiced by men who are trying to
  follow the Buddha closely, and in order to do this better and more easily, have left the
  household life and become Bhikkhus. But every one, whether he is a Bhikkhu or not, can
  practice them to a certain extent as they are here described. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first two members of the Eightfold Path, also, Right
  Seeing and Right Mindedness, in their full perfection are only possessed by those men who,
  after many years of training and practice of meditations, at last have come very near to
  understanding and realizing the true nature of things in the same way that the Buddha did.
  Yet still, every one who wishes to follow the Buddha, must have a little of Right Seeing,
  and a little of Right Mindedness. They must think sometimes how all things round them are
  not really so fine and splendid as they often seem to be. And they must sometimes
  entertain in their minds the thought that some day they will turn away from the transient
  things of the world to something better, to something more sure and lasting. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But the three middle members of the Noble Eightfold Path
  are for everybody to practice to the fullest extent of their powers. Everyone ought to try
  to live without doing harm to any one either in word or in act. Every one ought to try,
  and can try to avoid wrong-speaking and wrong-doing; and according as they do this, they
  prepare the way for some day controlling their thoughts and properly training their minds,
  and so coming at last to true knowledge and insight, that knowledge and insight which the
  Buddha discovered and teaches, which is truly called Wisdom. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And when they come to this true wisdom, then the mind is
  delivered from clinging any more to anything in any world. And because it does not cling
  any more to such things, therefore it does not any more for ever take shape or form in any
  world. That is to say: For if there is no more being born into the world, and so no more
  of all the troubles and unpleasant things that follow men who are born into the world; and
  so the whole mass of distress of any kind is brought to an end for ever. All this the
  Buddha discovered beneath the Bodhi Tree: He discovered the Noble Eightfold Path of Right
  Seeing and Right Mindedness, of Right Speaking and Doing and Living, of Right Endeavoring
  and Remembering and Concentration, which is also called by the name of the Triple Path of
  Right Behavior, Mind-culture and Wisdom; or in the Pali, Sila, Samadhi, and Panna. </font></p>
