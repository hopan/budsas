  <p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"><strong><em>Bhikkhu
  Silacara: A Biography</em></strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In 1906 a Scotsman in his thirty-fifth year, known as J.F.
  McKechnie, was admitted to the Sangha by the Thera U Kumara at Kyun Daw Gone Kyaung
  (Temple), Kemmendine, Rangoon, Burma. He was given the Bhikku's name of Silacara.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The new monk had come to the country about the beginning
  of this century, having, whilst in Glasgow, read about Buddhism in a copy of the magazine
  //Buddhism// which he found in the public library, and answered an advertisement of its
  editor the Bhikkhu Ananda Metteyya (Alan Bennett, in lay life) for one with literary
  ability to assist him in the editorial work in Rangoon. McKechnie remained with the
  British Buddhist monk until the magazine ceased publication. Then, prior to his own
  entering the Sangha as noted above, he taught for a year in the Buddhist boys' school of
  Mme Hla Oung.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The future Bhikkhu was born in Hull, Yorkshire, on October
  22nd, 1871. His father was a famous baritone singer, Sir Charles Santley, and his mother
  was Caroline Mavis. After the years of schooling, till he was 21, he worked as apprentice
  to the trade of Stock-cutter in a clothing factory, emigrating therefrom to America to
  work for four years on a fruit and dairy farm.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Bhikkhu Silacara worked untiringly, writing,
  preaching, traveling. He once went on a mission to Sikkim, on the Maharajah's invitation,
  but the mission bore hardly any fruit owing to the point of view of the lamas who thought
  that pure Buddhism would be corrupted, if in the hands of the ignorant peasant. He broke
  down in health, contracting nervous asthma, complicated with heart trouble, and on the
  advice of the German Buddhist Dr. P. Dahlke, left the robes and for England late in 1925.
  Here he worked with the Anagarika Dharmapala at the Mahabodhi Society's British branch,
  lecturing and editing the //British Buddhist//. His health suffered again and in 1932 when
  he had to leave London to live in Surrey. But he never ceased to work, for he wrote to
  Buddhist Magazines in the country, in Ceylon, Burma, Germany, etc.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">During World War II his little retreat Wisboro Green
  having been sold, he entered an Old Persons' Home at Bury, where he, who had led the
  austere life of a Buddhist monk, bore the hard way of a state charitable institution with
  equanimity until his death three years ago.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of the books on Buddhism which he wrote, those perhaps
  best known to Ceylon Buddhists are //The Four Noble Truths//, //The Eightfold Path//,
  //Kamma//, //Lotus Blossoms//. In the early twenties Ceylon readers of the //Buddhist
  Chronicle//, a paper started by Mr. P. de. S. Kularatne, the Principal of Ananda College,
  Colombo, were greatly encouraged by the vigorous contribution which the Bhikkhu made
  regularly. The interest of these articles was heightened specially by the fact that there
  was a controversy going on at that time, the leader on the Buddhist side being American
  Buddhist Scholar of Mahayana, Dr. W. Y. Evans-Wentz //Buddhist Annual of Ceylon//.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Bhikkhu also contributed a number of articles to the
  //Buddhist Annual of Ceylon// an illustrated magazine of a high order which the firm
  Messrs. W. E. Bastain &amp; Co. of Colombo were publishing with great acceptance to places
  and people all over the world wherever Orientalia found welcome, and these were a
  formidable tally. For this Firm he specially wrote the //Young People's Life of the
  Buddha// the popularity of which remains undimmed throughout the decades in which it is
  being re-printed. </font></p>
