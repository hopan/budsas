  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>DAILY LIFE </strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha now began that career of continual teaching and
  preaching which lasted for forty-four years, during which time He wandered about
  principally in that part of Northern India where are now Oudh, Bihar, and the North
  Bengal. Except during the rainy season He very seldom stayed more than a day or two at any
  one place. And during the rainy season of each year, He generally lived at the Bamboo
  Grove or Veluvana Vihara at Rajagaha that had been given Him by King Bimbisara, or else at
  the Jetavana Vihara near Savatthi in the Kosala country, which had been presented to Him
  by a very generous supporter of the Buddha and His Sangha whose name was Anathapindika. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">During these years the daily habits of the Buddha were
  somewhat as follows: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">He rose early in the morning before dawn, and after making
  His toilet, sat down and engaged in meditation for some time. Then, when daylight was
  fully come, He used to put His robe on decently over both shoulders, and taking His
  almsbowl in hand, go out to the village or town near which He happened to be staying at
  the time, and with His eyes fixed on the ground, pass from door to door, waiting for, and
  accepting in silence, whatever the charitable might put into His bowl. Sometimes He went
  out on this round for alms alone by Himself; sometimes he went accompanied by a body of
  His disciples who passed along in single file behind Him, their bowls in their hands also,
  and with the same modest and subdued demeanor. Occasionally, when begging alone, some
  supporter to whose door He came, would invite Him to come in and eat His meal in their
  house. Such invitations He usually accepted, taking the seat that had been prepared for
  Him, and partaking of what was put in His bowl by the people of the house who meantime had
  taken it from Him and filled it with the best of everything they had. Then, after
  finishing His meal and washing His hands, He would speak to those present about His
  doctrine, telling them about the benefit and advantage of doing good and the disadvantage
  and harm of doing evil both now and in the future, and then He would rise and go back to
  the place where He happened to be staying at the time. There He would sit quiet waiting in
  a rest-house or under a tree near by, until all the Bhikkhus living with Him at the time,
  had finished their meal also; and then He would retire to His own chamber where He would
  wash His feet, coming out again afterwards to give an address to the Bhikkhus who
  meanwhile had assembled together in order to listen to Him, and to exhort them to be
  diligent in learning the Doctrine and practicing the Discipline, so as to attain to a
  realization of Nibbana here and now in this present life. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">After He had finished speaking, some of the Bhikkhus would
  ask Him to give them a subject to meditate upon suitable to their individual character and
  the state of progress at which they had arrived, and then the Buddha would tell them what
  would be best for them to meditate on that day, giving them an easy or a difficult subject
  according as they were beginners or far advanced in their study and practice. Then the
  Bhikkhus would break up their gathering, and each would go away by himself under a tree or
  to some retired spot in the fields, and spend the afternoon there meditating upon the
  subject the Master had given each for meditation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha would now go back to His private room, and if
  it was the hot season, and by reason of the great heat He felt inclined to lie down for a
  little and rest, He would do so with His mind composed and collected. Then, being
  refreshed, He would rise from His couch which simply consisted of His robe folded in four
  and laid on the floor of His room, and He would begin to consider the people in the world
  and how best He could help them to gain final deliverance from everything evil. By this
  time the people from the village or town near which he was living, perhaps would come to
  Him with offerings of one kind or another, wishing at the same time to hear Him preach. So
  He would sit down and after accepting their gifts, speak to them in such a nice easy way,
  in a way so suited to the understanding of each person present, whether rich or poor,
  learned or unlearned, that each of them would think that the Great Teacher was speaking
  specially to them, to nobody else, and when He had ended speaking, they would all go away
  pleased and delighted with everything they had heard. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When these visitors had thus gone, the Buddha would then
  go and bathe in the Vihara somewhere or, if there was a good bathing-tank or pond near by,
  go and bathe there, and afterwards retire again to His private room, and sitting down
  alone, engage in meditation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">By this time it would be coming on towards evening; and
  now any Bhikkhus who did not belong to the company who were living with Him but were
  living somewhere else, were free to come and see Him and get advice from him about their
  practice of meditation or ask Him to explain to them some points about the Doctrine which
  they did not fully understand. Such Bhikkhus were now received by Him and He gave them the
  counsel and advice they required, and cleared up for them their difficulties in
  understanding with kind and helpful answers which sent them away cheered and encouraged
  and strengthened. And this the Buddha always did in the kindest and most patient and
  courteous manner. During all the forty-four years of His life when He thus received
  Bhikkhus from other places nearly every day, and answered their questions and solved their
  difficulties for them, never once was He known to lose patience with any questioner or
  become annoyed or angry at anything any one said, whether they were friendly or hostile;
  still less did He ever become confused and confounded, or unable to answer any question
  asked Him. He was always prepared to speak with all who came to Him, whether honestly ask
  His help, or only to try to trap Him in what He said. To those who really wanted help in
  their difficulties, He gave helpful, satisfying answers. And those who came to try to
  confuse and puzzle Him, and trip Him up in His words very often came away full of
  admiration for His ready knowledge and wisdom, some of them even becoming there and then
  His devoted followers for the rest of their life. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The evening and the earlier part of the night is this was
  given to visitors. But now, being a little weary of so much sitting all day, the Buddha
  used to get to His feet and spend some time just pacing up and down to relieve and refresh
  His limbs. Then, after walking back and forward like this for a while, He would retire to
  His room and go to rest for the night. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus during the forty-four years of His career of teaching
  and preaching His doctrine, did the Buddha spend each day when not actually engaged in
  traveling from one place to another, always ready to help and instruct any one who desired
  His help and instructions in religious matters. But it was not only in religious but also
  in every day worldly affairs that He was sometimes able to do good with His practical
  wisdom to the people among whom He freely moved during these forty-four years of active,
  beneficent life. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, once when He was staying at the Jetavana Vihara at
  Savatthi, the people of Kapila and Koliya fell into a great and bitter dispute about the
  watering of their paddy fields. It was a time of drought. No rain had fallen for a long
  time, and as a result, the stream that ran between the fields of the Kapila folk on one
  side, and the fields of the Koliya people on the other, was almost dried up. There was
  only a very little water left in it. And each of these two peoples, the Kapilas and the
  Koliyas, wanted to get all the water there was for their own fields, and to leave the
  others none. And they began to get ready to fight about it, each party prepared to kill
  the people on the other side of the stream so as to get all the water in it for
  themselves. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now the Kapila people were the Buddha's own people, and
  when He heard about this quarrel of theirs with the Koliyas, He felt very sorry to think
  that they were going to kill other people and perhaps get killed themselves all for the
  sake of a little water. So He set out for the place where the angry people were gathered
  together all ready to fight, with their weapons in their hands. And when He got there He
  spoke to them like this: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Princes and warriors, listen to what I am going to
  say, and answer what I ask you, truthfully. What is it you are getting ready to kill one
  another about?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;About the water in the stream, here, which we both
  want for our dry fields,&quot; said the people of both banks of the stream. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yes,&quot; said the Buddha, &quot;but tell me truly.
  Which do you think is the more valuable -- the little water in this stream, or the blood
  in the veins of the many men, especially that in the veins of princes and kings?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The blood of men, and especially the blood of
  princes and kings,&quot; the people at once replied, &quot;of course is much more valuable
  than the water of the stream.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;That being so,&quot; the Buddha now said, &quot;is
  it fit and proper to risk what is more precious and valuable for the sake of what is less
  precious and valuable?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Nay, indeed, Lord,&quot; the people replied,
  &quot;it would not be fit and proper to risk what is more valuable for the sake of what is
  less valuable.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If that is so,&quot; concluded the Buddha, &quot;go
  and conquer your anger, put away your murderous weapons, and come to a peaceable agreement
  among yourselves.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And both the Kapila and the Koliya people, now heartily
  ashamed of their foolishness and lack of good sense thus pointed out to them by the Lord
  Buddha, did as He told them, and agreed to share equally between them what water was in
  the stream, and ever afterwards lived at peace with one another. </font></p>

  <h3 align="center"><font color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">Chapter XIII </font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>MAHAPAJAPATI </strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Meanwhile the Buddha's father King Suddhodana fell very
  ill, so like a good son, the Buddha, taking with Him His half-brother Nanda who now was
  one of His Bhikkhus, and Ananda and Sariputta and Moggallana, went to visit and console
  His father in his illness. At first, in his pleasure at seeing his beloved son again, King
  Suddhodana grew a little better, and everyone thought that he was going to get well
  altogether; but the improvement lasted only a little while. He was getting too old now to
  have much strength for resisting sickness, and a few days later, the king became very ill
  again, and to the grief of the whole kingdom, passed away in death. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Her husband now being dead, Queen Mahapajapati the
  Buddha's own mother's sister, who had brought Him up the same as if He had been her own
  child, did not want to stay living in household life any longer. Mourning for her husband
  who had just died, she wished henceforth to live a religious life just like a Bhikkhu,
  under the guidance and instruction of her foster-son, the Buddha. So, along with a number
  of her ladies who did not want to part from their mistress but wished to go with her
  wherever she might go, she went to the Buddha and asked Him if out of pity and compassion
  He would not allow women also to leave the household life the same as men, and live under
  His guidance and instruction the same as the Bhikkhus. But although she entreated the
  Buddha three separate times to accept her and her ladies as female Bhikkhus under Him, He
  begged her not to ask such a thing from him. And Queen Mahapajapati was very much grieved
  that her great wish should thus have been refused, and bursting into tears, she and her
  ladies left the Buddha's presence weeping. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And now, having waited at Kapilavatthu until the funeral
  ceremonies for his father were over, the Buddha left the city, and wandering on from place
  to place, at length came to Vesali, and took up His residence in the Vihara in the Great
  Wood there. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then Mahapajapati cut off her hair and putting on yellow
  robes, along with a lot of her ladies, she took the road to Vesali, proceeding on foot
  from village to village until in due time she arrived at the Vihara in the Great Wood
  where the Buddha was staying. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then, with her feet all swollen with her long walk, and
  with the dust of the road still upon her, sad and dejected, she stood weeping outside the
  Vihara. And Ananda saw her standing there in such a pitiful condition, and asked her what
  was the matter, why she was crying. And she answered: &quot;It is because, O Ananda, the
  Blessed One will not allow women to retire from the household life and live the homeless
  life under His Doctrine and Discipline.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If that is so, O daughter of the Gotama
  family,&quot; said Ananda, &quot;wait a moment and I will plead with the Blessed One that
  He may be pleased to allow women to live under His Doctrine and Discipline the same as the
  Bhikkhus do.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And Ananda did as he promised Mahapajapati, and going into
  the room where the Buddha was, he humbly and respectfully asked the Buddha to have
  compassion on women and allow them to follow the homeless life under His guidance the same
  as men. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Enough, Ananda, enough! Do not ask me any such
  thing!&quot; was the Buddha's reply to him. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But Ananda was not in the least daunted or discouraged. A
  second time and a third time he asked the Buddha the very same thing, and each time he
  received the very same answer. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then Ananda thought to himself: &quot;The Blessed One will
  not give permission for women to withdraw from household life under Him when He is asked
  direct; but perhaps He may give permission if He is approached in another way.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So he said to his Master: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If women were to be allowed, Reverend Lord, to
  retire from the household life and follow the life of homelessness under the Doctrine and
  Discipline of the Tathagata, would they be able to reach the four stages, one after
  another, of the Path of Holiness that leads to the Deathless, to Nibbana?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yes, Ananda,&quot; was the Buddha's reply, &quot;if
  women were to withdraw from household life and follow my Doctrine and Discipline, they
  could reach Nibbana in this life, they could become Arahans.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If that is so,&quot; said Ananda, &quot;consider,
  Reverend Lord, what a great benefactress Mahapajapati of the Gotama family, has been. She
  is the sister of the mother of the Blessed One; and as foster-mother as nurse, as giver of
  mother's milk, she reared and nurtured the Blessed One when His own mother died. Pray,
  Reverend Lord, allow women to withdraw from household life and live the homeless life
  under the Doctrine and Discipline made known to the world by the Tathagata.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Well, Ananda,&quot; said the Buddha, &quot;if
  Mahapajapati of the Gotama family is willing to accept and keep strictly these eight
  rules, let this be considered as her ordination.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And then the Buddha went on to tell Ananda that every
  women who wished to follow His Discipline must show respect to any Bhikkhu no matter how
  lately he may have been in the Order or how long she may have been in the Order, and she
  must not live in any district where there are no Bhikkhus, must listen to an admonition
  from an appointed Bhikkhu every Sabbath day, must invite criticism of her behavior both
  from Bhikkhus and Bhikkunis at the end of each Vassa, if guilty of a serious offense must
  do penance towards both Bhikkhus and Bhikkunis, must spend a period of testing as a novice
  for two years before being fully ordained by a chapter composed of both Bhikkhus and
  Bhikkhunis, must not speak evil in any way about any Bhikkhu, and must not officially
  administer admonition to a Bhikkhu but must accept such admonition from a Bhikkhu. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If Ananda,&quot; said the Buddha in conclusion,
  &quot;Mahapajapati is willing to obey these eight rules and to keep them as long as she
  lives, then she may consider herself ordained as a female Bhikkhu or Bhikkhuni.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then Ananda took leave of the Buddha and went and told
  Mahapajapati all that the Buddha had said. And Mahapajapati, glad and happy, answered
  Ananda: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;O Ananda, Reverend Sir, just as a young woman or
  young man, fond of personal adornment, having bathed their head and got a wreath of
  beautiful, sweet-smelling flowers, would lift it up with both hands and place it on their
  head, on that, the noblest part of the body, even so do I, O Ananda, Reverend Sir, take up
  these eight rules, never to break them as long as my life shall last.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then Ananda went back to where the Buddha was, and
  greeting his Master respectfully, he spoke to Him and said: &quot;Mahapajapati of the
  Gotama family, Reverend Lord, accepts the eight strict rules laid upon her by the Blessed
  One. The sister of the mother of the Blessed One is now ordained a Bhikkhuni.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But the Buddha said: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Ananda, not for long will this Doctrine and
  Discipline of mine endure among women who withdraw from the household life. Only for five
  hundred years will it so endure, Ananda, just as families in which there are many women
  and few men, do not long hold out against thieves and robbers, so where women take to the
  homeless life under a Doctrine and Discipline like mine, it does not long endure. It will
  be with it as with a field of rice or sugar-cane when mildew falls on it: it will not
  flourish very long.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And things happened exactly as the Buddha had foreseen.
  The proper ordination of women Bhikkhus or, as they are correctly called, Bhikkhunis, died
  out about five hundred years after Mahapajapati thus became the first Bhikkhuni in the
  world, there being no longer any Bhikkhunis then living who had been ten years in the
  Order and so able to confer ordination properly. </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">* * * </font></p>
  <h3 align="center"><font color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">Chapter XIV </font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>WONDER-WORKING </strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As the Buddha went wandering here and there about the
  country along with His Bhikkhus, everywhere He went the people came in crowds to see Him
  and to hear Him teach and preach, and many were converted to belief in Him and in His
  Doctrine. But there were also going about the country in the same way that He did, other
  religious teachers; and some of these, by doing very wonderful and extraordinary things,
  sometimes attracted many people to go and see them do such things. And then these people
  stayed and listened to their preaching, and sometimes believed in what they preached and
  became their followers. Now when the Buddha's Bhikkhus saw what was happening in this way,
  they went to their Master and asked Him if He, too, would not do some wonderful and
  extraordinary thing just to show the simple jungle people that He was not inferior to
  these other religious teachers they were admiring because of the wonderful things they
  could do, and so induce them to follow Him instead of the other religious teachers. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But the Buddha answered the Bhikkhus who asked Him this,
  that He would be ashamed to attract people to listen to Him and believe in Him just
  because, He could do something extraordinary that would make them gape with astonishment,
  something of the nature of what they would call a miracle. &quot;The only miracle,&quot;
  said the Buddha, &quot;which the Tathagatas perform is this -- that when they find a man
  full of passion and craving, they leave him free from passion and craving. When they find
  a man a slave to anger and hatred, they leave him delivered from anger and hatred. When
  they find a man blinded with delusion and ignorance, they open his eyes and leave him rid
  of delusion and ignorance. This is the only miracle They perform. Any other miracle They
  loathe and despise and shun.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But now some one came and told the Buddha that Moggallana,
  by the use of extraordinary power which he possessed more than any other of the Arahans,
  had gone up to a high place difficult to get at, and from it had brought down a very fine,
  specially good bowl which a certain man had put on that high place in order to test
  Moggallana's power and see if he would be able to go there and get it. But the Buddha was
  very much displeased to hear about this that Moggallana had been doing; and He sent for
  Moggallana and told him to bring with him the bowl he had got in this way by the exercise
  of his abnormal powers. And when Moggallana came with the bowl, the Buddha took it from
  his hand and broke it into pieces before Moggallana and all the assembled Bhikkhus, and
  strictly charged him that he must never on any account do such a thing again as show off
  his powers, and that none of His Bhikkhus must ever do any kind of wonderful thing just to
  make simple ignorant people admire at them: or if they did, then they must at once leave
  His Brotherhood of Bhikkhus; they could not be allowed to remain with Him as His
  followers. And this particular command of the Buddha about wonderworking remains to this
  day as one of the Vinaya rules for the breaking of which a Bhikkhu is at once put out of
  the Order and cannot be taken back into it. For a Bhikkhu to perform, or even claim to be
  able to perform, any supernormal feat, is a Parajika or Great Offense, as seriously looked
  upon as murder or theft or unchastity; and if he does such a thing he must leave the Order
  at once. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, the Buddha never tried to astonish the people by
  doing any wonderful deeds and after this affair with Moggallana, neither he nor any other
  of the Bhikkhus ever tried to do any. Yet in spite of this, the people clearly saw and
  felt that the Buddha was a great teacher, and they showed their respect and veneration for
  Him wherever He went, by providing plentifully for the wants of Himself and His company of
  Bhikkhus who went about everywhere with Him. And many of the followers of the other
  religious teachers did not like to see this at all. They were very much annoyed to see how
  the people went to these new yellow-robed ascetics of the Sakya ascetic Gotama to hear
  them preach and to give them the best of fool and medicines, while they neglected them and
  their teachers. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, once when the Buddha and His Bhikkhus came to the
  town of Kosambi where there lives a well-known religious teacher along with a large
  company of disciples, these latter began to abuse and revile the Bhikkhus and followers of
  the Buddha in the most outrageous manner, calling them all sorts of abusive and wicked
  names. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then Ananda came to the Buddha and told his Master what
  these other ascetics were saying about the Buddha's Bhikkhus, and how they used the most
  shameful language about them, and heaped the coarsest abuse upon them whenever they met
  them anywhere, but especially when they met them going out with their begging-bowls to
  collect alms of food. And on behalf of all the Bhikkhus who had asked him to speak to the
  Buddha about the matter, he asked the Buddha if He did not think it would be better for
  Him and them to leave Kosambi and go some-where else where they would not have to listen
  to such abuse every day when they went out begging. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha quietly listened to all Ananda had to say. Then
  He spoke and said: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;But suppose, Ananda, that we are ill-treated and
  abused in the next place we go, what shall we do then?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then we shall go to some other place,&quot; said
  Ananda. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And if we are reviled and miscalled in that new
  place too, what shall we do then?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then we shall go to some other place,&quot; replied
  Ananda. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha sat silent for a little while; then, with a
  gently glance at Ananda, He said: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;O Ananda, a little patience properly exercised now,
  will save us all the trouble of so much moving about. We cannot say for certain that we
  shall find the peace we want in any new place we may go to; but we are sure to find it
  just where we are, if only we practice patience. By patience and forbearance those that
  are wise overcome all their enemies. Look at the elephant, that men use in war, Ananda. He
  plunges into the thick of the fighting and pays no attention to the darts and arrows and
  javelins that are hurled at him from all sides, but rushes on, sweeping away everything
  from before him. And I, Ananda, am going to imitate that elephant. I shall stay here in
  this town and preach my excellent doctrine with all my force and power, and labor without
  ceasing to deliver wretched men from the net of passion in which they are entangled and
  caught fast. I shall not pay the least attention to the abuse these other ascetics hurl at
  me and my disciples. Like men, who spit up at the sky thinking they are going to dirty it
  only to find that their spit does not touch the sky at all or dirty it, but only falls
  back on and dirties themselves, so these poor men who spit abuse at us will only find
  their abuse come back on themselves, if we pay no attention to it.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, notwithstanding the request and wishes of Ananda and
  all the other Bhikkhus, the Buddha still stayed on at Kosambi; and the good result of His
  practice of patience and forbearance was soon seen. For when the people of Kosambi saw how
  meekly He and His Bhikkhus endured the bad language of the other ascetics without ever
  answering them back in the same way they became displeased with the other ascetics for
  abusing men who never abused them. And many of the young men of Kosambi admired the
  behavior of the Buddha and His Bhikkhus in this respect so much, that they became His
  followers and joined the Order of Bhikkhus. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Unfortunately, however, these Kosambi youths did not, in
  becoming Bhikkhus, at once get rid of their quarrelsome dispositions, and very soon they
  were involved in a bitter dispute among themselves about some small point in what they
  considered correct Bhikkhu behavior. Some maintained one thing and some maintained
  another, and although the Buddha repeatedly admonished them to live at peace with one
  another and not quarrel, they still kept on wrangling. They paid no attention to the
  Buddha when He told them that quarreling and ill-will were greater evils than the little
  fault in behavior about which all their disputing arose. So when the Buddha saw that they
  were not going to listen to Him or take His advice, He went away from Kosambi by Himself,
  leaving all the Bhikkhus there behind Him. Then the people of Kosambi, when they saw that
  the Great Teacher had gone away by Himself, and that the Bhikkhus He had left behind were
  behaving just like common worldly people who had not left the household life t become
  ascetics, quarreling and wrangling no different from householders they stopped putting any
  food in the bowls of the quarrelsome Bhikkhus when they came round begging in the
  mornings. This step very quickly brought the squabbling Bhikkhus to their senses. They
  made up their quarrel; came to peace again with one another; and the Buddha once more
  allowed them to join Him, and go with Him wherever He went. </font></p>

  <h3 align="center"><font color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">Chapter XV </font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>DISCOURSES </strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As the son of a king, and so, accustomed to the manners of
  a royal court, the Buddha was perfectly at home, entirely at his ease, in the company of
  the greatest kings and warriors and priests, and could hold His own in conversation with
  any of them, even the most learned, and send them away pleased and delighted with what
  they had heard from Him. But He was equally as well able to speak in a manner common
  people could understand, and as He wandered about the country on foot, was always ready to
  talk to any one He happened to meet -- farmers, blacksmiths, wheelwrights, barbers,
  anybody who liked to speak to Him. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, one day as he was traveling through a district
  covered with paddy fields, He fell in with a farmer at work in his field, and stopped and
  began talking to him about his cattle, and plowing, and seed, and about how he expected
  his crop to turn out this year. &quot;You know,&quot; He said to the farmer, &quot;I am a
  farmer, too, and I have got all the things needed for working my fields, and the seed as
  well.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;You a farmer!&quot; said the surprised cultivator.
  &quot;Where then have you left your bullocks, your plow, and the other things you
  need?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I have got them all with me here,&quot; said the
  Buddha calmly. &quot;Listen to me, and I'll tell you all about it.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;My seed is the warm desire and feeling of compassion
  which caused me to resolve to become a Buddha, as also the knowledge which I obtained
  under the Bodhi Tree. The rain that watered my seed and made it grow richly and
  abundantly, was the constant good deeds I did until I became a Buddha. My knowledge is the
  yoke, and wisdom the shaft of my plow. My heart is the reins with which I guide my
  bullocks. My plowshares is the diligence with which I get rid of all evil things in me.
  The handle of my plow is the Doctrine which enables me to remove all that is bad and
  promote all that is good. When you go plowing, you cut up and overthrow all bad weeds; so
  he who has learned the Four Noble Truths cuts up and overthrows all evil inclinations
  within him. At night, when your day's work is done, you unyoke your bullocks and let them
  go wherever they like. In the same way the wise men, in cleaving to what is perfect, lets
  go whatever is not perfect. Your bullocks have to strain and toil in order to do their
  work of plowing your fields; and in the same way the wise man has to strive with all his
  strength, and turn over the soil of his own nature, so as to reach Nibbana. The cultivator
  works hard in order to prepare his field for the seed; and in the same way the wise man
  has to work hard to get rid of the ills of existence. But the man who works in the paddy
  fields is often disappointed in the size of the crops he gets as the outcome of his toil
  and sometimes he has to go hungry. But whoever works in the fields of wisdom, never is
  disappointed; he is sure to reap the full results of his labors; he is entirely happy,
  perfectly satisfied when he comes in sight of Nibbana. In this way it is, O farmer, that I
  am a farmer also. And this, too, is the way in which I do my work.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And the cultivator to whom the Buddha spoke this little
  sermon was so well pleased with it that he asked the Buddha there and then to accept him
  as a cultivator in the field of His Good Doctrine, and he became a follower of the Buddha
  for the rest of his life. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To another person who came to the Buddha and asked to be
  told the way in which common people might reach the best and happiest state, the state of
  Nibbana, the Buddha gave these simple instructions. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Avoid the company of the foolish; cultivate the
  companionship of the wise. Show respect to those who are worthy of respect. Remain in a
  position that is in accordance with your abilities. Always perform meritorious deeds.
  Constantly aim at perfect behavior. Take pleasure in hearing and seeing all you can so as
  to acquire knowledge. Study everything that is not evil. Acquire a knowledge of what ought
  to be shunned. Speak only what is true, kindly and profitable. Be kind to, and support
  father and mother. Care for, and cherish wife and children. Resist temptation to do evil.
  Give alms. Observe the rules of right conduct. Assist relatives and friends when they are
  in need of assistance. Do nothing that is not permitted by the law of good. Abstain from
  intoxicating drinks or drugs. Do not be slow in doing good deeds when an opportunity to do
  them arises. Be courteous to all men. Be humble. Be easily satisfied. Acknowledge kindness
  received with gratitude. Listen to the preaching of the Doctrine in proper season. Be
  patient and forbearing. Take pleasure in profitable conversation. From time to time visit
  those who lead the holy life. Converse with them on religious subjects. Practice virtuous
  behavior. Bear in mind the Four Noble Truths. Keep ever before the mind's eye the goal of
  Nibbana. In the midst of every affliction, be unshaken, unperturbed, fearless, and
  composed. Who observes these perfect rules shall never be overcome by evil; he will always
  enjoy perfect peace of mind.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">On another day when the Buddha was resting in a little
  village, the people of the place came to him and said: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Reverend Sir, we know that you are a great religious
  teacher, and have taught much that is good to those disciples of your who follow you about
  and live the homeless life just as you do yourself. But we are not ascetics. We are just
  common folk who love our wives and children, and earn our living cultivating our fields
  and breeding cattle, and we take whatever innocent enjoyment comes our way. We use gold
  and silver. We like to ornament ourselves on holidays and feast days with jewelry and
  flowers. We use oils and perfumes to make our bodies pleasant to us. We follow the
  ordinary ways of the world. Now, Reverend Sir, if there is anything in your teaching that
  would be good for us to know, anything that would help us to be happy here and now as well
  as in the future, be pleased, Reverend Sir, to let us hear that part of your teaching, so
  that we may follow it and get the benefit of it.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Well, villagers,&quot; said the Buddha, &quot;there
  are four things which a teacher like myself has to teach which are good for you and
  everybody who is not an ascetic to know and observe. Listen, and I will tell you about
  them. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;First: Whatever may be the employment by which you
  earn your living, in that business you ought always to do your best to make yourselves
  efficient. If you are a farmer you should try to be a good farmer, and make your fields
  grow all they can. If you are a merchant you should try to be a wide-awake and
  enterprising merchant. If you are a servant you should try to be a reliable and
  trustworthy servant. Be active and energetic always so as to get the best and fullest
  results from what you do, whatever it may be. In this way you will acquire wealth and be
  able to do good with it -- to help any one who may need help. For it you do not acquire
  wealth by working for it, you will not be able to do good deeds and help others, for you
  will have nothing with which to help them. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Second: You ought to take proper care of your wealth
  after you have got it, and not waste it in foolish ways. It is of no use to put water in a
  jar out of which it is allowed to run away again through a hold in the jar. It is good to
  get wealth, but it is every bit as necessary to see to it that when it is got it is not
  lost again in all sorts of foolish and wasteful ways. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Third: People in worldly life should choose only
  good people for their friends and associates. People mostly become like the kind of people
  they mix with. If a man goes with good men, he has a good chance of becoming a good man
  himself. And if he goes with bad men, he is very likely to become bad too. You cannot
  touch black things without getting your fingers made black. So household folk should
  frequent the company of others who are good and wise and liberal and full of faith in what
  is good, and then they also will be likely to become good and wise and liberal and full of
  faith in what is good. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Fourth: The householder should follow a regular and
  moderate way of living. He should not be extreme or extravagant in his way of life. He
  should not spend or give more than what he gets as income. If he does his wealth will be
  like a pond that has more streams running out of it than it has running into it. Such a
  pond very soon will run dry, and have no water in it at all. And very soon a man who pays
  out more then comes in to him, will have no more wealth. But if a man takes care to spend
  on himself and his family, or give away in charity, always a little less than his income,
  then the pond of his wealth will never run dry. There will always be some water, that is
  some wealth in it, for use when any sudden need for it arises. But this does not mean that
  he is not to make full use of his wealth. It does not mean that he is to heap it up and
  hide it away and not use it. A man who does that is like one who has a tree full of fruit
  in his garden, but instead of eating the fruit when it becomes ripe, puts it all away in a
  box to keep it there. Such a man will find that all his fruit will go rotten and he will
  get no good of it at all. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;These, then, O householders,&quot; said the Buddha
  in concluding this sermon, &quot;are the four things that will promote your success and
  well-being in this world if you observe them. And now I will tell you what are the four
  things which will promote your best good in the future. They are, first: Faith in the
  teaching that the doing of good will bring good results, and the doing of evil, evil
  results. Second: The constant practice of good deeds, and the avoiding of evil deeds such
  as killing, stealing, lying, lewdness, and drinking intoxicating drinks. Third: The
  practice of liberality in giving so as to learn not to cling too closely to the things of
  the world. Fourth: The acquiring of wisdom so as to know and follow the path that leads to
  Nibbana.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Such was the sermon which the Lord Buddha delivered to
  these country villagers who wanted to know what ordinary household folk, not Bhikkhus or
  ascetics, could do to make sure of their well-being both here and hereafter. And they were
  all very much pleased with the plain practical advice which the Buddha gave them. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the longest discourses ever delivered was spoken,
  not to common folk nor yet to His Bhikkhus, but to no less a person than a king, King
  Ajatasattu of Magadha. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This King Ajatasattu was not a good man; he was, indeed, a
  murderer. He caused his own father, King Bimbisara who had been one of the first friends
  of the Buddha when he became Buddha, to be starved to death, and in this cruel and
  unrighteous manner, came to the throne himself. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It happened that one night of the full moon, King
  Ajatasattu sitting on the terrace of his palace, did not know what to do for
  entertainment, and decided that he would go and visit the Buddha who was then staying in a
  garden not too far away that had been given to Him and His Bhikkhus by the good physician
  Jivaka. When the king got to where the Buddha was, he found Him sitting quietly with all
  his Bhikkhus round Him in the preaching hall. The king exchanged the usual greetings of
  courtesy with the Buddha, and after taking a seat, asked the Great Teacher if he could
  tell what was the benefit or advantage of living like an ascetic. &quot;What profit is it
  to a man to live like a Bhikkhu?&quot; said King Ajatasattu. [*] &quot;I have asked
  several other leaders of ascetics this question, but I have never received a satisfying
  answer from any one of them. They always answered by telling me about something else I did
  not ask about. It was as if a person should enquire about bread-fruit, and in reply be
  told all about mangoes. So I shall be highly pleased, Reverend Sir, to hear what you will
  say in reply to this question of mine.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">* [Read &quot;The Fruits of the Homeless Life,&quot; by
  the author, or the Visible Fruits of a Buddhist Monk,&quot; by J. Wettha Singha.] </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the Buddha, after a few words exchanged back and
  forth, proceeded to tell King Ajatasattu at great length all the benefits that come to a
  man both in this life and afterwards through becoming a Bhikkhu; and He did it so well
  that when He had ended His long discourse, Ajatasattu declared himself entirely satisfied
  that what the Buddha had answered was true, and that it was the best thing in the world to
  be a Bhikkhu if a man could be one, honestly and sincerely and follow so great and good a
  teacher as the Buddha. And he asked the Buddha to look upon him henceforth as a follower
  of His and not of any other religious teacher. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">After the King had gone away again, the Buddha said to the
  Bhikkhus round Him: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;O Bhikkhus, this king was much moved in his mind
  just now as I was speaking to him. If, O Bhikkhus, this king had not done that evil deed,
  had not caused the death of his father the just king, there where he sat just now, he
  would have seen the Truth with clear eyes, and left his throne and everything behind him,
  and become a Bhikkhu and an Arahan.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This, the longest sermon the Buddha ever spoke can be read
  in its complete form in the Digha Nikaya of the Sutta Pitaka. It is called the
  Samannaphala Sutta, or the Discourse concerning the fruit of the life of an ascetic. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And here is the shortest sermon the Lord Buddha ever
  delivered; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some one once asked the Buddha: &quot;What is the best
  thing anybody can give as alms? What thing has the best taste? What thing gives the most
  pleasure? What thing is best fitted to bring passion to and end?&quot; And the Buddha
  replied to all these four questions with just this one word: &quot;Dhamma.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of course His questioner then asked Him to explain a
  little more what He meant; and the Buddha then said: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The giving of alms, though it is a good thing to do,
  cannot by itself bring a man on to the Path that leads to Deliverance: only the Dhamma can
  do this. Therefore the making known of the Dhamma, the trouble a man takes to give a
  knowledge of the Dhamma to others -- this is the best kind of giving, this is the best
  kind of alms. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Also, through learning the Dhamma, the heart is
  filled with joy and the mind delighted with its sweet taste, because it destroys all those
  passions in men which cause them suffering, and brings them at last to the final end of
  all sufferings -- to supreme Nibbana. Therefore the Dhamma is the most sweet tasting of
  all things, and the most pleasing of all things, and the best thing in the world for
  putting passion to an end. And so, my disciples, preach the Dhamma to all mankind, and
  thus you will be giving the very best of alms to all beings that live on the earth or in
  the heavens.&quot; </font></p>
