  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>MAKING KNOWN THE TEACHING </strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As a man who long has struggled to swim across a wide and
  stormy water and at length after much effort reaches the safe shore, lies down awhile to
  rest his wearied limbs and look back with satisfaction on the dangers he has safely
  passed, as a man who has climbed into the cool pleasant air of a high mountain slope, when
  he gets there turns round, pleased and contented, and looks down upon the hot, dusty plain
  whose stifling air he had left behind, so now, his long toil past, his labors successfully
  accomplished, there in the quiet wood of Uruvela the victor in this fierce fight, rested
  Himself for a time, enjoying the relief of release from toil and labor, tasting in peace
  well-won, the fruits of truth and knowledge He had gained. Then having rested Himself
  sufficiently beneath the tree of victory, Siddhattha Gotama, now and henceforth Gotama the
  Buddha, passed from under that tree and went towards another near by under which the
  goatherds of the place were accustomed to take shelter from the sun while they watched
  their flocks. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As He sat resting here, a Brahmin happened to come past
  that way, and after the usual greetings to the ascetic under the goatherd's tree, he said
  to Him, &quot;Gotama, what makes a man a real Brahmin? What qualities does he require to
  possess in order really to be a man of the highest caste?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And the Buddha, taking no notice of the proud Brahmin's
  rudeness in addressing Him by His family name of Gotama without any title of courtesy
  before it such as &quot;reverend Sir,&quot; or the like, pointedly replied to him in this
  verse: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The Brahmin who has put away all evil, Has put off
  pride, is self-restrained and pure, Has learning, follows out the Holy life, He alone has
  the light to be called Brahmin, He nothing has to do with worldly thing.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And the Brahmin went away muttering to himself: &quot;This
  ascetic Gotama knows me, this ascetic Gotama knows me.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A few days after this, while the Buddha was still staying
  under the goatherd's tree, two merchants who were going about the country selling their
  wares, came along the road, and seeing the ascetic sitting there under the goatherd's tree
  so calm and content, enjoying its fruits in the peace and quietude it has brought him,
  they offered Him an offering of the best food they had, and struck by His noble and
  majestic look, asked Him to accept them as believers in Him. These two merchants, whose
  names were Tapussa and Bhallika, were thus the first persons in the world who became the
  followers of the Buddha Gotama. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But now, having rested long enough, the Buddha began to
  think about what He should do next. He had found the Truth He sought, and now it seemed to
  Him that He ought not to keep such precious knowledge to Himself, but that He ought to
  tell it to others, so that they too might taste the comfort it brought. This was what He
  thought at first. But then other thoughts came into His mind. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This doctrine of mine is not a very easy doctrine to
  understand,&quot; he said to himself. &quot;It is deep and subtle. Only the thoughtful and
  reflective can grasp it fully so that it will do them good. But there are not many men who
  are thoughtful and reflective. The great majority of men do not want to take the trouble
  to think and reflect. They want something easy; something that will amuse and entertain
  them. Their minds are inclined only to what promises to give them pleasure and delight.
  They are altogether given over to love of pleasure. If I were to preach this doctrine to
  them, they would not know what I was talking about. They would not pay attention to me. I
  should only be giving myself trouble all for nothing.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus did the Buddha consider within himself almost making
  up his mind not to tell the Truth He had found to anybody, but just to keep it and enjoy
  it by Himself, since it did not seem to Him that anybody else in the world would want to
  hear it or thank Him for telling them. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">However He did not stop at this point in His reflections
  or else the world would not know as it does to-day, the Truth He taught. He went on to
  consider the matter further; and this is what He next thought: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yes, it is true that most of the people in the
  world, will not want to hear this Truth I have found, and would not understand it even if
  they did hear me tell about it, they are so fond of what is easy and pleasant and
  comfortable and costs them no trouble. But still, everybody in the world is not alike.
  There are sure to be some, not very many, but still some who are not satisfied with the
  way they are living now, who want to know more than they know now, who are not content to
  follow pleasure wherever it may lead them. What a pity it would be that I should know this
  Truth which would bring to these few comfort and happiness, if only they heard it, and yet
  never give them a chance to hear it! No, I shall not do like that. I shall go forth now
  and make known, to all men I meet, these Four Noble Truths, these Four Great Facts I have
  discovered, of Ill, and its Cause, and its Cure, and the Way in which it can be cured; and
  among the many I speak to, there will always be a few who will listen, and listening,
  understand me. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Just as in a lotus pond where all kinds of lotus
  lilies are growing, pink and blue and white, many of them have grown only a little way
  about the muddy bottom of the pond; and some have grown half way up through the water; and
  some have reached the top of the water and rest there; but a few grown up so as to lift
  their blossoms right out of, and above the mud and water, into the open air and the
  sunshine. So there are some beings whose minds are much sunk in the mud of passions and
  desires; and there are some that are not so much sunk in that mud; while some, a few are
  only a little touched with the mud of passion. These last will be able to understand my
  teaching when they hear it. I will let them hear it. I will go forth now and preach it to
  all men everywhere.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And then the Buddha began to consider who would be the
  best people to whom to tell His doctrine first, who would be the most likely to listen to
  Him and quickly understand what He said. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then He thought about His old teacher Alara Kalama, and
  how learned and thoughtful, how quick in the brain, how pure in his life he was. And He
  said to himself: &quot;I will go and tell Alara Kalama first. He will very quickly
  understand.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But as He was getting ready to go to Alara Kalama, some
  one came and told Him that Alara Kalama was dead. The Buddha was very sorry to hear this,
  for He felt sure that so good and so wise a man as His old teacher would have been sure to
  understand His doctrine as soon as he heard it. Then He began to think who else there was
  who would be likely to understand His doctrine. And the thought came to Him that perhaps
  the other teacher He had studied under in former days, Uddaka the disciple of Rama, would
  be a good person to whom to tell it, for Uddaka too, like Alara Kalama, was quick to
  understand anything new when he was told it. But when He made enquiry where Uddaka was
  staying, then He learned that he had died just the night before. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So once more He had to consider who among all those He
  once had known, would be most likely to listen to Him and understand the Truth He wanted
  to tell them. And then He remembered the five hermits who had waited upon Him and attended
  to Him so faithfully during the time when He was striving by Himself at Uruvela. After
  enquiring where they had gone to when they had left Him, He learned that they were staying
  in a deer-park near the city of Benares. So, rising up and leaving Uruvela, the Buddha set
  out to walk to Benares, about a hundred and fifty miles away, to find His former
  attendants and disciples and tell them what He had found. And wandering on day after day
  from place to place, at length one evening He drew near to the grove in the deer-park
  where those five ascetics were staying. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And they say Him approaching in the distance, and said to
  one another: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Look yonder! There is that ascetic Gotama coming
  here -- a luxurious fellow who gave up striving and fell back into a life of ease and
  comfort. Don't let us speak to Him! Don't let us show Him any respect! Let nobody go and
  offer to take His bowl or His extra robe from Him. We'll just leave a mat there for Him to
  sit on if He wants to, and if He doesn't want, He can stand. Who is going to attend on a
  good-for-nothing ascetic like Him!&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, as the Buddha came nearer and nearer, they began
  to notice that somehow He was not the same as He used to be in the days when they had
  lived with Him and studied under Him. There now was something about Him, something noble
  and majestic, such as they never had seen before. And almost in spite of themselves,
  before they well knew what they were doing, they had forgotten all they had just agreed on
  as to how they were going to receive Him. And one was hastening forward to meet Him, and
  respectfully taking His bowl and robe from Him, another busily preparing a seat for Him,
  while a third hurried off and brought Him water for His feet. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then, after He had taken the seat offered Him, the Buddha
  spoke to them and said: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Listen, ascetics. I have found the way to
  deathlessness. Let me tell you. Let me teach you. And if you listen and learn and practice
  as I instruct you, very soon you will know for yourselves, not in some future life but
  here and now in this present lifetime that what I say is true. You will realize for
  yourselves the state that is beyond all lives and deaths.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Naturally the five ascetics were very much astonished to
  hear their old master and teacher talking like this. They had seen Him give His hard life
  of going without proper food and rest; they had seen Him cease, as they thought, from all
  efforts to find the Truth, and here He was actually coming to them and telling them that
  He had found the Truth! They simply did not believe Him; and they told Him so. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Why, friend Gotama,&quot; they said, &quot;when we
  were living with you, you practiced all sorts of stern austerities and bodily
  mortifications such as were practiced by no other ascetic we ever heard of in the whole of
  India, and that was why we took you for our master and teacher. Yet with all you did, you
  never found out the Truth you wanted to find. How is it possible you can have found it now
  when you are living a life of luxury, have ceased from striving, and turned to live in
  ease and comfort?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But the Buddha replied: &quot;You are mistaken, ascetics.
  I have not given up all efforts. I am not living a life of self-indulgence and idle
  comfort and ease. Listen to me. I really have attained supreme knowledge and insight. And
  I can teach it to you so that you also may attain to it and possess it for
  yourselves.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But still the five ascetics could not believe what their
  old teacher now was telling them. It seemed to them impossible that such a thing could be
  true, even though He begged them once more to listen to Him and believe what He said. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then when He saw that they did not believe Him when He
  said He found the Deathless, He looked at them very earnestly, very seriously, and said: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Listen, ascetics! In all the time that you used to
  be with me, did I ever say anything like this to you before? Did I ever before tell you
  that I had found the supreme knowledge and insight that leads beyond birth and death?
  Come, answer me!&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The five ascetics had to answer the Buddha that it was
  true He had never said anything like this to them before. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Very well,&quot; urged the Buddha. &quot;Listen to
  me now when I tell you that I really have found the way to deathlessness. And let me show
  you what I have found.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So gravely and impressively did the Buddha speak these
  words, so gravely and impressively did He look at them as He spoke, that the five ascetics
  found themselves unable any longer to refuse to listen to Him. They invited their old
  master and teacher to stay with them and teach them. So, day after day, during the next
  few months, the Buddha taught these five old disciples of His, the new Truth He had
  discovered. First He taught two out of the five, while the other three went out with their
  begging bowls to the city, and collected enough food for the whole six of them. Then these
  three stayed at the deer-park and were taught by the Buddha while the other two went out
  begging and brought back sufficient for them all. Thus the little party of the five pupils
  and their teacher lived happily together, He teaching, the other five busily learning and
  practicing, until in a short time (for they were all diligent pupils, and they had the
  best master and teacher in the world) the whole five of them, one after another, reached
  and realized for themselves the Truth their Master had found. They came to know even while
  alive in this body, the state that is called Nibbana. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Out of these five ascetics, the one who was the first thus
  to learn and realize for himself what his Master taught, was called Kondanna. The names of
  the other four were, Bhaddaka, Assaji, Vappa, and Mahanama. These five ascetics were the
  first five Arahans that appeared in the world; for Arahan is the name that is given to one
  who in this life, in the body he now is in, comes to realize the state that cannot be
  touched by birth and death, the state that is called Nibbana. These five Arahans were the
  first members of the Sangha or Brotherhood of Bhikkhus who acknowledged the Buddha as
  master and teacher and guide for all their life. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">While the Buddha thus was staying in the deer-park at
  Isipatana, there came to see Him a rich young man of the neighborhood called Yasa. And
  after the young man Yasa had heard the Buddha explain his teaching and what it led to, he
  was so well pleased with what he heard that he became a Bhikkhu there and then, and stayed
  on with the Buddha in order to hear and learn more. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But towards evening that day an elderly man came to where
  the Buddha was, and told Him that his son had left home that morning saying he was going
  to visit the Buddha, but he had not come again, and his mother was crying for him thinking
  that he must have been killed by robbers on the way. Then the Buddha told the man that his
  son had become a Bhikkhu; and He began to explain His doctrine to the new Bhikkhu's
  father. And so well did He speak that when He had ended, the father also asked to be
  allowed to become a Bhikkhu, the same as his son had done; and he too, stayed with the
  Buddha and did not return home. And next morning, when the Buddha and the new young
  Bhikkhu went to his mother's house for food, she was quite pleased to learn that her son
  and her husband had become disciples of so great a teacher, and she herself became a
  lay-follower of the Buddha. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">After this, four close friends of young Yasa, when they
  saw what their companion had done, also did the same, and became Bhikkhus also, disciples
  of the Buddha Gotama, members of His Sangha. And in this way, more and more young men
  became Bhikkhus, until at last the Buddha had gathered round Him there at Isipatana, a
  body of about sixty young Bhikkhus, all of the best families, and all of them eager and
  diligent in study, and strenuous and persevering in practice under their Master's
  training, so that in no very long time, all of them had realized for themselves the
  supreme knowledge and insight, and become Arahans. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But the Buddha did not allow them to stay there with Him.
  Now that they had learned all He had to teach, He told them that now they must go out and
  teach others, so that these others who were ready to accept His teaching, might hear It
  and learn It, and be saved from all trouble and distress. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Go forth,&quot; He said to them, &quot;and make
  known the Teaching which is excellent in its beginnings, excellent in its progress, and
  excellent in its goal. Proclaim the perfect life, holy and pure. There are in the world
  beings not altogether blinded with the dust of passion and desire; and if they do not
  learn my doctrine, they will perish. They will listen to you: they will understand.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And the Buddha sent out these first sixty disciples, not
  in pairs nor in groups of three or four. He sent them out one by one, and each of them in
  a different direction, so as to make sure that His teaching should be spread as far and
  wide as possible. And these sixty Arahans did as their Master told them to do, and carried
  a knowledge of His Teaching and Discipline, North and South, and East and West. They were
  the first men in the world who went abroad into foreign countries for the sole purpose of
  spreading a knowledge of the religious truth they believed in. They were, in fact, the
  first duly appointed missionaries of a religion the world has seen. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And they were brave men, these first missionaries of the
  Buddha's religion. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of them came to the Buddha and told Him that he wanted
  to be sent to a certain country where everybody knew the people were very wild and rough. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;But what will you do there, Bhikkhu,&quot; said the
  Buddha, when He heard his request, &quot;if the people of the country abuse you and say
  all sorts of bad things about you.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then,&quot; answered the Bhikkhu, &quot;I shall say
  to myself: 'These people are very good people; they only use their tongues to me; they do
  not beat me with their fists.'&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;But suppose they beat you with their fists, Bhikkhu,
  what will you do then?&quot; asked the Buddha. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then I shall say to myself: 'These people are very
  good people; they do not thrash me with sticks,'&quot; replied the Bhikkhu. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;But if they thrash you with sticks, what then?&quot;
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then I shall say that they are very good people;
  they do not cut me with swords.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And if they cut you with swords?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then I shall say they are very good, they do not
  kill me.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;But if they make to kill you, O Bhikkhu; what will
  you do then?&quot; said the Buddha. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then Lord,&quot; said the Bhikkhu calmly, &quot;I
  shall say to myself: 'These people are doing me a great favor, for this body of mine is an
  evil thing of which I shall be glad to be rid; and these good people are going to rid me
  of it.'&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the Buddha said: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Go O Bhikkhu, and make known my Teaching among these
  people. Bhikkhus like you are the proper kind of Bhikkhus to publish abroad my Doctrine
  among all the peoples and nations of the world.&quot; #11; *&#11;&#11;#11;&#11;#11; </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">* * * </font></p>
  <h3 align="center"><font color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">Chapter IX </font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>SIGALA </strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the meantime the two merchants Tapussa and Bhallika,
  the first men in the world to call themselves the followers of the Buddha, had traveled
  on, and in the course of their journeying, come to Kapilavatthu. There they told everybody
  that they had seen Siddhattha the son of their king, at Uruvela, and that He had actually
  become, as had been prophesied, a very great religious teacher, indeed, the greatest
  religious teacher in the world, an Awakened One, a Buddha. And they said they had heard
  that He was coming soon to Kapilavatthu. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And, shortly after the Buddha had sent out the sixty
  Arahans to preach His Doctrine everywhere, He himself also left the deer-park at
  Isipatana, and turning Southwards in the direction of the Magadha country, at length came
  back to Uruvela. Here he stayed for a time, and entered into talk and discussions with a
  number of hermits who were living there under a leader called Kassapa. And after He had
  explained His Doctrine to them, Kassapa himself, their leader and teacher, accepted the
  Buddha's doctrine as true, and asked the Buddha to receive him into the Order of His
  Bhikkhus. And later on, by meditating and practicing as the Buddha taught him, he became
  an Arahan, and after the Buddha had passed away, he was one of the leading Arahans who
  maintained the doctrine in its original purity. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But now, leaving Uruvela, the Buddha wandered on through
  the country towards Rajagaha the capital city of Magadha, to keep His promise to its king,
  Bimbisara, that when He had found the Truth, He would come and let him and his people know
  it. And King Bimbisara and his people received Him with great gladness, now that He had
  become a Buddha. And in a grove of bamboo trees a little way outside the city He stayed
  many days, teaching and preaching so kindly and so persuasively, that the king and all his
  people accepted His teaching entirely and became His declared followers. And the king, to
  show the respect in which he held the Buddha and His Teaching and the Brotherhood of
  Bhikkhus, made Him a gift of the Bamboo Grove and of a fine Vihara he caused to be build
  there, so that He and His Sangha would always have a comfortable place to live in during
  the rainy season. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now one morning as the Buddha left the Bamboo Grove to go
  into Rajagaha to beg alms of food, He saw a young man all dripping wet as if he had just
  come from bathing, standing in the roadway and bowing in each of the four directions,
  East, South, West and North, as well as to the sky overhead and to the ground beneath his
  feet, at the same time throwing rice in each of these directions. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha looked at the young man as he went through this
  strange performance on the public street, and then He stopped and asked the young man why
  he was acting like that. The young man replied that he was only doing what his old father
  had asked him to do each morning so as to keep any evil from coming to him during each day
  from any of the four directions, or from the gods above, or from the demons below. It was
  his father's last wish, spoken on his death-bed, so he could not deny him his wish. And
  every day since his father had died, he had faithfully observed his promise without
  missing a single morning. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;It is very right of you,&quot; said the Buddha when
  He heard the young man's answer, &quot;to keep the promise you made to your dying father
  and carry out his wish faithfully; but what you are doing is not really what your father
  meant.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When your father told you that you were to bow down
  to, and make an offering of rice to the East, he meant that you were to show respect and
  honor to those through whom you have come into life, namely, to your parents. By
  worshiping the South, he meant worshiping and honoring your teachers through whom you get
  knowledge. By worshiping the West, he meant cherishing and supporting wife and children.
  By worshiping the North, he meant holding in esteem all relatives and friends, and helping
  them where they have need of help. By worshiping the sky, he meant worshiping and
  reverencing all that is good and holy and high. And by worshiping the earth, he meant
  respecting the rights of every creature, even the smallest and meanest that lives upon it.
  This is the way in which your father wished you to behave so that no harm would come to
  you any day from any quarter whatsoever.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And there and then the Lord Buddha went on to give Sigala
  -- for that was the name of the young man He was speaking to -- some good counsel as to
  how he should live so as to make his own and other people's lives happy and fortunate here
  and now, and in the future earn an equally happy and fortunate lot. He told Sigala to
  abstain from killing and stealing and lying and lewdness and the using of intoxicating
  drinks or hurtful drugs. He told him to avoid bad companions and cultivate the
  acquaintance of good people. He told him to work diligently so as to get wealth, and then
  to take care of the wealth he earned, but yet not to be greedy in keeping it all to
  himself, nor yet foolish in throwing it away again on foolish objects, but to use a fourth
  part of it in supporting himself and all depending on him, his wife and family, another
  fourth part in building up and extending his business further, another fourth part in
  helping any one in need of help, and the last fourth part he was to lay aside and keep in
  case misfortune should come to him and he should need help himself. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Young Sigala listened respectfully to all the good counsel
  the Lord Buddha thus gave him. Then he confessed that when his father was living, he had
  often told him about the Buddha and what a great and good teacher He was, and had tried to
  get him to go and see the Buddha and hear Him preach; but he always refused to go, saying
  that is was too much trouble and would only weary him, and that he had neither time nor
  money to spend on wandering ascetics like Gotama. And Sigala now asked the Buddha kindly
  to pardon him for his former neglect, and to accept him as a follower; for, so he promised
  the Lord Buddha, he meant to worship the six directions of space exactly in this right way
  which the Buddha had just taught him, for all the rest of his life. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The full account of all the Buddha said to Sigala that
  morning in the streets of Rajagaha, can be read in the Sigalovada Sutta of the Samyutta
  Nikaya. </font></p>

  <h3 align="center"><font color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">Chapter X </font></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>SARIPUTTA AND MOGGALLANA </strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now about this time there was staying near Rajagha a
  famous religious teacher called Sanjaya, along with a large following of disciples and
  pupils, numbering about two hundred in all. And among these two-hundred disciples of
  Sanjaya, there were two very close friends who were not at all satisfied with the teaching
  their master gave them. These two friends whose names were Upatissa and Kolita, wanted to
  know something more than their teacher knew and taught: they wanted to find that state
  which is beyond the power of death. They wanted to find what they called &quot;The
  Deathless.&quot; And these two friends were so fond of one another, that they always
  shared together what ever either of them got. And they made a solemn promise to each other
  that they would both search and study and meditate with all their power, and try to find
  &quot;The Deathless,&quot; and whichever of them found it first, he would let the other
  know. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now it chanced that one morning early, as Upatissa was in
  the main street of Rajagaha, he saw some distance away, an ascetic going round from door
  to door begging alms of food. And as he looked at him, he was very much struck by
  everything about him. The unknown ascetic seemed to him most modest in his demeanor, and
  so calm and collected in his way of walking along and standing still while the people
  brought out rice from their houses and put it in his bowl. But when he had come nearer,
  his admiration of the ascetic was turned into wonder and reverence, for there was a look
  in his face such as he had never seen on the face of any ascetic before -- a look of
  perfect peace, of unshakable serenity as of a smooth unruffled lake under a calm, clear
  sky. &quot;Who is this?&quot; said Upatissa to himself. &quot;This ascetic must be one who
  has found what I am seeking, or else he must be the pupil of such an one. I wonder who is
  his teacher? Whose doctrine can it be that he follows? I must go after him and find
  out.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Upatissa, however, knew that it was not proper to ask
  questions of a stranger ascetic while he was busy begging his morning meal, so he
  patiently walked on some way behind him as he passed in and out among the houses with his
  begging bowl; but at last, when the ascetic had gone round all the houses, and now was
  going out of the city gate, Upatissa went up to him, and greeting him with respect, humbly
  asked him if he would kindly tell him who was the teacher at whose feet he sat and
  learned. &quot;&#11;Your coming and going, brother, are so serene and placid,&quot; he
  said, &quot;your face is so clear and bright; very much would I like to know who is that
  teacher, to follow whom you have left home and friends behind. What is your teacher's
  name? What is the doctrine he preaches?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I can soon tell you that, brother,&quot; said the
  ascetic pleasantly. &quot;There is a great ascetic of the Sakya race who has left his home
  and country behind in order to follow the homeless life. And it is to follow him that I
  have left the household life. It is that Blessed One who is my teacher. It is His teaching
  that I follow and practice.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;And what is that teaching, Venerable Sir? What is it
  that your master teaches? I also would like to know it,&quot; said Upatissa eagerly,
  thinking that perhaps at last now he was going to hear from this ascetic about that
  &quot;Deathless&quot; for which he and his friend Kolita had been looking for so long. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I am only a novice, a newcomer into the Brotherhood
  of the Blessed One,&quot; replied the ascetic modestly. &quot;It is only a little while
  ago since I began to study under the Blessed One, and to follow His rules of discipline,
  so I do not know very much yet about His Teaching. I cannot explain it to you in every
  little point. But if it is only the pith of His teaching that you want; I can give you
  that just in a few words.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;That is all I want, brother,&quot; said Upatissa
  quickly. &quot;Tell me the substance. The substance is just what I want. What need to make
  a lot of words about it?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Very well, then,&quot; said the ascetic.
  &quot;Listen!&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;How all things here through Cause have come, He hath
  made known, the Awakened One. And how again they pass away, That, too, the Great Recluse
  doth say.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That was all the ascetic said. But as Upatissa stood there
  listening to him by the city gate in one great flash of insight there burst upon his mind
  in all its force and verity, the great truth taught by all the Buddhas -- the truth that
  everything that ever has come into existence, or ever will come into existence,
  inevitably, unfailingly, without exception, must and will again Pass out of existence.
  Upatissa in this great moment saw clearly with his whole heart and mind that only whatever
  has not arisen, never had come into existence can be free from the law that it must pass
  out of existence again, must die. And he said to the ascetic: &quot;If this is the
  doctrine you have learned from your teacher, then indeed you have found the state that is
  free from sorrow, free from death, the state of the Sorrowless, the Deathless, which has
  not been made known to men for ages and ages.&quot; Then, with expressions of joyful
  gratitude, he took leave of the ascetic who thus in a moment had brought light to his
  mind, and he went off to find his friend Kolita and bring him the great news that at last
  he had found &quot;The Deathless.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But just as he had seen the unknown ascetic from a
  distance and wondered at his impressive walk and behavior; so now Kolita saw his friend
  Upatissa coming near, and wondered what had made such a change in his whole appearance.
  And he said to him: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Why, brother, how clear and shining your face is!
  Can it be, brother, that at last you have found &quot;The Deathless&quot; we both have
  been seeking so long?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;It is so, brother; it is so,&quot; was Upatissa's
  glad reply. &quot;I have found the Deathless.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;But how, brother, how?&quot; Kolita asked eagerly. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then Upatissa told his bosom friend Kolita about the
  unknown ascetic he had seen that morning begging in the streets -- an ascetic all dressed
  in yellow, and looking so calm and collected as he never had seen an ascetic look before.
  And how he had followed him out of the city gate and then asked him to tell him the secret
  of his peace and serenity. Then he repeated to Kolita the four line stanza the ascetic of
  the happy countenance had repeated to him. And there and then, in a flash of perception,
  Kolita also saw the Truth that the Deathless is that which never has arisen in this world
  of sights and sounds and scents and tastes and touches and ideas, and, because it never
  has so arisen, therefore cannot pass away again, cannot die. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So these two friends, with minds now happy and joyful,
  went to the place where the Buddha was, and asked to be allowed to take Him as their
  master and teacher henceforth instead of Sanjaya whom they now left. And the Buddha
  accepted them into the Brotherhood of His Bhikkhus, and within a very short time they
  became the very foremost of the Buddha's disciples for their learning and practical
  knowledge. In fact, these two friends Upatissa and Kolita, became the two great Theras
  known to the world as Sariputta and Moggallana. And the name of the ascetic who told them
  the Doctrine of the Buddha in one little stanza or gatha of four lines only, was Assajii.
  And ever afterwards this little stanza was known as &quot;Assaji's stanza.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But it was not only Upatissa and Kolita who joined the
  Buddha's Order of Bhikkhus while he was staying at Rajagaha at this time. Many of the
  youths of the best families of Magadha left their homes, their fathers and mothers and all
  their relations behind them, and became the Bhikkhu disciples of the great Sakya teacher
  who was so different from the ordinary religious teachers of the country -- so great and
  noble by birth and attainments, and whose Teaching, if followed to its end, brought about
  the ceasing of all things evil. Indeed, so many young men left their homes to follow the
  Sakya Sage, the Buddha Gotama, that the people of the country began to get alarmed and
  annoyed, and some of them even got angry. And they went to the Buddha and complained
  saying that if things went on much longer as they were doing, soon there would be no young
  men at all left in the country to live the household life. Soon, they said, there would be
  no more families, no more wives and children, and the whole country would go to ruin and
  become an empty wilderness, for all the young men in the country would be Bhikkhus. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So when the Buddha heard this complaint of the people, He
  gave orders that after this, no one was to come and follow Him as a Bhikkhu without first
  getting permission to do so from his father or mother; or, if his father and mother were
  dead, then from his nearest relation, whoever that might be. And when the people of
  Magadha heard of this new rule of the Buddha, they were once more pleased and contented to
  have a Buddha in their midst, and they gave Him and His Bhikkhus the best of everything
  they had got. And this new rule which the Buddha thus first gave out at Rajagaha with
  regard to Bhikkhus joining the Order, is the one we find in the Vinaya Rules of the Sangha
  to this day. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>KAPILAVATTHU </strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the Buddha's father, King Suddhodana, heard that his
  son was now at Rajagaha, he sent a messenger to tell Him that His father was now getting
  old, and begged that He would come and let him see his son once more before he died. But
  the messenger he sent happened to arrive at Rajagaha just when the Buddha was preaching to
  the people. So he sat down and listened to the preaching till it was finished before
  trying to deliver his message. But what the Buddha said seemed to him so good and so true
  as he listened to it, that when the discourse was ended, in his pleasure and delight with
  it, he had forgotten all about what he had come for, he had forgotten the message King
  Suddhodana had sent him to take to his son the Buddha, and instead of delivering it, he
  remained with the Buddha so as to hear Him preach some more. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">King Suddhodana at Kapilavatthu, meanwhile waited a long
  time for his messenger to come back and tell him what his son had said in reply to his
  message, but no messenger came. Then he sent another messenger to take the same message to
  his son the Buddha, and to see what had happened to his first messenger. But this second
  messenger also, when he arrived, found the Buddha preaching, listened to His preaching,
  became converted to His doctrine, and remained with Him. Then King Suddhodana sent out a
  third messenger with his message and to see what had happened to the first two he had
  sent; but the same thing happened to him as to the other two before him; he did not come
  back with any answer. And so, one after another, King Suddhodana sent out other messengers
  until he had sent out nine altogether; but none of them came back. They were also charmed
  by the Buddha's words that they forgot what they had been sent to say, and stayed with the
  Buddha so as to hear more of His preaching. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The King thought it was very strange that none of his
  messengers had come back with any answer. He asked Yasodhara, his son's wife, to try do
  what she could to get an answer from Him, and to bring Him to Kapilavatthu. So now
  Yasodhara sent a messenger asking her husband to come and see her and Rahula, who was a
  fine little boy seven years old. But the same thing happened to her messenger as happened
  to King Suddhodana's: he was so pleased with the Buddha's preaching that he forgot the
  message he had been sent with, and did not return. Then another and another messenger was
  sent by Yasodhara but none of them returned. All were captivated by the Buddha's words,
  and remained with Him. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And now Yasodhara did not know what more she could do to
  get her husband to come and see her and His son. Then King Suddhodana remembered that
  there was a young man about the court called Udayi who had formerly been the Buddha's
  favorite playmate when they both were boys together. And he thought that if he sent Udayi
  to tell his son that His old father wanted to see Him once more before he died, perhaps He
  would listen to this old friend of His boyhood's days, and come to Kapilavatthu. For of
  course, neither the King nor Yasodhara knew that all the messengers they had sent before
  had never delivered their message at all. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So now the friend of His youth, Udayi, was sent to ask the
  Buddha to come to Kapilavatthu and let everyone there see His face once more -- His
  father, His wife, His son, and all the people of the country who would have called Him
  their king one day if He had not gone away to become a religious teacher. And when Udayi
  came to Rajagaha he soon learned the real reason why King Suddhodana's and Princess
  Yasodhara's messengers had never come back. So Udayi stopped his ears while the preaching
  was going on for fear that he too might do as the others had done. But when the preaching
  was over, he went to the Buddha and after greeting Him with profound reverence, he told
  Him that His father and wife and son, as well as all the people of Kapilavatthu, were
  very, very anxious to see the Buddha that had appeared in the world, and asked Him out of
  compassion to come and visit them soon. Then the Buddha very kindly said that He would not
  refuse to gratify the wish of those who were His own people, and that very soon He would
  go to Kapilavatthu and see them all. So Udayi hurried back to King Suddhodana bearing the
  news that He who before was Prince Siddhattha, and now was the great, the universally
  honored Buddha, soon would be coming to the city to do the duty of a son to his father. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then every one in Kapilavatthu, from the King downward,
  was filled with joy to know that their prince who had left them seven long years ago and
  become a homeless beggar in order to follow the religious life, had succeeded in His
  efforts to find the Truth, and was now a Buddha, a teacher not only of men but of the very
  gods, and soon would be back among His own folk again to tell them what he had found. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So they swept up all the streets of the city and made them
  clean as they never had been made clean before. They decorated all their houses with
  flowers, and hung flags and streamers of many colored cloth along the streets, and
  prepared to give their prince a reception worthy of the eldest son of their Raja, and a
  great Buddha as well. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And on the day when the Buddha was expected to arrive in
  the city, the king sent out his best elephants decorated with all their royal ornaments,
  along the road by which he thought his son would come, in order that they might meet Him
  and conduct Him in regal state into the city of His fathers. Yasodhara also, on this great
  day, ordered her bearers to carry her litter out to the borders of the city so that she
  might meet her husband at the city gate. But as they were carrying her along the main
  street, she saw ahead of her an ascetic dressed all in yellow who was going round from
  door to door with a bowl in his hand begging alms of fool. &quot;Who can that ascetic
  be?&quot; she thought to herself. &quot;Never before have I seen a begging ascetic look so
  noble an dignified as this one does. He must be a very good and holy man.&quot; But as she
  came nearer, what was her surprise to find that the yellow-robed beggar was her own
  husband, the father of her child, the handsome Prince Siddhattha of former days! He was
  not handsome now in the way that he used to be handsome. About Him now there was something
  that was better than handsomeness, something great and high and holy that made her get
  down out of her litter and bow low before His feet, as He passed upon His silent way, His
  eyes fixed on the ground, not seeing her. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But when she returned to the Palace and told the king her
  father-in-law in what way his son and her husband, had come into the city, as a beggar,
  King Suddhodana was filled with humiliation and anger at the news. At once he ordered his
  charioteer to get the chariot ready and he drove furiously through the streets of the city
  towards the place where Yasodhara had told him she had seen her husband begging. When the
  king got there he found the Buddha calmly pacing along towards the Palace with a
  worshiping crowd all round Him. But the king's indignation and anger at his son's behavior
  in begging where He had the right to take all He wanted without asking leave, remained as
  great as ever, and he at once began to scold and upbraid Him. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;What is this I hear about you, my son?&quot; he
  cried. &quot;Was it for this that you left your father's home, to come back begging your
  daily food like the commonest beggar in the kingdom -- you, the son of the king, the heir
  to the throne? O my son, you have this day disgraced me and the royal house to which you
  belong. When did any of your race and lineage do a thing like this? When did any of our
  family before beg his food like a common beggar?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But the Buddha quietly answered his grieved, indignant
  father: &quot;Indeed, my father, this is how my race and lineage have always done.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Your race have always been kings for as long as men
  can remember,&quot; said King Suddhodana proudly. &quot;Not one of them ever did a thing
  like this.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;That is true, my father,&quot; the Buddha gently
  answered. &quot;But now I do not think of my earthly descent. Now I belong to the race of
  the Buddha of all time. It is of them that I speak when I say that I only do as my race
  has always done. For the Buddhas have always done like this, and now, as is only right and
  proper, I do the same.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And as the Buddha walked along beside his father towards
  the Palace, He told him that He was not coming back to the home of His fathers, by any
  means poor or empty handed. He told him that He was bringing back with Him a precious
  jewel, the richest, most precious jewel in the world, the jewel of the security of
  Nibbana. And then He went on to tell His father all about that great security, Nibbana,
  and about the way in which it can be reached. And when He had come to the Palace, He sat
  down and explained the Truth He had discovered so simply and persuasively that not only
  His father and Yasodhara and His son Rahula, but all the people of Kapilavatthu became his
  followers and accepted His Teaching as true. And after a short time, His son Rahula was
  ordained and became a member of the Order of Bhikkhus. </font></p>
