  MAHASAMMATA</font></b></center>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">S</font>PRUNG of the race of
  king Mahasammata was the Great Sage. For in the beginning of this age of the
  world there was a king named Mahüsammata, and (the kings) Roja and Vararoja,
  and the two Kalyanakas, Uposatha aM Mandhata and the two, Caraka and Upacara,
  and Cetiya and Mucala and he who bore t-he name Mahamucala, Mucalinda and
  Sagara and he who bore the name Sagaradeva; Bharata and Angirasa and Ruci and
  also Suruci, Patäpa and Mahapatapa and the two Panadas likewise, Sudassana
  and Neru, two and two; also Accima. His sons and grandsons, these twenty-eight
  princes whose lifetime wp immeasurably (long), dwelt in Kusavati, Rajagaha,
  and Mithila. Then followed a hundred kings, and (then) fifty-six, and (then)
  sixty, eighty-four thousand, and then further thirty-six, thirty-two,
  twenty-eight, then further twenty-eight, eighteen, seventeen, fifteen,
  fourteen; nine, seven, twelve, then further twentyfive; and (again)
  twenty-five, twelve and (again) twelve, and yet again nine and eighty-four
  thousand with Makhädeva coming at the head, and (once more) eighty-four
  thousand with Kalarajanaka at the head; and sixteen even unto Okkãka; these
  descendants (of Mahasammata) reigned in groups in theirdue order, each one in
  his capital.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The prince Okkamukha was Okkaka's eldest son;
  Nipmia, Candimã, Candamukha and Sivisarnjaya, the great king Vessantara,
  Jãli, and Sihavahana and Sihassara: these were his sons and grandsons.
  Eighty-two thousand in number were the royal sons and grandsons of king
  Sihassara; Jayasena was the last of them. They are known as the Sakya kings of
  Kapilavatthu. The great king Sihahanu was Jayasena's son, and Jayasena's
  daughter was named Yasodharã. In Devadaha there was a prince named
  Devadahasakka, Anjana and Kaccänã were his two children. Kaccãnä was the
  first consort of Sihahanu, but the Sakka Anjana's queen was Yasodhara. Anjana
  had two daughters, Maya and Pajäpati, and also two sons, Dandapamji and the
  Sakiya Suppabuddha. But Sihahanu had five sons and two daughters, Suddhodana,
  Dhotodana, Sakka, Sukka, and Amitodana, and Amitä and Pamita; these were the
  five sons and two daughters.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The royal consort of the Sakka Suppabuddha was
  Amitii; she had two children: Bhaddakaccäna and Devadatta. MaytL and Pajapati
  were Suddhodana's queens, and the son of the great king Suddhodana and of Maya
  was our Conqueror.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of this race of Mahasammata, thus succeeding,
  was born, in unbroken line, the Great Sage, he who stands at the head of all
  men of lordly birth. The consort of the prince Siddhattha, the Bodhisatta, was
  Bhaddgakaccana; her son was Rahula.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Bimbisara and the prince Siddhattha were
  friends, and friends likewise were the fathers of both. The Bodhisatta was
  five years older than Bimbisara; twenty-nine years old was he when he left
  (his father's) house. When he had striven six years and thereafter had
  attained to wisdom, he, being thirty-five years old, visited Bimbisära. The
  virtuous Bimbisära was fifteen years old when he was anointed king by his own
  father, and when sixteen years had gone by since his coming to the throne, the
  Master preached his doctrine. Two and fifty years he reigned; fifteen years of
  his reign passed before the meeting with the Conqueror, and yet thirtyseven
  years (of his reign) followed in the lifetime of the Tathagata.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Bimbisara's son, the. foolish Ajatasattu,
  reigned thirty-two years after he, the traitor, had slain (his father). In the
  eighth year of Ajatasattu the Sage entered into nibbana and thereafter did he,
  Ajãtasattu, reign yet twenty-four years.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Tathagata, who has reached the summit of
  all virtue, yielded himself up, albeit free, into the power of impermanence.
  He who shall contemplate this (same) dread-begetting impermanence shall attain
  unto the end of suffering.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the second chapter, called 'The Race
  of Maha saipmata', in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the serene joy and emotion
  of the pious.</font>
