  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>HE great thera Mahinda,
  of lofty wisdom, who at that time had been twelve years (a monk), charged by
  his teacher and by the brotherhood to convert the island of Lañkä, pondered
  on the fitting time (for this) and thought: 'Old is the king Mutasiva; his son
  must become king.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he had resolved to visit in the meantime
  his kinsfolk, he bade farewell to his teacher and the brotherhood and having
  asked the leave of the king he took with him the four theras and also
  Saipghamitta's son, the miraculously gifted samanera Sumana, mighty in the six
  supernormal powers; and he went to Dakkhinagira to confer on his kinsfolk
  (the) grace (of his preaching). While he was so doing six months passed away.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he came in time to Vedisagiri the city of
  his mother Devi, he visited his mother and when Devi saw her dear son she made
  him welcome, and his companions likewise, with foods prepared by herself, and
  she led the thera up to the lovely vihära Vedisagiri.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the prince Asoka, while ruling over the
  realm of Avanti, that his father had bestowed on him, halted in the town of
  Vedisa, before he came to Ujjeni, and met there a lovely maiden named DevI,
  the áaughter of a merchant, he made her his wife; and she was (afterwards)
  with child by him and bore in Ujjeni a beautiful boy, Mahinda, and when two
  years bad passed (she bore) a daughter, Samghamitta. At that time she lived in
  the city of Vedisa. The thera who then- sojourned there, perceiving (that) the
  time (was come), thought thus: 'In that great festival of consecration
  commanded by my father shall the great king Devanampiyatissa take part, and he
  shall know the splendour of the three things when he has heard it from the
  envoys. He shall climb the Missakamountain on the uposatha-day of the month
  Jettha. On that same day we will go to the beauteous isle of Lanka;.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The great Indra sought out the excellent thera
  Mahinda and said to him: 'Set forth to convert Lanka; by the Sam buddha also
  hast thou been foretold (for this) and we will be those who aid thee there.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The son of a daughter of Devi's sister, (a
  youth) named Bhanduka, who had heard the doctrine preached by the thera to
  Devi, and who had obtained the reward of one who shall return no more unto
  life remained with the thera.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he had stayed there a month the thera, on
  the uposatha-day of the month Jettha, with the four theras and Sumana, and the
  lay-disciple Bhanduka also, to the end that they might be known for human
  beings, rose up in the air (and departed) from that vihara; and he, the
  (thera) of wondrous powers, coming hither with his following alighted on the
  pleasant Missaka-mountain, on the Sila-peak on the open and fair Ambatthala.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">He who was foretold by the Sage, in the hour
  of death, as bringing salvation to Lañkä, by his merit in converting Lanka,
  he, who for Lanka's salvation had become like to the Master, alighted there,
  extolled by the gods of Lanka.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the thirteenth chapter, called 'The
  Coming of Mahinda', in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the serene joy and emotion
  of the pious.</font>
