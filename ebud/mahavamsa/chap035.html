  MAHA DATHIKA's death AMANDA GAMANI, his son, reigned nine years and eight
  months. On the splendid Great Thupa he caused to be made a parasol above the
  parasol, and he built even there a vedi at the base and at the top. And in
  like manner he made an inner courtyard and an inner verandah to the Lohapasada
  and to the (building) called the Uposatha (house) of the Thuparama. Moreover,
  for both he built a beautiful pavilion adorned with precious stones; and the
  ruler of men also built the Rajatalena-vihara. When he had made the
  Mahagamendi-tank on the south side (of Anurädhapura), he, who was clever in
  works of merit, bestowed it on the Dakkhina-vihära. On the whole island the
  ruler of men commanded not to kill. All kinds of vine-fruits did he plant in
  divers places, and the king Amandiya, filling the almsbowis with the fruit
  called 'flesh-melons', and bestowing garments as a support (for the bowls) he
  gave of these, with believing heart, to the whole brotherhood; because he had
  filled the almsbowls (with them) be received the name AMANDA GAMANI.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A33"></a> His younger brother, the
  prince KANIRAJANU TISSA, reigned three years in the city, when he had slain
  his brother. He decided the lawsuit concerning the uposatha-house in the
  (vihara) named after the cetiya, but sixty bhikkhus who were invoived in the
  crime of high treason did the king order to be taken captive, with all that
  was theirs, upon the Cetiyapabbata, and he commanded these evildoers to be
  flung into the caves called Kanira.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A34"></a> After KANIRAJANU's death
  AMANDA GAMANI's son, the prince CULABHAYA, reigned a year. The king built the
  Culagallakavihara on the bank of the Gonaka-river to the south of the capital.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A35"></a> After the death of
  CULABHAYA his younger sister SIVALI, the daughter of <a name="35"></a><a name="A36"></a>AMANDA,
  reigned four months. But AMANDA's nephew named ILANAGA dethroned Sivali and
  raised the parasol (of sovereignty) in the capital. When, one day, in the
  first year (of his reign), the king went to the Tissa-tank, many of the
  Lambakannas deserted him and went back to the capital. When the king saw them
  not he was wroth and (in punishment) he ordered that they, even they
  themselves, should make a road to the Mahäthüpa, commanding to stamp it down
  firmly, where it ran beside the tank, and he set caudalas to be their
  overseers. And full of anger because of this the Lambakannas came together,
  and when they had taken the king captive and imprisoned him in his palace they
  themselves administered the government; but the king's consort put festal
  garments on her little son the prince Candamukhasiva, gave him into the hands
  of the serving-women and sent him to the state-elephant, charging (the
  attendants) with a message.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The serving-women conveyed him thither and
  gave the state elephant the queen's whole message: 'This is thy lord's son;
  thy lord is in prison; better is it for this (boy) to meet his death by thee
  than by the enemies; then slay thou him: that is the queen's command.' With
  these words they laid him down at the elephant's feet. And for grief the
  elephant began to shed tears, and breaking to pieces the posts (to which he
  was chained) he pressed forward into the palace and dashed against the gate
  with fury, and when he had broken down the door' in the room where the king
  sat, he made him mount upon his back and went towards Mahatittha. There the
  elephant made the king embark on a ship (that brought him) to the western
  shore of the sea; he himself went toward Malaya.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the king had stayed three years on the
  other coast he raised an army and went by ship to Rohana. Having landed at the
  haven Sakkharasobbha the king assembled there in Rohana a mighty force. Then
  came the king's state-elephant forthwith out of the southern Malaya to Rohana
  to do him service. As he had heard there the Kapi-jataka from the great thera,
  the preacher of jatakas, named Mahäpaduma, who dwelt in the (vihara) called
  Tuladhara, he, being won to faith in the Bodhisatta, restored the
  Nagamahavihara and gave it the extension of a hundred unbent bows in length,
  and he enlarged the thüpa even to what it has been (since then); moreover, he
  made the Tissa-tank and the tank called Dura.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the king had raised an army he marched to
  battle; when the Lambakannas heard this they also prepared themselves for
  battle. Near the gate of Kapallakkhanda on the field of Hankarapitthi was
  waged the battle between the two (armies) that brought destruction to both.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since their bodies were exhausted by the
  sea-journey, the king's men yielded their ground, therefore the king
  proclaimed his name and pressed forward. Terrified thereat the Lambakannas
  threw themselves down upon their belly, and they hewed off their heads and
  heaped them up high as the nave of the (king's) waggon-wheel, and when this
  had come to pass three times the king, from pity, said: 'Slay them not, but
  take them captive living.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When then the king had come into the capital
  as victor in battle and had raised the parasol (of sovereignty) he went to a
  festival at the Tissa-tank.' And when he, fully arrayed in his ornaments and
  armour, had withdrawn from the watersports and reflected on the good-fortune
  that he had attained, and thought of the Lambakannas who had opposed his
  progress, he was wroth and commanded that they be yoked two and two behind one
  another to his car, and thus did he enter the city in front of them. Halting
  on the threshold of the palace the king gave the command: 'Here on this
  threshold, soldiers, strike off their heads.' 'These are but oxen yoked to thy
  chariot, O lord of chariots; therefore let their horns and hoofs be struck
  off,' thus admonished by his mother the king recalled (the order) to behead
  them and commanded that their nose and toes be cut off. The district where the
  elephant had stayed the prince allotted to the elephant; and therefore the
  tract is called Hatthibhoga.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So ILANAGA, ruler of the earth, reigned full
  six years as king in Anuradhapura.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A37"></a> After the death of ILANAGA
  his son CANDAMUKHA SIVA reigned eight years and seven months as king.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the lord of the earth had constructed a
  tank near Manikaragamaka he gave it to the vihara called Issarasamana. This
  king's consort who was known by the name Damilidevi, allotted her own revenues
  from that village to the same vihara.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A38"></a> Having slain Candamukha
  Siva in the festival-sports at the Tissa-tank his younger brother, known by
  the name YASALALAKATISSA, reigned as king in delightful Anuradhapura, the fair
  face of Lanka, seven years and eight months.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A39"></a> Now a son of Datta the
  gate-watchman, named SUBHA, who was himself a gate-watchman, bore a close
  likeness to the king. And this palace-guard SUBHA did the king Yasalalaka, in
  jest, bedeck with the royal ornaments and place upon the throne and binding
  the guard's turban about his own head, and taking himself his place, staff in
  band, at the gate, he made merry over the ministers as they paid homage to
  (SUBHA) sitting on the throne. Thus was he wont to do, from time to time.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now one day the guard cried out to the king,
  who was laughing: 'Why does this guard laugh in my presence?' And SUBHA the
  guard ordered to slay the king, and he himself reigned here six years under
  the name SUBHARAJA.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In both the great viharas SUBHARAJA built a
  noble row of cells called SUBHARAJA after him. Near Uruvela (he built) the
  Valli-vihara, to the east the (vihara) Ekadvara and at the mouth of the Ganga
  the (vihara) Nandigamaka.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A40"></a><a name="36"></a> One sprung
  of the Lambakanna (clan), named VASABHA, whose home was in the northern
  province, served under his uncle, a commander of troops. Since it was
  declared: 'One named Vasabha shall be king,' the king at that time commanded
  that all in the island who bore the name of Vasabha should be slain. The
  commander, thinking: 'We must deliver up our Vasabha to the king,' and having
  taken counsel with his wife (upon the matter) set out early in the morning to
  go to the king's residence. And the wife, to guard Vasabha carefully who went
  with him, put betel into his hand but without powdered chalk.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now when the commander, at the gate of the
  palace, saw the betel without chalk, he sent him back for chalk. When Vasabha
  came for the chalk the commander's wife spoke with him secretly, gave him a
  thousand (pieces of money) and aided him to take flight. Vasabha went to the
  Mahavihara and by the theras there was provided with milk, food and clothes,
  and when he had again heard from a leper the certain prophecy that be would be
  king, rejoicing he resolved: 'I will be a rebel' And when he had found men
  suited (to his purpose) he went, seizing in his further course village by
  village, according to the instruction (in the story) of the cake,' to Rohana,
  and gradually winning the kingdom to himself he advanced, after two years,
  with theneedful army and train, towards the capital. When the mighty VASABHA
  had conquered SUBHARAJA in battle he raised the parasol (of sovereignty) in
  the capital. His uncle had fallen in battle. But his uncle's wife, named
  Pottha, who had first helped him, did king VASABHA raise to be queen.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once he questioned a soothsayer concerning the
  length of his life, and he told him secretly (that he should live) just twelve
  years. And when be had given him a thousand (pieces of money) to keep the
  secret the king assembled the brotherhood and greeted them reverently and
  asked them:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Is there perchance, venerable sirs. means to
  lengthen life?' 'There is,' so did the brotherhood teach him, 'a way to do
  away with the hindrances (to long life); gifts of strainers must be given and
  gifts of dwellings and gifts for maintenance of the sick, O ruler of men, and
  in like manner the restoring of ruined buildings must be carried out; one
  should take the five precepts on himself and keep them carefully, and one
  should also keep the solemn fast on the uposathaday.' The king said: 'It is
  well,' and went thence and carried out all these (duties).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Every three years that went by the king
  bestowed the three garments on the whole brotherhood in the island; and to
  those theras that lived far away he sent them. In thirty two places lie
  ordered milk-rice with honey to be distributed, but in sixty-four places a
  lavish gift of mixed alms.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">He had a thousand lamps lighted in four
  places; that is, on the Cetiya-pabbata, about the cetiya in the Thuparama,
  about the Great Thüpa and in the temple of the great Bodhi-tree.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Cittalakuta (vihara) he built ten
  beautiful thnpas and over the whole island he restored ruined buildings. From
  pious trust in a thera in the Valliyera-vihara he built the vihara called
  Mahavalligotta. And (moreover) he built the Anurarama (vihara) near Mahagama
  and bestowed on it a thousand and eight karisa (of land) of (the village)
  Heligama. When he had built the Mucela-vihara in Tissavaddhamanaka he allotted
  to the vihara a share in the water of the (canal) Alisara. To the thüpa in
  Galambatittha he added a mantling of bricks, and he built an uposatha-house
  too, and to provide oil for the lamps. he constructed a pond (yielding water
  to) a thousand karisa (of land)5 and gave it to the (vihara). In the
  Kumbhigallaka-vihara he built an uposatha-house. In like manner the king built
  an uposatha-house in the Issarasamanaka (vihara) here aud in the Thuparama a
  thüpa-temple. In the Mahavihara he built a row of cells facing the west, and
  he restored the ruined Catussala (hail). In like manner the same king made
  four beautiful Buddha-images and a temple for the images in the fair courtyard
  of the great Bodhi-tree.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The king's consort, named Pottha, built in
  that same place a splendid thüpa and a beautiful temple for the thüpa. When
  the king had completed the thiipa-temple in the Thuparama he commanded lavish
  almsgiving for the festival of its completion. Among those bhikkhus who were
  busied with (the learning of) the word of the Buddha he distributed the
  things. needed (by bhikkhus), and among the bhikkhus who explained the
  doctrine butter and sugar-molasses. At the four gates of the city he had food
  given away to the poor and, to such bhikkhus who were sick, food suited to the
  sick. The Cayanti and the Rajappala-tank, the Vaba and the Kolambagamaka, the
  Mahanikkhavatii-tank and the Maharametti, the Kohãla and the Kali-tank, the
  Cambuti, the Citthamangaijia and the Aggivaddhamanaka: these twelve tanks and
  twelve canals he constructed, to make (the land) fruitful. For safety he built
  up the city wall even so high (as it now is) and he built fortress -towers at
  the four gates and a palace besides; in the garden he made a tank and put
  geese therein.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the king had constructed many
  bathing-tanks here and there in the capital he brought water to them by
  subterranean canals. And in this way carrying out various works of merit king
  VASABHA did away with the hindrances (to long life), and delighting
  perpetually in well doing he reigned forty-four years in the capital. He
  appointed also fortyfour Vesakha-festivals.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Subharüja while he yet lived had anxiously,
  for fear of VASABHA, entrusted his daughter to a brick-worker and had at the
  same time given into his care his mantle and the royal insignia. When he was
  killed by VASABHA the brick-worker took her with him, put her in the place of
  a daughter, and brought her up in his own house. When he was at work the girl
  used to bring him his food.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When (one day) in a thicket of flowering
  kadambas, she saw an (ascetic) who was in the seventh day of the state of
  nirodha,' she the wise (maiden) gave him the food. When she had then prepared
  food afresh she carried the food to her father, and when she was asked the
  cause of the delay she told her father this matter. And full of joy he bade
  (her) offer food repeatedly to the thera. When the thera had come out (of his
  trance) he said to the maiden, looking into the future: 'When royal rank has
  fallen to thy lot then bethink thee, O maiden, of this place.' And forthwith
  the thera died.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now did king VASABHA when his son
  Vañkanäsikatissa had come to (full) age seek a fitting wife for him. When
  those people who understood the (auspicious) signs in women saw the maiden in
  the brick-worker's village they told the king; the king thereon was about to
  send for her. And now the brick-worker told him that she was a king's
  daughter, but that she was the daughter of SUBHARAJA he showed by the mantle
  and so forth. Rejoiced the king gave her (in marriage) to his son when all had
  been duly provided.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A41"></a> After VASABHA's death his
  son VANKANASIKA TISSA reigned three years in Anuradhapura. On the bank of the
  Gonariver the king VankanAsikatissaka built the vihära called Mahamangala.
  But his consort Mahamatta collected money to build a vihãra, bethinking her
  of the thera's words.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A42"></a> After VANKANASIKA TISSA 's
  death his son GAJABAHU I reigned twenty-two years. Hearkening to his mother's
  word the king founded the Mätuvihära on the place of the thicket of
  flowering kadambas, in honour of his mother. His wise mother gave to the great
  vihära a hundred thousand (pieces of money) for the plot of land and built
  the vihara;' he himself built a thüpa of stone there and gave (land) for the
  use of the brotherhood, when he had bought it from various owners.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">He erected the great Abhayuttara-thupa, making
  it greater, and to the four gates thereof he made vestibules. When the king
  had made the Gamanitissa-tank he bestowed it on the Abhayagiri-vihara for
  maintenance in food. He made a mantling to the Maricavatti-thupa and gave
  (land) thereto for the use of the brotherhood, having bought it for a hundred
  thousand (pieces of money). In the last year he founded the vihara called
  Ramuka and built in the city the Mahejasanasala (hall).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A43"></a> After Gajabãhu's death the
  king's father-in-law MAHALLAKA NAGA reigned six years. (The viharas) Sejalaka
  in the east, Gotapabbata in the south, Dakapasana in the west, in Nagadipa
  Sälipabbata, in Bijagama Tanaveli, in the country of Rohana
  Tobbalanugapabbata, in the inland country Girihälika: these seven vihäras
  did the king MAHALLAKA NAGA, ruler of the earth, build in the time (of his
  reign), short though it was.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this way do the wise, doing many works of
  merit, gain with worthless riches that which is precious, but fools in their
  blindness, for the sake of pleasures, do much evil.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the thirty-fifth chapter, called
  'The Twelve Kings', in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the serene joy and emotion
  of the pious.</font>
