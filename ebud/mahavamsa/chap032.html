  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">E</font>RE yet the making of
  the chatta and the plaster-work' on the cetiya was finished the king fell sick
  with a sickness that was (fated) to be mortal. He sent for his younger brother
  Tissa from Dighavapi. and said to him: 'Complete thou the work of the thüpa
  that is not yet finished.' Because of his brother's weakness he had a covering
  made of white cloths by seamsters and therewith was the cetiya covered, and
  thereon did he command painters to make on it a vedika duly and rows of filled
  vases likewise and the row with the five-finger ornament. And he had a chatta
  made of bamboo-reeds by plaiters of reeds and on the upper vedika a sun and
  moon of kharapatta. And when he had had this (thüpa) painted cunningly with
  lacquer and kankutthaka he declared to the king: 'That which was yet to do to
  the thüpa is completed.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lying on a palanquin the king went thither,
  and when on his palanquin he had passed round the cetiya, going toward the
  left, he paid homage to it at the south entrance, and as he then, lying on his
  right side on his couch spread upon the ground, beheld the splendid Great
  Thupa, and lying on his left side the splendid Lohapasada, he became glad at
  heart, surrounded by the brotherhood of bhikkhus.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since they had come from here and there to
  have news Of the sick (king), there were (present) in that assembly ninety-six
  kotis of bhikkhus. The bhikkhus, group by group, recited in chorus. When the
  king did not see the thera Theraputtabhaya among them he thought: 'The great
  warrior, who fought victoriously through twenty-eight great battles with me
  nor ever yielded his ground, the thera Therasutabhaya comes not now to help
  me, now that the death-struggle is begun, for methinks he (fore)sees my
  defeat.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the thera, who dwelt by the source of the
  Karindariver' on the Paajali-mountain, knew his thought he came with a company
  of five hundred (bhikkhus) who had overcome the äsavas, passing through the
  air by his miraculous power, and he stood among those who surrounded the king.
  When the king saw him be was glad at heart and he bade him be seated before
  him and said: 'Formerly I fought with you, the ten great warriors, by my side;
  now have I entered alone upon the battle with death, and the foe death I
  cannot conquer.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The thera answered: 'O great king, fear not,
  ruler of men. Without conquering the foe sin the foe death is unconquerable.
  All that has come into (this transitory) existence must necessarily perish
  also, perishable is all that exists; thus did the Master teach. Mortality
  overcomes even the Buddhas, untouched by shame or fear; therefore think thou:
  all that exists is perishable, full of sorrow, and unreal. In thy last mortal
  existence' thy love for the true doctrine was indeed great. Albeit the world
  of gods was within thy sight, yet didst thou, renouncing heavenly bliss,
  return to this world and didst many works of merit in manifold ways. Moreover,
  the setting up of sole sovereignty by thee did serve to bring glory to the
  doctrine. Oh thou who art rich in merit, think on all those works of merit
  accomplished by thee even to this present day, then will all be well with thee
  straightway!'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the king heard the thera's words he was
  glad at heart and said: 'In single combat also thou art my help.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And rejoicing he forthwith commanded that the
  book of meritorious deeds be brought, and he bade the scribe read it aloud,
  and he read the book aloud:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Ninety-nine viharas have been built by the
  great king, and, with (the spending of) nineteen kotis, the Maricavattivihara;
  the splendid Lohapasada was built for thirty kotis. But those precious things
  that have been made for the Great Thupa were worth twenty kotis; the rest
  that, was made for the Great Thüpa by the wise (king was worth) a thousand
  kotis, O great king.' Thus did he read. As he read further: 'In the
  mountain-region called Kotta, at the time of the famine alled the Akkhakhayika
  famine, two precious ear-rings were given (by the king), and thus a goodly
  dish of sour millet- gruel was gotten for five great theras who had overcome
  the asavas, and offered' to them with a believing heart; when, vanquished in
  the battle of Culaganiya, he was fleeing he proclaimed the hour (of the meal)
  and to the ascetic (Tissa), free from the Asavas, who came thither through the
  air he, without thought for himself, gave the food from his bowl' then did the
  king take up the tale:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'In the week of the consecration-festival of
  the (Maricavatti) vihära as at the consecration of the (Loha) pasada, in the
  week when the (Great) Thupa was begun even as when the relics were enshrined,
  a general, great and costly giving of alms was arranged by me to the great
  community of both (sexes) from the four quarters. I held twenty-four great
  Vesakha-festivals; three times did I bestow the three garments on the
  brotherhood of the island.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Five times, each time for seven days, have I
  bestowed (glad at heart) the rank of ruler of this island upon the doctrine. I
  have had a thousand lamps with oil and white wicks burning perpetually in
  twelve places, adoring the Blessed (Buddha) with this offering. Constantly in
  eighteen places have I bestowed on the sick the foods for the sick and
  remedies, as ordered by the physicians.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In forty-four places have I commanded the
  perpetual giving of rice-foods prepared with honey ; and in as many places
  lumps of rice with oil, and in even as many places great jala-cakes, baked in
  butter and also therewith the ordinary rice. For the uposatha-festivals I have
  had oil for the lamps distributed one day in every month in eight vihãras on
  the island of Lanka. And since I heard that a gift (by preaching) of the
  doctrine is more than a gift of worldly wealth I said: At the foot of the
  Lohapasada, in the (preacher's) chair in the midst of the brotherhood, I will
  preach the Mangalasutta to the brotherhood but when I was seated there I could
  not preach it, from reverence for the brotherhood. Since then I have commanded
  the preaching of the doctrine everywhere, in the viharas of Lanka, giving
  rewards to the preachers. To each preacher of the doctrine did I order to give
  a nali of butter, molasses and sugar; moreover, I bestowed on them a handful
  of liquorice, four inches long, and I gave them, moreover, a pair of garments.
  But all this giving while that I reigned, rejoices not my heart; only the two
  gifts that I gave, without care for my life, the while I was in adversity,
  those gladden my heart.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the thera Abhaya heard this he described
  those two gifts, to rejoice the king's heart withal, in manifold ways:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'When (the one) of those five theras the thera
  Malayamahadeva, who received the sour millet-gruel, had given thereof to nine
  hundred bhikkhus on the Sumanakuta-mountain he ate of it himself. But the
  thera Dhammagutta who could cause the earth to quake shared it with the
  bhikkhus in the Kalyanika-vihara, (who were) five hundred in number, and then
  ate of it himself. The thera Dhammadinna, dwelling in Talanga, gave to twelve
  thousand (bhikkhus) in Piyangudipa and then ate of it. The thera Khuddatissa
  of wondrous power, who dwelt in Mangana, divided it among sixty thousand
  (bhikkbus) in the Kelasa (vihara) and then ate of it himself. The thera
  Mahavyaggha gave thereof to seven hundred (bhikkhus) in the Ukkanagara-vihara
  and then ate of it himself.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The thera who received the food in his dish
  divided it among twelve thousand bhikkhus in Piyangudipa and then ate of it
  himself.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">With such words as these the thera Abhaya
  gladdened the king's mood, and the king, rejoicing in his heart, spoke thus to
  the thera:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Twenty-four years have I been a patron of the
  brotherhood, and my body shall also be a patron of the brotherhood. In a place
  whence the Great Thupa may be seen, in the malaka (bounded about) for the
  ceremonial acts of the brotherhood, do ye burn the body of me the servant of
  the brotherhood.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To his younger brother he said: 'All the work
  of the Great Thüpa which is still unfinished, do thou complete, my dear
  Tissa, caring duly for it. Evening and morning offer thou flowers at the Great
  Thupa and three times (in the day) command a solemn oblation at the Great
  Thupa. All the ceremonies introduced by me in honour of the doctrine of the
  Blessed (Buddha) do thou carry on, my dear, stinting nothing. Never grow
  weary, my dear, in duty toward the brotherhood.' When he had thus exhorted
  him, the king fell into silence.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At this moment the brotherhood of bhikkhus
  began the chanting in chorus, and the devatas led thither six cars with six
  gods, and severally the gods implored the king as they stood in their cars:
  'Enter into our delightful celestial world, O king.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the king heard their words he stayed them
  with a gesture of his hand: 'Wait ye as long as I listen to the dhamma.' Then
  the bhikkhus thinking: 'He would fain stop the chanting in chorus,' ceased
  from their recitations; the king asked the reason of the interruption.
  'Because the sign (to bid us) sbe still&quot; was given,' they answered. But
  the king said: 'It is not so, venerable sirs,' and he told them what had
  passed.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When they heard this, certain of the people
  thought:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Seized by the fear of death, he wanders in
  his speech.' And to banish their doubts the thera Abhaya spoke thus to the
  king: 'How would it be possible to make known (the presence of) the cars that
  have been brought hither?' The wise king commanded that garlands of flowers be
  flung into the air, these severally wound themselves around the poles of the
  cars and hung loose from them.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the people saw them floating free in the
  air, they conquered their doubts; but the king said to the thera:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Which of the celestial worlds is the most
  beautiful, venerable sir?' And the other answered: 'The city of the Tusitas, O
  king, is the fairest; so think the pious. Awaiting the time when he shall
  become a Buddha, the compassionate Bodhisatta Metteyya dwells in the
  Tusita-city.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the most wise king heard these words of
  the thera, he, casting a glance at the Great Thupa, closed his eyes as he lay.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And when he, even at that moment, had passed
  away, he was seen, reborn and standing in celestial form in the ear that bad
  come from Tusita-heaven. And to make manifest the reward of the works of merit
  performed by him he drove, showing himself in all his glory to the people,
  standing on the same car, three times around the Great Thupa, going to the
  left, and then, when he had done homage to the thüpa and the brotherhood he
  passed into the Tusita-heaven.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even where the dancing-women who had come
  thither laid off their head-ornaments there was a hail built called
  Makutamuttasala. Even where the people, when the body of the king was laid on
  the funeral pyre, broke into wailing there was the so-called Ravivattisala
  built.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The mälaka outside the precincts (of the
  monastery), in which they burned the body of the king here bears the name
  Rajamalaka.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The great king Dutthagamani, he who is worthy
  of the name of king, will be the first disciple of the sublime Metteyya, the
  king's father (will be) his father' and the mother his mother.' The younger
  brother Saddhatissa will be his second disciple, but Salirajakumara, the
  king's son, will be the son of the sublime Metteyya.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">He who, holding the good life to be the
  greatest (good), does works of merit, passes, covering over much that
  perchance is evil-doing, into heaven as into his own house; therefore will the
  wise man continually take delight in works of merit.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the thirty-second chapter, called
  'The Entrance into the Tusita-heaven', in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the
  serene joy and emotion of the pious.</font>
