  DUTTHAGAMANI</font></b></center>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">W</font>HEN the king
  Dutthagamani had provided for his people and had had a relic put into his
  spear' he marched, with chariots, troops and beasts for riders, to
  Tissamaharama, and when he had shown favour to the brotherhood he said: 'I
  will go on to the land on the further side of the river to bring glory to the
  doctrine. Give us, that we may treat them with honour, bhikkhus who shall go
  on with us, since the sight of bhikkhus is blessing and protection for us.' As
  a penance the brotherhood allowed him five hundred ascetics; taking this
  company of bhikkhus with him the king marched forth, and when he had caused
  the read in Malaya leading hither to be made ready he mounted the elephant
  Kandula and, surrounded by his warriors, he took the field with a mighty host.
  With the one end yet in Mahagama the train of the army reached to Guttahalaka.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="11"></a>Arrived at Mahiyangana he
  overpowered the Damila Chatta. When he had slain the Damilas in that very
  place he came then to Ambatitthaka, which had a trench leading from the river,
  and (conquered) the Damila Titthamba; fighting the crafty and powerful foe for
  four months he (finally) overcame him by cunning,' since he placed his mother
  in his view.<a name="12"></a> When the mighty man marching thence down (the
  river) had conquered seven mighty Damila princes in one day and had
  established peace, he gave over the booty to his troops. Therefore is (the
  place)called Khemäräma.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="13"></a> In Antarasobbha he subdued
  Mahakotta, in<a name="14"></a> Dona Gavara, in<a name="15"></a> Halakola
  Issariya, in<a name="16"></a> Nalisobbha Nalika. In<a name="17"></a>
  Dighabhayagallaka he subdued, in like manner, Dighabhaya; in<a name="18"></a>
  Kacchatittha, within four months, he subdued Kapisisa. In<a name="19"></a>
  Kotanagara he subdued Kota, then Halavahanaka, in<a name="20"></a> Vahitta the
  Damila Vahittha and in<a name="56"></a> Gamani (he subdued) Gamani, in<a name="21"></a>
  Kumbagama Kumba, in <a name="55"></a>Nandigama Nandika,<a name="22"></a> Khanu
  in Khanugama but in<a name="23"></a> Tamba and <a name="24"></a>Unnama the
  two, uncle and nephew, named Tamba and Unnama. Jambu also did he subdue, and
  each village was named after (its commander.)</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the monarch heard (that it was said: )
  'Not knowing their own army they slay their own people', he made this solemn
  declaration: 'Not for the joy of sovereignty is this toil of mine, my striving
  (has been) ever to establish the doctrine of the Sambuddha. And even as this
  is truth may the armour on the body of my soldiers take the colour of fire.'
  And now it came to pass even thus.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="25"></a> All the Damilas on the bank
  of the river who had escaped death threw themselves for protection into the
  city named Vijitanagara. In a favourable open country he pitched a camp, and
  this became known by the name Khandhavarapitthi.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since the king, in order to take Vijitanagara,
  would fain put Nandhimitta to the test, he let loose Kandula upon him (once)
  when he saw him coming towards him. When the elephant came to overpower him,
  Nandhimitta seized with his hands his two tusks and forced him on his
  haunches.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since Nandhimitta fought with the elephant the
  village built on the spot where (it came to pass) is therefore named
  Hatthipora.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the king had (thus) put them both to the
  test he marched to Vijitanagara. Near the south gate befell a fearful battle
  between the warriors. But near the east gate did Velusumana, sitting on his
  horse, slay Damilas in great numbers.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Damilas shut the gate and the king sent
  thither his men. Kandula and Nandhimitta and Suranimila, at the south gate,
  and the three, Mahasona, Gotha and Theraputta, at the three other gates did
  their (great) deeds. The city had three trenches, was guarded by a high wall,
  furnished with gates of wrought iron, difficult for enemies to destroy.
  Placing himself upon his knees and battering stones, mortar and bricks with
  his tusks did the elephant attack the gate of iron. But the Damilas who stood
  upon the gate-tower hurled down weapons of every kind, balls of red-hot iron
  and molten pitch. When the smoking pitch poured on his back Kandula, tormented
  with pains, betook him to a pool of water and dived there.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Here is no sura-draught for thee, go forth to
  the destroying of the iron gate, destroy the gate !' thus said Gothambara to
  him. Then did the best of elephants again proudly take heart, and trumpeting
  he reared himself out of the water and stood defiantly on firm land.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The elephants' physician washed the pitch away
  and put on balm; the king mounted the elephant and, stroking his temples with
  his hand, he cheered him on with the words: 'To thee I give, dear Kandula, the
  lordship over the whole island of Lanka.' And when he had had choice fodder
  given to him, had covered him with a cloth and had put his armour on him and
  had bound upon his skin a seven times folded buffalo-hide and above it had
  laid a hide steeped in oil he set him free. Roaring like thunder he came,
  daring danger, and with his tusks pierced the panels of the gate and: trampled
  the threshold with his feet; and with uproar the gate crashed to the ground
  together with the arches of the gate. The crumbling mass from the gate-tower
  that fell upon the elephant's back did Nandhimitta dash aside, striking it
  with his arms. When Kandula saw his deed, in contentment of heart he ceased
  from the former wrath he had nursed since he (Nandhimitta) had seized him by
  the tusks.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That he might enter the town close behind him
  Kandula the best of elephants turned (to Nandhimitta) and looked at that
  warrior. But Nandhimitta. thought: 'I will not enter (the town) by the way
  opened by the elephant' and with his arm did he break down the wall. Eighteen
  cubits high and eight usabhas long it crashed together. The (elephant) looked
  on Süranimila, but he too would not (follow in) the track but dashed forward,
  leaping the wall into the town. Gona also and Sona pressed forward, each one
  breaking down a gate. The elephant seized a cart-wheel, Mitta a waggon frame,
  Gotha a cocos-palm, Nimila his good sword, Mahasona a palmyra-palm, Theraputta
  his great club,' and thus, rushing each by himself into the streets, they
  shattered the Damilas there.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="27"></a> When the king in four months
  had destroyed Vijitanagara he went thence to Girilaka and slew the Damila
  Giriya.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="28"></a>Thence he marched to
  Mahelanagara that had a triple trench and was surrounded by an undergrowth of
  kadamba flowers, possessed but one gate and was hard to come at; and staying
  there four months the king subdued the commander of Mahela by a cunningly
  planned battle. Then nearing Anuradhapura the king pitched his camp south of
  the Kasa-mountain. When he had made a tank there in the month Jetthamüla he
  held a water-festival. There is to be found the village named Pajjotanagara.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="29"></a> When the king Elara heard
  that king Dutthagamani was come to do battle he called together his ministers
  and said: 'This king is himself a warrior and in truth many warriors (follow
  him). What think the ministers, what should we do?' King Elara's warriors, led
  by Dighajantu, resolved: 'Tomorrow will we give battle.' The king Dutthagamani
  also took counsel with his mother and by her counsel formed thirty-two bodies
  of troops. In these the king placed parasol-bearers and figures of a king;'
  the monarch himself took his place in the innermost body of troops.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Elara in full armour had mounted his
  elephant Mahäpabbata he came thither with chariots, soldiers and beasts for
  riders. When the battle began the mighty and terrible Dighajantu seized his
  sword and shield for battle, and leaping eighteen cubits up into the air and
  cleaving the effigy of the king with his sword, he scattered the first body of
  troops. When the mighty (warrior) had in this manner scattered also the other
  bodies of troops, he charged at the body of troops with which king Gamani
  stood. But when he began to attack the king, the mighty warrior Süranimila
  insulted him, proclaiming his own name. Dighajantu thought: 'I will slay him,'
  and leaped into the air full of rage. But Süranimila held the shield toward
  him as he alighted (in leaping). But Dighajantu thought: 'I will cleave him in
  twain, together with the shield,' and struck the shield with the sword. Then
  Süranimila let go the shield. And as he clove (only) the shield thus released
  Dighajantu fell there, and Suranimila, springing up, slew the fallen (man)
  with his spear. Phussadeva blew his conch shell, the army of the Damilas was
  scattered; nay, Elara turned to flee and they slew many Damilas. The water in
  the tank there was dyed red with the blood of the slain, therefore it was
  known by the name Kulantavapi.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">King Dutthagamini proclaimed with beat of
  drum: 'None but myself shall slay Elara.' When he himself, armed, had mounted
  the armed elephant Kandula he pursued Elara and came to the south gate (of
  Anuradhapura).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Near the south gate of the city the two kings
  fought; Elara hurled his dart, Gamani evaded it; he made his own elephant
  pierce (Elara's) elephant with his tusks and he hurled his dart at Elara; and
  this (latter) fell there, with his elephant.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he had thus been victorious in battle and
  bad united Lankã under one rule he marched, with chariots, troops and beasts
  for riders, into the capital. In the city he caused the drum to be beaten, and
  when he had summoned the people from a yojana around he celebrated the funeral
  rites for king Elara. On the spot where his body had fallen he burned it with
  the catafalque, and there did he build a monument and ordain worship. And even
  to this day the princes of Lanka, when they draw near to this place, are wont
  to silence their music because of this worship.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he had thus overpowered thirty-two Damila
  kings Dutthagamani ruled over Lanka in single sovereignty.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Vijitanagara was destroyed the hero
  Dighajantuka had told Elara of the valour of his nephew, and to this nephew
  named Bhalluka he had sent a message to come hither. When Bhalluka had
  received (the message) from him he landed here, on the seventh day after the
  day of the burning of Elara, with sixty thousand men.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although he heard of the king's death after he
  had landed yet, from shame, with the purpose: 'I will do battle,' he pressed
  on from Mahatittha hither.'<a name="30"></a> He pitched his camp near the
  village Kolambahalaka.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the king heard of his coming he marched
  forth to battle in full panoply of war, mounted on the elephant Kandula, with
  warriors mounted on elephants, horses and chariots, and with foot-soldiers in
  great numbers.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ummadaphussadeva, who was the best archer in
  all the island (followed) armed with the five weapons, and the rest of the
  heroes followed him (also). While the raging battle went forward Bhalluka in
  his armour came at the king there; but Kandula, the king of elephants, to
  weaken his onslaught, yielded his ground quite slowly and the army with him
  drew also back quite slowly. The king said: 'Aforetime in twenty-eight battles
  he has never retreated, what may this be, Phussadeva?' And he answered:
  'Victory lies behind us, O king; looking to the field of victory the elephant
  draws back, and at the place of victory he will halt.' And when the elephant
  had retreated he stood firm beside (the shrine of) the guardian god of the
  city within the precincts of the Mahavihara.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the king of elephants had halted here the
  Damila Bhalluka came toward the king in that place and mocked at the ruler of
  the land. Covering his mouth with his sword the king returned insult for
  insult. 'I will send (an arrow) into the king's mouth,' thought the other, and
  he let fly an arrow. The arrow struck on the sword-blade and fell to the
  ground. And Bhalluka, who thought 'He is struck in the mouth,' uttered a shout
  for joy. But the mighty Phussadeva sitting behind the king, let fly an arrow
  into his mouth wherewith (as the arrow passed) he lightly touched the king's
  ear-ring. And since he made him thus to fall with his feet toward the king, he
  let fly yet another arrow at the falling man and struck him in the knee; and
  making him (now) to turn with his head toward the king, thus with swift hand
  he brought him down.' When Bhalluka had fallen a shout of victory went up.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To make known his fault Phussadeva himself
  forthwith cut off the lobe of his own ear and showed the king the blood
  streaming down. When the king saw this he asked: 'What does this mean?' 'I
  have carried out the royal justice upon myself,' he said (in answer) to the
  ruler of the land. And to the question: 'What is thy guilt?' he answered:
  'Striking thy ear-ring.' 'Why hast thou done this, my brother, taking as guilt
  that which was no guilt?' replied the great king, and in gratitude he said
  moreover: 'Great shall be thy honourable guerdon, even as thy arrow.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the king, after winning the victory, had
  slain all the Damilas he went up on the terrace of the palace, and when, in
  the royal chamber there in the midst of the dancers and ministers, he had sent
  for Phussadeva's arrow and had set it in the ground with the feathered end
  uppermost, he covered the dart over and over with kahapanas poured forth upon
  it, and these he forthwith caused to be given to Phussadeva.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sitting then on the terrace of the royal
  palace, adorned, lighted with fragrant lamps and filled with many a perfume,
  magnificent with nymphs in the guise of dancing-girls, while he rested on his
  soft and fair couch, covered with costly draperies, he, looking back upon his
  glorious victory, great though it was, knew no joy, remembering that thereby
  was wrought the destruction of millions (of beings).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the arahants in Piyangudipa knew his
  thought they sent eight arahants to comfort the king. And they, coming in the
  middle watch of the night, alighted at the palace-gate. Making known that they
  were come thither through the air they mounted to the terrace of the palace.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The great king greeted them, and when he had
  invited them to be seated and had done them reverence in many ways he asked
  the reason of their coming. 'We are sent by the brotherhood at Piyangudipa to
  comfort thee, O lord of men.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And thereon the king said again to them: 'How
  shall there be any comfort for me, O venerable sirs, since by me was caused
  the slaughter of a great host numbering millions?'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'From this deed arises no hindrance in thy way
  to heaven. Only one and a half human beings have been slain here by thee, O
  lord of men. The one had come unto the (three) refuges, the other had taken on
  himself the five precepts Unbelievers and men of evil life were the rest, not
  more to be esteemed than beasts. But as for thee, thou wilt bring glory to the
  doctrine of the Buddha in manifold ways; therefore cast away care from thy
  heart, O ruler of men!'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus exhorted by them the great king took
  comfort. When he had bidden them farewell and had given them leave to depart
  belay down again and thought: 'Without the brotherhood you shall never take a
  meal,' thus our mother and father have caused to swear us in our boyhood at
  the meal. Have I ever eaten anything whatsoever without giving to the
  brotherhood of bhikkhus?' Then he saw that he had, all unthinkingly, eaten
  pepper in the pod, at the morning meal, leaving none for the brotherhood; and
  he thought: 'For this I must do penance.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Should a man think on the hosts of human
  beings murdered for greed in countless myriads, and should he carefully keep
  in mind the evil (arising from that), and should he also very carefully keep
  in mind the mortality as being the murderer of all, then will he, in this way,
  shortly win freedom from suffering and a happy condition.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the twenty-fifth chapter, called
  'The Victory of Dutthagamani', in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the serene joy
  and emotion of the pious.</font>
