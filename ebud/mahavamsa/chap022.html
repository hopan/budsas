  he had slain Elara, DUTTAGAMANI became king. To show clearly how this came to
  pass the story in due order (of events) is this: King Devanampiyatissa's
  second brother, the vice-regent named Mahanaga, was dear to his brother. The
  king's consort, that foolish woman, coveted the kingship for her own son and
  ever nursed the wish to slay the vice-regent, and while he was making the tank
  called Taraccha she sent him a mangofruit which she had poisoned and laid
  uppermost among (other) mango-fruits. Her little son who had gone with the
  vice-regent, ate the mango-fruit, when the dish was uncovered, and died
  therefrom. Upon this the vice-regent, with his wives, men and horses, went, to
  save his life, to Rohana.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Yatthalata-vihara his wife, who was
  with child, bore a son. He gave him his brother's name. Afterwards he came to
  Rohana and as ruler over the whole of Rohana the wealthy prince reigned in
  Mahagame. He founded the Nagamahavihara that bore his name; he founded also
  many (other) viharas, as the Uddhakandaraka (vihära) and so forth.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">His son Yatthalayakatissa reigned after his
  death in that same place, and in like manner also Abhaya, son of this (last).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Gothabhaya's son, known by the name
  Kakavannatissa, the prince, reigned there after his death. Viharadevi was the
  consort of this believing king, firm in the faith (was she), the daughter of
  the king of Kalyani.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now in Kalyani the ruler was the king named
  Tissa. His younger brother named Ayya-Uttika, who had roused the wrath (of
  Tissa) in that he was the guilty lover of the queen, fled thence from fear and
  took up his abode elsewhere. The district was named after him. He sent a man
  wearing the disguise of a bhikkhu, with a secret letter to the queen. This man
  went thither, took his stand at the king's door and entered the king's house
  with an arahant who always used to take his meal at the palace, unnoticed by
  that thera. When he had eaten in company with the thera, as the king was going
  forth, he let the letter fall to the ground when the queen was looking.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The king turned at the (rustling) sound, and
  when he looked down and discovered the written message he raged, unthinking,
  against the thera, and in his fury he caused the thera and the man to be slain
  and thrown into the sea Wroth at this the sea-gods made the sea overflow the
  land; but the king with all speed caused his pious and beautiful daughter
  named Devi to be placed in a golden vessel, whereon was written 'a king's
  daughter', and to be launched upon that same sea. When she had landed near to
  (the) Lanka (vihara) the king Kakavanna consecrated her as queen. Therefore
  she received the epithet Vihära.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he had founded the Tissamahavihara and
  the Cittalapabbata (vihara) and also the Gamitthavali and Kütali (vihära)
  and so forth, devoutly believing in the three gems, he provided the
  brotherhood continually with the four needful things.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the monastery named Kotapabbata there lived
  at that time a sämanera, pious in his way of life, who was ever busied with
  various works of merit.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To mount the more easily to the courtyard of
  the Akasacetiya he fixed three slabs of stone as steps. He gave (the bhikkhus)
  to drink and did services to the brotherhood. Since his body was continually
  wearied a grievous sickness came upon him. The grateful bhikkhus, who brought
  him in a litter, tended him at the Tissarama, in the Silapassayaparivena.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Always when the self-controlled Vihäradevi
  had given lavish gifts to the brotherhood in the beautifully prepared royal
  palace, before the mid-day meal, she was used to take, after the meal, sweet
  perfumes, flowers, medicines and clothing and go to the arama and offer these
  (to the bhikkhus) according to their digrity.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now doing thus, at that time, she took her
  seat near the chief thera of the community (in the vihara) and when expounding
  the true doctrine the thera spoke thus to her: 'Thy great happiness thou hast
  attained by works of merit; even now must thou not grow weary of performing
  works of merit.' But she, being thus exhorted, replied: 'What is our happiness
  here, since we have no children? Lo, our happiness is therefore barren!'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The thera, who, being gifted with the six
  (supernormal) powers, foresaw that she would have children, said: 'Seek out
  the sick samanera, O queen.' She went thence and said to the samanera, who was
  near unto death: 'Utter the wish to become my son; for that would be great
  happiness for us.' And when she perceived that he would not the keen-witted
  woman commanded, to this end, great and beautiful offerings of flowers, and
  renewed her pleading.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he was yet unwilling, she, knowing the
  right means, gave to the brotherhood for his sake all manner of medicines and
  garments and again pleaded with. him. Then did he desire (rebirth for himself
  in) the king's family, and she caused the place to be richly adorned and
  taking her leave she mounted the car and went her way. Hereupon the samanera
  passed away, and he returned to a new life in the womb of the queen while she
  was yet upon her journey; when she perceived this she halted. She sent that
  message to the king and returned with the king. When they two had both
  fulfilled the funeral rites for the samanera they, dwelling with collected
  minds in that very parivena, appointed continually lavish gifts for the
  brotherhood of bhikkhus.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And there came on the virtuous queen these
  longings of a woman with child. (This) did she crave: that while making a
  pillow for her head of a honeycomb one usabha long and resting on her left
  side in her beautiful bed, she should eat the honey that remained when she had
  given twelve thousand bhikkhus to eat of it; and then she longed to drink (the
  water) that had served to cleanse the sword with which the head of the first
  warrior among king Elära's warriors had been struck off, (and she longed to
  drink it) standing on this very head, and moreover (she longed) to adorn
  herself with garlands of unfaded lotus-blossoms brought from the lotusmarshes
  of Anuradhapura.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The queen told this to the king, and the king
  asked the soothsayers. When the soothsayers heard it they said: 'The queen's
  son, when he has vanquished the Damilas and built up a united kingdom, will
  make the doctrine to shine forth brightly.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Whosoever shall point out such a honeycomb,
  on him the king will bestow a grace in accordance (with this service),' thus
  did the king proclaim. A countryman who found, on the shore of the Gotha-sea a
  boat, which was turned upside down, filled with honey, showed this to the
  king. The king brought the queen thither and, in a beautifully prepared
  pavilion, caused her to eat the honey as she had wished.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And that her other longings might also be
  satisfied the king entrusted his warrior named Velusumana with the matter. He
  went to Anuradhapura and became the friend of the keeper of the king's
  state-horse and continually did him services. When he saw that this man
  trusted hin he, the fearless one, laid lotus-flowers and his sword down on the
  shore of the Kandamba-river early in the morning; and when he had led the
  horse out and had mounted it and had grasped the lotus-blossoms and the sword,
  he made himself known and rode thence as swiftly as the horse could (go).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the king heard that he sent forth his
  first warrior to catch him. This man mounted the horse that came second (to
  the state-horse) and pursued the other. He (Velusumana), sitting on the
  horse's back, hid himself in the jungle, drew the sword and stretched it
  toward his pursuer. Thereby was his head, as he came on, so swiftly as the
  horse could, severed (from the trunk). The other took both beasts and the head
  (of Elara's warrior) and reached Mahagama in the evening. And the queen
  satisfied her longings even as she would. But the king conferred on his
  warrior such honours as were in accordance (with this service).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In time the queen bore a noble son, endowed
  with all auspicious signs, and great was the rejoicing in the house of the
  great monarch. By the effect of his merit there arrived that very day, from
  this place and that, seven ships laden with manifold gems. And in like manner,
  by the power of his merit, an elephant of the six-tusked race brought his
  young one thither and left him here and went his way. When a fisherman named
  Kandula saw it standing in the jungle on the shore opposite the
  watering-place, he straightway told the king. The king sent his
  (elephant)-trainers to bring the young elephant and he reared him. He was
  named Kandula as he had been found by Kandula</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'A ship filled with vessels of gold and so
  forth has arrived.' This they announced to the king. And he bade them bring
  (the precious things) to him.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As the king had invited the brotherhood of the
  bhikkhus, numbering twelve thousand, for the name-giving festival of his son,
  he thought thus: 'If my son, when he has won the kingship over the whole realm
  of Lanka, shall make the doctrine of the Sambuddha to shine forth (in clear
  brightness) then shall just one thousand and eight bhikkhus come hither and
  they shall wear the robe in such wise that the alms-bowl shall be uppermost.
  fhey shall put the right foot first inside the threshold and they shall lay
  aside the prescribed waterpot together with the umbrella (made of) one
  (piece). A thera named Gotama shall receive my son and impart to him the
  confession of faith and the precepts of morality.' All fell out in this
  manner.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he saw all these omens the king, glad at
  heart, bestowed rice-milk on the brotherhood; and to his son, bringing
  together in one both the lordship over Mahagama and the name of his father, he
  gave the name Gamani Abhaya.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When, on the ninth day after this, he had
  entered Mahägama, he had intercourse with the queen. She became thereby with
  child. The son born in due time did the king name Tissa. And both boys grew up
  in the midst of a great body of retainers.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When, at the festival time of the presenting
  of the (first) rice-foods to both (children), the king, full of pious zeal,
  set rice-milk before five hundred bhikkhus, he, when the half had been eaten
  by them, did, together with the queen, take a little in a golden spoon and
  give it to them with the words: 'If you, my sons, abandon the doctrine of the
  Sambuddha then shall this not be digested in your belly.' Both princes, who
  understood the meaning of these words, ate the rice-milk rejoicing as if it
  were ambrosia.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When they were ten and twelve years old the
  king, who would fain put them to the test, offered hospitality in the same way
  to the bhikkhus, and when he had the rice that was left by them taken and
  placed in a dish and set before the boys he divided it into three portions and
  spoke thus: 'Never, dear ones, will we turn away from the bhikkhus, the
  guardianspirits of our house: with such thoughts as these eat ye this portion
  here.' And furthermore: 'We two brothers will for ever be without enmity one
  toward the other; with such thoughts as these eat ye this portion here.' And
  as if it were ambrosia they both ate the two portions. But when it was said to
  them: 'Never will we fight with the Damilas; with such thoughts eat ye this
  portion here,' Tissa dashed the food away with his hand, but Gämani who had
  (in like manner) flung away the morsel of rice, went to his bed, and drawing
  in his hands and feet he lay upon his bed. The queen came, and caressing
  Gamani spoke thus: 'Why dost thou not lie easily upon thy bed with limbs
  stretched out, my son?' 'Over there beyond the Ganga are the Damilas, here on
  this side is the Gotha-ocean, how can I lie with outstretched limbs?' he
  answered. When the king heard his thoughts he remained silent.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Growing duly Gamani came to sixteen years,
  vigorous, renowned, intelligent and a hero in majesty and might.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this changing existence do beings indeed
  (only) by works of merit come to such rebirth as they desire; pondering thus
  the wise man will be ever filled with zeal in the heaping up of meritorious
  works.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the twenty-second chapter, called
  'The Birth of Prince Gamani', in the Mahavamsa compiled for the serene joy and
  emotion of the pious.</font>
