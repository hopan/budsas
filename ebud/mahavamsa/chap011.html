  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A5"></a><font size="6">A</font>FTER
  his death his son, known by the name of MUTASIVA, the son of Suvannapali,
  succeeded him in the government, which was (then) in a peaceful state. The
  king laid out the beautiful Mahameghavana-garden, rich in all the good
  qualities that its name promises and provided with fruittrees and
  flowering-trees. At the time that the place was chosen for the garden, a great
  cloud, gathering at an unwonted season, poured forth rain; therefore they
  called the garden Mahameghavana.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A6"></a> Sixty years king MUTASIVA
  reigned in splendid Anuradhapura the fair face of the land of Lanka. He had
  ten sons, each thoughtful of the other's welfare, and two daughters equal (in
  beauty), worthy of their family. The second son, known by the name
  DEVANAMPIYATISSA, was foremost among all his brothers in virtue and
  intelligence.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This DEVANAMPIYATISSA became king after his
  father's death. Even at the time of his consecration many wonders came to
  pass. In the whole isle of Lanka treasures and</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">jewels that had been buried deep rose up to
  the surface of the earth. Jewels which had been in ships wrecked near Lanka
  and those which were naturally formed there (in the ocean) issued forth upon
  the land. At the foot of the Chata-mountain there grew up three bamboo-stems,
  in girth even as a waggonpole. One of them, 'the creeper-stem,' shone like
  silver; on this might be seen delightful creepers gleaming with a golden
  colour. But one was the 'flower-stem', on this again might be seen flowers of
  many kinds, of manifold colours, in full bloom. And last, one was the
  'bird-stem' whereon might be seen numbers of birds and beasts of many (kinds)
  and of many colours, as if living. Pearls of the eight kinds, namely
  horse-pearl, elephant-pearl, waggon-pearl, myrobalan-pearl, bracelet-pearl,
  ring-pearl, kakudha fruit-pearl, and common (pearls) came forth out of the
  ocean and lay upon the shore in heaps.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">All this was the effect of DEVANAMPIYATISSA's
  merit. Sapphire, beryl, ruby, these gems and many jewels and those pearls and
  those bamboo-stems they brought, all in the same week, to the king.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the king saw them he was glad at heart
  and thought:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">My friend Dhammasoka and nobody else is worthy
  to have these priceless treasures; I will send them to him as a gift.' For the
  two monarchs, DEVANAMPIYATISSA and Dhammasoka already had been friends a long
  time, though they bad never seen each other.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The king sent four persons appointed as his
  envoys: his nephew Maharittha, who was the chief of his ministers, then his
  chaplain, a minister and his treasurer, attended by a body of retainers, and
  he bade them take with them those priceless jewels, the three kinds of
  precious stones, and the three stems (like) waggon-poles, and a spiral shell
  winding to the right, and the eight kinds of pearls. When they had embarked at
  Jambukola' and in seven days had reached the haven in safety, and from thence
  in seven days more had come to Pataliputta, they gave those gifts into the
  hands of king Dhammasoka. When he saw them he rejoiced greatly. Thinking:
  'Here I have no such precious things,' the monarch, in his joy, bestowed on
  Arittha the rank of a commander in his army, on the brahman the dignity of
  chaplain, to the minister he gave the rank of staff-bearer, and to the
  treasurer that of a guild-lord.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he had allotted to the (envoys) abundance
  of (all) things for their entertainment and dwelling-houses, he took counsel
  with his ministers considering (what should be sent as) a return-gift; and he
  took a fan, a diadem, a sword, a parasol, shoes, a turban, ear-ornaments,
  chains, a pitcher, yellow sandalwood, a set of garments that had no need of
  cleansing, a costly napkin, unguent brought by the nagas, red-coloured earth,
  water from the lake Anotatta and also water from the Ganges, a (spiral) shell
  winding in auspicious wise,' a maiden in the flower of her youth, utensils as
  golden platters, a costly litter, yellow and emblic myrobalans and precious
  ambrosial healing herbs, sixty times one hundred waggon loads of mountain-rice
  brought thither by parrots, nay, all that was needful for consecrating a king,
  marvellous in splendour; and sending these (things) in due time as a gift to
  his friend the lord of men sent envoys also with the gift of the true
  doctrine, saying: 'I have taken refuge in the Buddha, his Doctrine and his
  Order, I have declared myself a lay-disciple in the religion of the Sakya son;
  seek then even thou, O best of men converting thy mind with believing heart
  refuge in these best of gems!' and saying moreover: 'Consecrate my friend yet
  again as king,' he dismissed his friend's ministers, with many marks of
  honour.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the ministers had stayed five months,
  highly honoured they set forth with the envoys, on the first day of the bright
  half of the month Vesakha. Having embarked at Tamalitti. and landed at
  Jambukola they sought out the king, when they arrived here on the twelfth day.
  The envoys handed the gifts to the ruler of Lanka; the ruler of Lanka made
  them welcome with great hospitality.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But the envoys most faithful to their king
  consecrated the ruler of Lanka, whose (first) consecration had been held in
  the month Maggasira on the day when the moon first shows itself, fulfilling
  the charge of Dhammasoka, yet again as king, they rejoicing in the salvation
  of their king (consecrated) him who rejoiced in the good fortune of Lanka.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus on the full-moon day of the month
  Vesäkha the ruler of men, in whose name was contained the words 'friend of
  the gods',' bestowing good upon his people, held his consecration (as king) in
  Lanka, where in every place they held high festival.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the eleventh chapter, called 'The
  Consecrating of DEVANAMPIYATISSA, in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the serene
  joy and emotion of the pious.</font>
