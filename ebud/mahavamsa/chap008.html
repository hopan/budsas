  PANDUVASUDEVA</font></b></center>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>HE great king Vijaya,
  being in the last year (of his life), bethought him: 'I am old and there lives
  no son of mine. The kingdom peopled with (such great) difficulty may come to
  naught after my death; therefore would I fain have my brother Sumitta brought
  here (that I may give) the govern ment (into his hands).' When he had taken
  counsel with his ministers he sent a letter to him, and within a short time
  after Vijaya had sent the letter he passed away to the celestial world.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he was dead the ministers ruled, dwelling
  in Upatissagama while they awaited the coming of the prince. After the death
  of king Vijaya and before the coming of the prince was our island of Lanka
  kingless for a year.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Sihapura, after the death of king Sihabahu,
  his son Sumitta was king; he had three Sons by the daughter of the Madda'
  king. The messengers coming to Sihapura handed the letter to the king. When he
  had heard the letter the king spoke thus to his three sons: 'I am old, dear
  ones; one of you must depart for the greatly favoured and beauteous Lañkä
  belonging to my brother, and there, after his death, assume, (the sovereignty
  of) that fair kingdom.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A2"></a> The king's youngest son, the
  prince PANDUVASUDEVA, thought: 'I will go thither.' And when he had assured
  himself of the success of his journey and empowered by his father, he took
  with him thirty-two sons of ministers and embarked (with them) in the disguise
  of mendicant monks. They landed at the mouth of the Mahandara' river; when the
  people saw these mendicant monks they received them with due respect.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When they had inquired about the capital, they
  arrived gradualy approaching (the city), at Upatissagama, protected by the
  devatas. Now a minister there, charged by the (other) ministers, had
  questioned a soothsayer concerning the coming of the prince, and he had
  furthermore foretold him:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Just on the seventh day will the prince come
  and one who shall spring of his house shall establish (here) the religion of
  the Buddha.' Now when the ministers saw the mendicant monks arrive there, just
  on the seventh day, and inquiring into the matter recognized them, they
  entrusted PANDUVASUDEVA with the sovereignty of Lanka; but since he lacked a
  consort he did not yet receive the solemn consecration.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A son of the Sakka Amitodana was the Sakka
  Pandu Since he heard that the Sakyas would (shortly) be destroyed he took his
  followers with him and went to another tract of land on the further side of
  the Ganges and founded a city there and ruled there as king. He had seven
  sons.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">His youngest daughter was called
  Bhaddakaccana. She was (even as) a woman made of gold, fair of form and
  eagerly wooed. For (love of) her did seven kings send precious gifts to the
  king (Pandu), but for fear of the kings, and since he was told (by
  soothsayers) that an auspicious journey would come to pass, nay, one with the
  result of royal consecration, he placed his daughter speedily upon a ship,
  together with thirty-two women-friends, and launched the ship upon the Ganges,
  saying: 'Whosoever can, let him take my daughter.' And they could not overtake
  her, but the ship fared swiftly thence.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Already on the second day they reached the
  haven called Gonagamaka and there they landed robed like nuns. When they had
  inquired about the capital, they arrived gradually approaching (the city), at
  Upatissagama, protected by the devatas.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the ministers who had heard the saying
  of a soothsayer, saw the women come, and inquiring into the matter recognized
  them and brought them to the king. So his ministers, full of pious
  understanding, consecrated as their king PANDUVASUDEVA, whose every wish was
  fulfilled.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he had consecrated Subhaddakaccana, of
  noble stature, as his own queen, and had given those (maidens) who had arrived
  with her to the followers who had come with him, the monarch lived happily.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the eighth chapter, called 'The
  Consecrating of PANDUVASUDEVA, in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the serene joy
  and emotion of the pious.</font>
