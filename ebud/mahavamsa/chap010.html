  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A4"></a> (<font size="6">A</font>s)
  commanded by Ummadacitta the serving-woman took the boy, laid him in a basket
  and went with him to Dvaramandalaka.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the princes, who had gone a-hunting in
  the Tumbara forest saw the serving woman they asked her: 'Where art thou
  going? What is that?' She answered: 'I am going to Dvramandalaka; that is a
  sweet cake for my daughter.' The princes said to her. 'Take it out.' Then
  Citta and Kalavela who had come forth to protect (the boy) caused a great boar
  to appear at that moment. The princes pursued him; but she took (the boy) and
  went thither and gave the boy and a thousand (pieces of money) secretly to a
  certain man who was entrusted (with the matter). On that very day his wife
  bore a son, and he, declaring: 'My wife has borne twin sons,' reared that boy
  (with his own).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The (boy) was already seven years old when his
  uncles found out (where he was) and charged followers of theirs to kill (with
  him) the boys playing in a certain pond. Now the boy was used to hide, by
  diving, in a certain hollow tree standing in the water and having the mouth of
  the hollow hidden under water, entering by the hollow, and when he had stayed
  long within he would come forth in the same way, and being again among the
  other boys, however much they questioned him, he would mislead them with
  evasive words.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the day the (princes') people came the boy
  with his clothes on dived into the water and stayed hidden in the hollow tree.
  When those men had counted the clothes and killed the other boys they went
  away and declared: 'The boys have all been killed!' When they were gone that
  (boy) went to his foster-father's' house, and comforted by him he lived on
  there to the age of twelve years.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When his uncles again heard that the boy was
  alive they charged (their followers) to kill all the herdsmen. Just on that
  day the herdsmen had taken a deer and sent. the boy into the village to bring
  fire. He went home, but sent his foster father's son out saying: 'I am
  footsore, take thou fire for the herdsrnen; then thou too wilt have some of
  the roast to eat.' Hearing those words he took fire to the herdsmen: and at
  that moment those (men) despatched to do it surrounded the herdsmen and killed
  them all, and when they had killed them they (went and) told (the boy's)
  uncles.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then, when he was sixteen years old, his
  uncles discovered him; his mother sent him a thousand (pieces of money) and a
  command to bring him to (a place of) safety. His fosterfather told him all his
  mother's message, and giving him a slave and the thousand (pieces of money) he
  sent him to Pandula. The brahman named Pandula, a rich man and learned in the
  vedas, dwelt in the southern district in (the village) Pandulagamaka. The
  prince went thither and sought out the brahman Pandula. When this latter had
  asked him: 'Art thou PANDUKABHAYA, my dear?' and was answered 'Yes', he paid
  him honour (as a guest) and said: 'Thou wilt be king, and full seventy years
  wilt thou rule; learn the art, my dear!' and he inbtructed him, and by his son
  Canda also that art was mastered in a short time.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">He gave him a hundred thousand (pieces of
  money) to enrol soldiers and when five hundred men had been enrolled by him
  (he said): 'The (woman) at whose touch leaves turn to gold make thou thy
  queen, and my son Canda thy chaplain.' When he had thus said and given him
  money he sent him forth from thence with his soldiers. Proclaiming his name
  he, the virtuous prince, fared forth and when in the city of Paia near the
  Kasa-mountain he had gathered together seven hundred followers and provision
  for all, he went thence, followed by one thousand two hundred men to the
  mountain called Ginkanda.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">An uncle of PANDUKABHAYA, named Girikandasiva,
  drew his revenues from this district that Panduvasudeva had handed over to
  him. This prince was even then on the point of reaping (a field) measuring a
  hundred karisas; his daughter was the beautiful princess named Pali. And she,
  with a great retinue, had mounted her splendid waggon, and came bringing food
  for her father and for the reapers. The prince's men, who saw the princess
  there, told the prince (about her); the prince coming thither in haste and
  dividing her followers into two bands, drove his own waggon, followed by his
  men, near her and asked: 'Where art thou going?' And when she had told him all
  the prince, whose heart was fired with love, asked for a share of the food.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">She stepped down from the waggon and, at the
  foot of a banyan-tree, she offered the prince food in a golden bowl. Then she
  took banyan-leaves to entertain the rest of the people (with food) and in all
  instant the leaves were changed into golden vesse1s. When the prince saw this
  and remembered the brahman's words he was glad (thinking): 'I have found the
  maiden who is worthy to be made queen.' So she entertained them all, but yet
  the food became not less; it seemed that but one man's portion had been taken
  away. Thus from that time onward that youthful princess who was so rich in
  virtues and merit was called by the name Suvannapali.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And the prince took the maiden and mounted his
  waggon and fared onward, fearless, and surrounded by a mighty army.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="2"></a>When her father heard this he
  despatched all his soldiers, and they came and gave battle and returned,
  defeated by the others; at that place (afterwards) a village was built called
  Kalahanagara.' When her five brothers heard this they (also) departed to make
  war. And all those did Canda the son of Pandula slay; Lohitavahakhanda <a name="3"></a>
  was their battle-field.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">With a great host PANDUKABHAYA marched from
  thence to the further shore of the Ganga toward the Dola-mountain. Here he
  sojourned four years. When his uncles heard that he was there they marched
  thither, leaving the king behind, to do battle with him. When they had made a
  fortified camp near the <a name="4"></a>Dhümarakkha-mountain they fought a
  battle with their nephew. But the nephew pursued the uncles to this side of
  the river, and having defeated them in flight he held their fortified camp for
  two years.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And they went to Upatissagama and told all
  this to the king. And the king sent the prince a letter together with a
  thousand (pieces of money) saying: 'Keep thou possession of the land on the
  further shore, but come not over to this shore.' When the nine brothers heard
  of this they were wroth with the king and said: 'Long hast thou been, in
  truth, a helper to him Now dost thou give him the kingdom. For that we will
  put thee to death.' He yielded up the government to them, and with one accord
  they appointed their brother named Tissa to be regent.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This safety-giving Abhaya had reigned as king
  in Upatissagama twenty years.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now a yakkhini named Cetiya, who dwelt on the
  Dhammarakkha-mountain near the pond (called) Tumbariyangana, used to wander
  about in the form of a mare.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And once a certain man saw this beautiful
  (mare) with her white body and red feet and told the prince: Here is a mare
  whose appearance is thus and so.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The prince took a noose and came to capture
  her. When she saw him comin g up behind her she fled for fear of his majestic
  aspect. She fled without rendering herself invisible and he pursued her
  swiftly as she fled. Seven timesin her flight she circled round the pond, and
  plunging into the Mahaganga and climbing forth again to the shore she fled
  seven times around the Dhumarakkha-mountain; and yet three times more she
  circled round the pond and plunged yet again in the Ganga near the
  Kacchaka-ford, but there he seized her by the mane and (grasped) a palm-leaf
  that was floating down the stream; by the effect of his mer it this turned
  into a great sword. He thrust at her with the sword, crying: I will slay thee.
  And she said to him: I will conquer the kingdom and give it to thee, lord!
  Slay me not! Then he seized her by the neck and boring her nostrils with the
  point of his sword he secured her thus with a rope; but she followed
  wheresoever he would.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="5"></a> When the mighty (hero) had
  gone to the Dhumarakkha mountain, bestriding the mare, he dwelt there on the
  Dhumarakkha-mountain four years. And having mar ched thence with his force and
  come to the Arittha-mountain he sojourned there seven years awaiting a fit
  time to make war.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Eight of his uncles, leaving two behind, drew
  near to the Arittha-mountain in battle array, and when they had laid out a
  fortified camp near a small city and had placed a commander at the head they
  surrounded the Arittha-mountain on every side.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">After speech with the yakkhini, the prince,
  according to her cunning counsel, sent in advance a company of his soldiers
  taking with them kingly apparel and weapons as presents and the message: Take
  all this; I will make peace with you. But as they were lulled to security
  thinking: 'We will take him prisoner if he comes, he mounted the yakkha-mare
  and went forth to battle at the head of a great host. The yakkhini neighed
  full loudly and his army, inside and outside (the camp) raised a mighty
  battle-cry. The princes men killed all the soldiers of the enemy's army and
  the eight uncles with them, and they raised a pyramid of skulls. The commander
  escaped and fled (for safety) to a thicket; that (same thicket) is therefore
  called Senapatigumbaka. When t he prince saw the pyramid of skulls, where the
  skulls of his uncles lay uppermost, be said: Tis like a heap of gourds; and
  therefore they named (the place) Labugamaka.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he was thus left victor in battle,
  PANDUKABHAYA went thence to the dwelling-place of his great-uncle Anuradha.
  The great-uncle handed over his palace to him and built himself a dwelling
  elsewhere; but he dwelt in his house. When he had inquired of a soothsayer who
  was versed in the knowledge of (fitting) sites, he founded the capital, even
  near that village. Since it had served as dwelling to two Anuradhas, it was
  called Anuradhapura, and also because it was founded under the constellation
  Anuradha. When he had caused the (state) parasol of his uncles to be brought
  and purified in a natural pond thatis here, PANDUKABHAYA kept it for himself
  and with the water of that same pond he solemnized his own consecration; and
  Suvannapali, his spouse, he consecratedqueen. On the young Canda, even as he
  had agreed, he conferred the office of his chaplain and other appointments on
  his other followers according to their merits.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because his mother and he himself had been
  befriended by him, he did not slay the king Abhaya, his eldest uncle, but
  handed over the government to him for the night-time: he became the
  'Nagaraguttika' (Guardian of the City). From that time onward there were
  nagaraguttikas in the capital. Flis father-in-law also, Girikandasiva, he did
  not slay but handed over to this uncle the district of Girikanda. He had the
  pond' deepened and abundantly filled with water, and since he had taken water
  therefrom, when victories (for his consecration), they called it Jayavapi. He
  settled the yakkha Kalavela on the east side of the city, the yakkha Cittaraja
  at the lower end of the Abhayatank. The slave-woman who had helped him in time
  past and was re-born of a yakkhini, the thankful (king) settled at the south
  gate of the City. Within the royal precincth he housed the yakkhini in the
  form of a mare. Year by year he had sacrificial offerings made to them and to
  other (yakkhas); but on festival-days he sat with Cittaraja beside him on a
  seat of equal height, and having gods and men to dance before him, the king
  took his pleasure, in joyous and merry wise.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">He laid out also four suburbs as well as the
  Abhaya-tank, the common cemetery, the place of execution, and the chapel of
  the Queens of the West, the banyan-tree of Vessavana and the Palmyra-palm of
  the Demon of Maladies, the ground set apart for the Yonas and the house of the
  Great Sacrifice; all these he laid out near the west gate.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">He set five hundred candalas to the work of
  cleaning the (streets of the) town, two hundred candalas to the work of
  cleaning the sewers, one hundred and fifty candalas he employed to bear the
  dead and as many candalas to be watchers in the cemetery. For these he built a
  village north-west of the cemetery and they continually carried out their duty
  as it was appointed.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Toward the north-east of the candala-village
  he made the cemetery, called the Lower Cemetery, for the candala folk. North
  of this cemetery, between (it and) the Pasana-mountain, the line of huts for
  the huntsmen were built thenceforth. Northward from thence, as far as the
  Gamani-tank, a hermitage was made for many ascetics; eastward of that same
  cemetery the ruler built a house for the nigantha Jotiya. In that same region
  dwelt the nigantha named Gin and many ascetics of various heretical sects. And
  there the lord of the land built also a chapel for the nigantha Kumbhanda; it
  was named after him. Toward the west from thence and eastward of the street of
  the huntsmen lived five hundred families of heretical beliefs. On the further
  side of Jotiya's house and on this side of the Gamani tank he likewise built a
  monastery for wandering meudicLnt monks, and a dwelling for the ajivakas and a
  residence for the brahmans, and in this place and that he built a lying-in
  shelter and a hall for those recovering from sickness.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ten years after his consecration did
  PANDUKABHAYA the over the whole of the island of Lanka . With Kalavela and
  Cittaraja, who were visible (in bodily form) the prince enjoyed his good
  fortune, he who had yakkhas and bhütas for friends. Between the king
  PANDUKABHAYA and Abhaya were seventeen years without a king.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the ruler of the earth, Pandukabyaha, the
  intelligent, being thirty-seven years old, had assumed the rule over the
  kingdom, he reigned full seventy years in fair and wealthy Anurädhapura.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the tenth chapter, called 'The
  Consecrating of PANDUKABHAYA' in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the serene joy
  and emotion of the pious.</font>
