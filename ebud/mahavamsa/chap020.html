  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">I</font>N the eighteenth year
  (of the reign) of king Dhammasoka, the great Bodhi-tree was planted in the
  Mahameghavanarama. In the twelfth year afterwards died the dear consort of the
  king, Asamdhimitta, the faithful (believer) in the Sambuddha In the fourth
  year after this the ruler of the earth Dhammäsoka raised the treacherous
  Tissarakkhä to the rank of queen. In the third year thereafter this fool, in
  the pride of her beauty, with the thought: 'Forsooth, the king worships the
  great Bodhi-tree to my cost!' drawn into the power of hate and working her own
  harm, caused the great Bodhi-tree to perish by means of a mandu-thorn. In the
  fourth year after did Dhammasoka of high renown fall into the power of
  mortality. These make up thirty-seven years.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But when king Devanampiyatissa, whose delight
  was in the blessing of the true doctrine, had brought to completion in seemly
  wise his undertakings in the Mahävihära, on the Cetiya-mountain and also in
  the Thuparama, he asked this question of the thera who had converted the
  island, who was skilled in (answering) questions: 'Sir, I would fain found
  many viharas here; whence shall I get me the relics to place in the thupas?'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'There are the relics brought hither by
  Sumana, with which he filled the bowl of the Sambuddha and which were placed
  here on the Cetiya-mountain, O king. Have these relics placed on the back of
  an elephant and brought hither.' Thus addressed by the thera he brought thus
  the relics hither. Founding vihäras a yojana distant from one another he
  caused the relics to be placed there in the thupas, in due order. But the bowl
  that the Sambuddha had used the king kept in his beautiful palace and
  worshipped continually with manifold offerings.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The (vihära that was built) in the place
  where the five hundred nobles dwelt when they had received the pabbajja from
  the great thera,' was (named) Issarasamanaka. That (vihara that was built)
  where five hundred vessas dwelt, when they had received the pabbajja from the
  great thera, was (called) in like manner Vessagiri. But as for the grotto
  inhabited by the great thera Mabinda, in the vihära built upon the mountain,
  it was called the' Mahinda-grotto'.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">First the Mahavihara, then the (monastery)
  named Cetiya vihara, third the beautiful Thuparama, which the thüpa (itself)
  preceded, fourth the planting of the great Bodhi-tree, then fifth the (setting
  up) in seemly wise (of the) beautiful stone pillar which was intended to point
  to the place of the thupa, on the place where the Great cetiya (afterwards)
  was, and also the enshrining of the Sambuddha's collar-bone relic, sixth the
  Issarasamana(vihara), seventh the Tissatank, eighth the Pathamathupa, ninth
  the (vihära) called Vessa(giri), then that pleasant (nunnery) which was known
  as the Upasika(vihara) and the (vihara) called the Hatthalhaka, those two
  convents as goodly dwellings for the bhikkhunis; and (furthermore) for the
  accepting of food by the brotherhood of bhikkhus when they were visiting the
  dwelling of the bhikkhunis (called) Hatthalhaka(vihara), the refectory called
  Mahäpäli, easy of approach, beautiful, stored with all provisions and
  provided with service; then lavish gifts, consisting of the needful utensils
  for a thousand bhikkhus, (which things he gave) on the pavarana-day, every
  year; in Nagadipa the Jambukolavihara at this landing place, the
  Tissamahävihära and the Pacinarama: these works, caring for the salvation of
  the people of Lañkä, Devanampiyatissa, king of Lañkä, rich in merit and
  insight, caused to be carried out, even in his first year, as a friend to
  virtue, and his whole life through he heaped up works of merit. Our island
  flourished under the lordship of this king; forty years did he hold sway as
  king.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A7"></a> After his death, his younger
  brother since there was no son, the prince known by the name UTTIYA held sway
  piously as king. But the great thera, Mahinda, who had taught the peerless
  doctrine of the Master, the sacred writings, the precepts of righteousness and
  the higher perfection, full excellently in the island of Lanka, (Mahinda) the
  light of Lanka, the teacher of many disciples, he who, like unto the Master,
  had wrought great blessing for the people, did, in the eighth year of king
  UTTIYA, while he, being sixty years old,' was spending the rain season on the
  Cetiya-mountain, pass, victorious over his senses, into nibbana, on the eighth
  day of the bright half of the month Assayuja. Therefore this day received his
  name.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When king UTTIYA heard this he went thither,
  stricken by the dart of sorrow, and when he had paid homage to the thera and
  oft and greatly had lamented (over him) he caused the dead body of the thera
  to be laid forthwith in a golden chest sprinkled with fragrant oil, and the
  well closed chest to be laid upon a golden, adorned bier; and when he had
  caused it then to be lifted upon the bier, commanding solemn ceremonies, he
  caused it to be escorted by a great multitude of people, that had come
  together from this place and that, and by a great levy of troops; commanding
  due offerings (he caused it to be escorted) on the adorned street to the
  variously adorned capital and brought through the city in procession by the
  royal highway to the Mahavihara.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the monarch had caused the bier to be
  placed here for a week in the Panambamälaka with triumphal arches, pennons,
  and flowers, and with vases filled with perfumes the vihära was adorned and a
  circle of three yojanas around, by the king's decree, but the whole island was
  adorned in like manner by the decree of the devas and when the monarch had
  commanded divers offerings throughout the week he built up, turned toward the
  east in the Theränambandhamälaka, a funeral pyre of sweet smelling wood,
  leaving the (place of the later) Great thupa on the right, and when he had
  brought the beautiful bier thither and caused it to be set upon the pyre he
  carried out the rites of the dead.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And here did he build a cetiya when he had
  caused the relics to be gathered together. Taking the half of the relics the
  monarch caused thupas to be built on the Cetiya-mountain and in all the
  vihäras. The place where the burial of this sage's body had taken place is
  called, to do him honour, Isibhumangana.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">From that time onwards they used to bring the
  dead bodies of holy men from three yojanas around to this spot and there to
  burn them.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the great theri Samghamitta, gifted with
  the great supernormal powers and with great wisdom had fulfilled the duties of
  the doctrine and had brought much blessing to the people, she, being
  fifty-nine years old, in the ninth year of this same king UTTIYA, while she
  dwelt in the peaceful Hatthalhaka-convent passed into nibbana. And for her
  also, as for the thera, the king commanded supreme honours of burial a week
  through, and the whole of Lanka was adorned as for the thera.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The body of the theri laid upon a bier did he
  cause to be brought when the week was gone by, out of the city; and to the
  east of the Thüpäräma, near the Cittisala (of later times) in sight of the
  great Bodhi-tree, on the spot pointed out by the theri (herself), he caused
  the burning to take place. And the most wise UTTIYA also had a thupa built
  there.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The five great theras also, and those theras
  too of whom Arittha was the leader, and many thousand bhikkhus who were freed
  from the asavas and also the twelve theris among whom Samghamitta stood
  highest, and many thousand bhikkhunis who were freed from the äsavas, who,
  endowed with great learning and deep insight had expounded the holy scripture
  of the Conqueror, the vinaya and the rest, fell, in time, into the power of
  mortality.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ten years did king UTTIYA reign; thus is
  mortality the destroyer of the whole world.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A man who, although he knows this
  overmastering, overwhelming, irresistible mortality, yet is not discontented
  with the world of existence and does not feel, in this discontent, resentment
  at wrong nor joy in virtue that is the strength of the fetters of his evil
  delusion such an one is knowingly fooled.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the twentieth chapter, called 'The
  Nibbana of the Thera', in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the serene joy and
  emotion of the pious.</font>
