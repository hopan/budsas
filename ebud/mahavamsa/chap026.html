  THE MARICAVATTI VIHARA</font></b></center>
  <p><font size="6">W</font>HEN that king of high renown had united Lañkä in
  one kingdom he distributed places of honour to his warriors according to their
  rank. The warrior Theraputtabhaya would not have that which was allotted to
  him, and being asked:
  <p>'Wherefore?' he answered: 'It is war.' And questioned (yet again): 'When a
  single realm is created what war is there?' he answered: 'I will do battle
  with those rebels, the passions, (battle) wherein victory is hard to win.'
  Thus said he, and again and again the king sought to restrain him. When he had
  entreated again and again he took the pabbajja with the king's consent. After
  taking the pabbajja he attained in time to arahantship, and he lived in the
  midst of five hundred (bhikkhus) who had overcome the asavas.
  <p>When the week of the festival of kingship was gone by the fearless king
  Abhaya,' who had carried out the consecration with great pomp, went to the
  Tissa-tank, that was adorned according to the festival custom, to hold
  festival plays there and to observe the tradition of crowned kings.
  <p>All that had been made ready for the king and hundreds of offerings did
  they place on the spot where the Maricavatti vihara (afterwards stood). There
  in the very place where the thüpa (afterwards) stood the king's people who
  carried the spear planted the splendid spear with the relic. When the king had
  disported himself in the water the whole day through, together with the women
  of the harem, he said, in the evening: 'We will go hence; carry the spear
  before us.'
  <p>And the people entrusted with (this duty) could not move the spear from its
  place; and the king's soldiers came together and brought offerings of perfumes
  and flowers. When the king saw this great miracle, glad at heart he appointed
  sentinels there, and after he bad returned forthwith into the city he built a
  cetiya in such wise that it enclosed the spear and founded a vihära that
  enclosed the thüpa.
  <p>In three years the vihara was finished and the ruler of men called the
  brotherhood together to hold the festival (on the consecration) of the
  monastery. A hundred thousand bhikkhus and ninety thousand bhikkhunis were
  gathered together there. Then in this assembly the king spoke thus to the
  brotherhood: 'Without a thought of the brotherhood, venerable sirs, I ate
  pepper in the pod. Thinking: This shall be my act of expiation, I have built
  the pleasant Maricavatti vihara, together with the cetiya. May the brotherhood
  accept it!' With these words he poured forth the (ceremonial) water of a gift
  and piously gave the monastery to the brother hood. When he had set up a great
  and beautiful hall in the vihAra and round about it, he commanded that lavish
  gifts should be given there to the brotherhood. The hail was so planned that
  stakes were set even in the water of the Abhayatank,' what need of further
  words to speak of the remaining space (covered)?
  <p>When the ruler of men had given food, drink and so forth, for a week, he
  offered as a gift the whole of the costly necessaries for samanas. These
  necessaries began with a cost of a hundred thousand (kahapanas) and ended with
  a cost of a thousand. All this did the brotherhood receive. The money that was
  spent there in gratitude by the wise king, who was a hero in battle as in
  largess, whose pure heart was filled with faith in the Three Gems, who desired
  to raise the (Buddha's) doctrine to glory, (that was spent) to honour the
  Three Gems, beginning with the building of the thüpa and ending with the
  festival of the vihära, (all this money), leaving aside the rest of the
  priceless (gifts), is reckoned as but one less than twenty kotis.
  <p>Treasures which, in truth, bear on theni the blot of the five faults
  become, if they be acquired by people who are gifted with special wisdom,
  possessed of the five advantages ; therefore let the wise man strive to have
  them thus.
  <p>Here ends the twenty-sixth chapter, called 'The Consecrating of the
  Maricavatti-vihara', in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the serene joy and emotion
  of the pious.
