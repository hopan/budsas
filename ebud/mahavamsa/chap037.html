  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A57"></a> <font size="6">A</font>FTER
  king JETTHA TISSA's death, his younger brother MAHASENA ruled twenty-seven
  years as king. And to consecrate him as king, the thera Samghamitta came
  thither from the further coast, when he heard the time (of Jetthatissa's
  death). When he had carried out the consecration and the other ceremonies of
  various kihd, the lawless (bhikkhu) who would fain bring about the destruction
  of the Mahavihara won the king to himself with the words: 'The dwellers in the
  Mahavihara do not teach the (true) vinaya, we are those who teach the (true)
  vinaya, O king', and he established a royal penalty: 'Whosoever gives food to
  a bhikkhu dwelling in the Mahavihara is liable to a fine of a hundred (pieces
  of money).'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The bhikkhus dwelling in the Mahavihara, who
  thereby fell into want, abandoned the Mahavihara, and went to Malaya and
  Rohana. Thus was our Mahavihara desolate for nine years and empty of those
  bhikkhus who (else) had dwelt in the Mahavihara. And the unwise thera
  persuaded the unwise king: 'Ownerless land belongs to the king,' and when he
  had gained leave from the king to destroy the Mahavihara, this (bhikkhu), in
  the enmity of his heart, set on people to do so.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">An adherent of the thera Samghamitta, the
  ruthless minister Sona, a favourite servant of the king, and (with him)
  shameless bhikkhus, destroyed the splendid Lohapasada seven stories high, and
  carried away the (material of the) various buildings from hence to the
  Abhayagiri (vihara), and by means of the many buildings that were borne away
  from the Mahävihära the Abhayagiri-vihara became rich in buildings. Holding
  fast to his evil friend, the thera Samghamitta, and to his servant Sona, the
  king wrought many a deed of wrong. The king sent for the great stone image
  from the Päcinatissapabbata (vihära) and set it up in the Abhayagiri
  (vihra). He set up a building for the image, a temple for the Bodhitree, a
  beautiful relic-hall and a four-sided hall, and he restored the (parivena)
  called Kukkuta. Then by the ruthless thera Samghamitta was the
  Abhayagiri-vihara made stately to see.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="40"></a> The minister named
  Meghavannabhaya, the friend of the king, who was busied with all his affairs,
  was wroth with him for destroying the Mahavihara; he became a rebel, and when
  he had gone to Malaya and had raised a great force, he pitched a camp by the
  Düratissaka-tank.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the king heard that his friend was come
  thither, he marched forth to do battle with him, and he also pitched a camp.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The other had good drink and meat, that he had
  brought with him from Malaya and thinking: 'I will not enjoy it without my
  friend the king,' he took some, and he himself went forth alone by night, and
  coming to the king he told him this thing. When the king had eaten with him,
  in perfect trust, that which he had brought, he asked him: 'Why hast thou
  become a rebel?' 'Because the Mahavihara has been destroyed by thee' he
  answered. 'I will make the vihara to be dwelt in yet again; forgive me my
  fault,' thus spoke the king, and the other was reconciled with the king.
  Following his counsel the king returned to the capital. But Meghavannabhaya,
  who persuaded the king (that it was fitting to do this), did not go with the
  king that be might collect in the meantime the wherewithal to build.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the king's wives, who was exceedingly
  dear to him, the daughter of a scribe, grieved over the destruction of the
  Mahavihara, and when she, in bitterness of heart, had won over a labourer to
  kill the thera who had destroyed it, she caused the violent thera Samghamitta
  to be done to death as he came to the Thuparama to destroy it. And they slew
  likewise the violent and lawless minister Sona. But when Meghavannabhaya' had
  brought the building-materials (that he bad collected), he built several
  parivenas in the Mahavihara. When this fear had (thus) been calmed by Abhaya
  the bhikkhus coming from here and there again inhabited the Mahavihara. But
  the king made two bronze images and set them up on the west side of the temple
  of the great Bodhi-tree.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Being well-pleased with the hypocrite, the
  plotter, the lawless thera Tissa, his evil friend, who dwelt in the
  Dakkhinarama, he, although he was warned, built within the boundaries of the
  Mahavihara, in the garden called Joti, the Jetavana-vihara. Then he called
  upon the brotherhood of monks to do away with their boundaries, and since the
  bhikkhus would not do this, they abandoned the vihara. But now, to make the
  shifting of the boundary void of effect, if others should seek to do this,
  certain bhikkhus hid themselves in various places.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus was the Mahavihara abandoned for nine
  months by the bhikkhus, and the other bhikkhus thought: 'We will begin to
  shift (the boundaries).' Then, when this attempt to shift the boundary was
  given up,' the bhikkhus came back hither and dwelt again in the Mahavihara.
  But within the brotherhood of bhikkhus a complaint touching an offence of the
  gravest kind was raised against the thera Tissa, who had received the
  (Jetavana) vihára. The high minister, known to be just, who decided (the
  matter) excluded him, according to right and law, from the order, albeit
  against the king's wishes.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The king built also the Manihira-vihara and
  founded three vihäras, destroying temples of the (brahmanical) gods: the
  Gokanna (vihara), (and another vihara) in Erakavilla, (and a third) in the
  village of the Brahman Kalanda; (moreover be built) the Migagama-vihara and
  the Gangasenakapabbata (vihara). To the west, he built the Dhatusenapabbata
  (vihara); the king founded also the great vihãra in Kokaväta. He built the
  Thuparama -vihara and the Hulapitthi (vihara) and the two nunneries, called
  Uttara and Abhaya. At the place of the yakkha Kalavela' he built a thüpa, and
  on the island he restored many ruined buildings. To one thousand samghattheras
  he distributed alms for theras, at a cost of a thousand (pieces of money), and
  to all (the bhikkhus he distributed) yearly a garment. There is no record of
  his gifts of food and drink.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To make (the land) more fertile, he made
  sixteen tanks, the Manihira, the Mahagama, the Challüra, and the (tank) named
  Khanu, the Mahamani, the Kokavata and the Dhammaramma-tank, the Kumbalaka and
  the Vahana, besides the Rattamalakandaka, the tank Tissavaddhamanaka, that of
  Velangavitthi, that of Mahagallaka, the Cira-tank and the Mahadaragallaka and
  the Kalapasana-tank. These are the sixteen tanks. On the Ganga he built the
  great canal named Pabbatanta.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus did he gather to himself much merit and
  much guilt.</font>
