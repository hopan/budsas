  </center><center><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">THE RECEIVING OF THE
  GREAT BODHI-TREE</font></b></center>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>HE monarch remembered
  the word spoken by the thera, that he should send for the great Bodhi-tree and
  the theri, and when, on a certain day during the rain-season, he was sitting
  in his own city with the thera and had taken counsel with his ministers he
  entrusted his own nephew, his minister named Arittha, with this business.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he had pondered (on the matter) and had
  summoned him he spoke to him in these words: 'Canst thou perchance, my dear,
  go to Dhammasoka to bring hither the great Bodhi-tree and the then
  Sanghamitta?' 'I can bring them hither, your majesty, if I be allowed, when I
  am come back, to receive the pabbajja, O most exalted!'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'So be it,' answered the king and sent him
  thence. When he had received the command of the thera and the king and had
  taken his leave he set forth on the second day of the bright half of the month
  Assayuja,' and having embarked, filled with zeal (for his mission) at the
  haven Jambukola and having passed over the great ocean he came, by the power
  of the thera's will, to the pleasant Pupphapura even on the day of his
  departure.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The queen Anulä, who, with five hundred
  maidens and five hundred women of the royal harem had accepted the ten
  precepts, did (meanwhile) pious as she was, (wearing) the yellow robe, waiting
  for the pabbajja, in discipline, looking for the coming of the theri, take up
  her abode, leading a holy life, in the pleasant nunnery built by the king in a
  certain part of the city. Since the nunnery was inhabited by these laysisters
  it became known in Lañkã by the name Upasikavihara.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the nephew Maharittha had delivered the
  king's message to the king Dhammasoka he gave him (also) the thera's message:
  'The spouse of the brother of thy friend, of the king (Devanampiya), O thou
  elephant among kings, lives, longing for the pabbajjia, constantly in stern
  discipline. To bestow on her the pabbajja do thou send the bhikkhuni
  Samghamitta and with her the south branch of the great Bodhi-tree.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And the same matter, even as the thera had
  charged him, he told the then; the theri went to her father (Asoka) and told
  him the thera's purpose.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The king said: 'How shall I, when I no longer
  behold thee, dear one, master the grief aroused by the parting with son and
  grandson ? '</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">She answered: 'Weighty is the word of my
  brother, O great king; many are they that must receive the pabajja, therefore
  must I depart thither.' 'The great Bodhi-trees must not be injured with a
  knife, how then can I have a branch!' mused the king. Then when he, following
  the counsel of his minister Mahädeva, had invited the community of bhikkhus
  and had shown them hospitality the monarch asked: 'Shall the great Bodhi-tree
  be sent to Lañka, sirs?'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The thena Moggaliputta answered: 'It shall be
  sent thither,' and he related to the king the five great resolutions that the
  (Buddha) gifted with the five eyes had formed.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the ruler of the earth heard this he was
  glad, and when lie had caused the road, seven yojanas long, leading to the
  great Bodhi-tree to be carefully cleaned he adorned it in manifold ways, and
  gold he caused to be brought to make ready a vase. Vissakamma,' who appeared
  in the semblance of a goldsmith, asked: 'How large shall I make the vase?'
  Then being answered: 'Thyse'f deciding the size do thou make it,' he took the
  gold, and. having moulded it with his hand he made a vase in that very moment
  and departed thence.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the king had received the beautiful vase
  measuring nine cubits around and five cubits in depth and three cubits across,
  being eight finger-breadths thick, having the upper edge of the size of a
  young elephant's trunk, being in radiancy equal to the young (morning) sun;
  when, with his army of four divisions stretching to a length of seven yojanas
  and a width of three yojanas, and with a great company of bhikkhus, he had
  gone to the great Bodhi-tree, decked with manifold ornaments, gleaming with
  various jewels and garlanded with many coloured flags; when he, moreover, had
  ranged his troops about (the tree), bestrewn with manifold flowers and
  resounding with many kinds of music and had covered it round with a tent; when
  in seemly wise he had surrounded himself and the great Bodhi-tree with a
  thousand great theras at the head of a great company (of bhikkhus) and with
  more than a thousand princes who had been anointed as king, he gazed up with
  folded hands at the great Bodhi-tree.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then from its south bough the branches
  vanished, leaving a stump four cubits long.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the ruler of the earth saw the miracle he
  cried out, rejoicing: 'I worship the great Bodhi-tree by bestowing kingship
  (thereon),' and the monarch consecrated the great Bodhi-tree as king of his
  great realm. When he had worshipped the great Bodhi-tree with gifts of flowers
  and so forth, and had passed round it three times turning to the left' and had
  done reverence to it at eight points with folded hands, he had the golden vase
  placed upon a seat inlaid with gold, adorned with various gems and easy to
  mount, reaching to the height of the bough; and when, in order to receive the
  sacred branch, he had mounted upon it, grasping a pencil of red arsenic with a
  golden handle he drew (with this) a line about the bough and uttered the
  solemn declaration:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'So truly as the great Bodhi-tree shall go
  hence to the isle of Lañkä, and so truly as I shall stand unalterably firm
  in the doctrine of the Buddha, shall this fair south branch of the great
  Bodhi-tree, severed of itself, take its place here in this golden vase.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the great Bodhi-tree severed, of itself,
  at the place where the line was, floating above the vase filled with fragrant
  earth. Above the line first (drawn) the ruler of men drew, at (a distance of)
  three finger-breadths, round about ten (further) pencil-strokes. And ten
  strong roots springing from the first and ten slender from each of the other
  (lines) dropped down, forming a net.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the king saw this miracle he uttered even
  there, greatly gladdened, a cry of joy, and with him his followers all around
  and the community of bhikkhus raised, with glad hearts, cries of salutation
  and round about was a thousandfold waving of stuffs.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus with a hundred roots the great Bodhi-tree
  set itself there in the fragrant earth, converting the people to the faith.
  Ten cubits long was the stem; five lovely branches (were thereon), each four
  cubits long and (each) adorned with five fruits, and on these branches were a
  thousand twigs. Such was the ravishing and auspicious great Bodhi-tree.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the moment that the great Bodhi-tree set
  itself in the vase the earth quaked and wonders of many kinds came to pass. By
  the resounding of the instruments of music (which gave out sound) of
  themselves among gods and men, by the ringing-out of the shout of salutation
  from the hosts of devas and brahmas,' by the crash of the clouds, (the voices)
  of beasts and birds, of the yakkhas and so forth and by the crash of the
  quaking of the earth all was in one tumult. Beautiful rays of six colours
  going forth from the fruits and leaves of the Bodhi-tree made the whole
  universe to shine. Then rising in the air with the vase the great Bodhi-tree
  stayed for seven days invisible in the region of the snow.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The king came down from his seat and
  sojourning there for seven days he continually brought offerings in many ways
  to the great Bodhi-tree. When the week was gone by all the snow-clouds and all
  the rays likewise entered into the great Bbdhi-tree, and in the clear
  atmosphere the glorious great Bodhi-tree was displayed to the whole people,
  planted in the golden vase. Whilst wonders of many kinds came to pass the
  great Bodhi-tree, plunging mankind into amazement descended on the earth.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Rejoiced by the many wonders the great king
  worshipped again the great Bodhi-tree by (bestowing on it) his great kingdom,
  and, when he had consecrated the great Bodhi-tree unto great kingship he
  abode, worshipping it with divers offerings, yet another week in that same
  place.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the bright half of the month Assayuja on
  the fifteenth uposatha-day he received the great Bodhi-tree; two weeks after
  in the dark half of the month Assayuja on the fourteenth-uposatha day the lord
  of chariots brought the great Bodhi-tree, having placed it on a beautiful car
  on the same day, amid offerings, to his capital; and when he had built a
  beautiful hail (for it) adorned in manifold ways, and there on the first day
  of the bright half of the month Kattika had caused the great Bodhi-tree to be
  placed on the east side of the foot of a beautiful and great sula-tree, he
  allotted to it day by day many offerings. But on the seventeenth day after the
  receiving (of the tree) new shoots appeared on it all at once; therefore,
  rejoicing, the lord of men once more worshipped the great Bodhi-tree by
  bestowing kingship upon it. When the great ruler had consecrated the great
  Bodhitree unto kingship he appointed a festival of offerings in divers forms
  for the great Bodhi-tree.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So it came to pass that the festival of
  adoration of the great Bodhi-tree, vivid with gay and lovely flags, great,
  brilliant and splendid, in the city of flowers, opened the hearts of gods and
  men (to the faith) (even as) in the lake the sun (opens the lotuses).'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the eighteenth chapter, called 'The
  Receiving of the Great Bodhi-tree', in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the serene
  joy and emotion of the pious.</font>
