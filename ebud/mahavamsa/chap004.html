  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">W</font>HEN Ajatasattu's son
  Udayabhaddaka had slain him he, the traitor, reigned sixteen years.
  Udayabhaddaka's son Anuruddhaka slew (his father) and Anuruddha's son named
  Muia did likewise. Traitors and fools, these (sons) reigned over the kingdom;
  in the reign of these two (kings) eight years elapsed. Munla's son Nagadasaka
  slew his father and then did the evildoer reigntwenty-four years.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then were the citizens wroth, saying: 'This is
  a dynasty of parricides,' and when they had banished the king Nagadasaka they
  met together and (since) the minister known by the name Susunaga was proved to
  be worthy, they anointed him king, mindful of the good of all. He reigned as
  king eighteen years. His son Kalasoka reigned twenty-eight years. At the end
  of the tenth year of Kalasoka's reign a century had gone by since the
  parinibbana of the Sambuddha.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At that time in Vesali many bhikkhus of the
  Vajji-clan did shamelessly teach that the Ten Points were lawful, namely 'Salt
  in the horn', 'Two fingers' breadth', 'Visiting the village', 'Dwelling',
  'Consent', 'Example', 'unchurned milk', 'Unfermented palm-wine', 'Seat without
  fringe', 'Gold and so forth'.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When this came to the ears of the thera Yasa,
  the son of the brahman Kakandaka, gifted with the six supernormal powers,' who
  was wandering about in the Vajji country, he betook himself to the Mahavana
  (vihära) with the resolve to settle the matter. In the uposatha-hall those
  (monks) had placed a vessel made of metal and filled with water and had said
  to the lay-folk: 'Bestow on the brotherhood kahapanas and so on.' The thera
  forbade them with the words 'This is unlawful; give nothing!' Then did they
  threaten the thera</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yasa with the penance called the Craving of
  pardon from layfolk.' He asked for one to bear him company and went with him
  into the city proclaiming to the citizens, that his teaching was according to
  the dhamma.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the bhikkhus heard what (Yasa's)
  companion had to tell, they came to thrust him out and surrounded the thera's
  house. The thera left it, rising up and passing through the air, and halting
  at Kosambi, he forthwith sent messengers to the bhikkhus of Pava and Avanti;
  he himself went to the Ahoganga-mountain and related all to the thera
  Sambhüta Simaväsi.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sixty great theras from Pava and eighty from
  Avanti, all free from the asavas, came together on the Ahogahga. The bhikkhus
  who met together here from this and that region were in all ninety thousand.
  When they had all conferred together they, knowing that the deeply learned
  thera Revata of Soreyya who was free from the asavas, was the chief among them
  at that time, went thence to seek him out.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the thera heard this resolution (by his
  divine ear) he set out at once, wishing to travel easily, upon the way to
  Vesali. Arriving day by day in the evening at the spot whence the sage had
  departed in the morning (the theras) met him (at last) at Sahajäti.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There the thera Yasa, as the thera Sambhuta
  had charged him to do, at the end of the recital of the sacred word,
  addressing himself to the great thera Revata, questioned him on the Ten
  Points. The thera rejected them, and when he had heard the matter, he said:
  'Let us make an end (of this dispute).' The heretical bhikkhus, too, in order
  to win support, sought the thera Revata. Preparing in abundance the things
  needful for ascetics,' they took ship with all speed and went to Sahajäti,
  bestowing food sumptuously when the mealtime came.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The thera Sälha, free from the asavas, who
  lived at Sahajati, having thought on the matter, perceived: 'Those of Pava
  hold the true doctrine.' And the great god Brahma drew near to him and said:
  'Stand thou firm in the doctrine,' and he replied that he would ever stand
  firm in the doctrine.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">They took those needful things (that they had
  brought as gifts) and. sought the thera Revata, but the thera did not take
  their part and dismissed (the pupil) who took their part. They went thence to
  Vesali, shameless they went from there to Pupphapura, and told king Kalasoka:
  'Guarding our Master's perfumed chamber we dwell in the Mahävana-vihära in
  the Vajji territory; but bhikkhus dwelling in the country are coming, great
  king, with the thought: We will take the vihara for ourselves. Forbid them!'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When they had thus misled the king they went
  (back) to Vesali. Here in Sahajati eleven hundred and ninety thousand bhikkhus
  were come together under the thera Revata, to bring the dispute to a peaceful
  end. And the thera would not end the dispute save in the presence of those
  with whom it had begun;' therefore all the bhikkhus went thence to Vesali. The
  misguided king likewise sent his ministers thither, but led astray by the
  design of the devas they went elsewhere. And the monarch, when he had sent
  them, saw himself in a dream, that night, hurled into the hell called
  Lohakumbhi. The king was sorely terrified and, to calm his fears, his sister,
  Nanda, the then free from the asavas, came to him, passing through the air.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'An ill deed is this that thou hast done!
  Reconcile thee with these venerable bhikkhus, the true believers. Placing
  thyself on their side, protect thou their faith. If thou dost so, blessed art
  thou!' she said, and thereon vanished. And forthwith in the morning the king
  set out to go to Vesali. He went to the Mahavana (monastery), assembled the
  congregation of the bhikkhus there, and when he had heard what was said by
  both of the (opposing) sides, and had decided, himself, for the true faith,
  when moreover this prince was reconciled with all the rightly believing
  bbikkhus and had declared that he was for the right belief, he said: 'Do what
  ye think well to further the doctrine,' and when he had promised to be their
  protector, he returned to his capital.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thereafter the brotherhood came together to
  decide upon those points; then, in the congregation (of monks), aimless words
  were spent. Then the thera Revata, who went into the midst of the brotherhood,
  resolved to settle the matter by means of an ubbahika. He appointed four
  bhikkhus from the East, and four from Pava, for the ubbahika to set the
  dispute to rest. Sabbakami and Salha, one named Khujjasobhita, and
  Vasabhagamika, these were the theras from the East; Revata, Sänasambhüta,
  Yasa, the son of Kakandaka, and Sumana, these were the four theras from Pavä.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now to decide on those points the eight theras
  who were free from the Asavas betook them to the quiet and solitary
  Valikarama. There, in the beautiful spot prepared for them by the young
  Ajita,' the great theras took up their abode, they who knew the thoughts of
  the Greatest of Sages. And the great thera Revata, skilled in questioning,
  questioned the thera Sabbakämi successively on each one of those points.
  Questioned by him the great thera Sabbakämi thus gave judgment: 'All these
  points are unlawful, according to tradition.' And when, in due order, they had
  ended (their task) in this place, they did all again, in like manner, with
  question and answer, in the presence of the brotherhood. And thus did the
  great theras refute the teaching of those ten thousand heretical bhikkhus who
  maintained the Ten Points.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sabbakämi was then the sarpghatthera on the
  earth, one hundred and twenty years did he number since his upasampada.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sabbakami and Salha, Revata, Khnjjasobhita,
  Yasa, the son of Kakandaka, and Sarnbhüta Sanavasika, the six theras, were
  pupils of the thera Ananda; but Vasabhagamika and Sumana, the two theras, were
  pupils of the thera Anuruddha. These eight fortunate theras had beheld the
  Tathagata in time past. One hundred and twelve thousand bhikkhus had come
  together, and of all these bhikkhus the them Revata then was the chief.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At that time the thera Revata, in order to
  hold a council, that the true faith might long endure, chose seven hundred out
  of all that troop of bhikkhus; (those chosen were) arahants endowed with the
  four special sciences, understanding of meanings and so forth, knowing the
  tipitaka.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">All these (theras met) in the Valikarama
  protected by Käläsoka, under the leadership of the thera Revata, (and)
  compiled the dhamma.' Since they accepted the dhamma already established in
  time past and proclaimed afterward, they completed their work in eight months.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When these theras of high renown had held the
  Second Council, they, since in them all evil had perished, attained in course
  of time unto nibbana.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we bethink us of the death of the sons of
  the Universal Teacher, who were gifted with perfect insight, who had attained
  all that is to attain, who had conferred blessings on (the beings of) the
  three forms of existence, then may we lay to heart the entire vanity of all
  that comes into being and vigilantly strive (after deliverance).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the fourth chapter, cal]ed 'The
  Second Council ', in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the serene joy and emotion of
  the pious.</font>
