  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">I</font>N the country of the
  Vangas in the Vanga capital there lived once a king of the Vangas. The
  daughter of the king of the Kalingas was that king's consort. By his spouse
  the king had a daughter, the soothsayers prophesied her union with the king of
  beasts. Very fair was she and very amorous and for shame the king and queen
  could not suffer her.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Alone she went forth from the house, desiring
  the joy of independent life; unrecognized she joined a caravan travelling to
  the Magadha country. In the Lala country a lion attacked the caravan in the
  forest, the other folk fled this way and that, but she fled along the way by
  which the lion had come.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the lion had taken his prey and was
  leaving the spot he beheld her from afar, love (for her) laid hold on him, and
  he came towards her with waving tail and ears laid back. Seeing him she
  bethought her of that prophecy of the soothsayers which she bad heard, and
  without fear she caressed him stroking his limbs.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The lion, roused to fiercest passion by her
  touch, took her upon his back and bore her with all speed to his cave, and
  there he was united with her, and from this union with him the princess in
  time bore twin-children, a son and a daughter.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The son's bands and feet were formed like a
  lion's and therefore she named him Sihabahu, but the daughter (she named)
  Sihasivali. When he was sixteen years old the son questioned his mother on the
  doubt (that had arisen in him): 'Wherefore are you and our father so
  different, dear mother?' She told him all. Then he asked: 'Why do we not go
  forth (from here)?' And she answered: 'Thy father has closed the cave up with
  a rock.' Then he took that barrier before the great cave upon his shoulder and
  went (a distance of) fifty yojanas going andcoming in one day.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then (once), when the lion had, gone forth in
  search of prey, (Sihabahu) took his mother on his right shoulder and his young
  sister on his left, and went away with speed. They clothed themselves with
  branches of trees, and so came to a border-village and there, even at that
  time, was a son of the princess's uncle, a commander in the army of the Yanga
  king, to whom was given the rule over the border-country; and he was just then
  sitting under a banyan-tree overseeing the work that was done.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he saw them he asked them (who they were)
  and they said; 'We are forest-folk'; the commander bade (his people) give them
  clothing; and this turned into splendid (garments). He had food offered to
  them on leaves and by reason of their merit these were turned into dishes of
  gold. Then, amazed, the commander asked them, 'Who are you?' The princess told
  him her family and clan. Then the commander took his uncle's daughter with him
  and went to the capital of the Vangas and married her.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the lion, returning in haste to his cave,
  missed those three (persons), he was sorrowful, and grieving after his son he
  neither ate nor drank. Seeking for his children he went to the border-village,
  and every village where he came was deserted by the dwellers therein.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And the border-folk came to the king and told
  him this:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'A lion ravages thy country; ward off (this
  danger) 0 king!' Sinée he found none who could ward off (this danger) he bad
  a thousand (pieces of money) led about the city on an elephant's back and this
  proclamation made: 'Let him who brings the lion receive these!' And in like
  manner the monarch (offered) two thousand and three thousand. Twice did
  Sibabahu's mother restrain him. The third time without asking his mother's
  leave, Sihabähu took the three thousand gold-pieces (as reward) for slaying
  his own father.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">They presented the 'youth to the king, and the
  king spoke thus to him: 'If thou shalt take the lion I will give thee at once
  the kingdom.' And he went to the opening of the cave, and as soon as he saw
  from afar the lion who came forward, for love toward his son, he shot an arrow
  to slay him.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The arrow struck the lion's forehead but
  because of his tenderness (toward his son) it rebounded and fell on the earth
  at the youth's feet. And so it fell out three times, then did the king of
  beasts grow wrathful and the arrow sent at him struck him and pierced his
  body.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">(Sihabahu) took the head of the lion with the
  mane and returned to his city. And just seven days had passed then since the
  death of the king of the Vangas. Since the king had no son the ministers, who
  rejoiced over his deed on hearing that he was the kings grandson and on
  recognizing his mother, met all together and said of one accord to the prince
  Sihabahu 'Be thou (our) king'.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And he accepted the kingship but handed it
  over then to his mother's husband and he himself went with Sihasivali to the
  land of his birth. There he built a city, and they called it Sihapura, and in
  the forest stretching a hundred yojanas around he founded villages. In the
  kingdom of Lala, in that city did Sihabähu, ruler of men, hold sway when he
  had made Sihasivali his queen. As time passed on his consort bore twin sons
  sixteen times, the eldest was named Vijaya, the second Sumitta; together there
  were thirty-two sons. In time the king consecrated Vijaya as prince-regent.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Vijaya was of evil conduct and his followers
  were even (like himself), and many intolerable deeds of violence were done by
  them. Angered by this the people told the matter to the king; the king,
  speaking persuasively to them, severely blamed. his son. But all fell out
  again as before, the second and yet the third time; and the angered people
  said to the king: 'Kill thy son.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then did the king cause Vijaya and his
  followers, seven hundred men, to be shaven over half the head and put them on
  a ship and sent them forth upon the sea, and their wives and children also.
  The men, women, and children sent forth separately landed separately, each
  (company) upon an island, and they dwelt even there. The island where the
  children landed was called Naggadipa and the island where the women landed
  Mahiladipaka. But Vijaya landed at the haven called Suppäraka, but being
  there in danger by reason of the violence of his followers be embarked again.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The prince named VIJAYA, the valiant, landed
  in Lanka, in the region called Tambapanni on the day that the Tathagata lay
  down between the two twinlike sala-trees to pass into Nibbana.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the sixth chapter, called 'The
  Coming of Vijaya', in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the serene joy and emotion
  of the pious.</font>
