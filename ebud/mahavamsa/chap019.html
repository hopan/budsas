  </center><center><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">THE COMING OF THE
  BODHI-TREE</font></b></center>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">W</font>HEN the lord of
  chariots had appointed to watch over the Bodhi-tree eighteen persons' from
  royal families and eight from families of ministers, and moreover eight
  persons from brahman families and eight from families of traders and persons
  from the cowherds likewise, and from the hyena and sparrowhawk-clans, (from
  each one man), and also from the weavers and potters and from all the
  handicrafts, from the nagas and the yakkhas; when then the most exalted prince
  had given them eight vessels of gold and eight of silver, and had brought the
  great Bodhi-tree to a ship on the Ganges, and likewise the theri Samghamitta
  with eleven bhikkhunis, and when he had caused those among whom Arittha was
  first to embark on that same ship, he fared forth from the city, and passing
  over the Vinjha-mountains the prince arrived, in just one week, at Tamalitti.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The gods also and the nagas and men who were
  worshipping the great Bodhi-tree with the most splendid offerings, arrived in
  just one week. The ruler of the earth, who had caused the great Bodhi-tree to
  be placed on the shore of the great ocean, worshipped it once more by
  (bestowing upon it) the great kingship.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the wish-fulfiller had consecrated the
  great Bodhitree as a great monarch, he then, on the first day of the bright
  half of the month Maggasira,' commanded that the same noble persons, eight of
  each (of the families) appointed at the foot of the great säla-tree to escort
  the great Bodhitree, should raise up the great Bodhi-tree; and, descending:
  there into the water till it reached his neck, he caused it to be set down in
  seemly wise on the ship. When he had brought the great theri with the (other)
  theris on to the ship he spoke these words to the chief minister Maharittha:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Three times have I worshipped the great
  Bodhi-tree by (bestowing) kingship (upon it). Even so shall the king my friend
  also worship it by (bestowing) kingship (upon it).'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the great king had spoken thus he stood
  with folded hands on the shore, and as he gazed after the vanishing great
  Bodhi-tree he shed tears. 'Sending forth a net like rays of sunshine the great
  Bodhi-tree of the (Buddha) gifted with the ten powers departs, alas! from
  hence!'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Filled with sorrow at parting from the great
  Bodhi-tree Dhammasoka returned weeping and lamenting to his capital.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The ship, laden with the great Bodhi-tree,
  fared forth into the sea. A yojana around the waves of the great ocean were
  stilled. Lotus-flowers of the five colours blossomed all around and manifold
  instruments of music resounded in the air.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">By many devatas many offerings were provided,
  and the nagas practised their magic to win the great Bodhi-tree. The great
  theri Samghamitta, who had reached the last goal of supernormal powers, taking
  the form of a griffin terrified the great snakes. Terrified, the great snakes
  betook them to the great theri with entreaties, and when they had escorted the
  great Bodhi-tree from thence to the realm of the serpents and had worshipped
  it for a week by (bestowing on it) the kingship of the nagas and by manifold
  offerings they brought it again and set it upon the ship. And on that same day
  the great Bodhi-tree arrived here1 at Jambukola.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">King Devanampiyatissa, thoughtful for the
  welfare of the world, having heard before from the samanera Sumana of its
  arrival, did, from the first day of the month Maggasira onwards, being always
  full of zeal, cause the whole of the highroad from the north gate even to
  Jambukola to be made ready, awaiting the arrival of the great Bodhi-tree, and
  abiding on the sea-shore, in the place where the Samuddapannasal (afterwards)
  was, he, by the wondrous power of the then, saw the great Bodhi-tree coming.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The hail that was built upon that spot to make
  known this miracle was known here by the name Samuddapannasala.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">By the power of the great thera and together
  with the (other) theras the king came, with his retinue, on that same day to
  Jambukola.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then, uttering an exulting cry moved by joyous
  agitation at the coming of the great Bodhi-tree, he, the splendid (king),
  descended even neck-deep into the water; and when together with sixteen
  persons (of noble families) he had taken the great Bodhi-tree upon his head,
  had lifted it down upon the shore and caused it to be set in a beautiful
  pavilion, the king of Lañkä worshipped it by (bestowing on it) the kingship
  of Lanka. When he had then entrusted his own government to the sixteen persons
  and he himself had taken the duties of a doorkeeper, the lord of men forthwith
  commanded solemn ceremonies of many kinds to be carried out for three days.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the tenth day he placed the great
  Bodhi-tree upon a beautiful car and he, the king of men, accompanying this,
  the king of trees, he who had knowledge of the (right) places caused it to he
  placed on the spot where the Eastern Monastery (afterwards) was and commanded
  a morning meal for the people together with the brotherhood. Here the great
  them Mahinda related fully to the king the subduing of the nägas which had
  been achieved by the (Buddha) gifted with the ten powers.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the monarch heard this from the them he
  caused monuments to be raised here and there in such places as had been
  frequented by the Master by resting there or in other ways. And, moreover,
  when he had caused the great Bodhitree to be set down at the entrance to the
  village of the brahman Tivakka and in this and that place besides, he,
  (escorting it) on the road, sprinkled with white sand, bestrewn with various
  flowers, and adorned with planted pennons and festoons of blossoms, bringing
  thereto offerings unweariedly, day and night, brought the great Bodhi-tree on
  the fourteenth day to the neighbourhood of the city of Anuradhapura, and
  after, at the time when the shadows increase, he had entered the city worthily
  adorned by the north gate amid offerings, and (when he then), leaving the city
  again by the south gate, had entered the Mahameghavanarama consecrated by four
  Buddhas, and here had brought (the tree) to the spot worthily prepared by
  Sumana's command, to the lovely place where the former Bodhi-trees had stood,
  he, with those sixteen noble persons, who were wearing royal ornaments, lifted
  down the great Bodhi-tree and loosed his hold to set it down.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hardly had he let it leave his hands but it
  rose up eighty cubits into the air, and floating thus it sent forth glorious
  rays of six colours. Spreading over the island, reaching to the Brahma-world,
  these lovely rays lasted till sunset. Ten thousand persons, who were filled
  with faith by reason of this miracle, gaining the spiritual insight and
  attaining to arahantship, received here the pabbajja.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the great Bodhi-tree at sunset was come
  down from (its place in the air) it stood firm on the earth under the
  constellation Rohini. Then did the earth quake. The roots growing over the
  brim of the vase struck down into the earth, closing in the vase. When the
  great Bodhi-tree had taken its place all the people who had come together from
  (the country) round, worshipped it with offerings of perfumes, flowers and so
  forth. A tremendous cloud poured forth rain, and cool and dense mists from the
  snow-region surrounded the great Bodhi-tree on every side. Seven days did the
  great Bodhi-tree abide there, awaking faith among the people invisible in the
  region of the snow. At the end of the week all the clouds vanished and the
  great Bodhi-tree became visible and the rays of six colours.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The great thera Mahinda and the bhikkhuni
  Samghamitta went thither with their following and the king also with his
  following. The nobles of Kajaragama and the nobles of Candanagama and the
  Brabman Tivakka and the people too who dwelt in the island came thither also
  by the power of the gods, (with minds) eagerly set upon a festival of the
  great Bodhi-tree. Amid this great assembly, plunged into amazement by this
  miracle, there grew out of the east branch, even as they gazed, a faultless
  fruit.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This having fallen off the thera took it up
  and gave it to the king to plant. In a golden vase filled with earth mingled
  with perfumes, placed on the spot where the Mahaasana (afterwards) was, the
  ruler planted it. And while they all yet gazed, there grew, springing from it,
  eight shoots; and they stood there, young Bodhi-trees four cubits high.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the king saw the young Bodhi-trees he,
  with senses all amazed, worshipped them by the gift of a white parasol and
  bestowed royal consecration on them.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of the eight Bodhi-saplings one was planted at
  the landingplace Jambukola on the spot where the great Bodhi-tree had stood,
  after leaving the ship, one in the village of the Brahman Tivakka, one
  moreover in the Thuparama, one in the Issarasamanarama, one in the Court of
  the First thüpa, one in the arama of the Cetiya-mountain, one in Kajaragama
  and one in Candanagama. But the other thirty-two Bodhi-saplings which sprang
  from four (later) fruits (were planted) in a circle, at a distance of a
  yojana, here and there in the vihäras.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When thus, for the salvation of the people
  dwelling in the island, by the majesty of the Sammasambuddha, the king of
  trees, the great Bodhi-tree was planted, Anula with her following having
  received the pabbajja from the theri Samghamitta, attained to arahantship. The
  prince Arittha also, with a retinue of five hundred men, having received the
  pabbajja from the thera, attained to arahantship. The eight (persons from the)
  merchant-guilds who had brought the great Bodhi-tree hither were named
  therefrom the 'Guild of the Bodhi-bearers'.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the nunnery, which is known as the
  Upasikavihara the great theri Samghamitta dwelt with her company (of nuns).
  She caused twelve buildings to be erected there, of which three buildings were
  important before others; in one of these great buildings she caused the mast
  of the ship that had come with the great Bodhi-tree to be set up, in one the
  rudder, and in one the helm, from these they were named. Also when other sects
  arose these twelve buildings were always used by the Hatthalhaka-bhikkhunis.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The king's state-elephant that was used to
  wander about at will liked to stay on one side of the city in a cool grotto,
  on the border of a Kadamba-flower-thicket, when he went to feed. Since they
  knew that this place was pleasing to the elephant they put up a post in the
  same spot. One day the elephant would not take the fodder (offered to him) and
  the king questioned the thera who had converted the island as to the reason.
  'The elephant would fain have a thupa built in the Kandamba flower-thicket,
  'the great thera told the great king. Swiftly did the king, who was ever
  intent on the welfare of his people, build a thupa, with a relic, in that very
  place and a house for the thupa.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The great theii Samghamitta, who longed for a
  quiet dwelling-place, because of the too great crowding of the vihara where
  she dwelt, she who was mindful for the progress of the doctrine and the good
  of the bhikkhunis, the wise one who desired another abode for the bhikkhunis
  went (once) to the fair cetiya-house, pleasant by its remoteness, and there
  she the skilled (in choice) of dwelling-places, the blameless, stayed the day
  through.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the king came to the convent for
  bhikkhunis to salute the theri he, hearing that she had gone thither, went
  also and when he had greeted her there and talked with her and had heard the
  wish that was the cause of her going thither, then did he, who was skilled in
  (perceiving) the desires (of others), the wise, the great monarch Devanampiya
  tissa, order to be erected a pleasing convent for the bhikkhunis round about
  the thüpa-house. Since the convent for the bhikkhunis was built near to the
  elephant-post therefore was it known by the name Hatthalhaka-vihara.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The well-beloved, the great theri Samghamitta
  of lofty wisdom now took up her abode in this pleasing convent for bhikkhunis.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Bringing about in such wise the good of the
  dwellers in Lañkä, the progress of the doctrine, the king of trees, the
  great Bodhi-tree, lasted long time on the island of Lanka, in the pleasant
  Mahamegha-grove, endowed with many wondrous powers.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the nineteenth chapter, called 'The
  Coming of the Bodhi-tree', in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the serene joy and
  emotion of the pious.</font>
