  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A21"></a> <font size="6">A</font>FTER
  his death, MAHACULI MAHA TISSA reigned fourteen years with piety and justice.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since he heard that a gift brought about by
  the work of a man's own hand is full of merit, the king, in the very first
  year (of his reign), went in disguise and laboured in the riceharvest, and
  with the wage that he received for this he gave food as alms to the thera
  Mahasumma. When the king had laboured also in Sonagiri three years in a
  sugar-mill, and had received lumps of sugar as wage for this, he took the
  lumps of sugar, and being returned to the capital he, the ruler of the earth,
  appointed great almsgiving to the brotherhood of bhikkhus. He bestowed
  clothing on thirty thousand bhikkhus and the same on twelve thousand
  bhikkhunis.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the protector of the earth had built a
  well-planned vihara, he gave the six garments to sixty thousand bhikkhus and
  to bHikkhunis likewise, in number thirty thousand. The same king built the
  Mandavapi-vihara, the Abhayagallaka (vihara), the (vihäras) Vankavattakagalla
  and Dighabahugallaka and the Jalagama-vihara.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the king (inspired) by faith had done
  works of merit in many ways he passed into heaven, at the end of the fourteen
  years.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A22"></a> VATTA GAMANI's son known as
  CORANAGA lived as a rebel under the rule of Mahacula. When MAHACULI had
  departed: he came and reigned. Those places, where he had found no refuge
  during the time of his rebellion, eighteen vihäras, did this fool destroy.
  Twelve years did Coranaga reign. And eating poisoned (food) that his consort
  gave him the evildoer died and was reborn in the Lokantarika-hell.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A23"></a> After his death king
  MAHACULI's son ruled three years as king, being known by name TISSA. But
  Coranaga's spouse, the infamous Anulä, had done her infamous (consort) to
  death, giving him poison, because she was enamoured of one of the
  palace-guards. And for love of this same palace-guard Anulä now killed TISSA
  also by poison and gave the government into the hands of that other.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A24"></a> When the palace-guard,
  whose name was SIVA, and who (had been) the first of the gate-watchmen, had
  made ANULA his queen he reigned a year and two months in the city; but Anulä,
  who was enamoured of the<a name="A25"></a> Damila VATUKA, did him to death
  with poison and gave the reign to VATUKA. The Damila VATUKA, who had been a
  city-carpenter in the capital, made ANULA his queen and then reigned a year
  and two months in the city.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But when ANULA (one day) saw a wood-carrier,
  who had come to the house, she fell in love with him, and when she had killed
  VATUKA with poison she gave the government into his hands.<a name="A26"></a>
  DARU BHATIKA TISSA, the wood-carrier, when he had made ANULA his queen, ruled
  one year and one month in the city. In haste he had a bathing-tank made in the
  Mahameghavana. But ANULA, enslaved by passion for a Damila named NILIYA, a
  brahman who was the palace-priest, and eager to be united with him, did Tissa
  the wood-carrier to death giving him poison and gave the government into
  (NILIYA's) hands.<a name="A27"></a> And the brahman NILIYA also made her his
  queen and resigned, upheld constantly by her, six months here in Anuradhapura.
  When the princess ANULA (who desired to take her pleasure even as she listed
  with thirty-two of the palace-guards) had <a name="A28"></a>put to death
  NILIYA also with poison, the queen ANULA herself, reigned four months.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="34"></a><a name="A29"></a> But king
  MAHACULI's second son, named KUTAKANNA TISSA, who had fled from fear of ANULA
  and had taken the pabbajja returned hither when, in time, he had gathered an
  army together, and when he had slain the wicked ANULA he, the ruler of men,
  reigned twenty-two years. He built upon the Cetiya-mountain a great building
  for the uposatha festival and to the east of this building he raised a thupa
  of stone, and in that same place on the Cetiya-mountain he planted a
  bodhi-tree.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the region between the rivers he founded
  the Pelagamavihara and in the same place (he made) a great canal called
  Vannaka and the great Ambadugga-tank and the Bhayoluppala, and moreover (he
  made) around the city a wall seven cubits high and a trench. When he had
  burned the licentious ANULA in the palace (upon the funeral pyre), he,
  withdrawing a little (distance) from thence, built a new palace. In the city
  itself he laid out the Padumassara-park. His mother entered the order of the
  doctrine of the Conqueror when she had just cleansed her teeth. On a plot for
  building belonging to his family he founded a nunnery for his mother and this
  was therefore known by name Dantageha.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A30"></a> After his death his son,
  the prince named BHATIKABHAYA, reigned twenty-eight years. Since he, the pious
  ruler of the earth, was the brother of king MAHADATHIKA he was known on the
  island by the name Bhatikaraja, Here did he carry out the work of repairing
  the Lohapasada and built two vedikas for the Mahathupa, and the (hail) called
  the Uposatha (hall) in the (vihära) named after the thüpa.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And doing away with the tax appointed for
  himself he planted sumana and ujjuka-flowers over a yojana of land round the
  city. And when the king had commanded that the Great Cetiya, from the vedika
  at the foot to the parasol at the top, be plastered with (a paste of)
  sweet-smelling unguent four fingers thick and that flowers be carefully
  embedded therein by their stalks, he made the thupa even as a globe of
  flowers. Another time he commanded them to plaster the cetiya with (a paste
  of) minium eight fingers thick, and thus he changed it into a heap of flowers.
  Yet another time he commanded that the cetiya be strewn with flowers from the
  steps to the parasol on the top, and thus he covered it over with a mass of
  blossoms. Then when he had raised water by means of machines from the
  Abhaya-tank he, by pouring (masses of) water over the thupa, carried out a
  wateroffering. From a hundred waggon-loads of pearls, he, bidding that the
  mass of plaster be carefully kneaded together with oil, made a
  plaster-covering (for the Great Thupa). He had a net of coral prepared and
  cast over the cetiya, and when he had commanded them to fasten in the meshes
  thereof lotus-flowers of gold large as waggon-wheels, and to hang clusters of
  pearls on these that reached to the lotus-flower beneath, he worshipped the
  Great Thupa with this offering.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he heard one day in the relic-chamber the
  sound of the arahants chanting in chorus he made the resolve: 'I will not rise
  up till I have seen it,' and fasting he lay down at the foot of the
  stone-pillar on the east side. The theras created a door for him and brought
  him into the relic-chamber. When the ruler of the earth had beheld all the
  adornment of the relic-chamber he went forth and made an offering of figures
  modelled with clay in close likeness to those (within).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">With honeycombs, with perfumes, with vases
  (filled with flowers), and with essences, with anti-pigment (prepared) as
  unguent and minium; with lotus-flowers arrayed in minium that lay ankle-deep
  in the courtyard of the cetiya, where they had poured it molten; with
  lotus-flowers that were fastened in the holes of mattings, spread on fragrant
  earth, wherewith tbe whole courtyard of the cetiya was filled; with many
  lighted lamps, prepared with wicks made of strips of stuff in clarified
  butter, which had likewise been poured (into the courtyard) when the ways for
  the outflow had been closed up; and in like manner with many lamps with
  stuff-wicks in madhuka-oil and sesamum-oil besides; with these things, as they
  were named, the prince commanded severally with each seven times offerings for
  the Great Thupa.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And moreover, urged by faith, he ordered year
  by year perpetually a great festival (for the renewing) of the plasterwork;
  and festivals also of the great Bodhi-tree (in honour) of the watering of the
  Bodhi-tree, and furthermore twentyeight great Vesakha-festivals and
  eighty-four thousand lesser festivals, and also divers mimic dances and
  concerts, with the playing of all kinds of instruments of music (in honour) of
  the Great Thüpa. Three times a day he went to do homage to the Buddha and he
  commanded (them to give) twice (a day) continually (the offering known as) the
  'flower-drum '.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And he continually gave alms at the preaching
  and alms at the pavarana-ceremony, and (distributed) also, in abundance, the
  things needed for the ascetic, such as oil, molasses, garments and so forth
  among the brotherhood. Moreover, the prince bestowed everywhere land for the
  cetiya, to the end that the cetiyas might be kept in repair. And constantly
  the king bestowed food (as alms allotted) by tickets to a thousand bhikkhus in
  the vihara (of the) Cetiya-pabbata. At five spots, namely, the three receiving
  -places, called Citta, Maui, and Mucala, as also in the Paduma-house and the
  beautiful Chattapasada, offering hospitality to the bhikkhus who were
  harnessed to the yoke of the sacred word he provided them always with all that
  was needful, being filled with reverence for the religion. Moreover, all those
  works of merit which had been ordered by the kings of old regarding the
  doctrine, all these did king Bhatika carry out.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A31"></a> After the death of
  Bhatikaraja his younger brother named MAHADATHIKA MAHA NAGA reigned twelve
  years, intent on works of merit of many kinds. Hehad kincikkha-stones laid as
  plaster on (the square of) the Great Thüpa and he turned the sand-pathway
  round (the thupa) into a wide court; in all the viharas he had (raised) chairs
  put up for the preachers.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The king built the great Ambatthala-thupa;
  since the building was not firm he lay down in that place, bethinking him of
  the merit of the Sage (Buddha), risking his own life. When he had thus made
  the building firm and had completed the cetiya he set up at the four entrances
  four bejewelled arches that had been well planned by artists and shone with
  gems of every kind. To be fastened to the cetiya he spent a cover (for it) of
  red stuff and golden balls thereto and festoons of pearls.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he had made ready around the
  Cetiya-mountain a (tract of land measuring a) yojana, and had made four
  gateways and a beautiful road round about (the mountain), and when he had then
  set up (traders') shops on both sides of the road and had adorned (the road)
  here and there with flags, arches, and triumphal gates, and had illuminated
  all with chains of lamps, he commanded mimic dances, songs, and music. That
  the people might go with clean feet on the road from the Kadamba-river to the
  Cetiya-mountain he bad it laid with carpets the gods themselves might hold a
  festival assembly' there with dance and music and lie gave great largess at
  the four gates of the capital. Over the whole island he put up chains of lamps
  without a break, nay over the waters of the ocean within a distance of a
  yojana around. At the festival of (consecrating of) the cetiya these beautiful
  offerings were appointed by him: the splendid feast is called here (in the
  country) the great Giribhanda-offering.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the lord of the earth had commanded
  almsgiving in eight places to the bhikkhus who were come together in the
  festal assembly, lie, with the beating of eight golden drums that were set up
  even there, allotted lavish gifts to twenty-four thousand (bhikkhus). He
  distributed the six garments, commanded the remission of the prison-penalties
  and he ordered the barbers to carry on their trade continually at the four
  gates. Moreover, all those works of merit that had been decreed by the kings
  of old and that had also been decreed by big brother, those did he carry out
  without neglecting anything. He gave himself and the queen, his two sons, his
  state-elephant and his state horse to the brotherhood as their own, albeit the
  brotherhood forbade him.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To the brotherhood of the bhikkhus he gave
  gifts worth six hundred thousand, but to the company of bhikkhunis (such
  gifts) worth a hundred thousand, and in giving them, with knowledge of the
  custom, various possessions suited (to their needs) he redeemed (again)
  himself and the rest from the brotherhood. In Kalayanakannika the ruler of men
  built the (vihara) called Maninagapabbata and the vihara which was called
  Kalanda, furthermore on the bank of the Kubukandariver the Samudda-vihara and
  in Huvacakannika the vihära that bore the name Culanagapabbata. Delighted
  with the service rendered him in the vihãra that he himself had built, called
  Pasana-dipaka, by a samanera who had given him a draught of water, the king
  bestowed on that vihara (a tract of land) in measure half a yojana round
  about, for the use of the brotherhood. And rejoicing likewise at (the
  behaviour of) a samanera in the Mahadavapi-vihara the prince gave land for the
  use of the brotherhood to this vihara.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus men of good understanding, who have
  conquered pride and indolence, and have freed themselves from the attachment
  to lust, when they have attained to great power, without working harm to the
  people, delighting in deeds of merit, rejoicing in faith, do many and various
  pious works.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the thirty-fourth chapter, called
  'The Eleven Kings', in the Mahavamsa compiled for the serene joy and emotion
  of the pious.</font>
