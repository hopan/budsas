  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">H</font>AVING made obeisance to
  the Sambuddha the pure, sprung of a pure race, I will recite the Mahãvamsa,
  of varied content and lacking nothing. That (Mahävamsa) which was compiled by
  the ancient (sages) was here too long drawn out and there too closely knit;
  and contained many repetitions. Attend ye now to this (Mahavamsa) that is free
  from such faults, easy to understand and remember, arousing serene joy and
  emotion and handed down (to us) by tradition, (attend ye to it) while that ye
  call up serenejoy and emotion (in you) 'at passages that awaken serene joy and
  emotion.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">On seeing the Sambuddha Dipamkara, in olden
  times, our Conqueror resolved to become a Buddha, that he might release the
  world from evil. When he had offered homage to that Sambuddha and likewise to
  Kondanna and to the sage Mangala, to Sumana, to the Buddha Revata and likewise
  to the great sage Sobhita, to the Sambuddha Anomadassi, to Paduma and to the
  Conqueror Narada, to the Sambuddha Padumuttara and to the Tathagata Sumedha,
  and to Sujata, to Piyadassi and to the Master Atthadassi, to Dhammadassi and
  Siddhattha, to Tissa and the Conqueror Phussa, to Vipassi and the Sambuddha
  Sikhi, and the Sambuddha Vessabhu, the mighty one, to the Sambuddha</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kakusaudha, and likewise to Konagamana, as
  also to the blessed Kassapa, having offered homage to these twenty-four
  Sambuddhas and having received from them the prophecy of his (future)
  buddhahood he, the great hero, when he had fulfilled all perfections-' and
  reached the highest enlightenment, the sublime Buddha Gotama, delivered the
  world from suffering.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At Uruvelä, in the Magadha country, the great
  sage, sitting at the foot of the Bodhi-tree, reached the supreme enlightenment
  on the full-moon day of the month Vesäkha. Seven weeks he tarried there,
  mastering his senses, while that be himself, knew the high bliss of
  deliverance and let (others) behold its felicity. Then he went to Baranasi and
  set rolling the wheel of the law; and while he dwelt there through the
  rain-months, he brought sixty (hearers) to arahantship. When he had sent forth
  these bhikkhus to preach the doctrine, and when he had converted the thirty
  companions of the company of Bhadda' then did the Master dwell at Uruvela the
  winter through, for the sake of converting the thousand jatilas led by
  Kassapa, making them ripe (for deliverance).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now since a great sacrifice by Kassapa of
  Uruvela was near at hand, and since he saw that this latter would fain have
  him away, he, the victorious over enemies, went to seek alms among the
  Northern Kurus ; and when he had eaten his meal at evening time near the lake
  Anotatta, the Conqueror, in the ninth month of his buddhahood, at the full
  moon of Phussa, himself set forth for the isle of Lañkä, to win Lanka for
  the faith. For Lanka was known to the Conqueror as a place where his doctrine
  should (thereafter) shine in glory; and (he knew that) from Lañkä, filled
  with the yakkhas, the yakkhas must (first) be driven forth.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And he knew also that in the midst of Lañka,
  on the fair river bank, in the delightful Mahanaga garden, three yojanas long
  and a yojana wide, the (customary) meeting-place for the yakkhas, there was a
  great gathering of (all) the yakkhas dwelling in the island. To this great
  gathering of that yakkhas went the Blessed One, and there, in the midst of
  that assembly, hovering in the air over their heads, at the place of the
  (future) Mahiyangana-thupa, he struck terror to their hearts by rain, storm,
  darkness and so forth.' The yakkhas, overwhelmed by fear, besought the
  fearless Van quisher to release them from terrors, and the Vanquisher,
  destroyer of fear, spoke thus to the terrified yakkhas: 'I will banish this
  your fear and your distress, O yakkhas, give ye here to me with one accord a
  place where I may sit down.'The yakkhas thus answered the Blessed One: 'We
  all, O Lord, give you even the whole of our island. Give us release from our
  fear.' Then, when he had destroyed their terror, cold and darkness, and had
  spread his rug of skin on the ground that they bestowed on him, the Conqueror,
  sitting there, made the rug to spread wide, while burning flame surrounded it.
  Daunted by the burning heat thereof and terrified, they stood around on the
  border. Then did the Saviour cause the pleasant Giridipa to come here near to
  them, and when they had settled there, he made it return to its former place.
  Then did the Saviour fold his rug of skin; the devas assembled, and in their
  assembly the Master preached them the doctrine. The conversion of many kotis
  of living beings took place, and countless were those who came unto the
  (three) refuges and the precepts of duty.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The prince of devas, Mahäsumana of the
  Sumanaküta mountain,' who had attained to the fruit of entering into the path
  of salvation, craved of him who should be worshipped, something to worship.
  The Conqueror, the (giver of) good to living beings, he who had pure and
  blue-black locks, passing his hand over his (own) head, bestowed on him a
  handful of hairs. And he, receiving this in a splendid golden urn, when he had
  laid the hairs upon a heap of many-coloured gems, seven cubits round, piled up
  at the place where the Master had sat, covered them over with a thupa of
  sapphire and worshipped them.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the Sambuddha had died, the thera named
  Sarabhu, disciple of the thera Sariputta, by his miraculous power received,
  even from the funeral pyre, the collar-bone of the Conqueror and brought it
  hither (to Lañka), and, with the bhikkhus all around him, he there laid it in
  that same cetiya, covered it over with golden-coloured stones, and (then he),
  the worker of miracles, having made the thupa twelve cubits high, departed
  again from thence. The son of king Devanampiyatissa's brother, named
  Uddhaculabhaya saw the wondrous cetiya and (again) covered it over and made it
  thirty cubits high. The king Dutthaga mani dwelling there while he made war
  upon the Damilas, built a mantle cetiya over it eighty cubits high. Thus was
  the Mahiyangana-thupa completed. When he had thus made our island a fit
  dwelling-place for men, the mighty ruler, valiant as are great heroes,
  departed for Uruvela.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the Visit to Mahiyangana.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now the most compassionate Teacher, the
  Conqueror, rejoicing in the salvation of the whole world, when dwellingat
  Jetavana in the fifth year of his buddhahood, saw that a war, caused by a
  gem-set throne, was like to come to pass between the niigas Mahodara and
  Cülodara, uncle and nephew, and their followers; and he, the Sambuddha, on
  the uposathaday of the dark half of the month Citta, in the early morning,
  took his sacred alms-bowl and his robes, and, from compassion for the nagas,
  sought the Nagadipa.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">That same naga Mahodara was then a king,
  gifted with miraculous power, in a naga-kingdom in the ocean, that covered
  half a thousand yojanas. His younger sister had been given (in marriage) to
  the naga-king on the Kannavaddhamana mountain; her son was Culodara. His
  mother's father had given to his mother a splendid throne of jewels, then the
  naga had died and therefore this war of nephew with uncle was threatening; and
  also the nagas of the mountains were armed with miraculous power.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The deva named Samiddhisumana took a
  rajayatana-tree standing in Jetavana, his own fair habitation, and, holding it
  like a parasol over the Conqueror, he, with the Teacher's leave, attended him
  to that spot where he had formerly dwelt. That very deva had been, in his
  latest birth, a man in Nagadipa. On the spot where thereafter the
  rajayatana-tree stood, he saw paceekabuddhas taking their meal. And at the
  sight his heart was glad and he offered branches to cleanse the almsbowl.
  Therefore he was reborn in that tree in the pleasant Jetavana-garden, and it
  (the tree) stood afterwards outside at the side of the gate-rampart. The God
  of all gods saw (in this) an advantage for that deva, and, for the sake of the
  good which should spring (therefrom) for our land, he brought him hithcr (to
  Lafika) together with his tree.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hovering there in mid-air above the
  battlefield the Master, who drives away (spiritual) darkness, called forth
  dread darkness over the ntigas. Then comforting those who were distressed by
  terror he once again spread light abroad. When they saw the Blessed One they
  joyfully did reverence to the Master's feet. Then preadied the Vanquisher to
  them the doctrine that begets concord, and both [nagas] gladly gave up the
  throne to the Sage.' When the Master, having alighted on the earth, had taken
  his place on a seat there, and had been refreshed with celestial food and
  drink by the naga-kings, he, the Lord, established in the (three) refuges and
  in the moral precepts eighty kotis of snake-spirits, dwellers in the ocean and
  on the mainland.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The naga-king Maniakkhika of Kalyani, mother's
  brother to the naga Mahodara, who had come thither to take part in the battle,
  and who, aforetime, at the Buddha's first coming, having heard the true
  doctrine preached, had become established in the refuges and in the moral
  duties, prayed now to the Tathagata: 'Great is the compassion that thou hast
  shown us here, O Master! Hadst thou not appeared we had all been consumed to
  ashes. May thy compassion yet light also especially on me, O thou who art rich
  in loving-kindness, in that thou shalt come yet again hither to my
  dwelling-country, O thou peerless one.' When the Lord had consented by his
  silence to come thither, he planted the rajayatana-tree on that very spot as a
  sacred memorial, and the Lord of the Worlds gave over the rajayatana-tree and
  the precious throne-seat to the naga-kings to do homage thereto. 'In
  remembrance that I have used these do homage to them, ye naga-kings!</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This, well beloved, will bring to pass
  blessing and happiness for you.' When the Blessed One had uttered this and
  other exhortation to the nägas, he, the compassionate saviour of all the
  world, returned to Jetavana.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the Visit to Nagadipa.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the third year after this, the naga-king
  Maniakkhika sought out the Saipbuddha and invited him, together with the
  brotherhood. In the eighth year after he had attained to buddhahood, when the
  Vanquisher was dwelling in Jetavana, the Master, set forth surrounded by five
  hundred bhikkhus, on the second day of the beautiful month of Vesäkha, at the
  fullmoon, and when the hour of the meal was announced the Vanquisher, prince
  of the wise, forthwith putting on his robe and taking his alms-bowl went to
  the Kalyani country, the habitation of Maniakkhika. Under a canopy decked with
  gems, raised upon the spot where (afterwards) the Kalyani cetiya was built, he
  took his place, together with the brotherhood of bhikkhus, upon a precious
  throne-seat. And, greatly rejoicing, the naga-king with his following served
  celestial food, both hard and soft, to the king of truth, the Conqueror, with
  his followers.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the Teacher, compassionate to the whole
  world, had preached the doctrine there, he rose, the Master, and left the
  traces of his footsteps plain to sight on Sumanakuta And after he had spent
  the day as it pleased him at the foot of this mountain, with the brotherhood,
  be set forth for Dighavapi. And there the Master seated himself with the
  brotherhood at the place where the cetiya (thereafter) stood, and gave himself
  up to meditation, to consecrate the spot Then arose the Great Sage from that
  place, and knowing well which places were fit and which unfit he went to the
  place of the (later) Mahamegha vanarama. After he had seated himself with his
  disciples at the place, where the sacred Bodhi-tree came afterwards to be, the
  Master gave himself up to meditation; and likewise there where the Great
  Thüpa' stood (in later days) and there also where (afterwards) the thupa in
  the Thuparama stood. Then when he rose up from meditation he went to the place
  of the (later) Silacetiya, and after the Leader of the assembly (of bhikkhus)
  had uttered exhortation to the assembly of devas, he, the Enlightened, who has
  trodden all the paths of enlightenment, returned thence to Jetavana.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus the Master of boundless wisdom, looking
  to the salvation of Lanka in time to come, and knowing in that time the
  highest good for the hosts of asuras and nagas and so forth in Lanka visited
  this fair island three times, be, the compassionate Enlightener of the world ;
  therefore this isle, radiant with the light of truth, came to high honour
  among faithful believers.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the Visit to Kalyani</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the first chapter, called 'The Visit
  of the Tathagata', in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the serene joy and emotion
  of the pious.</font>
