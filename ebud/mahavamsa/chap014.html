  CAPITAL</font></b></center>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>HE king
  Devanampiyatissa who had arranged a waterfestival for the dwellers in the
  capital, set forth to enjoy the pleasures of the chase. Attended by forty
  thousand of his men he went on foot to the Missaka-mountain. The deva of the
  mountain who desired to show the theras to him, appeared there in the form of
  an elk-stag browsing in the thicket. When the king saw him, he thought: 'It is
  unseemly to kill an unheeding (creature)' and he struck out a sound from his
  bowstring; the stag fled towards the mountain. The king pursued, but the stag
  in his flight drew near to the thera. When the thera came into the prince's
  view the (deva) himself vanished.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thinking: 'If he sees too many (people) he
  will be too much afraid,' the thera let (the king) see him alone. When the
  king beheld him he stood still terrified. The thera said to him: 'Come hither,
  Tissa.' Then, from the calling him by his name, Tissa, the king thought
  forthwith: '(That is) a yakkha. 'Samanas are we, O great king, disciples of
  the King of Truth. From compassion toward thee are we come hither from
  Jambudipa,' thus said the thera. When the king heard this fear left him. And
  remembering the message of his friend, and persuaded that these were samanas,
  he laid bow and arrow aside and approaching the sage he exchanged greeting
  with the thera and sat down near him.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then came his people and surrounded him and
  the great thera caused the others who had come with him to become visible.
  When the king beheld these too he said: 'When did these come hither?' The
  thera answered: '(They came) with me.' And he asked moreover: 'Are there in
  Jambudipa other ascetics like to these?' The other said: 'Jambudipa is
  gleaming with yellow robes; and great is the number there of arahants learned
  in the three vedas, gifted with miraculous powers, skilled in reading the
  thoughts of others, possessing the heavenly ear: the disciples of the Buddha.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">(The king) then asked: 'By what way are you
  come?' And since the answer was: 'Neither by land nor by water are we come,'
  he understood that they had come through the air.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To test him that most wise (thera) now asked a
  subtle question, and even as he was questioned the monarch answered the
  questions severally.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'What name does this tree bear, O king?'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'This tree is called a mango.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Is there yet another mango beside this?'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'There are many mango-trees.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'And are there yet other trees besides this
  mango and the other mangoes?'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'There are many trees, sir; but those are
  trees that are not mangoes.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'And are there, beside the other mangoes and
  those trees which are not mangoes, yet other trees?'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'There is this mango-tree, sir.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Thou hast a shrewd wit, O ruler of men!'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Hast thou kinsfolk, O king?'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'They are many, sir.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'And are there also some, O king, who are not
  kinsfolk of thine?'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'There are yet more of those than of my kin.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Is there yet any one besides the kinsfolk and
  the others?'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'There is yet myself, sir.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Good! thou hast a shrewd wit, O ruler of
  men!'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he had known that he was a keen-witted
  man, the wise thera preached to the monarch the Cülahatthipadüpamasuttanta.
  At the end of the discourse he, with the forty thousand men, came unto the
  (three) refuges.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the evening they brought the king's meal to
  him. Although the king knew that these (bhikkhns) would not eat then he
  invited the sages to the meal, with the thought: 'It were seemly at least to
  ask them.' When they told him:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'We do not eat now,' he asked concerning the
  time. And when he was told the time, he said: 'We will go into the city.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Go thou, great king, we will stair here.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'If that be so, then must this young man come
  with 'us.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'This (youth) is one who has attained the
  goal, has grasped the doctrine and waits for the pabbajja, (therefore) must he
  abide near us. We wish to bestow on him the pabbajja now; depart then, O
  king.' Then, when he had taken leave of the theras with the words: 'To-morrow
  I will send a waggon, do you enter it and conic into the city,' he took Bhandu
  aside and asked him what the theras intended (to do). And he told the king
  all. When (the king) heard the thera's name he was full of joy and thought:
  'This is blessing for me.' And now the king, whose fear had left him because
  Bhandu was a layman, knew that these were human beings. Saying:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Let us bestow on him the pabbajja,' the thera
  bestowed on young Bhanduka, within the boundaries of that village and within
  that group (of bhikkhus), both the pabbajja and the upasampada-ordination, and
  even in the same moment he attained to the state of arahant.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the thera ordered the samanera Sumana:
  'Announce ye the time of preaching the dhamma.' He asked: 'How far, sir, shall
  I make the time to be heard when I announce it?' When the thera answered:
  'Over all Tambapanni,' he announced the time of (preaching the) dhamma, making
  it to be heard, by his miraculous power, over the whole of Lanka.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the king, who was seated by the
  rock-basin at the Nagacutakka and was taking his repast, heard, the loud
  summons, he sent a message to the thera asking: 'Has any misfortune come to
  pass?' He answered: 'No misfortune has come to pass; the time was proclaimed
  for hearing the word of the Sarnbuddha.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the earth-gods heard the summons of the
  sämanera they echoed it and so the call rose up gradually to Brahma's heaven.
  Because of the summons there came together a great assembly of devas; and the
  thera preached before this gathering the Samacitta-sutta.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Devas without number were converted to the
  doctrine and many nägas and supanas came unto the (three) refuges. Even as
  when the thera Sariputta uttered this discourse so did the devas gather
  together to hear it from Mahinda.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the morrow the king sent a waggon. The
  driver came and said: 'Mount into the waggon, we will drive to the city.' 'We
  will not mount into the waggon; go thou, we will follow thee.' Saying this
  they, full of holy desires, sent the driver away; and they rose into the air
  and by their miraculous power they descended to the east of the city in the
  place where the first thüpa (afterwards stood). And thenceforward to this day
  the cetiya that was built on the spot where the theras first alighted 1 is
  called the Pathamacetiya.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since the women of the royal household,
  hearing from the king of the virtues of the theras, desired to see them, the
  monarch had a lovely pavilion built for them within the royal precincts,
  covered with white stuffs and with flowers and beautifully adorned.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And since he had heard from the thera that
  they would not sit upon raised seats, he pondered doubtfully: 'Will the thera
  indeed sit upon a raised seat?' In the meantime the driver saw the theras
  standing there putting on their robes and in wonderment he came and told the
  king. Hearing all (this) it became clear to the king that they would not sit
  on chairs. And commanding: 'Let the finest carpets be spread upon the ground,'
  he went to meet the theras, greeted them reverently, took the almsbowl from
  the great thera Mahinda's hand and led the thera into the city, as is the
  custom in hospitable welcome and homage.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And the soothsayers, when they saw the seats
  prepared, foretold: 'The earth is occupied by these (bhikkhus); they will be
  lords upon the island.' Showing them honour the king led the theras into the
  palace. There, according to their rank, they took their seat on chairs covered
  with stuffs. The king himself served them with rice-soup and with foods hard
  and soft. And when the meal was finished, he himself sat down at their feet
  and sent for Anulä, the consort of his younger brother, the sub-king
  Mahanaga, who dwelt in the royal palace. When the queen Anulä had come with
  five hundred women and had bowed down and made offerings to the theras, she
  stepped to one side. The thera preached the Petavatthu, the Vimänavatthu and
  the Sacca-samyutta. The women attained to the first stage of sanctification.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And many people from the city, hearing from
  persons who had seen them the day before, of the virtues of the theras, came
  together desirous to see the theras and made a great stir at the palace-gates.
  When the king heard that and had been told, on asking, (why it was so,) he
  said, thoughtful for their welfare: 'Here there is not enough space for all
  these men; let them cleanse the hail of the state-elephant, there shall the
  townspeople be able to look upon the theras. When they had cleansed the
  elephant's hall, and had adorned it speedily with canopies and so forth, they
  prepared seats there (for the theras), according to their rank. The great
  thera went thither with the (other) theras and when he had taken his seat, he,
  the eminent preacher, preached the Devadüta-suttanta. When the townspeople,
  who were come together, heard it, they were filled with faith and a thousand
  persons among them attained to the first stage of salvation.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When thus in the isle of Lanka the peerless
  thera, like unto the Master in the protection of Lanka, had preached the true
  doctrine in two places, in the speech of the island, he, the light of the
  island, thus brought to pass the descent of the true faith.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the fourteenth chapter, called 'The
  Entry into the Capital', in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the serene joy and
  emotion of the pious.</font>
