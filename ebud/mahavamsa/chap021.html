  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A8"></a> <font size="6">U</font>TTIYA's
  younger brother, MAHASIVA, reigned after his death ten years, protecting the
  pious. Being devoted to the thera Bhaddasäla, he built the noble vihara,
  Nagarangana, in the eastern quarter (of the city).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A9"></a> Mahäsiva's younger brother,
  SURATISSA, reigned after his death ten years, zealously mindful of meritorious
  works. In the southern quarter (of the city) he founded the
  Nagarangana-vihara, in the eastern quarter the vibära (called) Hatthikkhandha
  and the Gonnagirika (vihara) on the Vangutrara-mountain the (vihära) named
  Pacinapabbata and near Raheraka the (vihära) Kolambahalaka; at the foot of
  the Arittha(mountain) the Makulaka(vihära), to the east the
  Acchagallaka(vihara), but the Girinelavahanaka(vihara) to the north of
  Kandanagara; these and other pleasing viharas, in number five hundred, did the
  lord of the earth build on this and the further bank of the river, here and
  there in the island of Lanka, before and while he reigned, during the period
  of sixty years, piously and justly, devoted to the three gems.
  Suvannapindatissa was his name before his reign, but he was named Süratissa
  after the beginning of the reign.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="6"></a><a name="A10"></a> Two
  Damilas, SENA and GUTTIKA, sons of a freighter who brought horses hither,'
  conquered the king Süratissa, at the head of a great army and reigned both
  (together) twenty-two years justly.<a name="7"></a><a name="A11"></a> But when
  ASELA had overpowered them, the son of Mutasiva, the ninth among his brothers,
  born of the same mother, he ruled for ten years onward from that time in
  Anuradhapura</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="8"></a><a name="A12"></a> A Damila of
  noble descent, named ELARA, who came hither from the Chola-country to seize on
  the kingdom, ruled when he had overpowered king ASELA, forty-four years, with
  even justice toward friend and foe, on occasions of disputes at law.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the head of his bed he had a bell hung up
  with a long rope so that those who desired a judgement at law might ring it.
  The king had only one son and one daughter. When once the son of the ruler was
  going in a car to the Tissa-tank, he killed unintentionally a young calf lying
  on the road with the mother cow, by driving the wheel over its neck. The cow
  came and dragged at the bell in bitterness of heart; and the king caused his
  son's head to be severed (from his body) with that same wheel.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A snake had devoured the young of a bird upon
  a palmtree. The hen-bird, mother of the young one, came and rang the bell. The
  king caused the snake to be brought to him, and when its body had been cut
  open and the young bird taken out of it he caused it to be hung up upon the
  tree.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the king, who was a protector of
  tradition, albeit he knew not the peerless virtues of the most precious of the
  three gems, was going (once) to the Cetiya-mountain to invite the brotherhood
  of bhikkhus, he caused, as he arrived upon a car, with the point of the yoke
  on the waggon, an injury to the thüpa of the Conqueror at a (certain) spot.
  The ministers said to him: 'King, the thüpa has been injured by thee.' Though
  this had come to pass without his intending it, yet the king leaped from his
  car and flung himself down upon the road with the words: 'Sever my head also
  (from the trunk) with the wheel.' They answered him: 'Injury to another does
  our Master in no wise allow; make thy peace (with the bhikkhus) by restoring
  the thupa'; and in order to place (anew) the fifteen stones that had been
  broken off he spent just fifteen thousand kahapanas.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">An old woman had spread out some rice to dry
  it in the sun. The heavens, pouring down rain at an unwonted season, made her
  rice damp. She took the rice and went and dragged at the bell. When he heard
  about the rain at an unwonted season he dismissed the woman, and in order to
  decide her cause he underwent a fast, thinking: 'A king who observes justice
  surely obtains rain in due season.' The guardian genius who received offerings
  from him, overpowered by the fiery heat of (the penances of) the king, went
  and told the four great kings of this (matter). They took him with them and
  went and told Sakka. Sakka summoned Pajjunna and charged him (to send) rain in
  due season. The guardian genius who received his offerings told the king. From
  thenceforth the heavens rained no more during the day throughout his realm;
  only by night did the heavens give rain once every week, in the middle watch
  of the night; and even the little cisterns everywhere were full (of water).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Only because he freed himself from the guilt
  of walking in the path of evil did this (monarch), though he had not put aside
  false beliefs, gain such miraculous power; how should not then an
  understanding man, established in pure belief, renounce here the guilt of
  walking in the path of evil?</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the twenty-first chapter, called
  'The Five Kings', in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the serene joy and emotion of
  the pious.</font>
