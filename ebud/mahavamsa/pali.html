  <ol>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>ACARIYA </b>- 'teacher, master'</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>ARAHANT </b>- Literally 'able worthy', a
      person who has reached the ideal. In an Arahant the asava, the deadly
      drugs of delusion, are brought to an end; he is no longer subject to
      rebirth, but lives in Nirvana, the final liberation.</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>ARAMA </b>- 'park, garden.' Designatin
      of a Buddhist convent = vihara.</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>ASAVA </b>- The term is hardly
      translatable. According to Buddhaghosa, wel matured spiritous liquors are
      called asava. The underlying idea is therefore, that of 'overwhelming
      intoxification', not that of a deadly flood. There are four asava: (1)
      kama 'lust, desire', (2) bhava '(desire of a future) existence', (3)
      avijja 'ignorance (of the four holy truths)', and (4) ditthi 'false
      belief'. Kinasava is 'one whoe has overcome the asavas', and anasava is
      'one who is free from the asavas', are epithets of the arahant.</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>BHIKKHU(NI) </b>- mendicant monk, nun.
      Member of the Buddhist order.</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>BUDDHA </b>- (Sambuddha, Samma-Sambuddha
      convey the same notion in a heightened degree) denotes a being who by his
      own force has attained to possession of the highest knowledge. He is
      neither man nor god. He is able to perform certain wonders in accord with
      the laws of nature. In an endless series of existences the Buddha prepares
      himself for his state of Buddhahood. During the whole of this time he is
      called a bodhisatta (Skt. bodhisatta) till in his last existence as a
      man-the last but one he generally spends in a heaven of the gods- he
      attains to knowledge (bodhi, sambodhi, abisambodhi). In the ancient texts
      sambodhi is always the insight of an Arahant. Since this event comes to
      pass for the historical Buddha under an assattha tree (Ficus religiosa),
      this is the sacred tree of the Buddhists, and the Bodhi-tree (Sinh.
      bogaha) is not lacking in any Buddhist sanctuary in Lanka. A Paccekabuddha
      has also reached Nirvana (see below) by his own force, but does not come
      forward as a teacher. The historical Buddha is called, after his family,
      Gotama Buddha or Sakyamuni, 'the sage of the house of the Sakyas.'</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>CETIYA </b>- See under THUPA</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>DAMILA </b>- a Tamil.</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>DEVATA </b>- divinity, genius,
      particularly applied to the spirits which, according to popular belief,
      inhabit trees, wells, hills, and in fact every place. In Mah. 28.6 a
      devata of the royal parasol is mentioned.</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>DHAMMA </b>- truth, religion, the
      sum-total of Buddhist doctrine. Opposed to vinaya, 'Discipline, the
      monastic rule,' Dhamma in the more restricted sense denotes the second
      part of the tipitaka (which see).</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>KARISA </b>- first a measure of
      capacity; in another sense an area of about 4 acres, i.e. as much ground
      as can be sown with a karisa of seed-corn.</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>KHATTIYA </b>- (Skt. ksatriya), the
      class of nobles or warriors. This was one of the four ancient vanna, or
      social grades. The Buddhists and Jainas put them first in the list, the
      Brahmans put themselves first. The Khattiyas have been sometimes called a
      caste; but they never formed an organized community, like the modern
      castes, with connubium and commensality between all Khattiyas.</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>MANTA </b>- formula, sacred formula,
      charm, spell, designation of the Vedic hymns.</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>NAGA </b>- designation of supernatural
      beings, snakedemons, sometimes represented in human form with a snake's
      hood in the neck, sometimes as mixed forms, half man half snake. They are
      distinguished by devout reverence toward the Buddha. Their sworn enemies
      are the Garuda, winged beings resembling the griffin.</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>NIBBANA </b>- (Skt. nirvana). One of the
      terms for Arahantship. It is defined as the destruction (in the heart) of
      raga, dosa, and moha (lust, iliwill, and stupidity); and is stated to be
      sttainable by the eightfold Path.</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>PABAJJA </b>- Literally 'going forth';
      the technical term for giving up the household life and becoming a
      religieux, entering an order. The rules for the reception of candidates
      for membership varied in the various orders. When a candidate is first
      admitted he is called a samanera, novice.</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>PACCEKABUDDHA </b>- See under BUDDHA.</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>PARIVANA </b>- monk's cell, the private
      dwelling of a bhikkhu within the monastery.</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>PAVARANA </b>- 'invitation,' name of a
      festival held by the bhikkhus at the close of the vassa, i.e. the rainy
      season, spent in the monastery.</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>SAMANA </b>- 'ascetic,' designation of
      the Buddhist priests as opposed to the Brahmana.</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>SAMANERA </b>- See under PABBAJJA.</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>SAMGHATTHERA </b>- See under THERA.</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>SUDDHA </b>- (Skt. Sudra) a man of the
      fourth, non-Aryan</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>TALA </b>- Lit. 'palm,' a measure of
      length.</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>TATHAGATA </b>- one of the terms of
      veneration applied to the Buddhas. The Buddha usually speaks of himself
      thus. The meaning is a matter of controversy. The native commentators
      explain the word in quite different ways.</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>THERA(I) </b>- (Skt. sthavira), term of
      respect applied to monks and nuns, especially to those of venerable age.
      Samghatthera is the denotion of the senior priest in any assembly of
      bhikkhus, or in the whole community.</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>THUPA </b>- (Skt. stupa, tope), name of
      edifices which serve as receptacle for a relic or as monument. They are
      hemispherical or bell-shaped, and rest upon a base of three concentric
      stories which form ambulatories round the tope; they sustain a cubical
      erection, the so-called tee from which rises the spire (chatta) which
      crowns the whole. The relic-chamber (dhatugabbha, whence the name
      'Dagaba', used in Lanka for the whole edifice) is in the interior, below
      the tee. The expression cetiya (Skt. caitya), originally the most general
      term for 'sanctuary 'a tree, too, can be a cetiya is used in the Mah.
      mostly as a synonym for thupa. Cf., for instance, Mahacetiya or Mahathupa
      as the name of the Ruwanweli-Dagaba in Anuradhapura. There is frequent
      mention in the Mah. of a thupaghara or cetiyaghara, \ 'house of the thupa
      or cetiya.' There can be no doubt, from Mah. 31. 29, that sometimes a sort
      of roof or temple was built over the tope. In Anuradhapura the
      Thuparama-Dagaba is surrounded by four concentric rows of pillars. It
      appears as if the two inner rows, where the capitals of the pillars have
      tenons, were intended to bear the roof of a thupaghara. PARKER (Ancient
      Ceylon p. 270) considers it altogether possible, differing in this from
      SMITHER (Anurdhapura, p. 7). Of course such temples could only be
      constructed over the smaller thupas, and, as far as I can see, are only
      mentioned is naturally only a question of building round and not over the
      sacred tree.</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>TIPITAKA </b>- Lit. 'three baskets,'
      collective name for the canonical scriptures of the Buddhists. They fall
      into three main divisions, Vinaya-pitaka, Sutta (or Dhamma), and
      Abhidhamma.</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>UPASAMPADA </b>- the solemn ordination
      of the monk who is a novice until that time, by a chapter of the order;
      the higher consecration of the priesthood.</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>UPOSATHA </b>- (Skt. upavasatha). The
      Buddhist sabbath which is considered a holy day both for priests and
      laymen. It occurs four times in the month: on the full and new-moon day,
      and on the eighth day following full- and new-moon. On two of these four
      days the recitation of the Patimokkha-precepts (patimokkhuddesa) takes
      place, i.e. the priestly ceremony of confession, in which every member of
      the order is to acknowledge the faults he has committed. Uposathagara, or
      uposathaghara, is a building belonging to the monastery used for the
      performance of the uposatha ceremonies.</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>VEDI or VEDIKA </b>- (Skt. the same),
      means first 'terrace, altar'. When in Mah. 36. 52 a pasanavedi around the
      bodhitree is mentioned, it means a stone terrace, on which such sacred
      trees usually stand. In the same sense silavedi, Mah. 36. 103. Further,
      this word has the sense of 'terrace with balustrade'. It is to be
      understood thus in the description of Sudassana's palace. Exactly in the
      same manner, by sopana a 'staircase with balustrade' is meant, and in both
      passages an accurate description follows, not of the terrace or of the
      staircase, but especially of the rail. When a muddhavedi and padavedi of a
      thupa are mentioned (Mah. 35. 2) the former is the so-called tee, the
      latter the storied base (see no. 26). Railings in relief are frequently
      added to both. Finally the meaning 'balustrade, railing' supersedes the
      others. Thus by the coralvedikas to the kutagara, the 'window-chambers' of
      the Lohapasada, the parapet-balustrade to the windows is evidently meant.</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>VESSA </b>- (Skt. vaisya), a man of the
      third social grade.</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>VIHARA </b>- dwelling, habitation for
      gods as also for monks, therefore temple or convent . In the Mahavamsa the
      latter meaning prevails.</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>YAKKHA</b>- (f. yakkhini; Skt. yaksa,
      yaksini), designation of certain supernatural beings who are under the
      rule of Vessavana (Skt. Vaisravana, name of the god Kubera). In the Mah.
      the aboriginal inhabitants of Lanka are frequently called Yakkha.</font>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>YOJANA </b>- a measure of length.
      According to the system of the Abhidhanappadipika, 1 yojana is = 4 pilvuta
      = 80 usabha = 20 yatthi = 7 ratana (or hattha 'ell') = 2 vidatthi (span) =
      12 angula. According to RHYS DAVIDS, the native tables of linear measures
      make the yojana between 12 and 12 .5 miles, but in actual practice it must
      have been reckoned as 7-8 miles.</font>
