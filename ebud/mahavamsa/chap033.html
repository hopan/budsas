  </center><center><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">THE TEN KINGS</font></b></center>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">U</font>NDER the rule of the
  king Dutthagamani the subjects in the kingdom lived happily; Salirajakumara
  was his famous son.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Greatly gifted was he and ever took delight in
  works of merit; he tenderly loved a candäla woman of exceedingly great
  beauty. Since he was greatly enamoured of the Agokamaladevi, who already in a
  former birth had been his consort,' because of her loveliness, be cared
  nothing for kingly rule.<a name="A14"></a> Therefore Dutthagamani's brother,
  SADDHA TISSA, anointed king after his death, ruled, a peerless (prince), for
  eighteen years. He finished the work on the parasol, and the plaster-work and
  the elephant-wall' of the Great Thüpa, he who won his name by his faith. The
  magnificent Lohapäsada caught fire from a lamp; he built the Lohapasada anew,
  seven stories high. And now was the pasada worth (only) ninety times a hundred
  thousand. He built the Dakkhinariri-vihara and the (vihara) Kallakalena, the
  Kalambaka-vihara, and the (vihara) Pettahgavalika, (the viharas)
  Velangavitthika, Dubbalavapitissaka and Duratissakavapi, and the Mutuviharaka
  He also built viharas (from Anuradhapura) to Dighavapi, one for every yojana
  (of the way).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Moreover, he founded the Dighavapi-vihara
  together with the cetiya; for this cetiya he had a covering of network made
  set with gems, and in every mesh thereof was hung a splendid flower of gold,
  large as a waggon-wheel, that he had commanded them to fashion. (In honour) of
  the eighty-four thousand sections of the dhamma the ruler commanded also
  eighty-four thousand offerings. When the king had thus accomplished many works
  of merit he was reborn, after his death, among the Tusita gods.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">While the great king Saddhatissa lived yet in
  Dighavapi his eldest son Lanjatissa built the beautiful vihara called
  Girikumbhila; and Thulathana, a younger son of this same (king), built the
  vihara called Kandara. When his father (SADDHA TISSA) went to his brother
  (Dutthagamani at Anurãdhapura) THULANTHANA went with him, to bestow land for
  the use of the brotherhood upon his vihãra.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When SADDHA TISSA died all the counsellors
  assembled, and when they had summoned together the whole brotherhood of
  bhikkhus in the Thuparama, they, <a name="A15"></a>with the consent of the
  brotherhood consecrated the prince THULANTHANA as king, that he might take the
  kingdom under his protection.<a name="A16"></a> When LANJA TISSA heard this he
  came hither,' overpowered him, and took the government upon himself. Only for
  one month and ten days had Thulathana been king.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">During three years did LANJA TISSA use the
  brotherhood slightingly and neglect them, with the thought: 'They did not
  decide according to age.' When, afterwards, he was reconciled with the
  brotherhood, the king built, in atonement, spending three hundred thousand
  (pieces of money), three stone terraces for offerings of flowers to the Great
  Cetiya, and then did the lord of the land, with (the expense of) a hundred
  thousand, have the earth heaped up between the Great Thupa and the Thuparama
  so that it was level. Moreover, he made a splendid stone mantling to the thupa
  in the Thuparama, and to the east of the Thupurama a little thupa built of
  stones, and the Lanjakasana hail for the brotherhood of bhikkhus. Moreover, he
  had a mantling made of stone for the Khandhakathupa. When he had spent a
  hundred thousand for the Cetiya-vihara he commanded that at the (consecration)
  festival of the vihara called Girikumbhila the six garments be distributed to
  sixty thousand bhikkhus.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">He built the Arittha-vihara and the (vihara)
  Kunjarahinaka, and to the bhikkhus in the villages he distributed medicines.
  To the bhikkhunis he ordered to give rice as much as they wanted. Nine years
  and one half-month did he reign here.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A17"></a> When Lanjatissa was dead
  his younger brother named KHALLATA NAGA reigned six years. Round about the
  Lohapasada he built thirty-two exceedingly beautiful (other) pasadas to make
  the Lohapäsäda yet more splendid. Round the Great Thupa, the beautiful
  Hemamali, he made as a border a court (strewn) with sand and a wall. Moreover,
  he built the Kurundavasoka-vihara, and yet other works of merit did the king
  carry out.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A commander of troops named Kammaharattaka,
  overpowered the ruler, king KHALLATA NAGA, in the capital itself.<a name="A18"></a>
  But the king's younger brother named VATTA GAMANI killed the villainous
  commander and took on himself the government. The little son of his brother,
  king Khallatanaga, whose name was Mahaculika, he took as his son; and the
  (child's) mother, Anulädevi, he made his queen. Since he had thus taken the
  place of a father they called him Pitiraja.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the fifth month after he was thus anointed
  king, a young brahman named Tissa, in Rohana, in the city (that was the seat)
  of his clan, hearkened, fool that he was, to the prophesying of a brahman and
  became a rebel, and his following waxed great.<a name="31"></a> Seven Damilas
  landed (at the same time) with their troops in Mahatittha. Then Tissa the
  brahman and the seven Damilas also sent the king a written message concerning
  the (handing over of the) parasol. The sagacious king sent a written message
  to Tissa the brahman: 'The kingdom is now thine, conquer thou the Damilas.' He
  answered: 'So be it,' and fought a battle with the Damilas, but they conquered
  him.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="32"></a> Thereupon the Damilas made
  war upon the king; in a battle near Kolambalaka the king was vanquished. (Near
  the gate of the Tittharama he mounted into his car and fled.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But the Titthäräma was built by king
  Pandukabhaya and it had been constantly inhabited under twenty-one kings.) As
  a nigantha named Giri saw him take flight he cried out loudly: 'The great
  black lion is fleeing.' When the great king heard that he thought thus: 'If my
  wish be fulfilled I will build a vihara here.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">He took Anuladevi with him, who was with
  child, thinking: 'She must be protected,' and Mahacula also and (his son) the
  prince Mahanaga, also thinking: 'They must be protected.' But, to lighten the
  car the king gave to Somadevi his splendid diadem-jewel and let her, with her
  own consent, descend from the car.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When going forth to battle he had set out,
  full of fears, taking his little son and his two queens with him. Being
  vanquished he took flight and, unable to take with him the almsbowl used by
  the Conqueror, he hid in the Vessagiri forest. When the thera Mahatissa from
  Kupikkala (vihüra) saw him there, he gave him food, avoiding thereby the
  giving of an untouched alms. Thereon the king, glad at heart, recording it
  upon a ketaka -leaf, allotted lands to his vihära for the use of the
  brotherhood. From thence, he went to Silasobbhakandaka and sojourned there;
  then he went to Matuvelanga near Samagalla and there met the thera
  (Kupikkalamahatissa) whom he had already seen before. The thera entrusted the
  king with due carefulness to Tanasiva, who was his attendant. Then in the
  house of this Tanasiva, his subject, the king lived fourteen years, maintained
  by him.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of the seven Damilas one, fired with passion
  for the lovely Somadevi, made her his own and forthwith returned again to the
  further coast. Another took the almsbowl of the (Master) endowed with the ten
  miraculous powers, that was in Anuradhapura, and returned straightway, well
  contented, to the other coast.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A19"></a> But the Damila PULAHATTHA
  reigned three years, making the Damila named Bahiya commander of his troops.
  BARIYA slew PULAHATTHA and reigned two years; his commander-inchief was
  PANAYAMARAKA. PANAYAMARAKA slew BARIYA and was king for seven years; his
  commander-in-chief was PILAYAMARAKA. PILAYAMARAKA slew PANAYAMARAKA and was
  king for seven months; his commander-in-chief was DATHIKA. And the Damila
  DATHIKA slew PILAYAMARAKA and reigned two years in Anuradhapura. Thus the time
  of these five Damila-kings was fourteen years and seven months.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When one day, in Malaya, Anuladevi went to
  seek her (daily) portion the wife of Tanasiva struck against her basket with
  her foot. And she was wroth and came weeping to the king. When Tanasiva heard
  this he hastened forth (from the house) grasping his bow. When the king had
  heard what the queen said, he, ere yet the other came, took the two boys and
  his consort and hastened out also. Putting the arrow to his bow the glorious
  (hero) transfixed Siva as he came on. The king proclaimed (then) his name and
  gathered followers around him. He obtained as ministers eight famous warriors,
  and great was the following of the king and his equipment (for war).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A20"></a> The famous (king) sought
  out the thera Mahatissa of Kupikkala and commanded that a festival in honour
  of the Buddha be held in the Acchagalla-vihara. At the very time when the
  minister Kapisisa, having gone up to the courtyard of the Akasa-cetiya to
  sweep the building, had come down from thence, the king, who was going up with
  the queen, saw him sitting by the road, and being wroth with him that he had
  not flung himself down (before him) he slew Kapisisa. Then in anger against
  the king the other seven ministers withdrew themselves from him, and going
  whither it seemed good to them, they were stripped of their possessions by
  robbers on the way, and they took refuge in the vihara Hambugallaka where they
  sought out the learned thera Tissa. The thera, who was versed in the four
  nikayas, gave them, as he had received it (as alms), clothing, sugar and oil,
  and rice, too, in sufficing measure.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he had refreshed them the thera asked
  them:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Whither are you going?' They made themselves
  known to him, and told him this matter. But when they were asked afterwards:
  'With whom will it be possible to further the doctrine of the Buddha? With the
  Damilas or with the king?' they answered: 'By the king will this be possible.'
  And when they had thus convinced them the two theras, Tissa and Mahatissa,
  took them forth from thence and brought them to the king and reconciled them
  one to another. The king and the ministers besought the theras saying: 'If our
  undertaking has prospered then must ye come to us, when a message is sent to
  you.' The theras agreed and returned each one to his place.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the renowned king had come to
  Anuradhapura and had slain the Damila Dathika he himself assumed the
  government. And forthwith the king destroyed the Arama of the niganthas and
  built there a vihara with twelve cells. When two hundred and seventeen years
  ten months and ten days had passed since the founding of the Mahavihara the
  king, filled with pious zeal, built the Abhayagiri-vihara.' He sent for the
  (two) theras, and to the thera Mahatissa, who had first assisted him of the
  two, he gave the vihära, to do him honour. Since the king Abhaya built it on
  the place of the arama of (the nigantha) Giri, the vihara received the name
  Abhayagiri.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he had sent for Somadevi he raised her
  again to her rank and built, in her honour, the Somarama, bearing her name.
  For this fair woman, who had alighted from the car at this spot and had
  concealed herself in a thicket of flowering Kadambas, saw in that very place a
  samanera who was relieving his need, using (decently) his hand for
  concealment. When the king heard her story he built a vihara there.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To the north of the Mahathupa this same king
  founded upon a lofty spot the cetiya called Silasobbhakandaka.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the seven warriors (of the king),
  Uttiya, built, to the south of the city, the so-called Dakkhina-vihara. In the
  same place the minister named Mula built the Mulavokasavihãra, which was,
  therefore, called after him. The minister named Saliya built the Saliyarama,
  and the minister named Pabbata built the Pabbatarama; but the minister Tissa
  founded the Uttaratissaräma. When the beautiful viharas were completed they
  sought out the them Tissa and gave them to him with these words: 'In gratitude
  for thy kindness we give thee these viharas built by us!</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The them established sundry bhikkhus
  everywhere (in these viharas), according to their rank, and the ministers
  bestowed upon the brotherhood the different (things) useful to a samana. The
  king provided those (bhikkhus) living in his vihära with the (needful) things
  for use, so that nothing was lacking therefore were they many in number.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A then known by the name Mahatissa, who had
  frequented the families of laymen, was expelled by the brotherhood from our
  monastery for this fault, the frequenting of lay-families. His disciple, the
  them who was known as Bahalamassutissa, went in anger to the Abhayagiri
  (vihãra) and abode there, forming a (separate) faction. And thenceforward
  these bhikkhus came no more to the Mahavihara: thus did the bhikkhus of the
  Abhayagiri (viliüra) secede from the Theravada. From the monks of the
  Abhayagiri -vihara those of the Dakkhina-vihara separated (afterwards); in
  this wise those bhikkhus (who had seceded) from the adherents of the Theravada
  were divided into two (groups).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">He (the king) built the cells of the vihara so
  that a greater number were joined together, for he reflected: 'In this way it
  will be possible to restore them.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The text of the three pitakas and the
  athhakatha thereon did the most wise bhikkhus hand down in former times
  orally, but since they saw that the people were falling away (from religion)
  the bhikkhus came together, and in order that the true doctrine might endure,
  they wrote them down in books.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus did the king VATTA GAMANI ABHAYA reign
  twelve years, and, at the beginning, five months beside.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus does the wise man labour, when he comes
  to rule, for the bliss of others and for his own bliss, but a man without
  understanding does not render the possessions which lie has won, however great
  they are, blissful for both, being greedy of (more) possessions.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the thirty-third chapter, called
  'The Ten Kings', in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the srene joy and emotion of
  the pious.</font>
