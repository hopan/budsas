  RELICS</font></b></center>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">W</font>HEN the great thera of
  lofty wisdom, after spending the rain-season (thus), had held the
  pavarana-ceremony, on the full-moon day of the month Kattika, he spoke thus to
  the king: 'Long is the time, O lord of men, since we have seen the Sambuddha.
  We lived a life without a master. There is nothing here for us to worship.'
  And to the question: 'Yet hast thou not told me, sir, that the Sambuddha is
  passed into nibbana?' he answered: 'If we behold the relics we behold the
  Conqueror.' 'My intention to build a thupa is known to you. I will build the
  thupa, and do you discover the relics.' The thera replied to the king: 'Take
  counsel with Sumana'; and the king said to the samanera: 'Whence shall we have
  the relics?' 'O lord of men, when thou hast commanded the adorning of the city
  and the road and hast taken the uposathavows upon thyself together with thy
  company, go thou, in the evening, mounted on thy state-elephant, bearing the
  white parasol and attended by musicians, to the Mahanaga-park. There, O king,
  wilt thou receive relics of him who knew how to destroy the elements of
  existence,'so said the sämanera Sumana to the (king), glad of heart.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And now the thera went forth from the king's
  house to the Cetiya-mountain and summoned the samanera Sumana, bent on holy
  thoughts.' 'Go, friend Sumana, and when thou art come to the fair Pupphapura,
  deliver to the mighty king, thy grandfather, this charge from us: &quot;Thy
  friend, O great king, the great king, the friend of the gods, desires, being
  converted to the doctrine of the Buddha, to build a thupa; do thou give him
  the relies of the Sage and the alms-bowl that the Master used, for many relies
  of the (Buddha's) body are with thee.&quot; When thou hast received the
  alms-bowl full (of relics) go to the fair city of the gods and declare to
  Sakka, king of the gods, this charge from us: &quot;The relic, the right
  eye-tooth of the (Buddha), worthy of the adoration of the three worlds, is
  with thee, O king of the gods, and the relic of the right collar-bone. Honour
  thou the tooth; the collar-bone of the Master do thou give away. Grow not
  weary of thy duty toward the isle of Lankä, O lord of the gods!</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And the sämanera of wondrous power, replying:
  'So be it, sir,' went, that very moment, to the king Dhammäsoka and found him
  even as he stood at the foot of a säla-tree and honoured the beautiful and
  sacred Bodhi-tree with the offerings of the Kattika-festival.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he had delivered the thera's charge and
  had accepted the alms-bowl full of relics received from the king he went to
  the Himalaya. When, on the Himalaya, he had set down that most sacred bowl
  with the relies, he went to the king of the gods and delivered the thera's
  charge.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sakka, the lord of the gods, took from the
  Culamani-cetiya the right collar-bone (of the Buddha) and gave it to the
  samanera. Thereupon the ascetic Sumana took the relic and the bowl with the
  relics likewise and returning to the Cetiya mountain he handed them to the
  thera.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the evening the king, at the head of the
  royal troops, went to the Mahanaga-park, in the manner (already) told. The
  thera put all the relics down there on the mountain, and therefore the
  Missaka-mountain was called the Cetiya mountain.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the thera bad put the vessel with the
  relics on the Cetiya-mountain, he took the collar-bone relic and went with his
  company of disciples to the appointed place.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'If this is a relic of the Sage then shall my
  parasol bow down, of itself, my elephant shall sink upon its knees, this
  relic-urn, coming (toward me) with the relic shall descend upon my head.' So
  thought the king, and as he thought so it came to pass. And as if sprinkled
  with ambrosia the monarch was full of joy, and taking (the urn) from his head
  he set it on the back of the elephant.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then did the elephant trumpet joyfully and the
  earth quaked. And the elephant turned about and having entered the fair city
  by the east gate, together with the theras and the troops and vehicles, and
  having left it again by the south gate he went to the building, of the Great
  Sacrifice set up' to the west of the spot where (afterwards) the cetiya of the
  Thuparama and when he had turned around on the place of the Bodhi-tree he
  remained standing, his head turned toward the east.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But at that time the place of the thüpa was
  covered with flowering kadamba-plants and adari-creepers.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the god among men had caused this holy
  place, protected by the gods, to be cleared and adorned, he began forthwith,
  in seemly wise, to take the relic down from the elephant's back. But this the
  elephant would not suffer, and the king asked the thera what he wished. And
  the other answered: 'He would fain have (them) put in a place that is equal
  (in height) to his back; therefore will he not suffer them to be taken down.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then with lumps of dry clay that he had
  commanded to be brought straight way from the dried Abhaya-tank he raised a
  pile even as (high as the elephant), and when the king had caused this
  high-standing place to be adorned in manifold ways and had caused the relic to
  be taken down from the back of the elephant, he placed it there.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">(Then) having entrusted the elephant with the
  guarding of the relic and having left him there, the king, whose heart was set
  on building a thupa for the relic, and who speedily commanded many people to
  make bricks, went back with his ministers to the city meditating (to hold) a
  solemn festival for the relic. But the great thera Mahinda went with his
  company of disciples to the beautiful Mahamegha-grove and rested there.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">During the night the elephant paced around the
  place with the relic; through the day he stood with the relic in the hail on
  the spot (destined) for the Bodhi-tree. When the monarch, obedient to the
  thera's wish, had built up3 the thüpa knee-high above that (brick)work and
  had caused the (festival of the) laying down of the relic to be proclaimed in
  that same place, he went thither and from this region and that, from every
  side a multitude assembled there.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Amid this assembly the relic rose up in the
  air from the elephant's back, and floating in the air plain to view, at the
  height of seven talas, throwing the people into amazement, it wrought that
  miracle of the double appearances,' that caused the hair (of the beholders) to
  stand on end, even as (did) the Buddha under the Gandamba-tree. By the rays of
  light and streams of water pouring down therefrom was the whole land of Lanka
  illumined and flooded again and again.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the Conqueror lay stretched upon the
  couch of the great nibbana the five great resolutions were formed by him, who
  was endowed with the five eyes.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'The south branch of the great Bodhi-tree,
  grasped by Asoka, being detached of itself, shall place itself in a vase. When
  it is so placed the branch, illumining all the regions of the world, shall put
  forth lovely rays of six colours from its fruits and leaves. Then, rising up
  with the golden vase, this delightful (tree) shall abide invisible for seven
  days in the region of snow. My right collar-bone, if it be laid in the
  Thuparama, shall rise in the air and perform the miracle of the double
  appearances. If my pure relics, filling a doiameasure, are laid in the
  Hemamalika-cetiya, that ornament of Lanka, they shall take the form of the
  Buddha, and rising and floating in the air, they shall take their place after
  having wrought the miracle of the double appearances.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus did the Tathagata form five resolutions
  and therefore was the miracle then wrought by the relic. Coming down from the
  air it rested on the head of the monarch, and full of joy the king laid it in
  the cetiya. So soon as the relic was laid in the cetiya a wondrous great
  earthquake came to pass, causing a thrill (of awe). Thus are the Buddhas
  incomprehensible, and incomprehensible is the nature of the Buddhas, and
  incomprehensible is the reward of those who have faith in the
  incomprehensible.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the people saw the miracle they had faith
  in the Conqueror. But the prince Mattabhaya, the king's younger brother, who
  had faith in the King of Sages, begged leave of the king of men and received
  the pabbajja of the doctrine with a thousand of his followers.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And from Cetavigama and also from Dvaramandala
  and also from Viharabahu even as from Gallakapitha and from Upatissagama, from
  each of these there received gladly the pabajja five hundred young men in whom
  faith in the Tathagata had been awakened.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So all these who, (coming) from within the
  city and without (the city), had received the pabbajja of the Conqueror's
  doctrine now numbered thirty thousand bhikkhus.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the ruler of the earth had completed the
  beautiful thüpa in the Thuparama he caused it to be worshipped perpetually
  with gifts of many jewels and so forth. The women of the royal household, the
  nobles, ministers, townspeople, and also all the country-folk brought each
  their offerings.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And here the king founded a vihara, the thiipa
  of which had been built before; for that reason this vihära was known by the
  name Thüpärama.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus by these relics of his body the Master of
  the World, being already passed into nibbana, truly bestowed salvation and
  bliss in abundance on mankind. How can there be discourse (of this, as it was)
  when the Conqueror yet lived</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the seventeenth chapter, called 'The
  Arrival of the Relics', in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the serene joy and
  emotion of the pious.</font>
