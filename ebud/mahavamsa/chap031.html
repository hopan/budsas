  THE RELICS</font></b></center>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">W</font>HEN the subduer of foes
  had completed the work on the relic-chamber he brought about an assembly of
  the brotherhood and spoke thus: 'The work on the relic-chamber has been
  completed by me; to-morrow I will enshrine the relics; do you, venerable sirs,
  take thought for the relics.' When the great king had spoken thus he went
  thence into the city; but the assembly of bhikkhus sought out a bhikkhu who
  should bring relics hither; and they charged the ascetic named Sonuttara,
  gifted with the six supernormal faculties, who dwelt in the Püja-parivena,
  with the task of bringing the relics.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now once, when the Master was wandering about
  (on the earth) for the salvation of the world, on the shore of the Ganges a
  bra hman named Nanduttara invited the Sambuddha and offered him hospitality
  together with the brotherhood. Near the landing-place Payaga the Master, with
  the brotherhood, embarked on a ship. As then the them Bhaddaji of wondrous
  might, endowed with the six supernormal faculties, saw there a place where the
  water whirled in eddies, he said to the bhikkhus: 'The golden palace measuring
  twenty-five yojanas wherein I dwelt, when I was (the king) Mahapanada, is sunk
  here. When the water of the Ganges comes to it here it whirls in eddies.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The bhikkhus, who did not believe him, told
  this to the Master. The Master said: 'Banish the doubts of the bhikkhus.' Then
  to show his power to command even in he Brahma-world he rose, by his wondrous
  might, into the air and when he, floating at a height even of seven talas, had
  taken the Dussa-thupa in the Brahma-world upon his outstretched hand, and had
  brought it hither and shown it to the people, he put it again in the place to
  which it belonged. Thereon he dived, by his wondrous power, into the Ganges,
  and seizing tht palace by its spire with his toe he raised it high up, and
  when he had shown it to the people he let it fall again there (to its place).
  When the brahman Nanduttara saw this wonder he uttered the wish: 'May I (at
  some time) have the power to procure relics that others hold in their
  possession.' Therefore did the brotherhood lay this charge upon the ascetic
  Sonuttara although he was but sixteen years old. 'Whence shall I bring a
  relic?' he asked the brotherhood, and thereupon the brotherhood described the
  relics thus:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Lying on his deathbed the Master of the
  world, that with his relics he might bring to pass salvation for the world,
  spoke thus to (Sakka) the king of the gods: 0 king of the gods, of the eight
  donas of my bodily relics one dona, adored (first) by the Koliyas in Ramagama,
  shall be borne thence into the kingdom of the nagas and when it will be adored
  even there by the nagas it (at the last) shall come to be enshrined in the
  Great Thupa on the island of Lanka. The far-seeing and most wise thera
  Mahakassapa then, mindful of the (coming) division of the relics by king
  Dhammasoka, had a great and well-guarded treasure of relics placed' near
  Rajagaha (the capital) of king Ajatasattu as he brought thither the seven
  donas of relics; but the dona in Ramagama he did not take, knowing the
  Master's intention. When the king Dhammasoka saw the great treasure of relics
  he thought to have the eighth dona also brought thither. But, bethinking them
  that it was destined by the Conqueror to be enshrined in the Great Thüpa, the
  ascetics of that time who had overcome the asavas prevented Dhammasoka from
  (doing) this. The thupa in Rajagama, that was built on the shore of the
  Ganges, was destroyed by the overflowing of the Ganges, but the urn with the
  relics reached the ocean and stayed there in the twofold divided waters on a
  throne made of many-coloured gems surrounded by rays of light. When the nagas
  saw the urn they went to the naga palace Mañjerika of the king Kalanaga and
  told him, And he went thither with ten thousand kotis of nagas, and when he
  had brought the relics to his palace, (adoring them) with offerings meanwhile,
  and had built over them a thupa made of all kinds of jewels and a temple above
  the (thüpa) also, he, filled with zeal, brought offerings continually,
  together with the (other) nagas. There a strong guard is set; go thou and
  bring the relics hither. To-morrow will the lord of the land set about
  enshrining the relics.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he had heard these words of the
  brotherhood he, answering 'Yes (I shall do so) ', withdrew to his cell
  pondering over the time when he must set forth. 'To-morrow the enshrining of
  the relics shall take place,' thus proclaimed the king by beat of drums in the
  city, by which all that must be done is set forth. He commanded that the whole
  city and the road leading hither' be carefully adorned and that the burghers
  be clad in festal garments. Sakka, the king of the gods, summoning Vissakamma
  (for this task), caused the whole island of Lanka to be adorned in manifold
  ways.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the four gates of the city the ruler of men
  had garments, food and so forth placed for the use of the people.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the fifteenth uposatha-day in the evening,
  (the king) glad at heart, well versed in the duties of kings, arrayed in all
  his ornaments, surrounded on every side by all his dancingwomen and his
  warriors in complete armour, by a great body of troops, as well as by
  variously adorned elephants, horses and chariots, mounted his car of state
  that was drawn by four pure white Sindhu-horses and stood there, making the
  (sumptuously) adorned and beautiful elephant Kandula pace before him, holding
  a golden casket under the white parasol. A thousand and eight beautiful women
  from the city, with the adornment of well-filled pitchers, surrounded the car
  and, even as many women bearing baskets (filled) with various flowers, and as
  many again bearing lamps on staves. A thousand and eight boys in festal array
  surrounded him, bearing beautiful many-coloured flags. While the earth seemed
  as it were rent asunder by all manner of sounds from various instruments of
  music, by the (thundering) noise of elephants, horses and chariots, the
  renowned king shone forth, as he went to the Mahameghavana, in glory like to
  the king of the gods when he goes to Nandavana.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the ascetic Sonuttara, sitting in his
  cell, heard the noise of the music in the city as the king began to</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">set out, he went, plunging into the earth to
  the palace of the nagas and appeared there in a short time before the naga
  king. When the king of the nagas had risen up and had greeted him and invited
  him to be seated on a throne, he paid him the honours due to a guest and
  questioned him as to the country whence he had come. When this was told he
  asked the reason of the thera's coming. And he told him the whole matter and
  gave him the message of the brotherhood: 'The relics that are here in thy
  hands are appointed by the Buddha to be enshrined in the Great Thupa; do thou
  then give them to me.' When the naga-king heard this, he was sorely troubled
  and thought: 'This samana might have the power to take them from me by force;
  therefore must the relics be carried elsewhere,' and he made this known by a
  sign to his nephew, who was present there. And he, who was named Vasuladatta,
  understanding the hint, went to the temple of the cetiya, and when he had
  swallowed the urn (with the relics) he went to the foot of Mount Sineru and
  lay there coiled in a circle. Three hundred yojanas long was the ring and one
  yojana was his measure around. When the (naga) of wondrous might had created
  many thousand (heads with puffed-up) hoods he belched forth, as he lay thare,
  smoke and fire. When he (then) had created many thousand snakes like to
  himself, he made them lie about him in a circle.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many nagas and devas came thither then with
  the thought:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'We will behold the combat of the two nagas.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the uncle perceived that the relics had
  been taken thence by his nephew, he said to the thera: 'There are no relics
  with me.' The thera told him the story of the coming of the relics from the
  beginning, and said then to the nagaking: 'Give thou the relics.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And to content him by some other means the
  serpent-king took the thera with him and went to the temple with the cetiya
  and described it to him: 'See, O bhikkhu, this cetiya adorned with many gems
  in many ways and the nobly built temple for the cetiya. Nay, but all the
  jewels in the whole island of Lanka are not of so great worth as the
  stone-slab' at the foot of the steps; what shall be said of the other
  (treasures)? Truly it beseems thee not, O bhikkhu, to bear away the relics
  from a place of high honour to a place of lesser honour.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Verily, there is no understanding of the
  truth among you nägas. It were fitting indeed to bear away the relics to a
  place where there is understanding of the truth. The Tathagatas are born for
  deliverance from the sarusara, and thereon is the Buddha intent, therefore I
  will bear away the relics. This very day the king will set about enshrining
  the relics; swiftly then give me the relics without delay.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The naga said: 'If thou shalt see the relics,
  venerable sir, take them and go.' Three times the thera made him repeat this
  (word), then did the thera standing on that very spot create a (long) slender
  arm, and stretching the hand straightway down the throat of the nephew he took
  the urn with the relics, and crying: 'Stay, naga !' he plunged into the earth
  and rose up (out of it) in his cell.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The naga-king thought: 'The bhikkhu is gone
  hence, deceived by us,' and he sent to his nephew to bring the relics (again).
  But when the nephew could not find the urn in his belly he came lamenting and
  told his uncle. Then the naga king also lamented: 'We are betrayed,' and all
  the nagas who came in crowds lamented likewise. But rejoicing in the victory
  of the mighty bhikkhu the gods assembled, and adoring the relics with
  offerings they came together with the (thera).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lamenting, the nagas came to the brotherhood
  and made right woful plaint sorrowful over the carrying away of the relics.
  From compassion the brotherhood left them a few of the relics; rejoicing at
  this they went and brought treasures as offerings.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sakka came to the spot with the gods bringing
  a throne set with jewels and a casket of gold. In a beautiful pavilion made of
  jewels that was built by Vissakamma on the spot, where the thera had emerged
  (from the earth), he set up the throne and when he had received the urn with
  the relics from the hand of the thera, and had put them in the casket he
  placed it on the throne.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Brahma held the parasol, Samtusita the
  yak-tail whisk, Suyama held the jewelled fan, Sakka the shell with water. The
  four great kings stood with swords in their grip and the thirty-three gods of
  wondrous power with baskets in their hands. When they had gone thither
  offering paricchattakaflowers the thirty-two celestial maidens stood there
  bearing lamps on staves. Moreover, to ward off the evil yakkhas the
  twenty-eight yakkha-chieftains stood holding guard. Pancasikha stood there
  playing the lute, and Timbaru who had set up a stage, making music to sound
  forth. Many devas (stood there) singing sweet songs and the naga-king
  Mabäkäla chanting praises in manifold ways. Celestial instruments of music
  resounded, a celestial chorus pealed forth, the devatas let fall a rain of
  heavenly perfumes and so forth. But the thera Indagutta created, to ward off
  Mara, a parasol of copper that he made great as the universe. On the east side
  of the relics and here and there in the five regions' the bhikkhus raised
  their song in chorus.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thither, glad at heart;, went the great king
  Dutthagamani, and when he had laid the casket with the relics in the golden
  casket that he had brought upon his head, and had placed it upon a throne, he
  stood there with folded hands, offering gifts to the relics and adoring them.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the prince saw the celestial parasol, the
  celestial perfumes, and the rest, and heard the sound of celestial instruments
  of music and so forth, albeit he did not see the Brahma-gods he, rejoicing and
  amazed at the miracle, worshipped the relics, with the offering of a parasol
  and investing them with the kingship over Lanka.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'To the Master of the world, to the Teacher
  who bears the threefold parasol, the heavenly parasol and the earthly and the
  parasol of deliverance I consecrate three times my kingly rank.' With these
  words he, with joyful heart, thrice conferred on the relics the kingship of
  Lanka.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, together with gods and men, worshipping
  the relics with offerings, the prince placed them, with the caskets, upon his
  head, and when he, surrounded by the brotherhood of the bhikkhus, had passed
  three times, going toward the left, around the thüpa, he ascended it on the
  east side and descended into the relic-chamber. Ninety-six kotis of arahants
  stood with folded hands surrounding the magnificent thüpa. While the king,
  filled with joy, when he had mounted into the relic-chamber, thought: 'I will
  lay them on the costly and beautiful conch,' the relic-casket, together with
  the relics, rose up from his head, and, floating at a height of seven tälas
  in the air, the casket forthwith opened of itself; the relics rose up out of
  it and taking the form of the Buddha, gleaming with the greater and lesser
  signs, they performed, even as the Buddha (himself) at the foot of the
  gandambatree that miracle of the double appearances, that was brought to pass
  by the Blessed One during his lifetime. As they beheld this miracle, with
  believing and joyous heart, twelve kotis of devas and men attained to
  arahantship; those who attained the three other fruits (of salvation) were
  past reckoning.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Quitting the form of the Buddha those (relics)
  returned to their place in the casket; but the casket sank down again and
  rested on the head of the king. Then passing round the relic-chamber in
  procession with the thera Indagutta and the dancing-women, the glorious king
  coming even to the beautiful couch laid the casket on the jewelled throne. And
  when he, filled with zeal, had washed again his hands in water fragrant with
  perfumes, and had rubbed them with the five kinds of perfumes, he opened the
  casket, and taking out the relics the ruler of the land, who was intent on the
  welfare of his people, thought thus: 'If these relics shall abide undisturbed
  by any man so ever, and if the relics, serving as a refuge for the people,
  shall endure continually, then may they rest, in the form of the Master as he
  lay upon his deathbed, upon this well-ordered and precious couch.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thinking thus he laid the relics upon the
  splendid couch; the relics lay there upon the splendid couch even in such a
  shape. On the fifteenth uposatha-day in the bright half of the month Asalha,
  under the constellation Uttarasalha, were the relics enshrined in this way. At
  the enshrining of the relics the great earth quaked and many wonders came to
  pass in divers ways.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">With believing heart did the king worship the
  relics by (offering) a white parasol, and conferred on them the entire
  overlordship of Lanka for seven days.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">All the adornments on his body he offered in
  the relic chamber, and so likewise (did) the dancing-women, the ministers, the
  retinue and the devatas. When the king had distributed garments, sugar,
  clarified butter and so forth among the brotherhood, and had caused the
  bhikkhus to recite in chorus the whole night, then, when it was again day, he
  had the drum beaten in the city, being mindful of the welfare of the people:
  'All the people shall adore the relics throughout this week.' The great thera
  Indagutta, of wondrous might, commanded: 'Those men of the island of Lanka who
  would fain adore the relics shall arrive hither at the same moment, and when
  they have adored the relics here shall return each one to his house.' This
  came to pass as he had commanded.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the great king of great renown bad
  commanded great offerings of alms to the great brotherhood of the bhikkhus for
  the week uninterruptedly, he proclaimed: 'All that was to be done in the
  relic-chamber has been carried out by me; now let the brotherhood take the
  charge of closing the relic-chamber.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The brotherhood charged the two samaneras with
  this task. They closed up the relic-chamber with the fat-coloured stone that
  they had brought.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'The flowers here shall not wither, these
  perfumes shall not dry up; the lamps shall not be extinguished; nothing
  whatsoever shall perish; the six fat-coloured stones shall hold together for
  evermore.' All this did the (theras) who had overcome the asavas command at
  that time.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The great king, mindful of the welfare (of the
  people), issued the command: 'So far as they are able (to do so) the people
  shall enshrine relics.' And above the great relictreasure did the people, so
  far as they could, carry out the enshrining of thousands of relics. Enclosing
  all together the king completed the thüpa and, moreover, he completed the
  four-sided building' on the cetiya.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus are the Buddhas incomprehensible, and
  incomprehensible is the nature of the Buddhas, and incomprehensible is the
  reward of those who have faith in the incomprehensible.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus do the pious themselves perform pure
  deeds of merit, in order to obtain the most glorious of all blessings; and
  they, with pure heart, make also others to perform them in order to win a
  following of eminent people of many kinds.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the thirty-first chapter, called
  'The Enshrining of the Relics', in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the serene joy
  and emotion of the pious.</font>
