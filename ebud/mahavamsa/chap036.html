  the death of MAHALLA NAGA his son BHATIKA TISSA reigned twenty-four years in
  Lanka. He built a wall around the Mahävihara. When the king had built the
  Gavaratissavihara lie made the Mahamani-tank and gave it to the vihara.
  Moreover, he built the vihãra called Bhätikatissa. He built an
  uposatha-house in the beautiful Thuparama; the king also made the
  Randhakandaka-tank. Filled with tenderness towards beings and zealous in
  reverencing the brotherhood the protector of the earth commanded lavish
  almsgiving to the community of both sexes.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A45"></a> After the death of BHATIKA
  TISSA (his younger brother) KANITTHA TISSA reigned eighteen years in the
  island of Lankä. Since he was well pleased with the thera Mahanaga in the
  Bhutarama he built for him in splendid fashion the Ratanapasada in the
  Abhayagiri. Moreover, he built in the Abhayagiri a wall and a great parivena
  and a great parivena besides in the (vihara) called Manisoma. In that place he
  built a temple for the cetiya and in like manner for the Ambatthala-thupa; and
  (he ordered) the restoration of the temple in Nagadipa. Doing away with the
  boundary of the Mahavihara, the king built there the row of cells (called)
  Kukkutagiri with all things provided. In the Mahävihãra the ruler of men
  built twelve great four-sided pasadas, admirable to see and beautiful, aria he
  added a mantling to the thupa of the Dakkhinavihara, and a refectory besides,
  doing away with the boundary of the Mahameghavana. And moving the wall of the
  Mahavihära to the side, he also made a road leading to the Dakkhinavihara. He
  built the Bhutaramavihara and the Ramagonaka, and the arama of Nandatissa
  besides.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the east the king built the
  Anulatissapabbata (vihära) in Gangaraji, the Niyelatissarama and the
  Pilapitthivihara as well as the Rajamahavihara. In like manner he built in
  three places an uposatha-house, in the three following viharas, the
  Kalyanikavihara, the Mandalagirika, also the (vihära) called
  Dubbalavapitissa.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A46"></a> After KANITTHA TISSA's
  death his son, who was known as KHUJJA NAGA, reigned <a name="A47"></a> one
  year. The younger brother of KHUJJA NAGA, KUNCHA NAGA, when he had slain the
  king his brother, reigned two years in Lanka. During the great Ekanalika
  famine the king maintained without interruption a great almsgiving appointed
  for five hundred bhikkhus.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="37"></a><a name="A48"></a> But the
  brother of KUNCHA NAGA's consort, the commander of troops, SIRI NAGA, became a
  rebel against the king, and when he was equipped with troops and horses he
  moved on to the capital and when he, in battle with the king's army, had put
  king KUNCHA NAGA to flight, victorious lie reigned over Lanka nineteen years
  in splendid Anuradhapura. When the king had placed a parasol on the stately
  Great Thupa, he had it gilded in admirable and splendid fashion. He built the
  Lohapasada, keeping it within five stories (height), and he restored the steps
  to the four entrances leading to the great Bodhi-tree. When he had completed
  the parasol and the pasada he commanded offerings at the festival (of the
  consecration); great in compassion, he remitted the tribute of families
  throughout the island.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A49"></a> After the death of SIRI
  NAGA his son VOHARIKA TISSA reigned twenty two years, with knowledge of (the)
  law and (the) tradition. Because he first in this country made a law that set
  aside (bodily) injury (as penalty) he received the name king VOHARIKA TISSA.
  When he had heard the (preaching of the) doctrine by the thera Deva, who dwelt
  in Kappukagama, he restored five buildings. Moreover, contented with the thera
  Mahätissa, who dwelt in Anurarama, he commanded almsgiving in Mucelapattana.
  When the king VOHARIKA TISSA had set up a pavilion in the two great viharas
  and in the eastern temple of the great Bodhi-tree two bronze images, and had
  built also the Sattapannakapasada, goodly to dwell in, he appointed every
  month a thousand (pieces of money) for the Mahavihara. In the
  Abhayagiri-vihara and in the (vihära) called Dakkhinamula, in the
  Maricavatti-vihära and the (vihära) called Kulalitissa, in the
  Mahiyangana-vihara, in the (vihãra) called Mahagamanaga, in the (vihäras)
  called Mahanagatissa, and Kalyäriika he put parasols to their eight thupas.
  In the Mulanagasenapati-vihara and in the Dakkhina (vihara), in the
  Maricavatiivihära and in the (vihara) called Puttabhaga, in the (vihära)
  called Issarasamana and the (vihara) named. VOHARIKA TISSA in Nagadipaka; in
  these six viharas he put up a wall, and he also built an uposatha-house in the
  (vihära) called Anurarama. For the occasions when the Ariyavamsa was read he
  decreed over the whole island a regular giving of alms, from reverence for the
  true doctrine. With the spending of three hundred thousand (pieces of money)
  this king, who was a friend to the doctrine, freed from their indebtedness
  such bhikkhus as were in debt. When he had decreed a great Vesakha-festival,
  he bestowed the three garments on all the bhikkhus dwelling in the island.
  Suppressing the Vetulya-doctrine and keeping heretics in check by his minister
  Kapila, he made the true doctrine to shine forth in glory.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A50"></a> This king's younger
  brother, known as ABHAYA NAGA, who was the queen's lover, being discovered (in
  his guilt) took flight for fear of his brother and went with his serving-men
  to Bhallatittha and as if wroth with him, he had his uncle's hands and feet
  cut off. And that he might bring about division in the kingdom, he left him
  behind here and took his most faithful followers with him, showing them the
  example of the dog, and he himself took ship at the same place and went to the
  other shore. But the uncle, Subbadeva, went to the king and making as if he
  were his friend he wrought division in the kingdom. And that he might have
  knowledge of this, ABHAYA NAGA sent a messenger thither. When Subhadeva saw
  him he loosened (the earth) round about an areca-palm, with the shaft of his
  spear, as he walked round (the tree), and when he had made it thus (to hold)
  but feebly by the roots, he struck it down with his arm; then did he threaten
  the (messenger), and drove him forth.<a name="38"></a> The messenger went and
  told this matter to ABHAYA NAGA. And when he knew this, ABHAYA NAGA took many
  Damilas with him and marched from there against the city to do battle with his
  brother. On news of this the king took flight, and, with his consort, mounting
  a horse he came to Malaya. The younger brother pursued him, and when he had
  slain the king in Malaya, he returned with the queen and reigned eight years
  in the capital as king.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The king set up a vedi of stone round about
  the great Bodhi-tree, and a pavilion in the courtyard of the Lohapasäda. And
  obtaining garments of every kind for twice a hundred thousand (pieces of
  money), he distributed gifts of clothing among the brotherhood of bhikkhus on
  the island.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A51"></a> After ABHAYA NAGA's death,
  SIRI NAGA II, the son of his brother Tissa, reigned two years in Lanka. When
  he had restored the wall round about the great Bodhi-tree, then did this king
  also build in the sand-court' of the temple of the great Bodhitree, to the
  south of the Mucela-tree, the beautiful Hamsavatta and a great pavilion
  besides.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A52"></a> SIRI NAGA's son named
  VIJAYA-KUMARAKA reigned for one year after his father's death.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">(At that time) three Lambakannas lived in
  friendship at Mahiyangana: Samghatissa and Samghabodhi, the third being
  Gothakabhaya. When they were coming (to Anuradhapura) to do service to the
  king, a blind man who had the gift of prophecy, being by the edge of the
  Tissa-tank, cried out at the sound of their footsteps: 'The ground bears here
  three rulers of the earth!' As Abhaya, who was walking last, heard this he
  asked (the meaning of the saying). The other uttered yet again (the prophecy).
  'Whose race will endure?' then asked again the other, and he answered:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'That of the last.' When he had heard that he
  went (on) with the two (others). When they were come into the capital the
  three, being the close and trusted (counsellors) of the king, remained in the
  royal service about the king.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A53"></a> When they together had
  slain king Vijaya in his royal palace the two (others) consecrated SANGHA
  TISSA, the commander of the troops, as king. Thus crowned did SANGHA TISSA
  reign four years in stately Anuradhapura. He set up a parasol on the Great
  Thüpa and gilded it, and moreover the king put four great gems, each worth a
  hundred thousand (pieces of money), in the middle of the four suns,' and put
  upon the spire of the thupa a precious ring of crystal. At the festival of
  (consecrating) the chatta the ruler of men distributed the six garments to the
  brotherhood (in number) forty thousand. As he (one day) when listening to the
  khandhakas' heard from the thera Mahadeva, dwelling in Damahalaka, the sutta
  that sets forth the merit of (a gift of) rice-gruel, he, joyfully believing,
  distributed to the brotherhood at the four gates of the city an abundant and
  well-prepared gift of rice-gruel.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">From time to time the king, with the women of
  the royal household and the ministers, used to go to Pacinadipaka to eat
  jambu-fruits. Vexed by his coming the people dwelling in Pacinadipa poisoned
  the fruit of the jambu-tree from which the king was to eat. When he had eaten
  the jambu-fruits he died forthwith even there. And Abhaya consecrated as king
  Samghabodhi who was charged with the (command of) the army.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A54"></a> The king, who was known by
  the name SIRI SAMGHABODHI, reigned two years in Anuradhapura, keeping the five
  precepts.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Mahavihara he set up a beautiful
  salaka-house. When the king heard that the people of the island were come to
  want by reason of a drought he himself, his heart shaken with pity, lay down
  on the ground in the courtyard of the Great Thüpa, forming the resolve:
  'Unless I be raised up by the water that the god shall rain down I will
  nevermore rise up from hence, even though I die here.' As the ruler of the
  earth lay there thus the god poured down rain forthwith on the whole island of
  Lanka, reviving the wide earth. And even then he did not yet rise up because
  he was not swimming in the water. Then his counsellors closed up the pipes by
  which the water flowed away. And as he now swam in the water the pious king
  rose up. By his compassion did he in this way avert the fear of a famine in
  the island.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the news: 'Rebels are risen here and
  there,' the king had the rebels brought before him, but he released them again
  secretly; then did he send secretly for bodies of dead men, and causing terror
  to the people by the burning of these he did away with the fear from rebels.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A yakkha known as Ratakkhi, who had come
  hither, made red the eyes of the people here and there. If the people did but
  see one another and did but speak of the redness of the eyes they died
  forthwith, and the yakkha devoured them without fear.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the king heard of their distress he lay
  down with sorrowful heart alone in the chamber of fasting, keeping the eight
  uposatha vows, (and said): 'Till I have seen the yakkha I will not rise up.'
  By the (magic) power of his piety the yakkha came to him. To the king's
  (question):</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Who art thou?' he answered: 'It is I, (the
  yakkha).' 'Why dost thou devour my subjects? Swallow them not!' 'Give up to me
  then only the people of one region,' said the other. And being answered: 'That
  is impossible,' he came gradually (demanding ever less and less) to one (man)
  only. The (king) spoke: 'No other can I give up to thee; take thou me and
  devour me.' With the words: 'That is impossible,' the other prayed him (at
  last) to give him an offering in every village. 'It is well,' said the king,
  and over the whole island he decreed that offerings' be brought to the
  entrance of the villages, and these he gave up to him. Thus by the great man,
  compassionate to all beings, by the torch of the island was the fear
  pestilence brought to an end.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="39"></a><a name="A55"></a> The king's
  treasurer, the minister GOTHABHAYA, who had become a rebel, marched from the
  north against the capital. Taking his water-strainer with him the king fled
  alone by the south gate, since he would not bring harm to others.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A man who came, bearing his food in a basket,
  along that road entreated the king again and again to eat of his food. When
  he, rich in compassion, had strained the water and had eaten he spoke these
  words, to show kindness to the other:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'I am the king Samghabodhi; take thou my head
  and show it to GOTHABHAYA, he will give thee much gold.' This he would not do,
  and the king to render him service gave up the ghost even as he sat. And the
  other took the head and showed it to GOTHABHAYA and he, in amazement of
  spirit, gave him gold and carried out the funeral rites of the king with due
  care.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus GOTHABHAYA, also known as
  Meghavannabhaya, ruled thirteen years over Lanka.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">He' built a palace, and when he had built a
  pavilion at the entrance to the palace and had adorned it, even there did he
  daily invite a thousand and eight bhikkhus of the brotherhood to be seated,
  and rejoicing them with rice-gruel and with foods excellent and of many kinds,
  both hard and soft, together with garments, he bestowed alms lavishly upon
  them. Twenty-one days did he continue (to give) thus.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Mahavihara he built a splendid pavilion
  of stone; he renewed the pillars of the Lohapasada. He set up a vedi of stone
  for the great Bodhi -tree and an arched gateway at the northern entrance, and
  likewise at the four corners (of the courtyard) pillars with wheel-symbols.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At three entrances he made three statues of
  stone and at the south gate he set up a throne of stone. To the west of the
  Mahävihära he laid out a tract of land for exercises of meditation, and over
  the island he restored all ruined buildings. In the Thüparama he ordered the
  thupa-temple to be restored and also in the Ambatthala-monastery of the thera
  (Mahinda); and in the arama called Manisoma, and in the Thuparama, in the
  Manisomarama and in the Maricavatti (vihara), and moreover in the vihara
  called Dakkhina (he restored) the uposatha-houses. And he founded also a new
  vihära called Meghavannabhaya and at the (time of) festal offerings at the
  consecration of the vihära he distributed the six garments to thirty thousand
  bhikkhus dwelling on the island, whom he had assembled.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In like manner he appointed then a great
  Vesakha-festival, and yearly did he distribute the six garments to the
  brotherhood. Purifying the doctrine by suppression of heresy he seized
  bhikkhus dwelling in the Abhayagiri (vihära), sixty in number, who had turned
  to the Vetulya-doctrine and were like a thorn in the doctrine of the Buddha,
  and when he had excommunicated them, he banished them to the further coast. A
  bhikkhu from the Cola people, named Samghamitta, who was versed in the
  teachings concerning the exorcism of spirits, and so forth, had attached
  himself to a thera banished thither, and he came hither embittered against the
  bhikkhus of the Mahävihära.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When this lawless (bhikkhu) had thrust himself
  into an assembly in the Thuparama and had refuted there the words of the thera
  living in the parivena of Samghapala, namely the thera GOTHABHAYA, uncle of
  the king on the mother's side, who had addressed the king with his (old) name,
  be became a constant guest in the king's house.' The king who was well pleased
  with him entrusted his eldest son Jetthatissa and his younger son Mahasena, to
  the bhikkhu. And he made the second his favourite, therefore prince
  Jetthatissa bore ill-will to the bhikkhu.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A56"></a> After his father's death
  JETTHA TISSA became king. To punish the hostile ministers who would not go in
  procession with him, at the performing of the king's funeral rites, the king
  himself proceeded forth, and placing his younger brother at the head and then
  the body following close behind, and then the ministers whilst he himself was
  at the end (of the procession), he, when his younger brother and the body were
  gone forth, had the gate closed immediately behind them, and he commanded that
  the treasonous ministers be slain and (their bodies) impaled on stakes round
  about his father's pyre.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because of this deed he came by the surname
  'the Cruel'. But the bhikkhu Samghamitta, for fear of the king, went hence at
  the time of his coronation, when he had taken counsel with MAHASENA, to the
  further coast awaiting the time of (MAHASENA's) consecrating.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">He (JETTHA TISSA) built up to seven stories
  the splendid Lohapasada, that had been left unfinished' by his father, so that
  it was now worth a koti (pieces) of money. When he had offered there a jewel
  worth sixty thousand, Jetthatissa named it the Manipasada.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">He offered two precious gems to the Great
  Thüpa, and he built three gateways to the temple of the great Bodhi-tree.
  When he had built the vihara Pacinatissapabbata the ruler gave it to the
  brotherhood in the five settlements.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The great and beautiful stone image that was
  placed of old by Devanampiyatissa in the Thuparama did king Jetthatissa take
  away from the Thuparama, and set up in the Arama Pacinatissapabbata. He
  bestowed the Kalamattika-tank on the Cetiyapabbata (vihara), and when he
  celebrated the consecrating festival of the vihära and the pasada and (held)
  a great Vesakha-ceremony he distributed the six garments among the
  brotherhood, in number thirty thousand. Jetthatissa also made the
  Alambagama-tank. Accomplishing thus many works of merit, beginning with the
  building of the pasada the king reigned ten years.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, reflecting that sovereignty, being the
  source of manifold works of merit, is at the same time the source of many an
  injustice, a man of pious heart will never enjoy it as if it were sweet food
  mixed with poison.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the thirty-sixth chapter, called
  'The Thirteen Kings', in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the serene joy and
  emotion of the pious.</font>
