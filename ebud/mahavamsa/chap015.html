  THE MAHAVIHARA</font></b></center>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">W</font>HEN they saw that the
  elephant's hail was also too small, the people who had assembled there, full
  of pious zeal, prepared seats for the theras outside the southern gate, in the
  pleasant Nandana-garden' in the royal park, thickly shaded, cool and covered
  with verdure. The thera went forth by the south gate and seated himself there.
  Numbers of women of noble families who came thither sat at the thera's feet
  filling the garden. And to them the thera preached the Balapandita-suttanta. A
  thousand of the women attained to the first stage of salvation. So, there in
  the grove, evening fell.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the theras set forth saying: 'We will go
  hence to the mountain.' And they told the king, and the king came with all
  speed. Approaching the thera he said to him: 'It is evening-time, and the
  mountain is far away; but here in the Nandana-garden is a pleasant place to
  rest.' When they answered: 'It is not fitting (for us) being too near the
  city,' (he said): 'The Mahamegha-park is neither too far nor too near;
  pleasant (is it), and water and shade abound there; may it please you to rest
  there! Thou must turn back, lord!' Then the thera turned back.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The cetiya (afterwards) built on the spot
  where he turned back, near the Kadamba-river, is called therefore
  Nivattacetiya.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Southwards from Nandana the lord of chariots
  himself led the thera to the Mahamegha-park, at the east gate. When the king
  had bidden them prepare fine beds and chairs in fitting wise, in the pleasant
  royal dwelling, and had taken leave of the theras, saying: 'Dwell here in
  comfort,' he returned to the city, surrounded by his ministers; but the theras
  sojourned there that night.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As soon as the morning came, the ruler of the
  land took flowers and visited the theras, greeting them and offering flowers
  in homage, and he asked them: 'Was (your) rest pleasant? Is the garden fitting
  (for you)?'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Pleasant was our rest, O great king, and the
  garden is fitting for ascetics.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And he asked (moreover): 'Is an arama allowed
  to the brotherhood, sir?' 'It is allowed,' replied the thera, who had
  knowledge of that which is allowed and that which is not allowed. And he
  related the accepting of the Veluvanarama. When the other heard it, he
  rejoiced greatly and (all) the people were pleased and joyful.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But the queen Anulä, who had come with five
  hundred women to greet the theras, attained to the second stage of salvation.
  And the queen Anula with her five hundred women said to the king: 'We would
  fain receive the pabbajja-ordination, your Majesty.' The king said to the
  them, 'Bestow ye on them the pabbajja!' But the them made answer to the king:
  It is riot allowed to us. O great king, to bestow the pabbajja on women. But
  in Pataliputta there lives a nun, my younger sister, known by the name
  Samghamitta. She, who is ripe in experience, shall come hither bringing with
  her the southern branch of the great Bodhi-tree of the king of samanas, O king
  of men, and (bringing) also bhikkhunis renowned (for holiness); to this end
  send a message to the king my father. When this then is here she will confer
  the pabbajja upon these women.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'It is well,' said the king, and taking a
  splendid vase he poured water (in token) of giving, over the hand of the thera
  Mahinda with the words: 'This Mahamégha-park do I give to the brotherhood.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As the water fell on the ground, the great
  earth quaked. And the protector of the earth asked the (thera): 'Wherefore
  does the earth quake?' And he replied: 'Because the doctrine is (from
  henceforth) founded in the island.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The noble (king)' offered jasmine-blossoms to
  the thera, and the thera went to the royal dwelling and scattered eight
  handfuls of blossoms about the picula-tree standing on the south side of it.
  And then again the earth quaked and when he was questioned he gave this
  reason: 'Already in the lifetime of three Buddhas there has been here a malaka
  for carrying out the duties of the brotherhood, O king, and now will it be so
  once more.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Northward he went from the royal dwelling to
  the beautiful bathing-tank, and there also the thera scattered as many
  blossoms. And then again did the earth quake, and being asked (the thera) gave
  this reason: 'This, O ruler of the earth, will be the tank with the room for
  warm baths.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the wise (thera) went to the gateway of
  the same king's dwelling and did homage to the spot with (the offering of) as
  many flowers. And here again the earth quaked; and quivering with joy the king
  asked the reason, and the thera told him the reason: 'Here the south branch of
  the Bodhi</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">tree of the three Buddhas' of our age was
  planted, when they had brought it hither, O king, and the south branch of the
  Bodhi-tree of our Tathagata will likewise have its place on this same spot,
  lord of the earth.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the great thera went to the
  Mahamucalamalaka and scattered on that spot as many flowers. And then again
  the earth quaked, and being questioned he told (the king) the reason: 'The
  uposatha-hall of the brotherhood will be here, O lord of the earth.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Afterwards the wise thera went to the place of
  the Pañhambamalaka.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A ripe mango-tree, excellent in colour,
  fragrance and taste and of large size, did the gardener offer to the king, and
  the king offered the splendid (fruit) the thera. The thera, bringer of good to
  mankind, let the king know that he would fain rest seated and forthwith the
  king had a fine carpet spread. When the thera was seated the king gave him the
  mango-fruit. When the thera had eaten it he gave the kernel to the king to
  plant. The king himself planted it there and over it, that it might grow, the
  thera washed his hands. In that same moment a shoot sprouted forth from the
  kernel and grew little by little to a tall tree bearing leaves and fruit.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When those who were present with the king
  beheld this miracle, they stood there doing homage to the thera, their hair
  raising on end (with amazement).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now the thera scattered there eight handfuls
  of flowers and then again the earth quaked. And being asked he gave the
  reason: 'This place will be the place where many gifts shall be distributed,
  which shall be given to the brotherhood, (the bhikkhus) being assembled
  together, O ruler of men.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And he went up to the place where (afterwards)
  the Catussä was, and there he scattered as many flowers, and then again did
  the earth quake. And when the king asked the reason of the earthquake the
  thera made answer: 'On the occasion of the receipt of a royal park by the
  three former Buddhas, on this spot the gifts brought from all parts by the
  dwellers in the island being laid down, the three Blessed Ones and their
  communities accepted them. And now again the Catassala will stand here and
  here will be the refectory of the brotherhood, O lord of men.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">From thence the great thera Mahinda, the
  friend of the island, knowing what was a fitting place, and what unfitting,
  went to the spot where the Great thüpa (afterwards) stood.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At that time there was within the enclosure of
  the royal park a little pond called the Kakudha-pond; at its upper end, on the
  brink of the water, was a level spot fitting for the thupa.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the thera went thither they brought the
  king eight baskets of campaka-flowers. The king offered the campakaflowers to
  the thera and the thera did homage to the spot with the campaka-fiowers. And
  then again the earth quaked, the king asked the reason of the earthquake and
  the thera gave in due order the reasons for the earthquake.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'This place, O great king, which has been
  visited by four Buddhas is worthy of a thupa, to be a blessing and happiness
  to beings.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'In our age of the world there lived first the
  Conqueror Kakusandha, a teacher versed in all truth, compassionate toward all
  the world. At that time this Mahamegha-grove was known as Mahatittha; the
  capital called Abhaya lay eastward on the other side of the Kadamba-river,
  there Abhaya was king. This island then bore the name Ojadipa.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'By (the power of) the demons pestilence arose
  here among</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">the people. When Kakusandha, who was gifted
  with the ten powers,' knew of this misery, then, to bring it to an end and to
  achieve the converting of beings and progress of the doctrine in this island,
  he, urged on by the might of his compassion, came through the air surrounded
  by forty thousand (disciples) like to him, and stood on the Devakuta-mountain.
  By the power of the Sambuddha, O great king, the pestilence ceased then here
  over the whole island.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Standing there, O king of men, the King of
  the Wise, the Great Sage, proclaimed his will: All men in Ojadipa shall see me
  this day, and if they only desire to come (to me) all men shall draw near to
  me without trouble and speedily.&quot;</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'When the king and the townsfolk saw the
  Prince of the Wise, shining and making the mountain to shine, they came
  swiftly thither.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'The people, who were going thither to bring
  offerings to the devaths, believed the Guide of the World with the brotherhood
  to be (such) devatäs. And when the king, greatly rejoicing had greeted the
  King of the Wise, had invited him to a repast and had brought him into the
  city, the monarch then thinking:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'This stately and pleasant place is fitting
  for the resting-place of the Prince of the Wise, with the brotherhood, and not
  too small,&quot; made the Sambuddha and the brotherhood sit here on beautiful
  seats in a fine pavilion raised (by him).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'When the people in the island saw the Guide
  of the world with the brotherhood sitting here they brought gifts holier from
  every side. And the king served the Guide of the World together with the
  brotherhood with his own food, both hard and soft, and with such (foods) as
  were brought by sundry other folk.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'While the Conqueror was seated, after the
  meal, on this very spot, the king offered him the Mahutitthaka-garden as a
  precious gift. When the Mahatitthaka-grove, gay with blossoms at an unwonted
  season, was accepted by the Buddha the great earthquaked. And sitting even
  here, the Master Preached the doctrine; forty thousand persons attained to the
  fruit of the path (of salvation).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'When the Conqueror had stayed the day through
  in the Mahatittha-grove he went in the evening to that plot of ground which
  was fitting for the place of the Bodhi-tree, and after he, sitting there, had
  sunk in deep meditation the Sambuddha, rising from thence again, thought,
  mindful of the salvation of the island-people: Bringing the south branch of my
  Bodhi-tree, the sirisa,' with her, the bhikkhuni Rucanada shall come hither
  with (other) bhikkhunis.&quot;</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'When the theri knew his thought she forthwith
  took the king of that country with her and went to the tree. Then when the
  theri of wondrous power had drawn a line with a pencil of red arsenic around
  the south branch she took the Bodhi-tree thus separated and set it in a golden
  vase, and this, by her miraculous power she brought hither, O great king, with
  (company of her) five hundred bhikkhunis, surrounded by the devatas, and she
  placed it, with its golden vase, in the outstretched right hand of the
  Sambuddha. The Tathugata received the Bodhi-branch and gave it to the king
  Abhaya to plant; the lord of the earth planted it in the Mahatittha garden.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Then the Sambuddha went northwards from this
  place, and sitting in the beautiful Sirisamalaka the Tathagata preached the
  true doctrine to the people. Then, O prince, the conversion of twenty thousand
  living beings took place. Thereupon the Conqueror went yet further north to
  that plot of ground where (afterwards) the Thuparama. stood, and after he,
  sitting there, had sunk into meditation, the Sambuddha rising from thence
  again preached the doctrine to those around him, and even at that place did
  ten thousand living beings attain to the fruit of the path (of salvation).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Giving his own holy drinking vessel for the
  homage of the people and leaving the bhikkhuni here with her following and
  also his disciple Mahadeva with a thousand bhikkhus, the Sambuddha went
  eastward from thence, and standing on the place of the Ratanamala, he
  delivered exhortations to the people; then rising in the air with the
  brotherhood the Conqueror returned to Jambudipa.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Second in our age of the world was the Lord
  Konagamana, the all-knowing Teacher, compassionate toward all the world.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'At that time this Mahamegha-grove was known
  as Mabänoma, the capital called Vaddhamana, lay to the south. Samiddha was
  the name of the king of that region then. This island then bore the name
  Varadipa.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'At that time the misery of drought prevailed
  here in Varadipa. When the Conqueror Konagamana knew of this misery, then, to
  bring it to an end, and afterwards to achieve the converting of beings and
  progress of the doctrine in this island, he, urged on by the might of his
  compassion, came through the air, surrounded by thirty thousand (disciples)
  like to himself, and stood upon the Sumanakütaka-mountain. By the power of
  the Sambuddha the drought came to an end, an4 from the time that the decline
  of the doctrine ceased rainfall in due season now began.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'And standing there, O king of men, the King
  of the Wise, the Great Sage, proclaimed his will: &quot; All men in Varadipa
  shall see me this day, and if they only desire to come (to me) all men shall
  draw near to me without trouble and speedily.&quot;</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'When the king and the townsfolk saw the
  Prince of the Wise, shining and making the mountain to shine, they came
  swiftly thither.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'The people who were going thither to bring
  offerings to the devatas believed the Guide of the World with the brotherhood
  to be (such) devatãs. And when the king, greatly rejoicing, had greeted the
  King of the Wise, had invited him to a repast, and had brought him to the
  city, the monarch then thinking: &quot;This stately and pleasant place, is
  fitting for the resting-place of the Prince of the Wise with the brotherhood
  and not too small,&quot; made the Sambuddha and the brotherhooà sit here on
  beautiful seats in a fine pavilion raised (by him).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'When the people of the island saw the Guide
  of the World with the brotherhood sitting here, they brought gifts hither from
  every side. And the king served the Guide of the World together with the
  brotherhood with his own food, both hard and soft, and with such (foods) as
  were brought by sundry other folk.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'While the Conqueror was sitting, after the
  meal on this very spot, the king offered him the Mahanoma-garden as a precious
  gift. And when the Mahanoma-grove, gay with: blossoms at an unwonted season,
  was accepted by the Buddha the great earthquaked. And sitting even here, the
  Master preached the doctrine; then thirty thousand persons attained to the
  fruit of the path (of salvation).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'When the Conqueror had stayed the day through
  in the Mahanoma-grove, he went in the evening to that plot of ground where the
  former Bodhi-tree had stood, and after he, sitting there, had sunk in deep
  meditation, the Sambuddha, rising from thence again, thought, mindful of the
  salvation of the island-people: &quot;Bringing the south branch of my Bodhi
  tree, the udumbara' with her, the bhikkhuii Kantakananda shall come hither
  with (other) bhikkhunis.&quot;</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'When the theri knew his thought she forthwith
  took the king of that region with her and went to the tree. Then when the
  theri of wondrous power had drawn a line with a pencil of red arsenic around
  the south branch, she took the Bodhi-tree thus separated, and set it in a
  golden vase, and this, by her miraculous power, she brought hither, O great
  king, with (her company of) five hundred bhikkhunis, surrounded by the
  devatäs, and she placed it, with its golden vase, in the outstretched right
  hand of the Sambuddha. The Tathagata received it and gave it to the king
  Samiddha to plant; the lord of the earth planted it there in the Mahänoma
  garden.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Then the Sambuddha went northward from the
  Sirisamala and preached the doctrine to the people, sitting in the
  Nagamälaka. When they heard the preaching of the doctrine, O king, the
  conversion of twenty thousand living beings took place. When he had gone yet
  further northward to the place where the former Buddha had sat, and after he,
  sitting there, had sunk into meditation, the Sambuddha, rising from thence
  again, preached the doctnne to those around him, and even at that place did
  ten thousand living beings attain to the fruit of the path (of salvation).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Giving his girdle as a relic for the homage
  of the people, and leaving the bhikkhuni here with her following and also his
  disciple Mahasumba with a thousand bhikkhus, the Sambuddha, standing on this
  side of the Ratanamäla in the Sudassanamala, delivered exhortations to the
  people; then rising with the brotherhood into the air, the Conqueror returned
  to Jambudipa.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Third in our age of the world was the
  Conqueror of the Kassapa clan, the all-knowing Teacher, compassionate toward
  the whole world.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'The Mahamegha-grove was called (at that time)
  Mahasagara; the capital, named Visãla, lay toward the West. Jayanta was the
  name of the king of that region then, and this isle bore then the name of
  Mandaipa.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'At that time a hideous and life-destroying
  war had broken out between king Jayanta and his younger royal brother. When
  Kassapa, gifted with the ten powers, the Sage, full of compassion, knew how
  great was the wretchedness caused to beings by this war, then, to bring it to
  an end and afterwards to achieve the converting of beings and progress of the
  doctrine in this island, he, urged on by the might of his compassion, came
  through the air surrounded by twenty thousand (disciples) like to himself, and
  he stood on the Subhakuta-mountain.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Standing there, O king of men, the King of
  the Wise, the Great Sage, proclaimed his will: &quot;All men in Mandadipa
  shall see me this day; and if they only desire to come (to me) all men shall
  draw near to me without trouble and speedily.&quot;</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'When the king and the townsfolk saw the
  Prince of the Wise, shining and making the mountain to shine, they came
  swiftly thither. The many people who were coming to the mountain bringing
  offerings to the devatas, that their own side might win the victory, believed
  the Guide of the World with the brotherhood to be (such) devatas; and the king
  and the prince amazed, halted in their battle. When the king, greatly
  rejoicing, had greeted the King of the Wise, had invited him to a repast and
  had brought him to the city, the monarch then thinking: &quot;This stately and
  pleasant place is I fitting for the resting-place of the King of the Wise with
  the brotherhood and not too small,&quot; made the Sambuddha and I the
  brotherhood sit here on beautiful seats in a fine pavilion raised (by him).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'When the people of the island saw the Guide
  of the 'World I with the brotherhood sitting here, they brought gifts hither
  from every side. And the king served the Guide of the World together with the
  brotherhood with his own food, both hard and soft, and with such (foods) as
  were brought by sundry other folk.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'While the Conqueror was sitting, after the
  meal, on this very spot, the king offered him the Mahasagara-garden as a
  precious gift. And when the Mahasagara-grove, gay with blossoms at an unwonted
  season, was accepted by the Buddha, the great earth quaked. And sitting even
  here, the Master preached the doctrine; then twenty thousand persons attained
  to the fruit of the path (of salvation).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'When the Blessed One had staved the day
  through in the Mahasagara-grove, he went in the evening to that plot of ground
  where the former Bodhi-trees had stood, and after he, sitting there, had sunk
  into deep meditation, the Sambuddha, rising from thence again, thought,
  mindful of the salvation of the island-people, sBringing the south branch of
  my Bodhitree, the nigrodha,' with her, the bhikkhuni Sudhammã shall come now
  with (other) bhikkhunis.&quot;</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'When the theri knew his thought she forthwith
  took the king' of that region with her and went to the tree. Then when the
  theri of wondrous power had drawn a line with a pencil of red arsenic around
  the south branch, she took the Bodhi-branch thus separated and set it in a
  golden vase, and this, by her miraculous power, she brought hither, O great
  king, with (her company of) five hundred bhikkhunis, surrounded by the
  devatas; and she placed it with its golden vase, in the out-stretched right
  hand of the Sambuddha the Tathagata recieved it and gave it to the king
  Jayanta to plant; the lord of the earth planted it there in the
  Mahasagara-garden.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Then the Buddha went northward from the
  Nagamalaka and preached the doctrine to the people seated in the Asokamalaka.
  When they heard the preaching of the doctrine,</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">o ruler of men, even there the conversion of
  four thousand living beings took place. When he had then gone yet further
  northward to the place where the former Buddhas had sat, and after he, sitting
  there, had sunk into meditation, the Sambuddha, rising from thence again,
  preached the doctrine to those around him; and even in that place did ten
  thousand living beings attain to the fruit of the path (of salvation).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Giving his rain-cloak as a relic for the
  homage of the people, and leaving the bhikkhuni here with her following, and
  also his disciple Sabbananda with a thousand bhikkhus, he, standing on this
  side of the river (and) of the Sudassanamäla in the Somanassamalaka,
  delivered exhortations to the people; then rising with the brotherhood into
  the air, the Conqueror returned to Jambudipa.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Fourth in our age of the world lived the
  Conqueror Gotama, the teacher, knowing the whole truth, compassionate toward
  the whole world. When he came hither the first time he drove forth the
  yakkhas, when he came hither again the second time he subdued the nagas. When,
  besought by the naga Maniakkhi in Kalyani, he returned the third time, he took
  his meal there with the brotherhood; and when he had taken</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">his ease'in the place where the former
  Bodhi-trees bad stood and in the place here appointed for the thupa and (also)
  in the place (appointed for the guarding) of those (things) used by him (and
  left as) relics, and when he had gone to this side of the place where the
  former Buddhas had stood, the great Sage, the Light of the World, since there
  were then no human beings in Lankadipa, uttered exhortations to the host of
  devatAs, dwelling in the island, and to the nagas; then rising into the air
  with the brotherhood the Conqueror returned to Jambudipa.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Thus was this place, O king, visited by four
  Buddhas; on this spot, O great king, will the thüpa stand hereafter, with the
  relic-chamber for a dona of the relics of the Buddha's body; (it will be) a
  hundred and twenty cubits4 high and (will be) known by the name Hemamali.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then said the ruler of the earth: 'I myself
  will build it.' 'For thee, O king, are many other tasks to fulfil here. Do
  thou carry them out; but one descended from thee shall build this (thüpa). A
  son of thy brother the vice-regent Mahanama, one named Yatthalayakatissa, will
  hereafter be king, his son will be the king named Gothabhaya; his son will be
  (the king) named Kakavannatissa; this king's son, O king, will be the great
  king named Abhaya, renowned under the title Dutthagamini: he, great in glory,
  wondrous power and prowess, will build the thupa here.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus spoke the thera, and because of the
  thera's words the monarch set up here a pillar of stone, whereon he inscribed
  these sayings. And as the great and most wise thera, Mahinda of wondrous
  power, accepted the pleasant Mahamegha-grove the Tissarsama, he, the
  unshakeable caused the earth to quake in eight aces' and when going his round
  for alms he had entered the city like unto the ocean and had taken his meal in
  the king's house, he left the palace, and when, sitting there in the
  Nandana-grove, he had preached to the people the sutta Aggikkhandhopama and
  had made a thousand persons partakers in the fruit of the path (of
  sanctification) he rested (again) in the Mahamegha-grove.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the thera had eaten on the third day in
  the king's house, and sitting in the Nandana-grove had preached the
  Asivisupama, and had thereby led a thousand persons to conversion, the thera
  went thence to the Tissäräma.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But the king, who had heard the preaching,
  seated himself at the thera's feet and asked: 'Does the doctrine of the
  Conqueror stand, sir?' 'Not yet, O ruler of men, only, O lord of nations, when
  the boundaries are established here for the uposatha-ceremony and the other
  acts (of religion), according to the command of the Conqueror, shall the
  doctrine stand.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus spoke the great thera, and the king
  answered thus:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'I will abide under the Buddha's command, thou
  Giver of light! Therefore establish the boundaries with all speed, taking in
  the city.' Thus spoke the great king and the thera answered thus: 'If it be
  so, then do thou thyself, lord of the earth, mark out the course of the
  boundary; we will establish it.' 'It is well,' said the lord of the earth, and
  even like the king of the gods leaving the Nandana (garden) he went forth from
  the Mahameghavanarama into his palace.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the thera on the fourth day had eaten in
  the king's house, he preached, sitting in the Nandana-grove, the
  Anamatagga-discourse and when he had given there a thousand persons to drink
  of the draught of immortality, the great thera went to the Mahameghavanarama.
  But having commanded in the morning to beat the drum and to adorn the splendid
  city and the road leading to the vihara and all around the vihara, the lord of
  chariots came upon his car to his äräma, adorned with all his ornaments,
  together with his ministers and the women of the harem, with chariots troops
  and beasts for riders, in a mighty train.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he had here sought out the theras and
  paid his respects to these to whom respet was due, he ploughed a furrow in a
  circle, making it to begin near the ford on the Kadamba-river, and ended it
  when he (again) reached the river.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he had assigned boundary-marks on the
  furrow that the king had ploughed and had assigned the boundaries for
  thirty-two malakas and for the Thuparama, the great thera of lofty wisdom,
  then fixed the inner boundary-marks likewise according to custom; and thus the
  ruler (of his senses) did on one and the same day establish all the
  boundaries. The great earth quaked when the fixing of the boundaries was
  completed.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When on the fifth day the thera had eaten in
  the king's house he preached, sitting in the Nandana-grove, the
  Khajjaniya-suttanta, to a great multitude of people, and when he</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">had given to drink of the ambrosial draught to
  a thousand persons there, he rested (again) in the Mahamegha-grove.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When also on the sixth day the thera had
  eaten. in the king's house he preached, sitting in the Nandana-grove, the
  Gomayapirnjr-sutta,' and after the wise preacher had thus brought a thousand
  persons to conversion he rested (again) in the Mahamegha-grove.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When on the seventh day the thera had eaten in
  the king's house he preached, sitting in the Nandana-garden, the
  Dhammacakkappavattana-suttanta, and having brought a thousand persons to
  conversion he rested (again) in the Mabamegha-grove, when he, the light-giver,
  bad in this wise brought eight thousand five hundred persons to conversion in
  the space of only seven days.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Nandana-grove being the place where the
  holy one had made the true doctrine to shine forth, is called the Jotivana.
  And in the very first days the king commanded that a pasada be built for the
  thera in the Tissäräma, and he had the bricks of clay dried speedily with
  fire. The dwelling-house was dark-coloured and therefore they named it the
  Kalapasadaparivena.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then did he set up a building for the great
  Bodhi-tree, the Lohapasada, a salaka-house, and a seemly refectory. He built
  many parivenas in an excellent manner, and bathingtanks and buildings for
  repose, by night and by day, and so forth. The parivena on the brink of the
  bathing-tank (which was allotted) to the blameless (thera) is called the
  Sunhätaparivena. The parivena on the spot where the excellent Light of the
  Island used to walk up and down is called Dighacañkamana. But the parivena
  which was built where he had sat sunk in the meditation that brings the
  highest bliss is called from this the Phalagga-parivena. The (parivena built
  there) where the thera had seated himself leaning against a support is called
  from this the Therapassaya-parivena/. The (parivena built) where many hosts of
  gods had sought him out and sat at his feet is therefore called the
  Marugana-parivena. The commander of the king's troops, Dighasandana, built a
  little pasada for the thera with eight great pillars. This famed parivena, the
  home of renowned men, is called the Dighasandasenapati-parivena.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The wise king, whose name contains the words
  'beloved of the gods', patronizing the great thera Mahinda, of spotless mind,
  first built here in Lanka this Mahävihära.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the fifteenth chapter, called 'The
  Acceptance of the Mahavihara', in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the serene joy
  and emotion of the pious.</font>
