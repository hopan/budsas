  VERSION</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he resplendant and
  beautiful isle we know as Sri Lanka has a long historical recorded. This rich
  and vibrant history is faithfully recored in the chronicle we have come to
  know as the <i>Mahavamsa</i>. The <i>Mahavamsa</i> or otherwise known as the
  &quot;Great Chronicle&quot; is the single most important work of Lankan
  origin. It describes the life and times of the people who forged our nation,
  from the coming of Vijaya in 543 BC to the final takeover by the British in
  1815. The <i>Mahavamsa</i> itself is actually comprised of three parts, all
  written at different times in Lankan history.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first part was written in the 6th century
  AD by King Dhatusena's brother, the venerable thera Mahanama. His work was
  greatly influenced by the <i>Dipavamsa</i> written five centuries earlier. It
  describes the foundation of the Lankan monarchy with the consecration of King
  Vijaya and continues to the end of King Mahasena's rule in the 4th century AD.
  The second part of the <i>Mahavamsa</i>, more commonly known as the <i>Culavamsa</i>
  was written in the 13th century AD. This chronicles the time between the
  arrival of the Tooth Relic in the 4th century AD and the end of the reign of
  King Parakramabahu the Great. Credit for this part is given to the thero
  Dhammakitti, but many historians believed that it was authored by many monks.
  The third and final part was written over many years, concluding in the year
  1815, when the British occupied the whole of Lanka by military force. <! took full control of the island.>
  </font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The official translation of the <i>Mahavamsa</i>
  from Pali was completed by Wilhelm Geiger in 1912 and subsequently the <i>Culavamsa</i>
  in 1930. The first English translation of the <i>Mahavamsa</i> from Mr.
  Geiger's native German was done by Mrs. Mabel Haynes Bode. Overall, the
  Chronicle has over 200,000 words of text in about 960 printed pages. It is as
  I mentioned earlier divided into three parts. Mr.Geiger called the first part
  (Chapters 1-37) the <i>Mahavamsa</i>, the second part (Chapters 38-79) the <i>Culavamsa
  I</i>, and the third and final part (Chapters 80-101) the <i>Culavamsa II</i>.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I felt it imperative that this national
  treasure be put on the Web, so beginning in July of 2002, I began scanning the
  text of the <i>Mahavamsa</i>. Using OCR (optical character recognition)
  technology, I translated the text onto my computer and then began the long
  task of hand editing any mistakes. The whole process of scanning, editing, and
  writing the HTML for the first 37 chapters took me a total of three weeks.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">What you will see on this website is only the
  first 37 chapters of the <i>Mahavamsa</i> as written by the Thera Mahanama. I
  hope to OCR and put online the complete <i>Culavamsa</i> as and when time
  permits over the next two years left for me in high school.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To further aid your reading of the <i>Mahavamsa</i>,
  I have included many supplements including: a <a href="gene.html" tppabs="http://lakdiva.org/mahavamsa/gene.html">geneology
  of kings</a>, an <a href="wars.html" tppabs="http://lakdiva.org/mahavamsa/wars.html">index
  of battles and wars</a> mentioned in the <i>Mahavamsa</i>, a <a href="kings.html" tppabs="http://lakdiva.org/mahavamsa/kings.html">list
  of sovereigns</a> from Vijaya to Mahasena with corresponding links, and a list
  of <a href="pali.html" tppabs="http://lakdiva.org/mahavamsa/pali.html">Pali
  words</a> that occur in the text. The end notes however are not included in
  this website. If you find yourself lost, please consult the actual book or
  email me.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I hope you enjoy exploring the <i>Mahavamsa</i>
  in this E-book I have made available on the World Wide Web at the
  <a href="http://lakdiva.org/">Lakdiva </a>site. For more information on Lankan history, please visit the other

  <p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">PREFACE</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">A</font> few words are
  necessary to explain how the present work came to be written; and one or two
  points should be mentioned regarding the aims it is hoped to achieve. Early in
  1908 the Government of Ceylon was contemplating a new and revised edition of
  Turner's translation of the Mahavamsa, published in 1837 and reprinted in L.
  C. Wijesinha's Mahavamsa published in 1889, and were in correspondence on the
  subject with the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. The Society
  appointed a numerous and influential Committee, and recommended myself as
  Editor for Europe.' By their letter of July 18, 1908, the Government of Ceylon
  requested me to undertake that post. I took the opportunity at the Congress of
  Orientalists held at Copenhagen in August, and again at the Congress on the
  History of Religions held in September at Oxford, to consult my colleagues on
  the best plan for carrying out the proposed revision. They agreed that the
  method most likely to lead to a satisfactory result within a reasonable time
  was to entrust the work to one competent critical scholar who could, if
  necessary, consult members of the Ceylon Committee, but who should be himself
  responsible for all the details of the work. I reported to Government
  accordingly, and recommended that Prof. Geiger, who had just completed his
  edition of the text, should be asked to undertake the task. The Government
  approved the plan, and asked me to make the necessary arrangements. Those
  arrangements have resulted in the publication of the present volume.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Professor Geiger has made a translation into
  German of his own revised critical edition published by the Pali Text Society
  in 1908; and added the necessary introduction, appendices, and notes. Mrs.
  Bode has translated the German into English; and Professor Geiger has then
  revised the English translation.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The plan has been to produce a literal
  translation, as nearly as possible an absolutely correct reproduction of the
  statements recorded in the Chronicle. It is true there is considerable
  literary merit in the original poem, and that it may be possible hereafter to
  attempt a reproduction also, in English unrhymed verse, of the literary spirit
  of the poem. But a literal version would still be indispensable for historical
  purposes. For similar reasons it has been decided to retain in the translation
  certain technical terms used in the Buddhist Order. In a translation aiming at
  literary merit some English word more or less analogous in meaning might be
  used, regardless of the fact that such a word would involve implications not
  found in the original. Thus bhikkku has often been rendered 'priest' or
  'monk'. But a bhikkku claims no such priestly powers as is implied by the
  former term, and would yield no such obedience as is implied in the other; and
  to discuss all the similarities and differences between these three ideas
  would require a small treatise. There are other technical terms of the same
  kind. It is sufficient here to explain that when such terms are left, in the
  present translation, untranslated, it is because an accurate translation is
  not considered possible. Most of them are, like bkikkhu, already intelligible
  to those who are likely to use this version. But they are shortly explained in
  footnotes; and a list of them, with further interpretation, will be found at
  the end of the volume.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Ceylon Government has defrayed the expense
  of this, as it did of the previously published translations of the Mahavamsa.</font>
