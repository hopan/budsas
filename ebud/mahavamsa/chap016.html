  alms and showing favour to the people (by preaching); eating in the king's
  house and showing favour to the king (by preaching) the thera dwelt twenty-six
  days in the Mahamegha-grove. But when, on the thirteenth day of the bright
  half of the month Asalha, the lofty souled (thera) had eaten in the great
  king's house and had preached (to him) the Mahappamada-suttanta, he went
  thence, for he would fain have a vihüra founded on the Cetiya-mountain,
  departing by the east gate (he went) to the Cetiya-mountain.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the king heard that the thera had gone
  thither he mounted his car, and taking the two queens with him he followed
  hard after the thera. When the theras had bathed in the Nagacatukka-tank they
  stood in their due order to go up to the mountain-top. Then the king stepped
  down from the car and stood there respectfully greeting the theras.
  ''Wherefore, 0 king, art thou come wearied by the heat?' they said; and on the
  reply: 'Troubled by your departure am I come,' the theras answered: 'We are
  come to spend the rain-season even here,' and lie who was versed in the rules
  (of the order), expounded to the king the chapter concerning the vassa.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the king's nephew, the chief minister
  Maharittha, who stood near the king with his fifty-five elder and younger
  brothers, heard this, after seeking the king's leave, they received the
  pabbajjä that very day from the thera, and all these wise men attained to
  arahantship even in the shavinghail.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the king, on that same day, had made a
  beginning with the work of building sixty-eight rock-cells about (the place
  where) the Kantaka-cetiya (afterwards stood), he returned to the city; but the
  theras remained in that spot, going at the appointed time, full of compassion
  (for the people) to the city to beg alms there.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the work on the rock-cells was finished,
  on the fullmoon day of the month Asalha, the king came and gave the vihara to
  the theras as a consecrated offering.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the thera, who had passed beyond the
  boundaries (of evil) had established the boundaries for the thirty-two
  mälakas and the vihara, then did he on the very same day in the
  Tumbaru-malaka, which was marked out as the first of all, confer the
  upasampada on all those who were weary of the pabajja. And these sixty-two
  arahants, taking up their abode during the rain-season all together on the
  Cetiya mountain, showed favour to the king (by their teaching).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And, in that the hosts of gods and men drew
  near with reverence to him, the leader of the host (of his disciples), and to
  his company that had attained to wide renown for virtue, they heaped up great
  merit.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the sixteenth chapter, called 'The
  Acceptance of the Cetiyapabbata-vihaira, in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the
  serene joy and emotion of the pious.</font>
