  </center><center><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">THE BEGINNING OF THE
  GREAT THUPA</font></b></center>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">W</font>HEN the wherewithal to
  build was thus brought together he began the work of the Great Thupa on the
  full-moon day of the month Vesakha, when the Visakha-constellation had
  appeared. When he had ordered to take away the stone pillar the lord of the
  land had the place for the thüpa dug out to a depth of seven to make it firm
  in every way. Round stones that he commanded his soldiers to bring hither did
  he cause to be broken with hammers, and then did he, having knowledge of the
  right and the wrong ways, command that the crushed stone, to make the ground
  firmer, be stamped down by great elephants whose feet were bound with leather.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fine clay that is to be found on the spot,
  for ever moist, where the heavenly Ganga falls down (upon the earth ) (on a
  space) thirty yojanas around, is called because of its fineness,
  'butter-clay.' Samaneras who had overcome the asavas, brought the clay hither
  from that place. The king commanded that the clay be spread over the layer of
  stones and that bricks then be laid over the clay, over these a rough cement
  and over this cinnabar, and over this a network of iron, and over this
  sweet-scented marumba that was brought by the samaneras from the Himalaya.
  Over this did the lord of the land command them to lay mountain-crystal. Over
  the layer of mountain-crystal he had stones spread; everywhere throughout the
  work did the clay called butter-clay serve (as cement). With resin of the
  kapittha -tree,' dissolved in sweetened water, the lord of chariots laid over
  the stones a sheet of copper eight inches thick, and over this, with arsenic
  dissolved in sesamum-oil, (he laid) a sheet of silver seven inches thick.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the king, glad at heart, had thus had
  preparation made upon the spot where the Great Thüpa was to be built, he
  arranged, on the fourteenth day of the bright half of the month Asalha, an
  assembly of the brotherhood of the bhikkhus, and spoke thus: 'To-morrow,
  venerable sirs, I shall lay the foundation-stone of the Great Cetiya. Then let
  our whole brotherhood assemble here, to the end that a festival may be held
  for the Buddha, mindful of the weal of the people; and let the people in
  festal array, with fragrant flowers and so forth, come to-morrow to the place
  where the Great Thupa will be built.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">He entrusted ministers with the adorning of
  the place of the cetiya. Commanded by the lord of men, they, filled with deep
  reverence for the Sage (Buddha), adorned the place in manifold ways. The whole
  city also and the streets leading thither did the king command to be adorned
  in manifold ways. On the following morning he placed at the four gates of the
  city many barbers and servants for the bath and for cutting the-hair, clothes
  likewise and fragrant flowers and sweet foods (did) the king (place there) for
  his people's good, he who rejoiced in the people's welfare. Taking, according
  to their wish, the things thus put before them, townsfolk and country-people
  went to the place of the thüpa.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The king supported, in order of their rank, by
  many ministers, richly clothed as befitted their office, surrounded by many
  dancers richly clothed like to celestial nymphs, (be himself) being clad in
  his state-raiment, attended by forty thousand men, while around him crashed
  the music (he being) glorious as the king of the gods; in the evening he who
  had knowledge of fit and unfit places went to the place of the Great Thupa,
  delighting the people (with the sight). A thousand and eight waggon-loads of
  clothes rolled in bundles did the king place in the midst, and on the four
  sides he had clothes heaped up in abundance; and moreover he had honey,
  clarified butter, sugar and so forth set (there) for the festival.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">From various (foreign) countries also did many
  bhikkhus come hither; what need to speak of the coming of the brotherhood
  living here upon the island? With eighty thousand bhikkhus from the region of
  Rajagaha came the thera Indagutta, the head of a great school. From Isipatana
  came the great thera Dhammasena with twelve thousand bhikkhus to the place of
  the cetiya.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">With sixty thousand bhikkhus came hither the
  great thera Piyadassi from the Jetarama-vihara. From the Mahavana (monastery)
  in Vesali came the thera Urubuddharakkhita with eighteen thousand bhikkhus.
  From the Ghositarama in Kosambi came the thera Urudbammarakkhita with thirty
  'thousand bhikkhus. From the Dakkhinagiri in Ujjeni came the thera
  Urusamgharakkhita with forty thousand ascetics.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">With a hundred and sixty thousand bhikkhus
  came the thera named Mittinna from the Asokarama in Pupphapura. From the
  Kasmira country came the thera Utinna bringing with him two hundred and eighty
  thousand bhikkhus. The wise Mahadeva came from Pallavabhogga with four hundred
  and sixty thousand bhikkhus, and from Alasanda the city of the Yonas came the
  thera Yonamahadhammarakkhita with thirty thousand bhikkhus. From his dwelling
  by the road through the Vinjha forest mountains, came the thera Uttara with
  sixty thousand bhikkhus.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The great thera Cittagutta came hither from
  the Bodhimanda-vihara with thirty thousand bhikkhus. The great thera
  Candagutta came hither from the Vanavasa country with eighty thousand
  ascetics. The great thera Suriyagutta came from the great Kelasa-vihara with
  ninety-six thousand bhikkhus. As for the number of the bhikkhus dwelling in
  the island who met together from every side, no strict account has been handed
  down by the ancients. Among all these bhikkhus who were met in that assembly
  those alone who had overcome the äsavas, as it is told, were ninety-six kotis</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">These bhikkhus stood according to their rank
  around the place of the Great Thupa, leaving in the midst an open space for
  the king. As the king stepped into this (space) and saw the brotherhood of
  bhikkhus standing thus he greeted them joyfully, with believing heart; when he
  had then duly offered them fragrant flowers and had passed round them three
  times, turning to the left,' he went into the midst, to the consecrated place
  of the 'filled pitcher'. Then forthwith uplifted by the power of pure gladness
  he, devoted to the welfare of the beings, commanded that the pure turning
  staff (for tracing the circular boundary), made of silver and secured (by
  means of a rope) to a post of gold, be grasped by a minister of noble birth,
  well attired and in festival array, and, being resolved to allot a great space
  for the cetiya, he ordered him to walk round (with the turning staff in his
  hands) along the ground already prepared. But the great thera of wondrous
  power named Siddhattha, the far-seeing, prevented the king as he did this.
  Reflecting: 'If our king shall begin to build so great a thupa death will come
  upon him, ere the thüpa be finished; moreover, so great a thupa will be hard
  to repair,' he, looking to the future, prevented (the measuring of)that great
  dimension. In agreement with the brotherhood and from reverence toward the
  thera, the king, though he would fain have made (the thupa) great, hearkened
  to the thera's word and did, according to the thera's instruction, allot a
  moderate space for the cetiya, that the (foundation) stones might be laid.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Eight vases of silver and eight (vases) of
  gold did he, with tireless zeal, place in the midst, and in a circle around
  these he placed a thousand and eight new vases, and likewise (around each of
  these) a hundred and eight garments.' Eight splendid bricks did he lay, each
  one apart by itself. When he then had commanded an official chosen for this
  and adorned in every way to take one of them, he laid on the east side, which
  had been prepared with many ceremonies, the first foundation stone, solemnly,
  upon the sweet-smelling clay.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When jasmine-flowers had been offered on that
  spot an earthquake came to pass. And he caused the other seven (stones) to be
  laid by seven (other) ministers and ceremonies (of consecration) to be carried
  out. Thus he caused the stones to be laid on the day appointed, the fifteenth
  uposatha day in the bright half of the month Asalha.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he had reverentially greeted the four
  great theras who were free from the asavas, who stood there at the four
  heavenly quarters, and when he had honoured them with gifts he came in due
  course, greatly rejoicing, to the north-east side, and when he (here) had
  greeted the great thera Piyadassi, who was free from the asavas, he took his
  place near him. Exalting the festival ceremony there this thera preached the
  true doctrine to him; the preaching of the thera was rich in blessing for the
  people. The conversion of forty thousand to the true doctrine took place, and
  (yet) forty thousand (more) became partakers in the fruit of entering into the
  path of salvation. A thousand lay-folk became even such as have but one
  (earthly) existence before them, a thousand became such as have no other
  (earthly) existence (to come), and a thousand also became arahants.' Eighteen
  thousand bhikkhus and fourteen thousand bhikkhunis attained to arahantship.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even so may every one whose heart is inclined
  to (faith in) the Three Gems, knowing that by a benefactor of mankind, whose
  heart is set on generous giving, the highest blessing is brought to pass for
  the world, strive toward the attainment of many virtues, as faith and so
  forth.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the twenty-ninth chapter, called
  'The beginning of the Great Thupa', in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the serene
  joy and emotion of the pious.</font>
