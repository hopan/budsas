  </center><center><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">THE MAKING OF THE
  RELIC-CHAMBER</font></b></center>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">W</font>HEN the great king had
  reverentially greeted the whole brotherhood he invited them, saying: 'Even
  till the cetiya is finished accept ye alms from me.' The brotherhood would not
  consent; when he then by degrees' prayed (them to accept) for a week he won
  acceptance, for one week, by the half of the bhikkhus. When he had obtained
  this from them he, satisfied, had pavilions set up in eighteen places around
  the place of the thupa and commanded there, for one week, lavish gifts to the
  brotherhood. Then he gave the brotherhood leave to depart.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thereupon commanding that the drums be beaten
  he called the master-builders together with all speed; in number they were
  five hundred. And one of them answered the king, on his asking: 'How wilt thou
  make (the thupa)?' 'Taking a hundred workmen I will use one waggon-load of
  sand in one day.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The king rejected him. Thereon they offered
  (to work with) one half less and yet one half less again, and (at last with)
  two ammanas of sand. These four master-builders also did the king reject. Then
  an experienced and shrewd masterbuilder said to the king: 'I shall pound (the
  sand) in a mortar, and then, when it is sifted, have it crushed in the mill
  and (thus will use) one ammana (only) of sand.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And on these words the lord of the land, whose
  courage was like to Indra's, consented, with the thought: There will be no
  grass nor any such thing on our cetiya, and he questioned him saying: 'In what
  form wilt thou make the cetiya?' At that moment Vissakamma entered into (and
  possessed) him. When the master-builder had had a golden bowl filled with
  water, he took water in his hand and let it fall on the surface of the water.
  A great bubble rose up like unto a half-globe of crystal. He said: 'Thus will
  I make it.' And well-pleased the king bestowed on him a pair of garments worth
  a thousand (pieces of money) and ornamented shoes and twelve thousand
  kahapanas.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'How shall I have the bricks transported
  without laying burdens on the people?' Thus pondered the king in the
  night-time; when the gods were aware of this they brought night after night
  bricks to the four gates of the cetiya and laid them down there, always as
  many as sufficed for one day. When the king heard this, glad at heart, he
  began work on the thüpa. And he made it known: 'Work shall not be done here
  without wage.' At every gate he commanded to place sixteen hundred thousand
  kahapanas, very many garments, different ornaments, solid and liquid foods and
  drink withal, fragrant flowers, sugar and so forth, as well as the five
  perfumes for the mouth.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Let them take of these as they will when they
  have laboured as they will.' Observing this command the king's work-people
  allotted (the wages).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A bhikkhu who wished to take part in the
  building of the thupa took a lump of clay which he himself had prepared, went
  to the place of the cetiya, and deceiving the king's work-people, he gave it
  to a workman. So soon as he received it he knew what it was, perceiving the
  bhikkhu's design.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A dispute arose there. When the king
  afterwards heard this he came and questioned the workman.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Sire, with flowers in the one hand the
  bhikkhus are used to give me a piece of clay with the other; but I can only
  know (just so much) whether he be a bhikkhu from another land or of this
  country, Sire.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the king heard this word he appointed an
  overseer to show him the ascetic who had offered the lump of clay. The other
  showed him to the overseer and he told the king. The king had three pitchers
  with jasmine-blossoms placed in the courtyard of the sacred Bodhi-tree and
  bade the overseer give them to the bhikkhu. When the bhikkhu, observing
  nothing, had offered them, the overseer told him this while he yet stood
  there. Then did the ascetic understand.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A thera living in Piyañgalla in the
  Kotthivala district, who also wished to take part in the work of building the
  cetiya and who was a kinsman of that brick-worker, came hither and when he had
  made a brick in the size (such as was used there) after having learned (the
  exact measure) he, deceiving the work-people, gave it to the workman. This man
  laid it on its place (in the thupa), and a quarrel arose (on this matter).
  When the king knew this he asked: 'Is it possible to recognize the brick?'
  Although the workman knew it, he answered the king: 'It is impossible.' To the
  question:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Dost thou know the thera?' he answered:
  'Yes.' So that he might be made known the king placed an overseer near him.
  When the overseer had thereby come to know him he went, with the king's
  consent, and visited the thera in the Katthahala-parivena and spoke with him;
  and when he had learned the day of the thera's departure and the place whither
  he was going, and had said to him: 'I am going with thee to thy village,' he
  told the king all. The king commanded that a pair of garments, worth a
  thousand (pieces of money), and a costly red coverlet he given to him, and
  when he had (also) commanded to give him many things used by samanas, and
  sugar and a nali of fragrant oil withal, he laid his command upon him.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">He went with the thera, and when Piyangallaka
  was in sight he made the thera sit down in a cool shady place where there was
  water, and when he had given him sugar-water and had rubbed his feet with
  fragrant oil and put sandals upon them, he gave him the necessaries (saying):
  'For the thera who visits my house have I brought these with me, but the two
  garments for my son. All this do I give to thee now.' When with these words he
  had given those (necessaries) to the thera who, after receiving them, set out
  again upon his journey, he, taking leave of (the thera), told him, in the
  king's words, the king's command.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">While the Great Thupa was built, people in
  great numbers who laboured for wages, being converted to the faith, went to
  heaven. A wise man who perceives that only by inner faith in the Holy One is
  the way to heaven found, will therefore bring offerings to the thupa.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Two women, who since they had also laboured
  here for hire, were re-born in the heaven of the thirty-three (gods), pondered
  when the thupa was finished, upon what they had formerly done, and when they
  both became aware of the reward of their deeds, they took fragrant flowers and
  came to do reverence to the thupa with offerings. When they had offered the
  fragrant flowers they did homage to the cetiya. At this moment came the thera
  Mahasiva who dwelt in Bhätivaka (with the thought): 'I will pay homage by
  night to the Great Thupa.' As he, leaning against a great sattapanna-tree, saw
  those women and without letting himself be seen stood there gazing at their
  marvellous splendour, he, when their adoration was ended asked them:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Here the whole island shines with the
  brightness of your bodies; what works have ye done that ye have passed from
  this world into the world of gods?' The devatas told him of the work done by
  them in the (building of the) Great Thupa; thus does faith in the Tathagata
  bring a rich reward.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The three terraces for the flower-offerings to
  the thupa did the theras of miraculous power cause to sink down so soon as
  they were laid with bricks, making them equal to the surface of the soil. Nine
  times did they cause them to sink down when they were laid. Then the king
  called together an assembly of the brotherhood of bhikkhus. Eighty thousand
  bhikkhus assembled there. The king sought out the brotherhood, and when he had
  paid homage to them with gifts and had reverentially greeted them he asked the
  reason of the sinking down of the bricks. The brotherhood answered: 'In order
  that the thupa may not sink down of itself was this thipg done by the bhikkhus
  of miraculous power, O great king; they will do it no more, make no alteration
  and finish the Great Thüpa.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the king heard this, glad at heart he
  caused the work on the thüpa to be continued. For the ten flower-terraces ten
  kotis of bricks (were used). The brotherhood of bhikkhus charged the two
  samaneras, Uttara and Sumana, saying: 'Bring hither, to (make) the
  relic-chamber in the cetiya, fat-coloured stones.&quot; And they set out for
  (the land of) the Northern Kurus and brought from thence six massive
  fat-coloured stones measuring eighty cubits in length and breadth, bright as
  the sun, eight inches thick and like to ganthi blossoms. When they had laid
  one on the flower terrace in the middle and had disposed four (others) on the
  four sides, in the fashion of a chest, the (theras) of wondrous might placed
  the sixth, to serve (afterwards) as a lid, upon the east side, making it
  invisible.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the midst of the relic-chamber the king
  placed a bodhi tree made of jewels, splendid in every way. It bad a stem
  eighteen cubits high and five branches; the root, made of coral, rested on
  sapphire. The stem made of perfectly pure silver was adorned with leaves made
  of gems, had withered leaves and fruits of gold and young shoots made of
  coral. The eight auspicious figures were on the stem and festoons of flowers
  and beautiful rows of fourfooted beasts and rows of geese. Over it, on the
  border of a beautiful canopy, was a network of pearl bells and chains of
  little golden bells and bands here and there. From the four corners of the
  canopy hung bundles of pearl strings each worth nine hundred thousand (pieces
  of money). The figures of sun, moon and stars and different lotus-flowers,
  made of jewels, were fastened to the canopy. A thousand and eight pieces of
  divers stuffs, precious and of varied colours, were hung to the canopy. Around
  the bodhi-tree ran a vedika made of all manner of jewels; the pavement within
  was made of great myrobalanpearls.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Rows of vases (some) empty and (some) filled
  with flowers made of all kinds of jewels and filled with four kinds of
  fragrant water were placed at the foot of the bodhi-tree. On a throne, the
  cost whereof was one koti, erected to the east of the bodhi-tree, he placed a
  shining golden Buddha image seated. The body and members of this image were
  duly made of jewels of different colours, beautifully shining. Mahabrahma
  stood there holding a silver parasol and Sakka carrying out the consecration
  with the Vijayuttara shell, Pancasikha with his lute in his hand, and Kalanaga
  with the dancing -girls, and the thousand-handed Mara with his elephants and
  train of followers. Even like the throne to the east (other) thrones were
  erected, the cost of each being a koti, facing the other seven regions of the
  heavens. And even thus, so that the bodhi-tree was at the head, a couch was
  placed, also worth one koti, adorned with jewels of every kind.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The events during the seven weeks he commanded
  them to depict duly here and there in the relic chamber, and also the prayer
  of Brahma, the setting in motion the wheel of the doctrine, the admission of
  Yasa into the order, the pabbajja of the Bhaddavaggiyas and the subduing of
  the jatilas; the visit of Bimbisära and the entry into Rajagaha, the
  accepting of the Veluvana, the eighty disciples,' the journey to Kapilavatthu
  and the (miracle of the) jewelled path in that place, the pabbajjä of Rahula
  and Nanda, the accepting of the Jetavana, the miracle at the foot of the
  mango-tree, the preaching in the heaven of the gods, the miracle of the
  descent of the gods, and the assembly with the questioning of the thera, the
  Mahasamayasuttanta, and the exhortation to Rahula, the Mahamahgalasutta, and
  the encounter with (the elephant) Dhanapala; the subduing of the (yakkha)
  Alavaka, of the (robber) Anguli mala and the (naga-king) Apalala,' the meeting
  with the Parayanakas, the giving-up of life, the accepting of the dish of
  pork, and of the two gold-coloured garments, the drinking of the pure water,
  and the Parinibbana itself; the lamentation of gods and men, the revering of
  the feet by the thera, the burning (of the body), the quenching of the fire,
  the funeral rites in that very place and the distributing of the relics by
  Dona.' Jatakas also which are fitted to awaken faith did the noble (king)
  place here in abundance. The Vessantarajataka he commanded them to depict
  fully, and in like manner (that which befell beginning at the descent) from
  the Tusitaheaven even to the Bodhi-throne.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the four quarters of the heaven stood the
  (figures of) the four Great kings, and the thirty-three gods and the
  thirty-two (celestial) maidens and the twenty-eight chiefs of the yakkhas; but
  above these devas raising their folded hands, vases filled with flowers
  likewise, dancing devatas and devatas playing instruments of music, devas with
  mirrors in their hands, and devas also bearing flowers and branches, devas
  with lotus-blossoms and so forth in their hands and other devas of many kinds,
  rows of arches made of gems and (rows) of dhammacakkas; rows of sword-bearing
  devas and also devas bearing pitchers. Above their heads were pitchers five
  cubits high, filled with fragrant oil, with wicks made of duküla fibres
  continually alight. In an arch of crystal there was in each of the four
  corners a great gem and (moreover) in the four corners four glimmering heaps
  of gold, precious stones and pearls and of diamonds were placed. On the wall
  made of fat-coloured stones sparkling zig-zag lines were traced, serving as
  adornment for the relic-chamber. The king commanded them to make all the
  figures here in the enchanting relic-chamber of massive wrought gold.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The great thera Indagutta, who was gifted with
  the six supernormal faculties, the most wise, directed here all this, being
  set over the work. All this was completed without hindrance by reason of the
  wondrous power of the king, the wondrous power of the devatas, and the
  wondrous power of the holy (theras).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If the wise man who is adorned with the good
  gifts of faith, has done homage to the blessed (Buddha) the supremely
  venerable, the highest of the world, who is freed from darkness, while he was
  yet living, and then to his relics, that were dispersed abroad b him who had
  in view the salvation of mankind; and if he then understands: herein is equal
  merit; then indeed will he reverence the relics of the Sage even as the
  blessed (Buddha himself) in his lifetime.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the thirtieth chapter, called 'The
  Making of the Relic-Chamber', in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the serene joy
  and emotion of the pious.</font>
