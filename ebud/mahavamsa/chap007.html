  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A1"></a> <font size="6">W</font>HEN
  the Guide of the World, having aecomplished the salvation of the whole world
  and having reached the utmost stage of blissful rest, was lying on the bed of
  his nibbana; in the midst of the great assembly of gods, he, the great sage,
  the greatest of those who have speech, spoke to Sakka' who stood there near
  him: 'VIJAYA, son of king Sihabahu, is come to Lanka from the country of Lala,
  together with seven hundred followers. In Lanka, O lord of gods, will my
  religion be established, therefore carefully protect him with his followers
  and Lanka.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the lord of gods heard the words of the
  Tathagata he from respect handed over the guardianship of Lanka to the god who
  is in colour like the lotus.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And no sooner had the god received the charge
  from Sakka than he came speedily to Lanka and sat down at the foot of a tree
  in the guise of a wandering ascetic. And all the followers of VIJAYA came to
  him and asked him: 'What island is this, sir?' 'The island of Lanka, he
  answered. 'There are no men here, and here no dangers will arise.' And when he
  had spoken so and sprinkled water on them from his water-vessel, and had wound
  a thread about their hands he vanished through the air. And there appeared, in
  the form of a bitch, a yakkhini who was an attendant (of Kuvanna).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of (VIJAYA's men) went after her, although
  he was forbidden by the prince (for he thought), 'Only where there is a
  village are dogs to be found.' Her mistress, a yakkhini named Kuvanna, sat at
  the foot of a tree spinning, as a woman hermit might.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the man saw the pond and the woman-hermit
  sitting there, he bathed there and drank and taking young shoots of lotuses
  and water in louts-leaves he came forth again. And she said to him:
  &quot;Stay! thou art my prey!&quot;. Then the man stood there as if fast
  bound. But becasue of the power of the magic thread she could not devour him,
  and though was entreated by the yakkhini, the man would not yield up the
  thread. Then the yakkhini seized him, and hurled who cried aloud into a chasm.
  And there in like manner she hurled (all) the seven hundred one by one after
  him.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And when they all did not return fear came
  upon VIJAYA; armed with the five weapons he set out, and when he beheld the
  beautiful pond, where he saw no footstep of any man coming forth, but saw that
  woman-hermit there, he thought: 'Surely my men have been seized by this
  woman.' And he said to her, 'Lady, hast thou not seen my men?' 'What dost thou
  want with thy people, prince?' she answered. 'Drink thou and bathe.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then was it clear to him: 'This is surely a
  yakkhini, she knows my rank,' and swiftly, uttering his name, he came at he
  drawing his bow. He caught the yakkhini in the noose about the neck, and
  seizing her hair with his left hand he lifted his sword in the right and
  cried: 'Slave! give me back my men, or I slay thee!' Then tormented by fear
  the yakkhini parayed him for her life. 'Spare my life, sir, I will give thee a
  kingdom and do thee a woman's service and other services as thou wilt.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And that he might not be betrayed he made the
  yakkhini swear an oath, an so soon as the charge was laid on her, 'Bring
  hither my men with all speed,' she brought them to that place. When he said,
  'These men are hungry,' she showed them rice and other(foods) and goods of
  every kind that had been in the ships of those traders whoem she had devoured.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">(VIJAYA's) men prepared the rice and the
  condiments, and when they had first set them before the prince they all ate of
  them.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the yakkhini had taken the first portions
  (of the meal) that VIJAYA handed to her, she was well pleased, and assuming
  the lovely form of a sixteen year old maidedshe approached the prince adorned
  with all the ornaments. At the foot of a tree she made a splendid bed, well
  covered around with a tent, and adorned with a canopy. And seeing this, the
  king's son, looking forward to the time to come, to her to him as his spouse
  and lay (with her) blissfully on that bed; and all his men encamped around the
  tent.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As the night went on he heard the sounds of
  music and singing, and asked the yakkhini, who was lying near him: 'What means
  this noise?' And the yakkhini: 'I will bestow kingship on my lord and all the
  yakkhas must be slain, for (else) the yakkhas will slay me, for it was through
  me that men have taken up their dwelling (in Lanka).'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And she said to the prince: 'Here there is a
  yakkha-city called <a name="1"></a> Sirisavatthu; the daughter of the chief of
  the yakkhas who dwells in the city of Lanka has been brought hither, and her
  mother is to come. And for the wedding there is high festival, lasting seven
  seven days; therefore there is this noise, for a freat multitude is gathered
  together. Even to-day do thou destroy the yakkhas, for afterwards it will no
  longer be possible.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">He replied: 'How can I slay the yakkhas who
  are invisible?' 'Wheresoever they may be,' she said, 'I will utter cries, and
  where thou shalt hear that sound, strike! and by my magic power shall thy
  weapon fall upon their bodies.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since he listened to her and did even (as she
  said) he slew all the yakkhas, and when he had fought victoriously he himself
  put on the garments of the yakkha king and bestowed the other raiment on one
  and another of his followers.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he had spent some days at that spot he
  went to Tambapanni. There VIJAYA founded the city of Tambapanni and dwelt
  there, together with the yakkhini, surrounded by his ministers.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When those who were commanded by VIJAYA landed
  from their ship, they-sat down wearied, resting their hands upon the ground
  and since their hands were reddened by touching the dust of the red earth that
  region and also the island were (named) Tambapanni. But the king Sihabähu,
  since he had slain the lion (was called) Sihala and, by reason of the ties
  between him and them, all those (followers of VIJAYA) were also (called)
  Sihala.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here and there did VIJAYA's ministers found
  villages. Anuradhagama was built by a man of that name near the Kadamba river;
  the chaplain Upatissa built Upatissagama on the bank of the Qambhira river, to
  the north of Anu radhagama Three other ministers built, each for himself,
  Ujjeni, Uruvela, and the city of Vijita.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When they had founded settlements in the land
  the ministers all came together and spoke thus to the prince: 'Sire, consent
  to be consecrated as king.' But, in spite of their demand, the prince refused
  the consecration, unless a maiden of a noble house were consecrated as queen
  (at the same time).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But the ministers, whose minds were eagerly
  bent upon the consecrating of their lord, and who, although the means were
  difficult, had overcome all anxious fears about the matter, sent people,
  entrusted with many precious gifts, jewels, pearls, and so forth, to the city
  of Madhura in southern (India), to woo the daughter of the Pandu king for
  their lord, devoted (as they were) to their ruler; and they also (sent to woo)
  the daughters of others for the ministers and retainers.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the messengers were quickly come by ship
  to the city of Madhura they laid the gifts and letter before the king. The
  king took counsel with his ministers, and since he was minded to send his
  daughter (to Lanka) he, having first received also daughters of others for the
  ministers (of VIJAYA), nigh upon a hundred maidens, proclaimed with beat of
  drum:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Those men here who are willing to let a
  daughter depart for Lanka shall provide their daughters with a double store of
  clothing and place them at the doors of their houses. By this sign shall we
  (know that we may) take them to ourselves.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he had thus obtained many maidens and had
  given compensation to their families, he sent his daughter, bedecked with all
  her ornaments, and all that was needful for the journey, and all the maidens
  whom he had fitted out, according to their rank, elephants withal and horses
  and waggons, worthy of a king, and craftsmen and a thousand families of the
  eighteen guilds, entrusted with a letter to the conqueror VIJAYA. All this
  multitude of men disembarked at Mahatittha; for that very reason is that
  landing-place known as Mahatittha.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">VIJAYA had one son and one daughter by the
  yakkhini; when he now heard that the princess had arrived he said to the
  yakkhini: 'Go thou now, dear one, leaving the two children behind; men are
  ever in fear of superhuman beings.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But when she heard this she was seized with
  fear of the yakkhas; then he said (again) to the yakkhhini: 'Delay not! I will
  bestow on thee an offering by (spending) a thousand (pieces of money).' When
  she had again and again besought him (in vain) she took her two children and
  departed for Lankapura, though fearing that evil should come of it.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">She set the children down outside and went,
  herself, into that city. When the yakkhas in the city recognized the yakkhini,
  in their terror they took her for a spy and there was great stir among them;
  but one who was violent killed the yakkhini, with a single blow of his fist.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But her uncle, on the mother's side, a yakkha,
  went forth from the city and when he saw the children he asked them:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Whose children are you?' and hearing that
  they were Kuvanna's he said: 'Here has your mother been slain, and slay you
  also if they see you: (therefore) flee swiftly!'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Fleeing with speed they went from thence to
  the Sumanaküta. The brother, the elder of the two, when he grew up took his
  sister, the younger, for his wife, and multiplying with sons and daughters,
  they dwelt, with the king's leave, there in Malaya. From these are sprung the
  Pulinda</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The envoys of the Pandu king delivered up to
  the prince VIJAYA the gifts and the (maidens) with the king's daughter at
  their head. When VIJAYA had offered hospitality and bestowed honours on the
  envoys he bestowed the maidens, according to their rank, upon his ministers
  and retainers. According to custom the ministers in full assembly consecrated
  VIJAYA king and appointed a great festival.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then king VIJAYA consecrated the daughter of
  the Pandu king with solemn ceremony as his queen; he bestowed wealth on his
  ministers, and every year lie sent to his wife's father a shell-pearl worth
  twice a hundred thousand (pieces of money).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he had forsaken his former evil way of
  life, VIJAYA, the lord of men, ruling over all Lanka in peace and
  righteousness reigned, as is known, in the city of Tambapanni, thirty-eight
  years.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the seventh chapter, called 'The
  Consecrating of VIJAYA', in the Mahavamsa compiled for the serene joy and
  emotion of the pious.</font>
