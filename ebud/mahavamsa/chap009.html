  ABHAYA</font></b></center>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="A3"></a> <font size="6">T</font>HE
  queen bore ten sons and one daughter: the eldest of all was named ABHAYA, the
  youngest (child, the) daughter was named Cittia. When the brahmans skilled in
  sacred texts saw her they foretold: 'For the sake of sovereignty will her son
  slay his uncles.' When the brothers resolved: 'let us kill our young sister,'
  ABHAYA restrained them.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In due time they lodged her in a chamber
  having but one pillar, and the entry thereto they made through the king's
  sleeping chamber; and within they placed a serving woman, and a hundred
  soldiers without. But since she (Citta) drove men mad by the, mere sight of
  her beauty, the name given to 'her was lengthened by an epithet 'Ummadacitta
  '.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When they heard of the coming of the princess
  Bhaddakaccana to Lanka her brothers also, except one, urged by their mother,
  departed thither.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When on arriving they had visited the ruler of
  Lanka, Panduvasudeva and their youngest sister too and had lamented with her,
  they, hospitably received by the king and having the king's leave, went about
  the island of Lanka and took up their abode wheresoever it pleased them.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The place where Rama settled is called
  Ramagona, the settlements of Uruvela and Anurädha (are called) by their
  names, and the settlements of Vijita, Dighayu, and Rohaijia are named
  Vijitagama, Dighayu, and Rohana. Anuradha built a tank and when he had built a
  palace to the south of this, he took up his abode there. Afterwards the great
  king Panduvasudeva consecrated his eldest son ABHAYA as viceregent.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the son of prince Dighayu, Dighagamani,
  heard of Ummadacitta he went, driven by longing for her, to Upatissagama, and
  there sought out the ruler of the land. And this (latter) appointed him
  together with the vice-regent, to service at the royal court.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now (once) Citta saw Gamani in the place where
  he stood opposite her window, and, her heart on fire with love, she asked her
  serving-woman: 'Who is that?' When she heard:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'He is the son of thy uncle,' she trusted the
  matter to her attendant and he, being in league with her, fastened a
  hookladder to the window in the night,' climbed up, broke the window and so
  came in.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So he had intercourse with her and did not go
  forth till break of day. And he returned there constantly, nor was he
  discovered, for there was no entry (to the chamber).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And she became with child by him, and when the
  fruit of her womb was ripe the serving-woman told her mother, and the mother,
  having questioned her daughter, told the king. The king took counsel with his
  sons and said: 'He too must be received among us; let us give her (in
  marriage) to him.' And saying: 'If it is a son we will slay him'; they gave
  her to him.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But she, when the time of her delivery was
  come near, went to the lying-in-chamber. And thinking: 'These were accomplices
  in the matter,' the princes, from fear, did to death the herdsman Citta and
  the slave Kalavela, attendants on Gamani, since they would make no promise.
  They were</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">reborn as yakkhas and both kept guard over the
  child in the mother's womb. And Citta made her attendant find another woman
  who was near her delivery. And Citta bore a son but this woman bore a
  daughter. Citta caused a thousand (pieces of money) to be handed over to (the
  other) together with her own son, and the latter's daughter to be then brought
  to her and laid beside her. When the king's sons heard 'a daughter is born',
  they were well pleased; but the two, mother and grandmother, joining the names
  of the grandfather and the eldest uncle gave the boy the name Panduabhaya.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The ruler of Lanka, Panduväsudeva, reigned
  thirty years. When Pandukabhaya was born, he died.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the ruler was dead, the king's sons all
  assembled together and held the great festival of consecration of their
  brother, the safety-giving ABHAYA.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the ninth chapter, called 'The
  Consecrating of ABHAYA', in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the serene joy and
  emotion of the pious.</font>
