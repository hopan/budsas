  </center><center><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">THE CONSECRATING OF
  THE LOHAPASADA</font></b></center>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">H</font>EREUPON the king called
  to mind the tradition known to all, and duly handed down: 'The thera rich in
  merit, ever intent on meritorious works, who formed his resolves in wisdom,
  who converted the island did, as is known, speak thus to the king, my
  ancestor: &quot;Thy descendant, the king Dutthagamani, the wise, will
  hereafter found the Great Thüpa, the splendid Sonnamali a hundred and twenty
  cubits in height, and an uposatha-house, moreover, adorned with manifold gems,
  making it nine stories high, namely the Lohapasada.&quot;</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus thought the ruler of the land, and
  finding, when he made search, a gold plate kept in a chest and laid by in the
  palace with such a written record thereon, he commanded that the inscription
  be read aloud: 'When one hundred and thirty-six years have run their course,
  in future time will Kakavanna's son, the ruler of men, Dutthagamani, build
  this and that in such and such wise.' When the king had heard this read he
  uttered a cry of joy and clapped his hands. Then early in the morning he went
  to the beautiful Mahamegha-park, and when he had arranged a gathering together
  of the brotherhood of the bhikkhus he said to them: 'I will build for you a
  pasada like to a palace of the gods. Send to a celestial palace' and make me a
  drawing of it.' The brotherhood of the bhikkhus sent thither eight (theras)
  who had overcome the asavas.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the time of the sage Kassapa a brahman
  named Asoka, who bad set out eight ticket-meals (to be apportioned) to the
  brethren, commanded his serving-woman named Birani:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Give of this continually.' When she had given
  these gifts faithfully her whole life long she left this (world) and was
  reborn as a lovely maiden in a gleaming palace, floating in the air, (and she
  was) continually served by a thousand nymphs. Her gem-palace was twelve
  yojanas high and measured forty-eight yojanas round about; it was adorned with
  a thousand jutting window-chambers, nine-storied and provided with a thousand
  chambers, gleaming with light, four-sided, with a thousand shell-garlands and
  with windows as eyes and provided with a vedikä (adorned) with a network of
  little bells. In the middle of the (building) was the beautiful
  Ambalatthika-pasada, visible from every side, bright with pennons hung out.
  When the theras, going to the heaven of the thirty-three (gods), saw that
  (palace) they made a drawing of it with red arsenic upon a linen cloth, and
  they returned, and being arrived they showed the linen to the brotherhood. The
  brotherhood took the linen and sent it to the king. When the king full of joy
  saw it he went to the splendid Aräma and caused the noble Lohapasada to be
  built after the drawing.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the time that the work was begun the
  generous (king) commanded that eight hundred thousand gold pieces should be
  placed at each of the four gates; moreover, at each gate he commanded them to
  lay a thousand bundles of garments and many pitchers filled with ball-sugar,
  oil, sugar-dust, and honey, and proclaiming, 'No work is to be done here
  without reward,' he had the work done (by the people) appraised, and their
  wage given to them.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The pasada was four-sided, (measuring) on each
  side a hundred cubits, and even so much in height. In this most beautiful of
  palaces there were nine stories, and in each story a hundred window-chambers.
  All the chambers were overlaid with silver and their coral vedikas were
  adorned with manifold precious stones, gay with various gems were the
  lotusflowers on the (vedikas) and they (the vedikas) were surrounded with rows
  of little silver bells.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A thousand well-arranged chambers were in the
  pasada, overlaid with various gems and adorned with windows. And since he
  heard of Vessavana's chariot which served as a car for the women, he bad a
  gem-pavilion set up in the middle (of the palace) fashioned in like manner. It
  was adorned with pillars consisting of precious stones, on which were figures
  of lions, tigers, and so forth, and shapes of devaths; a bordering of pearl
  network ran round the edge of the pavilion and thereon was a coral vedikä of
  the kind that has been described above.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Within the pavilion, gaily adorned with the
  seven gems, stood a shining beauteous throne of ivory with a seat of
  mountain-crystal, and in the ivory back (was fashioned) a sun in gold, a moon
  in silver, and stars in pearls, and lotus-blossoms made of various gems were
  fitly placed here and there and Jataka-tales in the same place' within a
  festoon of gold.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the exceedingly beautiful throne covered
  with costly cushions was placed a beautiful fan of ivory, gleaming
  (magnificently), and a white parasol with a coral foot, resting on
  mountain-crystal and having a silver staff, shone forth over the throne. On
  it, depicted in the seven gems, were the eight auspicious figures and rows of
  figures of beasts with jewels and pearls in between; and rows of little silver
  bells were hung upon the edge of the parasol. Palace, parasol, throne, and
  pavilion were beyond price.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Costly beds and chairs, according to rank, and
  carpets and coverlets of great price did he command them to spread about. The
  rinsing-vessel and the ladle (belonging thereto) were even of gold; what need
  then to speak of the other utensils in the palace? Surrounded by a beautiful
  enclosure and provided with four gateways the pasada gleamed in its
  magnificence like the ball in the heaven of the thirty-three (gods). The
  pasada was covered over with plates of copper, and thence came its name
  'Brazen palace'.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the Lohapasada was ready the king
  assembled the brotherhood, and the brotherhood came together as at the
  consecration-festival of the Maricavatti (vihara). Those bhikkhus who were yet
  simple folk stood on the first story, those learned in the tipitaka on the
  second, but those who had entered on the path of salvation and the others
  (stood) each on one of the third and higher stories,' but the arahants stood
  on those four stories that were highest of alL</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the king had bestowed the pasada on the
  brotherhood, after pouring forth the (ceremonial) water of presentation, he
  commanded, as before, a lavish gift of alms for a week. That which was spent
  by the generous king for the pasada, leaving aside all that which was beyond
  price, is reckoned at thirty kotis.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The wise who consider how marvellously
  precious is the giving of alms, while the gathering together of treasures (for
  oneself) is worthless, give alms lavishly, with a mind freed from the fetters
  (of lust), mindful of the good of beings.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the twenty-seventh chapter, called
  'the Consecrating of the Lohapasada', in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the
  serene joy and emotion of the pious.</font>
