  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">W</font>HEN the Conqueror the
  incomparable, he who has the five eyes,' had lived eighty-four years and had
  fulfilled all his duties in the world, in all ways; then at Kusinara in the
  holy place between the two siila-trees, on the full-moon day of the month
  Vesakha was the light of the world extinguished. Beyond all reckoning in
  numbers, did bhikkhus assemble there and khattiyas and brahmans, vessas and
  suddas, and gods likewise. Seven hundred thousand leading bhikkhus were among
  them, the thera Mahakassapa was at that time the samghatthera.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he had performed all rites due to the
  (dead) body of the Master and the bodily relics, the great thera, desiring
  that the doctrine of the Master might long endure, did, seven days after the
  Lord of the World, gifted with the ten powers, had passed into nibanna,
  bethinking him of the evil words of the aged Subhadda and also bethinking him
  that he (the Master) had given him his garment,' and had (thereby) made him
  equal with himself, and (bethinking him) that the Sage had commanded the
  establishing of the holy truth, and (lastly) that the Sambuddha's consent
  existed to make a compilation of the holy dhamma appointed to this end five
  hundred eminent bhikkhus, who had overcome the ãsavas, repeaters of the
  ninefold doctrine and versed in all its separate parts; but there was one less
  (than five hundred) because of the thera Ananda. And the thera Ananda also,
  again and again entreated by the bhikkhus, resolved to (join with them in)
  that compilation of the dhamma, for it was not possible without him.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When these theras, pitiful toward the whole
  world, had passed half a month seven days in the funeral ceremonies and seven
  in homage of the relics and had resolved thus: 'Spending the rainy season in
  Rajagaha, we will make a compilation of the dhamma, no other (monks) must be
  permitted to dwell there'; and when they had made their pilgrimage over
  Jambudipa, consoling here and there the sorrowing people, they, moved with
  desire that the good might long endure, betook them in the bright half of the
  month Asalha to Rajagaha, (the city) richly provided with the four things
  needful.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">After the theras, with Mahakassapa at the
  head, unwavering in virtue, familiar with the thought of the Sambuddha, had
  arrived at that place to spend the rainy season there, they busied themselves
  during the first of the rain-months with repairing all the dwellings, when
  they had announced this to Ajatasattu.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the repair of the vihara was finished
  they said to the king: 'Now we will hold the council.' To the question, 'What
  should be done?' they answered: 'A place (should be provided) for the
  meetings.' When the king had asked: 'Where (these were to be)?' and the place
  had been pointed out by them, he with all speed had a splendid hall built by
  the side of the Vebhära Rock by the entrance of the Sattapanni grotto, (and
  it was) like to the assembly-hall of the gods. When it was adorned in every
  way he caused precious mats to be spread according to the number of the
  bhikkhus. Placed on the south side and facing the north a lofty and noble seat
  was prepared for the thera, and in the middle of the hail a high seat was
  prepared for the preacher, facing the east and worthy of the blessed (Buddha)
  himself.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So the king bade them tell the theras: 'My
  work is finished,' and the theras addressed the thera Ananda, the joy-bringer:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Tomorrow, Ananda, the assembly (comes
  together); it behoves thee not to take part in it since thou art still
  preparing thee (for the highest state), therefore strive thou, unwearied in
  good.' Thus spurred on, the thera put forth due effort and reached the state
  of an arahaut without being confined to any one of the four postures.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the second day of the second month of the
  rainy season the bhikkhus met together in that splendid hail. Leaving a
  fitting place vacant for Ananda, the arahants seated themselves on chairs,
  according to their rank. The thera Ananda, to make known to them that he had
  reached the state of an arahant, went not with them thither. But when some
  asked: Where is the thera Ananda? he took the seat prepared for him, rising
  out of the ground or passing through the air.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Together the theras chose the thera Upali to
  speak for the vinaya, for the rest of the dhamma they chose Ananda. The great
  thera (Mahakassapa) laid on himself (the task) of asking questions touching
  the vinaya and the thera Upali (was ready) to explain it.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sitting in the thera's chair, the former asked
  the latter the questions touching the vinaya; and Upali, seated in the
  preacher's chair, expounded (the matter). And as this best master of the
  vinaya expounded each (clause) in turn all (the bhikkhus) knowing the custom,
  repeated the vinaya after him.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the thera (Mahakassapa) taking (the task)
  upon himself questioned concerning the dhamma, him the chief of those who had
  most often heard (the word), him the treasurekeeper of the Great Seer (the
  Buddha); and the them Ananda, taking (the task) upon himself, taking his seat
  in the preacher's chair, expounded the whole dhamma. And all the (theras)
  knowing all that was contained in the doe. trine repeated the dhamma in turn
  after the sage of the Videha country.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus in seven months was that compiling of the
  dhamma to save the whole world completed by those (theras) bent on the whole
  world's salvation. 'The thera Mahakassapa has made the blessed Buddha's
  message to endure five hundred years,' rejoicing in this thought, at the end
  of the council, the earth encircled by the ocean trembled six times and many
  wondrous signs were shown in the world in many ways. Now since the canon was
  compiled by the theras it was called tlw Thera tradition.' The theras who had
  held the First Council and had (thereby) brought great blessing to the world,
  having lived their allotted span of life, entered, all, into nibbana.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Also the theras who have overcome darkness
  with the light of insight, those great shining lights in the conquest of the
  world's darkness, have been extinguished by the dread tempest of death.
  Therefore will the wise man renounce the joy of life.</font>
  <p>&nbsp;
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the third chapter, called 'The First
  Council', in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the serene joy and emotion of the
  pious.</font>
