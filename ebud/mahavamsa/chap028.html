  </center><center><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">THE OBTAINING OF THE
  WHEREWITHAL TO BUILD THE GREAT THUPA</font></b></center>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">S</font>PENDING a hundred
  thousand (pieces of money) the king hereupon commanded a great and splendid
  ceremony of gift for the great Bodhi-tree. As he then, when entering the city,
  saw the pillar of stone raised upon the place of the (future) thüpa and
  remembered the old tradition, he became glad, thinking: 'I will build the
  Great Thupa.' Then he mounted the high terrace (of his palace), and when he
  had taken his repast and had lain down he thought thus: 'At the conquering of
  the Damilas this people was oppressed by me. It is not possible to levy a tax;
  yet if without a tax I build the Great Thüpa how shall I be able to have
  bricks duly made?'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As he thus reflected the devath of the parasol
  observed his thought, and thereupon arose a tumult among the gods; when Sakka
  was aware of this he said to Vissakamma:' 'King Gamani has been pondering over
  the bricks for the cetiya: Go thou a yojana from the city near the
  Gambhirariver and prepare the bricks there.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus commanded by Sakka, Vissakamma came
  hither and prepared the bricks in that very place.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the morning a huntsman there went into the
  forest with his dogs; the devatä of the place appeared to the huntsman in the
  form of an iguana. The hunter pursued it, and when he came (to the place) and
  saw the bricks, and when the iguana vanished there, he thought: 'Our king
  intends to build the Great Thupa; here is an aid there to!' Thereupon he went
  and told (this thing). When the king, to whom hispeople's good was dear, heard
  his welcome words he, glad at heart, bestowed on him a rich guerdon.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In a north-easterly direction from the city,
  at a distance of three yojanas and near Acaravitthigama, on a plain covering
  sixteen karisas (of land) there appeared nuggets of gold of different sizes;
  the greatest measured a span, the least were of a finger's measure. When the
  dwellers in the village saw the earth full of gold, they put some of it into a
  gold vessel and went and told the king of this matter.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the east side of the city, at a distance of
  seven yojanas, on the further bank of the river and near Tambapittha, copper
  appeared. And the dwellers in the village there put the nuggets of copper into
  a vessel, and when they had sought the king they told him this matter.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In a south-easterly direction from the city,
  four yojanas distant, near the village of Sumanavapi many precious stones
  appeared. The dwellers in the village put them, mingled with sapphires and
  rubies, into a vessel and went and showed them to the king.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In a southerly direction from the city, at a
  distance of eight yojanas, silver appeared in the Ambatthakola-cave. A
  merchant from the city, taking many waggons with him, in order to bring ginger
  and so forth from Malaya, had set out for Malaya. Not far from the cave he
  brought the waggons to a halt and since he had need of wood for whips he wetit
  up that mountain. As he saw here a branch of a bread-fruit-tree, bearing one
  single fruit as large as a waterpitcher, and dragged down by the weight of the
  fruit, he cut the (fruit) which was lying on a stone away from the stalk with
  his knife, and thinking: 'I will give the first (produce as alms),' with faith
  he announced the (meal) time. And there came thither four (theras) who were
  free from the asavas. When he had greeted them gladly and had invited them
  with all reverence to be seated, he cut away the rind around the stalk with
  his knife and tore out the bottom (of the fruit), and pouring the juice which
  filled the hollow forth into their bowls he offered them the four bowls filled
  with fruit-juice. They accepted them and went their way. Then he yet again
  announced the (meal) time. Four other theras, free from the asavas, appeared
  before him. He took their alms-bowls and when he had filled them with the
  kernels of the bread-fruit he gave them back. Three went their way, but one
  did not depart. In order to show him the silver he went further down and
  seating himself near the cave he ate the kernels. When the merchant also had
  eaten as he wished of the kernels that were left, and had put the rest in a
  bundle, he went on, following the track of the thera, and when he saw the
  thera he showed him the (usual) attentions. The thera opened a path for him to
  the mouth of the cavern: 'Go thou now also on this path, lay brother!' When he
  had done reverence to the thera he went that way and saw the cave. Standing by
  the mouth of the cave and seeing the silver he struck upon it with his axe,
  and when he knew it to be silver he took a lump of the silver and went to his
  freight-waggons. Then leaving the waggons behind and taking the lump of silver
  with him the excellent merchant went in haste to Anuradhapura and told the
  king of this matter, showing him the silver.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In a westerly direction from the city, at a
  distance of five yojanas, near the landing-place Uruvela, pearls in size like
  to great myrobalan fruits, mingled with coral, six waggonloads, came forth to
  the dry land. Fishermen who saw them piled them together in a heap, and taking
  the pearls together with coral in a vessel they went to the king and told him
  of this matter.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In a northerly direction from the city, at a
  distance of seven yojanas, in a cave opening on the Pelivapikagama tank, above
  on the sand, four splendid gems had formed in size like to a small mill-stone,
  in colour like flax-flowers, (radiantly) beautiful. When a hunter with his
  dogs saw these he came to the king and told him: 'I have seen precious stones
  of such and such a kind.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The lord of the land, rich in merit, heard, on
  one and the same day, that the bricks and the other (treasures) had appeared
  for the Great Thüpa. Glad at heart he bestowed due reward upon those people,
  and appointing them forthwith as watchers he had the treasures all brought to
  him.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Merit, that a man has thus heaped np with
  believing heart, careless of insupportable ills of the body, brings to pass
  hundreds of results which are a mine of happiness; therefore one must do works
  of merit with believing heart.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the twenty-eighth chapter, called
  'the Obtaining of the wherewithal to build the Great Thupa', in the Mahavamsa,
  compiled for the serene joy and emotion of the pious.</font>
