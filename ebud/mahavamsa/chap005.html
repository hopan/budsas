  </center><center><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">THE THIRD COUNCIL</font></b></center>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>HAT redaction of the
  true dhamma, which was arranged at the beginning by the great theras
  Mahäkassapa and others, is called that of the theras. One and united was the
  school of the theras in the first hundred years. But afterwards arose other
  schools of doctrine.' The heretical bhikkhus, subdued by the theras who had
  held the Second Council, in all ten thousand, founded the school which bears
  the name Mahasamghika.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">From this arose the Gokulika and Ekavyoharika
  (schools). From the Gokulika arose the Parniatti sect and the Bahulika, from
  these the Cetiya sect. (Thus) there are six, with the Mahasamghika, and yet
  two more (groups) parted from the followers of the Thera-doctrine: the
  Mahimsasaka and the Vajjiputtaka bhikkhus. And there parted from them likewise
  the Dhammuttariya and the Bhadrayänika bhikkhus, the Chandagarika, the
  Sammiti and the Vajjiputtiya bhikkhus. From the Mahimsasaka bhikkhus two
  (groups) parted, the bhikkhus who held by the Sabbattha-school and the
  Dhammaguttika bhikkhus. From the Sabbattha sect arose the Kassapiya, from
  these arose the Samkantika bhikkhus, from these last the Sutta sect. These are
  twelve together with (those of) the Thera-doctrine; thereto are added the six
  schools named and these together are eighteen.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus in the second century arose seventeen
  schools, and other schools arose afterwards. The Hemavata and the Rajagiriya
  and likewise the Siddhatthaka, the first Seliya bhikkhus, the other Seliya,
  and the Vajiriya: these six separated (from the rest) in Jambudipa, the
  Dhammaruci and the Sagaliya separated (from the rest) in the island of Lanka.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the Story of the Acariya-schools.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The sons of Kalasoka were ten brothers,
  twenty-two years did they reign. Afterwards, the nine Nandas were kings in
  succession; they too reigned twenty-two years.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then did the brahman Canakka anoint a glorious
  youth, known by the name Candagutta, as king over all Jambudipa, born of a
  noble clan, the Moriyas, when, filled with bitter hate, he had slain the ninth
  (Nanda) Dhanananda.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Twenty-four years he reigned, and his son
  Bindusära reigned twenty-eight. A hundred glorious sons and one had
  Bindusara; Asoka stood high above them all in valour, splendour, might, and
  wondrous powers. He, when he had slain his ninety-nine brothers born of
  different mothers, won the undivided sovereignty over all Jambudipa. Be it
  known, that two hundred and eighteen years had passed from the nibana of the
  Master unto Asoka's consecration.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Four years after the famous (Asoka) had won
  for himself the undivided sovereignty he consecrated himself as king in the
  city Pataliputta. Straightway after his consecration his command spread so far
  as a yojana (upward) into the air and downward into the (depths of the)
  earth.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Day by day did the devas bring eight men's
  loads of water of (the lake) Anotatta; the king dealt it out to his people.
  From the Himalaya did the devas bring for cleansing the teeth twigs of
  naga-creeper, enough for many thousands, healthful fruits, myrobalan and
  terminalia and mangofruits from the same place, perfect in colour, smell, and
  taste. The spirits of the air brought garments of five colours, and yellow
  stuff for napkins, and also celestial drink from the Chaddanta-lake. Out of
  the naga-kingdom the nagas (brought) stuff, coloured like the jasmine-blossom
  and without a seam, and celestial lotus-flowers and collyrium and unguents;
  parrots brought daily from the Chaddanta-lake ninety thousand waggon-loads of
  rice. Mice converted this rice, unbroken, into grains without husk or powder,
  and therewith was meal provided for the royal family. Perpetually did
  honey-bees prepare honey for him, and in the forges bears swung the hammers.
  Karavika-birds, graceful and sweet of voice, came and made delightful music
  for the king. And being consecrated king, Asoka raised his youngest brother
  Tissa, son of his own-mother, to the office of vice-regent.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the Consecration of the pious Asoka.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">(Asoka's) father had shown hospitality to
  sixty thousand brahmans, versed in the Brahma-doctrine, and in like manner he
  himself nourished them for three years. But when he saw their want of
  self-control at the distribution of food he commanded his ministers saying:
  (hereafter) I will give according to my choice.' The shrewd (king) bade (them)
  bring the followers of the different schools into his presence, tested them in
  an assembly, and gave them to eat, and sent them thence when he had
  entertained them. As he once, standing at the window, saw a peaceful ascetic,
  the samanera Nigrodha, passing along the street, he felt kindly toward him.
  The youth was the son of prince Sumana, the eldest brother of all the sdns of
  Bindusara.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Bindusära had fallen sick Asoka left the
  government of Ujjeni conferred on him by his father, and came to Pupphapura,
  and when he had made himself master of the city, after his father's death, he
  caused his eldest brother to be slain and took on himself the sovereignty in
  the splendid city.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The consort of prince Sumana, who bore the
  same name (Sumana), being with child, fled straightway by the east gate and
  went to a candala village, and there the guardian god of a nigrodha-tree
  called her by her name, built a hut and gave it to her. And as, that very day,
  she bore a beautiful boy, she gave to her son the name Nigrodha, enjoying the
  protection of the guardian god. When the headman of the candälas saw (the
  mother), he looked on her as his own wife, and kept her seven years with
  honour. Then, as the thera Mahavaruna saw that the boy bore the signs of his
  destiny, the arahant questioned his mother and ordained him, and even in the
  room where they shaved him. he</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">attained to the state of arahant. Going thence
  to visit his royal mother, he entered the splendid city by the south gate, and
  following the road that led to that village, he passed (on his way) the king's
  court. Well pleased was the king by his grave bearing, but kindly feeling
  arose in him also by reason of a former life lived together.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now once, in time past, there were three
  brothers, traders in honey; one was used to sell the honey, two to get the
  honey. A certain paecekabuddha was sick of a wound; and another paccekabuddha,
  who, for his sake, wished for honey, came even then to the city on his usual
  way for seeking alms. A maiden, who was going for water to the river-bank, saw
  him. When she knew, from questioning him, that he wished for honey, she
  pointed with hand outstretched and said:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Yonder is a honey-store, sir, go thither.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The trader, with believing heart, gave to the
  buddha who came there a bowlful of honey, so that it ran over the edge. As he
  saw the honey filling (the bowl) and flowing over the edge, and streaming down
  to the ground, he, full of faith, wished: 'May I, for this gift, come by the
  undivided sovereignty of Jambudipa, and may my command reach forth a yojana
  (upward) into the air and (downward) under the earth. To his brothers as they
  came, he said: 'To a man of such and such a kind have I given honey; agree
  thereto since the honey is yours also.' The eldest brother said grudgingly:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'It was surely a candala, for the candalas
  ever clothe themselves in yellow garments.' The second said: 'Away with thy
  paccekabuddha over the sea!' But when they heard his promise to let them
  participate of the reward, they gave their sanction. Then the (maid who) had
  pointed out the store wished that she might become the Toyal spouse of the
  (first), and (desired) a lovely form with limbs of perfect outline.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Asoka was he who gave the honey, the queen
  Asamdhimitta was the maid, Nigrodha he who uttered the word 'candala', Tissa
  he who had wished him away over the sea. He who had uttered the word 'candala'
  lived (in expiation thereof) in a candala village, but because he had desired
  deliverance, he also, even in the seventh year, attained unto deliverance.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The king, in whom kindly feelings had arisen
  towards that same (Nigrodha), summoned him in all haste into his presence; but
  he came staidly and calmly thither. And the king said to him: 'Sit, my dear,
  upon a fitting seat.' Since he saw no other bhikkhu there he approached the
  royal throne. Then, as he stepped toward the throne, the king thought:
  'To-day, this samanera will be lord in my house!' Leaning on the king's hand
  he (the monk) mounted the throne and took his seat on the royal throne under
  the white canopy. And seeing him seated there king Asoka rejoiced greatly that
  he had honoured him according to his rank. When he had refreshed him with hard
  and soft foods prepared for himself he questioned the samanera concerning the
  doctrine taught bythe Saipbuddha. Then the samanera preached to him the
  'Appamadavagga' '.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And when the lord of the earth had heard him
  he was won to the doctrine of the Conqueror, and he said to (Nigrodha):</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'My dear, I bestow on thee eight perpetual
  supplies of food.' And he answered: 'These will I bestow on my master.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When again eight (supplies) were bestowed on
  him he allotted these to his teacher; and when yet eight more were bestowed he
  gave them to the community of bhikkhus. And when yet again eight were
  bestowed, he, full of understanding, consented to accept them. Together with
  thirty-two bhikkhus, he went on the following day, and when he had been served
  by the king with his own hands, and had preached the doctrine to the ruler, he
  confirmed him with many of his train in the refuges and precepts of duty.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the Visit of the samanera Nigrodha.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thereon the king, with glad faith, doubled day
  by day (the number) of bhikkhus (receiving bounty), till they were sixty
  thousand. Putting aside the sixty thousand teachers of false doctrine, he
  bestowed alms perpetually on sixty thousand bhikkhus in his house.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Having commanded costly foods, hard and soft,
  to be prepared speedily, in order to feast the sixty thousand bhikkhus, and
  having caused the town to be gaily decked, he went to the brotherhood and bade
  them to his house; and after he had brought them thither, had bestowed
  hospitality on them and largely provided them with the things needful for
  ascetics, he questioned them thus:' How great is (the content of) the dhamma
  taught by the Master?' And the thera Moggaliputta-Tissa answered him upon this
  matter. When he heard: 'There are eighty-four (thousand) sections of the
  dhamma,' the king said: 'Each one of them will I honour with a vihara.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then bestowing ninety-six kotis (of money) in
  eighty-four thousand towns, the ruler bade the kings all over the earth begin
  (to build) viharas and he himself began to build the Asokarama.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">With the grant for the three gems, for
  Nigrodha and for the sick, he bestowed in (support of) the faith for each of
  them a hundred thousand (pieces of money) each day With the treasure spent for
  the Buddha the (priests) held thupa-offerings of many kinds continually in
  many vihäras. With the treasure spent for the dhamma the people continually
  prepared the four things needful for the use of bhikkhus who were learned in
  the doctrine. Of the loads of water borne from the Anotatta-lake he bestowed
  four on the brotherhood, one every day to sixty theras who knew the tipitaka;
  but one he had commanded to be given to the queen Asamdhimitta, while the king
  himself had but two for his own use. To the sixty thousand bhikkhus and to
  sixteen thousand women (of the palace), he gave day by day those tooth-sticks
  called nagalath.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'When, one day, the monarch heard of the
  naga-king Mahakala of wondrous might, who had beheld four Buddhas, who had
  lived through one age of the world, he sent for him to be brought (into his
  presence) fettered with a chain of gold; and when he had brought him and made
  him sit upon the throne under the white canopy, when he had done homage to him
  with (gifts of) various flowers, and had bidden the sixteen thousand women (of
  the palace) to surround him, he (the king) spoke thus: 'Let us behold the
  (bodily) form of the omniscient Great Sage, of Him who hath boundless
  knowledge, who hath set rolling the wheel of the true doctrine.' The naga-king
  created a beauteous figure of the Buddha, endowed with the thirty-two greater
  signs and brilliant with the eighty lesser signs (of a Buddha), surrounded by
  the fathom-long rays of glory and adorned with the crown of flames.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the sight thereof the king was filled with
  joy and amazement and thought: 'Even such is the image created by this.
  (Mahakala), nay then, what (must) the (real) form of the Tathagata have been!'
  And he was more and more uplifted with joy, and for seven days without ceasing
  did he, the great king of wondrous power, keep the great festival called the
  'Feast of the eyes '.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the Entrance (of Asoka) into the
  doctrine.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now the mighty and believing king and thera
  Moggaliputta had already in former times been seen by the holy ones.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the time of the Second Council, the theras,
  looking into the future, saw the downfall of the faith in the time of that
  king. Looking around in the whole world for one who should be able to stay
  that downfall, they saw the Brahmä Tissa who had not long to live (in the
  Brahma heaven). To him they went and prayed him, the mighty in wisdom, to
  bring this downfall to nought by being reborn himself among men. And he
  granted their prayer, desiring that the doctrine should shine forth in
  brightness. But to the youthful Siggava and Candavajji the sages spoke thus:
  'When a hundred and eighteen years are passed the downfall of the religion
  will begin. We shall not live to see that (time). You, bhikkhus, have had no
  part in this matter' therefore you merit punishment, and your punishment shall
  be this: that the doctrine may shine forth in brightness, the Brahma Tissa,
  mighty in wisdom, will be reborn in the house of the brahman Moggali. As time
  passes on one of you shall receive the boy into the order, another shall
  carefully instruct him in the word of the Sambuddha.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There was a thera Dasaka-disciple of the thera
  Upali. Sonaka was his (Dasaka's) disciple, and both those theras were
  disciples of Sonaka.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In former times there lived in Vesali a
  learned brahman named Dasaka. As the eldest of three hundred disciples he
  dwelt with his teacher, and at the end of twelve years having come to the end
  of (studying) the vedas, he, going about with the (other) disciples, met the
  thera Upali, dwelling at the Valika-monastery, after he had established the
  sacred word (in council), and sitting down near him he questioned him
  concerning hard passages in the vedas, and the other expounded them to him. 'A
  doctrine is come after all the doctrines, O brahman, yet all doctrines end in
  the one doctrine; which is that one?'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus spoke the thera concerning the name (of
  the true doctrine), but the young brahman knew it not. He asked: 'What manta
  is this?' and when the answer was given: 'The manta of the Buddha,' he said:
  'Impart it to me,' and the other answered: 'We impart it(only) unto one who
  wears our robe.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And he (Dasaka) asked his teacher and also his
  father and mother on behalf of that manta. When he with three hundred young
  brahmans had received from the thera the pabbajjä the brahman in time
  received the upassada Then to a thousand (disciples) who had overcome the
  asavas, among whom was the thera Dasaka, did the thera Upali teach the whole
  tipitaka. Past reckoning is the number of the other Ariyas, and of those who
  yet stood outside (the religion), by whom the pitakas were learned from the
  thera.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the land of the Kasi lived the son of a
  caravan-guide, named Sonaka. With his father and mother he had come trading,
  to Giribbaja. He went, youth as he was, fifteen years old, into the Veluvana
  (monastery); fifty-five young brahmans, his companions, came with him.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he saw the thera Däsaka there with his
  disciples around him, faith came to him and he asked him for the
  pabbajja-ordination. (The thera) said: 'Ask thy teacher.' Afterwards, the
  young Sonaka, having fasted three meal-times and won his parents' leave to
  enter the order, came again, and then, when he had received from the thera
  Dasaka the pabbajja and the upasampada, together with those other youths, he
  learned the three pitakas. Amid the company of the thousand disciples of the
  thera, who had overcome the asavas, who were versed in the pitakas, the
  ascetic Sojiaka was the foremost.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the city that bears the name of the patali
  flower there lived the wise Siggava, son of a minister. He, when eighteen
  years old and dwelling in three palaces fitted for the three seasons of the
  year, went, in company with his friend Candavajji, a minister's son, and
  surrounded by five hundred followers, to the Kukkutarama, and visited the
  thera Sonaka.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And when he perceived that (the thera) sat
  sunk in a trance with senses restrained' and did not answer his greeting, he
  asked the brotherhood about this matter. They said: 'Those who are deep in a
  trance give no reply.' (So he asked) 'How come they forth from (the trance)?'
  And the bhikkhus said:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'At a call from the master, or a call from the
  brotherhood, or. when the allotted time is ended, or at the approach of death
  they come forth (from the trance).'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As they saw, speaking thus, that these
  (youths) were destined for holiness, they caused the call from the brotherhood
  to be given; and (the thera) awoke from the trance and went to them. The youth
  asked: 'Wherefore didst thou not speak to me, venerable one?' The (thera)
  answered: 'We were enjoying that which is for us to enjoy.' The (young man)
  said: 'Let us also enjoy this.' He answered: 'Those only can we cause to enjoy
  it who are like unto us.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then, with their parents' leave, the young
  Siggava and Candavajji and their five hundred followers likewise received the
  pabbajja and (afterwards) the upasampada-ordination from the thera Sonaka.
  With him as their master the two eagerly studied the three pitakas and
  attained to the six supernormal powers.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thereafter when Siggava knew that Tissa had
  been born into this world, the thera, from that time, frequented his house for
  seven years. And not for seven years did it befall him to hear the words 'Go
  further on' (said to him). But in the eighth year did he hear those words 'Go
  further on', in that house. As he went forth the brahman Moggali, who was even
  then coming in, saw him and asked him: 'Hast thou received aught in our
  house?' And he answered: 'Yes.' When (Moggali) went into his house he heard
  (what had befallen) and when the thera came to the house again, on the second
  day afterwards, he reproached him with the lie. And when he had heard the
  thera's words the brahman, full of faith, gave him continual alms of his own
  food, and little by little did all of his household become believers, and the
  brahman continually offered hospitality (to the thera), giving him a seat in
  his house.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So as time passed the young Tissa gradually
  came to the age of sixteen years and reached the further shore of the ocean of
  the three vedas. The thera, thinking that he might have speech with him in
  this way, made all the seats in his house to vanish, save the seat of the
  young brahman. Being come from the Brahma-world (this latter) loved
  cleanliness, and therefore were they used to keep his chair hung up for better
  care thereof.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the people in the house, finding no other
  seat, full of confusion, since the thera had to stand, prepared the seat of
  the young Tissa for him. When the young brahman returned from his teacher's
  house and saw (the thera) sitting there he fell into anger and spoke to him in
  unfriendly wise. The thera said to him: 'Young man, dost thou know the manta
  ?' And the young brahman (for answer) asked him the same question again. Since
  the thera replied: 'I know it,' he asked him concerning hard passages in the
  vedas. The thera expounded them to him; for, when leading the lay life, he had
  already studied the vedas even to the end. How should he not be able to
  expound them since he had mastered the four special sciences?</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'For him whose thought arises and does not
  perish, thought shall perish and not arise (again); but for him whose thought
  shall perish and not arise, thought shall arise (again) and not perish.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The wise thera asked this question from the
  (chapter called) Cittayamaka. And it was as the (darkness of) night to the
  other, and he said to him: 'What kind of manta is that, o bhikkhu?' 'The manta
  of the Buddha,' answered (the thera); and when the other said: 'Impart it to
  me,' he said:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'I impart it (only) to one who wears our
  robe.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So with the leave of his father and mother
  (the young man) received the pabbajja-ordination, for the sake of the manta,
  and the thera, when he had ordained him, imparted to him duly the (method of
  the) kammatthanas. By practice of meditation this highly gifted man soon won
  the fruit of sotapatti, and when the thera was aware of this he sent him to
  the thera Candavajji that he might learn the suttapitaka and abhidhammapitaka
  of him. And this he learned (from Candavajji).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And thereafter the monk Siggava, having
  conferred on him the upasampada, taught him the vinaya and again instructed
  him in the two other (pitakas). When, afterwards, the young Tissa had gained
  the true insight, he attained in time to the mastery of the six supernormal
  powers and reached the rank of a thera. Far and wide shone his renown like the
  sun and moon. The world paid heed to his word even as to the word of the
  Sarnbuddha.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the Story of the them Tissa, the son
  of Moggali.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day the prince (Tissa) when hunting saw
  gazelles sporting joyously in the wild. And at this sight he thought:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Even the gazelles sport thus joyously, who
  feed on grass in the wild. Wherefore are not the bhikkhus joyous and gay, who
  have their food and dwelling in comfort?'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Returned home he told the king his thought. To
  teach him the king handed over to him the government of the kingdom for one
  week, saying: 'Enjoy, prince, for one week, my royal state; theit will I put
  thee to death.' Thus said the ruler.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And when the week was gone by he asked:
  'Wherefore art thou thus wasted away ?' And when (Tissa) answered: 'By reason
  of the fear of death,' the king spoke again to him and said: 'Thinking that
  thou must die when the week was gone by, thou wast no longer joyous and gay;
  how then can ascetics be joyous and gay, my dear, who think ever upon death?'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And (Tissa) when his brother spoke thus, was
  turned toward faith in the doctrine (of the Buddha). And afterwards when he
  once went forth hunting, he saw the thera Mahadhamrnarakkhita, the
  self-controlled, sitting at the foot of a tree, and fanned by a cobra with a
  branch of a säla-tree. And that wise (prince) thought: 'When shall I, like
  this thera, be ordained in the religion of the Conqueror, and live in the
  forest-wilderness?'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the thera, to convert him, had come
  thither flying through the air, standing on the water of the pond in the
  Asokarama, he, leaving hisgoodly garments behind him in the air, plunged into
  the water and bathed his limbs. And when the prince saw this marvel he was
  filled with joyful faith, and the wise man made this wise resolve: 'This very
  day will I receive the pabbajja-ordination.' He went to the king and
  respectfully besought him to let him receive the pabbajjii.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since the king could not turn him from (his
  resolve) he took him with him and went with a great retinue to the vihära.
  There (the prince) received the pabbajji from the thera Mahädhammarakkhita
  and with him four hundred thousand persons, but the number of those who
  afterwards were ordained is not known. A nephew of the monarch known by the
  name Aggibrahma was the consort of the king's daughter Samghamitti and the son
  of these two (was) named Sumana. He (Aggibrahma) also craved the king's leave
  and was ordained together with the prince.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The prince's ordination, whence flowed
  blessing to many folk, was in the fourth year of (the reign of) king Asoka. In
  the same year he received the upasampada-ordination, and since his destiny was
  holiness the prince, zealously striving, became an arahant, gifted with the
  six supernormal powers.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">All those beautiful viharas (then) begun they
  duly finished in all the cities within three years; but, by the miraculous
  power of the thera Indagutta, who watched over the work, the äräma named
  after Asoka was likewise quickly brought to completion. On those spots which
  the Conqueror himself had visited the monarch built beautiful cetiyas here and
  there. On every side from the eighty-four thousand cities came letters on one
  day with the news: 'The viharas are completed.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the great king, great in majesty, in
  wondrous power and valour, received the letters, he, desiring to hold. high
  festival in all the aramas at once, proclaimed in the town with beat of drum:
  'On the seventh day from this day shall a festival of all the aramas be kept,
  in every way, in all the provinces. Yojana by yojana on the earth shall great
  largess be given; the aramas in the villages and the streets shall be adorned.
  In all the viharas let lavish gifts of every kind be bestowed upon the
  brotherhood, according to the time and the means (of givers), and adornments,
  such as garlands of lamps and garlands of flowers, here and there, and all
  that is meet for festivals, with music of every kind, in manifold ways. And
  all are to take upon themselves the duties of the uposatha-day and hear
  religious discourse, and offerings of many kinds must they make on the same
  day.' And all the people everywhere held religious festivals of every kind,
  glorious as the world of gods,'even as had been commanded and (did) yet more.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">On that day the great king wearing all his
  adornments with the women of his household, with his ministers and surrounded
  by the multitude of his troops, went to his own arama, as if cleaving the
  earth. In the midst of the brotherhood he stood, bowing down to the venerable
  brotherhood. In the assembly were eighty kotis of bhikkhus, and among these
  were a hundred thousand ascetics who had overcome the asavas. Moreover there
  were ninety times one hundred thousand bhikkhunis, and among these a thousand
  had overcome the äsavas. These (monks and nuns) wrought the miracle called
  the 'unveiling of the world' to the end that the king Dhammasoka might be
  converted. Candasoka (the wicked Asoka) was he called in earlier times, by
  reason of his evil deeds; he was known as Dhammäsoka (the pious Asoka)
  afterwards because of his pious deeds. He looked around over the (whole)
  Jambudipa bounded by the ocean and over all the vihäras adorned with the
  manifold (beauties of) the festival and with exceeding joy, as he saw them, he
  asked the brethren, while taking his seat: 'Whose generosity toward the
  doctrine of the Blessed One was ever (so) great (as mine), venerable sirs'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The thera Moggaliputta answered the king's
  question:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Even in the lifetime of the Blessed One there
  was no generous giver like to thee.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the king heard this he rejoiced yet more
  and asked:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Nay then, is there a kinsman of Buddha's
  religion like unto me?'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But the thera perceived the destiny of the
  king's son Mahinda' and of his daughter Samghamitta, and foresaw the progress
  of the doctrine that was to arise from (them), and he, on whom lay the charge
  of the doctrine, replied thus to the king: 'Even a lavish giver of gifts like
  to thee is not a kinsman of the religion; giver of wealth is he called, O
  ruler of men. But he who lets son or daughter enter the religious order is a
  kinsman of the religion and withal a giver of gifts.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since the monarch would fain become a kinsman
  of the religion he asked Mahinda and Samghamitta, who stood near:</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Do you wish to receive the pabbajja, dear
  ones? The pabbajja is held to be a great (good).' Then, when they heard their
  father's words, they said to him: 'This very day we would fain enter the
  order, if thou, O king, dost wish it; for us, even as for thee, will blessing
  come of our pabbajja.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">For already since the time of the prince's
  (Tissa's) pabbajja had he resolved to enter the order, and she since (the
  ordination) of Aggibrahma. Although the monarch wished to confer on Mahinda
  the dignity of prince-regent, yet did he consent to his ordination with the
  thought: 'This (last) is the greater dignity.' So he permitted his dear son
  Mahinda, distinguished (above all others) by intelligence, beauty and
  strength, and his daughter Samghamitta, to be ordained with all solemnity.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At that time Mahinda, the king's son, was
  twenty years old, and the king's daughter Samghamitta was then eighteen years
  old. On the very same day did he receive the pabbajjaand also the
  upasampada-ordination, and for her the pabbajjaordination and the placing
  under a teacher took place on the same day.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The prince's master was the thera named after
  Moggali; the pabbajja-ordination was conferred on him by the thera Mahädeva,
  but Mahantika pronounced the ceremonial words,' and even in the very place
  where he (received) the upasampada-ordination this great man reached the state
  of an arahant together with the special kinds of knowledge.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The directress of Samghamitta was the renowned
  Dhamma and her teacher was Ayupala; in time she became free from the asavas.
  Those two lights of the doctrine, who brought great blessing to the island of
  Lanka, received the pabbajja in the sixth year of king Dhammäsoka. The great
  Mahinda, the converter of the island (of Lanka), learned the three pitakas
  with his master in three years. This bhikkhuni, even like the new moon, and
  the bhikkhu Mahinda, like the sun, illumined always the sky, the doctrine of
  the Sambuddha.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once in time past, a dweller in the forest,
  who went forth into the forest- from Pataliputta, loved a wood-nymph named
  Kunti. Owing to the union with him she bore two sons, the elder was Tissa and
  the younger was named Sumitta. Afterwards both received the
  pabbajja-ordination from the thera Mahavaruna and attained to arahantship and
  the possession of the six supernormal powers.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">(Once) the elder suffered pains in the foot
  from the poison of a venomous insect, and when his younger brother asked (what
  he needed) he told him that a handful of ghee was the remedy. But the thera
  set himself against pointing out to the king what things needful in sickness,
  and against going in search of the ghee after the midday meal. 'If, on thy
  begging-round, thou receivest ghee, bring it to me,' said the thera Tissa to
  the excellent thera Sumitta. When he went forth on his begging-round he
  received not one handful of ghee, and (in the meanwhile) the pain had come to
  such a pass that even a hundred vessels of ghee could not have cured it. And
  because of that malady the thera was near to death, and when he had exhorted
  (the other) to strive unceasingly he formed the, resolve to pass into nibbana.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lifted up in the air as he sat, and winning
  mastery of his own body by the fire-meditation, according to his own free
  resolve, he passed into nibbana. Flames that broke forth from his body
  consumed the flesh and skin of the thera's whole body, the bones they did not
  consume.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the monarch heard that the thera had died
  in this wise he went to his own arama surrounded by the multitude of his
  troops. Mounted on an elephant the king brought down the bones; and when he
  had caused due honour to be paid to the relics, he questioned the brotherhood
  as to (the thera's) illness. Hearing about it he was' greatly moved, and had
  tanks made at the city gates and filled them with remedies for the sick, and
  day by day he had remedies bestowed on the 'congregation of the bhikkhus,
  thinking: might the bhikkhus never find remedies hard to obtain</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The thera Sumitta passed into nibanna even
  when he was walking (in meditation) in the cankama-hall, and by this also was
  a great multitude of people converted to the doctrine (of the Buddha). Both
  these theras, the sons of Kunti, who had, wrought a great good in the world,
  passed into nibbana in the eighth year of Asoka.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">From that time onwards the revenues of the
  brotherhood were exceeding great, and since those who were converted later
  caused the revenues to increase, heretics who had (thereby) lost revenue and
  honour took likewise the yellow robe, for the sake of revenue, and dwelt
  together with the bhikkhus. They proclaimed their own doctrines as the
  doctrine of the Buddha and carried out their own practices even as they
  wished.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And when the thera Moggaliputta, great in
  firmness of soul, saw the coming-out of this exceedingly evil plague-boil on
  the doctrine, he, far-seeing, deliberated upon the right time to do away with
  it. And when he had committed his great company of bhikkhus to (the direction
  of) the thera Mahinda, he took up his abode, all alone, further up the Ganges
  on the Ahogahga-mountain, and for seven years he gave himself up to solitary
  retreat.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">By reason of the great number of the heretics
  and their unruliness, the bhikkhus could not restrain them by the law; and
  therefore the bhikkhus in Jambudipa for seven years held no uposatha-ceremony
  nor the ceremony of pavarana in all the aramas.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the great king, the famed Dhammasoka, was
  aware of this, he sent a minister to the splendid Asokarama, laying on him
  this command: 'Go, settle this matter and let the uposatha-festival be carried
  out by the community of bhikkhus in my arama.' This fool went thither, and
  when he had called the community of bhikkhus together he announced the king's
  command: 'Carry out the uposatha-festival.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'We hold not the uposatha-festival with
  heretics,' the community of bhikkhus replied to that misguided minister. The
  minister struck off the head of several theras, one by one, with his sword,
  saying, 'I will force you to hold the uposathafestival.' When the king's
  brother, Tissa, saw that crime he came speedily and sat on the seat nearest to
  the minister. When the minister saw the thera he went to the king and told him
  (the whole matter).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the monarch heard it he was troubled and
  went with all speed and asked the community of bhikkhus, greatly disturbed in
  mind: 'Who, in truth, is guilty of this deed that has been done?'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And certain of them answered in their
  ignorance: 'The guilt is thine,' and others said: 'Both of you are guilty';
  but those who were wise answered: 'Thou art not guilty.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the king heard this be said: 'Is there a
  bhikkhu who is able to set my doubts to rest and to befriend religion?' 'There
  is the thera Tissa, the son of Moggali, O king,' answered the brethren to the
  king. Then was the king filled with zeal.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">He sent four theras, each attended by a
  thousand bhikkhus and four ministers, each with a thousand followers, that
  same day, with the charge laid on them by (the king) himself to bring the
  thera thither; but though they prayed him he came not.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the king heard this he sent again eight
  theras and eight ministers each with a thousand followers, but even as before
  he came not.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The king asked: 'Nay then, how shall the thera
  come?' The bhikkhus told him how the thera could be moved to come: 'O great
  king, if they shall say to him, &quot;be our helper, venerable sir, to
  befriend religion,&quot; then will the thera come.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Again the king sent (messengers) sixteen
  theras and sixteen ministers, each with a thousand followers, laying that
  (same) charge upon them, and he said to them: &quot;Aged as he is, the' thera
  will not enter any wheeled vehicle; bring the thera by ship on the Ganges.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So they went to him and told him, and hardly
  had he heard (their message) but he rose up. And they brought the thera in a
  ship and the king went to meet him. Going down even knee-deep into the water
  the king respectfully gave his right hand to the thera, as he came down from
  the ship.' The venerable thera took the king's right hand from compassion
  toward him, and came down from the ship.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The king led the thera to the pleasure-garden
  called Rativaddhana, and when he had washed and anointed his feet and had
  seated himself the monarch spoke thus, to test the thera's faculty: 'Sir, I
  would fain see a miracle.' And to the question which (miracle he desired) he
  answered: 'An earthquake.' And again the other said to him: 'Which wouldst
  thou see, of the whole (earth shaken) or only of a single region?' Then when
  he had asked: 'Which is the more difficult?' and heard (the rep]y): 'The
  shaking of a single region is the more difficult,' he declared that he desired
  to see this last.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then within the boundary of a yojana (in
  extent) did the thera place a waggon, a horse and a man, and a vessel full of
  water at the four cardinal points, and over this yojana by his miraculous
  power he caused the earth to tremble, together with the half of (each of)
  these (things) and let the king seated there behold this.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the monarch asked the thera whether or
  not he himself shared the guilt of the murder of the bhikkhus by the minister.
  The thera taught the king: 'There is no resulting guilt without evil intent,'
  and he recited the Tittira-jataka.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Abiding a week there in the pleasant royal
  park he instructed the ruler in the lovely religion of the Sambuddha. In this
  same week the monarch sent out two yakkhas and assembled together all the
  bhikkhus on the earth. On the seventh day he went to his own splendid arama
  and arranged an assembly of the community of bhikkhus in its full numbers.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then seated with the thera on one side behind
  a curtain the ruler called to him in turn the bhikkhus of the several
  confessions and asked them: 'Sir, what did the Blessed One teach?' And they
  each expounded their wrong doctrine, the Sassata-doctrine and so forth.' And
  all these adherents of false doctrine did the king cause to be expelled from
  the order; those who were expelled were in all sixty thousand. And now he
  asked the rightly-believing bhikkhus: 'What does the Blessed One teach?' And
  they answered: 'He teaches the Vibhajja doctrine.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And the monarch asked the thera: 'Sir, does
  the Sambuddha (really) teach the Vibhajja-doctrine?' The thera answered:
  'Yes.' And when the king knew this he was glad at heart and said: 'Since the
  community is (henceforth) purified, sir, therefore should the brotherhood hold
  the uposathafestival,' and he made the thera guardian of the order and
  returned to his fair capital; the brotherhood held thenceforth the
  uposatha-festival in concord.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Out of the great number of the brotherhood of
  bhikkhus the thera chose a thousand learned bhikkhus, endowed with the six
  supernormal powers, knowing the three pitakas and versed in the special
  sciences, to make a compilation of the true doctrine. Together with them did
  he, in the Asokarama, make a compilation of the true dhamma. Even as the thera
  Mahäkassapa and the thera Yasa had held a council so did the thera Tissa. In
  the midst of this council the thera Tissa set forth the Kathavatthuppakarana,
  refuting the other doctrines. Thus was this council under the protection of
  king Asoka ended by the thousand bhikkhus in nine months.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the seventeenth year of the king's reign
  the wise (thera) who was seventy-two years old, closed the council with a
  great pavarana-ceremony. And, as if to shout applause to the reestablishment
  of doctrine, the great earth shook at the close of the council.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nay, abandoning the high, the glorious Brahma
  heaven and coming down for the sake of the doctrine to the loathsome world of
  men, be, who had fulfilled his own duty, fulfilled the duties toward the
  doctrine. Who else verily may neglect duties toward the doctrine?</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the fifth chapter, called 'The Third
  Council', in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the serene -joy and emotion of the
  pious.</font>
