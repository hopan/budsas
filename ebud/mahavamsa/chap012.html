  DIFFERENT COUNTRIES</font></b></center>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">W</font>HEN the thera
  Moggaliputta, the illuminator of the religion of the Conqueror, had brought
  the (third) council to an end and when, looking into the future, lie had
  beheld the founding of the religion in adjacent countries, (then) in the month
  Kattika' he sent forth theras, one here and one there. The thera Majjhantika
  he sent to Kasmira and Gandhara, the thera, MaMdeva he sent to Mahisamandala.
  To Vanaväsa be sent the thera named Rakkhita, and to Aparantaka the Yona
  named Dhainmarakkhjta; to Maharattha (he sent) the thera named
  MaMdhammarakkhita, but the thera Maharakkhita he sent into the cuntry of the
  Yona. He sent the thera Majjhima to the Himalaya country, and to Suvambhürni
  he sent the two theras Sona and Uttara. The great thera Mahinda, the theras
  Utthiya, Uttiya, Sambala and Bhaddasala his dig ciples, these five theras he
  sent forth with the charge: 'Ye shall found in the lovely island of Lanka the
  lovely religion of the Conqueror.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At that time in Kasmira and Gandhära did the
  naga-king of wondrous power, Araväla, cause the rain called 'Hail' to pour
  down upon the ripe crops, and cruelly did he overwhelm everything with a
  flood. The thera Majjhantika went thither with all speed, passing through the
  air, and wrought (miracles such as) walking on the surface of The water in
  Aravä!a's lake and so forth. When the nagas beheld it they told their king
  with fury about this thing.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then full of fury the naga-king brought divers
  terrors to pass; fierce winds blew, a cloud gave forth thunder and rain,
  thunder strokes crashed, and lightning flashed here and there, trees and
  mountain-tops were hurled down. Nagas in grisly forms terrified (beholders) on
  every side, he himself spat forth smoke and fire threatening in different
  ways.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the thera by his wondrous power had
  brought all these terrors to naught, he said to the naga-king, showing his
  eminent might: 'Even if the world together with the gods came seeking to
  terrify me, they would not be equal to me (in strength) whatever fears and
  dread (they may arouse) in this place.' Nay, if thou shouldst raise the whole
  earth with the ocean and the mountains, thou mighty naga, and shouldst hurl
  them upon me, thou couldst in no wise arouse fear and dread in me. It were
  surely but thy own destruction, thou lord of serpents.'</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then to him, humbled by these words the thera
  preached the doctrine, and thereupon the naga-king came unto the (three)
  refuges and the precepts of duty, and this likewise did eighty-four thousand
  serpents and many gandhabbas, yakkhas and kumbhandakas in the Himalaya. But a
  yakkha named Pandaka with (his wife) the yakkhini Harita and his five hundred
  sons obtained the first fruit (of sanctification).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">'Henceforth let no anger arise as of old; work
  no more harm to the harvest, for living beings love their happiness; cherish
  love for beings, let men live in happiness.' Thus were they taught by him and
  they did according to (this teaching). Then the lord of serpents made the
  thera sit upon a jewel-throne and he stood near, fanning him. But the dwellers
  in Kasmira and Gandhara who had come to worship the naga-king acknowledged the
  thera as the mightier in working wonders, and when they had paid the thera
  reverence they seated themselves on one side near him. The thera expounded to
  them the dhamma, (namely) the Asivisupama. The conversion of eighty thousand
  persons took place and a hundred thousand persons received the pabbajja from
  the thera. Since then Kasmira and Gandhära shine with yellow robes and prize
  above all the three things.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The thera Mahadeva who had gone to the
  Mahisamandala. country preached in the midst of the people the
  Devadütasuttanta. Forty thousand (persons) made pure (in themselves) the eye
  of the truth and yet forty thousand received from him the pabbajja-ordination.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The thera Rakkhita, who had gone to Vanaväsa,
  preached, floating in the air in the midst of the people, the
  Anamataggasamyutta. The conversion of sixty thousand persons took place,
  thirty-seven thousand in number received the pabbajja frbm him. Five hundred,
  viharas were founded in the country. Thus did the tbera establish there the
  religion of the Conqueror.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The thera Dhammarakkhita the Yona, being gone
  to Aparantaka' and having preached in the midst of the people the
  Aggikkhandhopama-sutta gave to drink of the nectar of truth to thirty-seven
  thousand living beings who had come togdther there, lie who perfectly
  understood truth and untruth. A thousand men and yet more women went forth
  from noble families and received the pabbajja.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The wise Mahadhammarakkhita, who had gone to
  MaMrattha, related there the jataka called Mahanaradakassapa. Eighty-four
  thousand persons attained to the reward of the path (of salvation), thirteen
  thousand received from him the pabbajjL</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The wise Maharakkhita who went to the country
  of the Yona delivered in the midst of the people the Kalakarama suttanta. A
  hundred and seventy thousand living beings attained, to the reward of the path
  (of salvation); ten thousand received the pabbajja.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The wise Majjhima preached in the Himalaya
  region whither he had gone with four theras, the
  Dhammacakkappavattana-suttanta.' Eighty kotis of living beings attained to the
  reward of the path (of salvation). The five theras separately converted five
  kingdoms; from each of them a hundred thousand persons received the pabbajja,
  believing in the doctrine of the Sammasambuddha.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Together with the thera Uttara the thera Sona
  of wondrous might went to Suvannabhumi. Now at this time, whenever a boy was
  born in the king's palace, a fearsome female demon who came forth out of the
  sea, was wont to devour (the child) and vanish again. And at that very moment
  a prince was born in the king's palace. When the people saw the theras they
  thought: 'These are companions of the demons,' and they came armed to kill
  them. And the theras asked: 'What does this mean?' and said to them: 'We are
  pious ascetics, in no wise companions of the demon.' Then the demon came forth
  from the ocean with her following, and when the people saw them they raised a
  great outcry. But the thera created twice as many terrifying demons and
  therewith surrounded the demon and her following on every side. She thought:
  'This (country) is come into possession of these (people),' and,
  panic-stricken, she took to flight.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the thera had made a bulwark round the
  country he pronounced in the assembly the Brahmajala (suttanta).</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many were the people who came unto the (three)
  refuges and the precepts of duty; sixty thousand were converted to the true
  faith. Three thousand five hundred sons of noble families received the
  pabbajja and one thousand five hundred daughters of noble families received it
  likewise. Thenceforth when a prince was born in the royal palace the kings
  gave to such the name Sonuttara.</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since they did even forbear to enter into the
  bliss already won (such was) also the renunciation of the all-compassionate
  Conqueror they bestowed blessing on the world,' (going) here and there. Who
  should grow weary in (striving for) the salvation of the world?</font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends the twelfth chapter, called 'The
  Converting of Different Countries', in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the serene
  joy and emotion of the pious.</font>
