        <P>From an ordinary boy to a remarkable monk, Buddhadasa Bhikkhu left 
        behind a legacy of teachings, writings and a sanctuary for others to 
        continue on the path of dharma </P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      </I><FONT SIZE="6">
      <P>I</FONT>n 1955, Buddhadasa Bhikkhu, founder of Suan Mokkh (Garden of 
      Liberation), made a three-month pilgrimage to India, the birth place of 
      Buddha. Throughout his life, the late reformist monk kept his vow to 
      follow in his teacher&#39;s footsteps. But this path was not lined with the 
      traditional gesture of a wai, or an offer of candles or incense sticks. 
      His journey encompassed a deeper understanding and practice of the true 
      teachings, or dharma, of the Lord Buddha.</P>
      <P>A publishing house is now organising a series of free trips for young 
      people from all over Thailand to learn about the late monk&#39;s life and 
      work. The two-day and one-night guided tour of Surat Thani province 
      includes a visit to the places where the monk grew up, studied and 
      practiced dharma, as well as the site of his cremation. All of this is to 
      commemorate next year&#39;s centenary celebration of Buddhadasa&#39;s birth.</P>
      <P>The well-respected monk has left this world, but his legacy continues 
      to inspire.</P>
      <P>&quot;This is how Buddhadasa will never die. He will continue to live on and 
      influence us through his life and work,&quot; said Chonrangsee Chalermchaikit, 
      managing director of Sukhapab Jai, the 23-year-old publishing house that 
      has introduced many of Buddhadasa&#39;s works to the public.</P>
      <P>Throughout his 67 years in the robes, the senior monk wrote numerous 
      books, gave hundreds of talks and invoked the true spirit of dharma, one 
      not imbued with superstition, mindless ritual or materialism.</P>
      <P>All of this was the monk&#39;s way of expressing his gratitude to the 
      Buddha, whom he held in highest regard. His chosen name, Buddhadasa, 
      literally means &quot;a slave of Buddha&quot;. According to the late monk, taking 
      refuge in the Buddha, dharma, and the sangha, or community of monks, did 
      not mean idolising the Buddha, but rather trying to live in accordance 
      with the Buddha&#39;s teachings.</P>
      <P>&quot;Dharma is the religion,&quot; wrote the monk in 1965 upon the completion of 
      an Indian-style Buddhist sculpture project at his forest monastery. 
      &quot;People nowadays, however, have become attached to and view Buddha as a 
      god instead of seeing him as a human being who attained enlightenment and 
      had great compassion for others. They are not aware that Buddha teaches 
      that anyone can follow his path and find the way out of suffering by and 
      for themselves.&quot;</P>
      <P>The organisers of the current trip to Suan Mokkh have adopted this 
      attitude towards their study and exploration of the late monk&#39;s life.</P>
      <P>&quot;We don&#39;t want to idolise Buddhadasa Bhikkhu,&quot; said Chonrangsee. &quot;We 
      focus on dharma and how it is reflected through the monk&#39;s way of living, 
      thinking and working. We hope that his life will help inspire people, 
      especially the younger generation. Buddhadasa often said, &#39;Whether or not 
      there will be peace in the world depends on the morals of the young 
      people.&quot;&#39;</P>
      <B>
      <P>EARLY LIFE</P>
      </B>
      <P>The district of Chaiya in Surat Thani was once a heartland of Buddhism 
      when it first appeared in the Siamese Kingdom. A two-lane cement road now 
      leads to a small community and a wooden two-storey shophouse: The 
      birthplace of a little boy who would later be known as Buddhadasa.</P>
      <P>On May 27, 1906, Ngerm Panich was born, the eldest of three children of 
      a Chinese merchant named Sieng, who together with his Thai wife, Kluen, 
      ran a small grocery store. Much has changed since then -- the building has 
      been renovated and looks brand new -- but some of its original structures 
      are still evident.</P>
      <P>Metta Panich, Buddhadasa&#39;s nephew, recalls stories he learned about 
      life in the village a century ago. </P>
      <P>&quot;In those days, temples had a dominant role in community life,&quot; he 
      said. &quot;Every house would have a table set up with alms ready to be offered 
      to monks every morning. Once a week, people would go to a nearby temple 
      and listen to sermons and prayers. There were six temples in the area and 
      monks usually dropped by for a visit and conversation.&quot;</P>
      <P>When the Panich brothers grew up, one of their joint hobbies was to 
      initiate dharma discussions in the neighbourhood, so they opened their 
      house up as a &quot;public library&quot;.</P>
      <P>&quot;Life then was peaceful and rather carefree. There was no need to shut 
      the doors or windows. The villagers did not have to worry about burglars. 
      They knew each other well, like relatives,&quot; Metta said.</P>
      <P>Ngerm&#39;s mother was an influential figure in his life. She taught the 
      young boy about responsibility and the art of frugality. She was later one 
      of the main sponsors of the Suan Mokkh foundation in the 1930s.</P>
      <P>Although the family was well-to-do, Ngerm learned how to be a wise 
      spender. The boy only got one satang (100 satang is equivalent to one 
      baht) as his daily school allowance. He would buy kanom jeen (rice 
      noodles) and nam ya (spicy soup) for lunch, sprinkled with vegetables or 
      morning glory that he had collected from a nearby pond.</P>
      <P>&quot;When he was nine, he asked his mother to buy him a bicycle but she 
      answered, &#39;It is not a mother&#39;s duty to buy her son a bike. If you want 
      it, you have to earn it yourself,&quot;&#39; said Poj Youngpholkan, a biographer of 
      the late Buddhadasa Bhikkhu.</P>
      <P>&quot;For six months, the young boy had to sew clothes and saved up in order 
      to buy what he wanted.&quot;</P>
      <P>To waste things like water and fuel was discouraged by the matriarch.</P>
      <P>&quot;His mother taught her children to make the the maximum use of 
      everything,&quot; said Poj. &quot;And this habit remained with Buddhadasa throughout 
      his life. Nothing would be thrown away, unless it has been thoroughly 
      used. For example, sometimes he would write dharma poems on the backs of 
      old calendars. &quot;</P>
      <P>Growing up, Ngerm was a regular -- and sometimes mischievous -- child. 
      Ngerm was often spanked by his mother for getting into squabbles or 
      playing pranks on his two siblings. And like most children his age, he was 
      afraid of ghosts.</P>
      <P>&quot;One day, the cattle he was tending ventured out into a graveyard,&quot; Poj 
      said. &quot;It was dusk already. He was very scared but then a thought came: &#39;I 
      am afraid of ghosts, but look, those cattle just walked there to nibble 
      grass.&#39; The fear melted away, and Buddhadasa said he was grateful to the 
      cattle for teaching him a valuable lesson.&quot;</P>
      <B>
      <P>SCHOOL LIFE </P>
      </B>
      <P>A short ride in a car from Buddhadasa&#39;s old house is an abandoned, 
      cobwebbed, wooden one-storey structure. The deserted building was once Wat 
      Bhoditharam school, called by the monk his &quot;university&quot;. It was here that 
      young Ngerm learned how to scrape away at his selfishness. He dubbed 
      himself as &quot;the man of the world&quot; -- as a temple boy he had to tend to 
      everything from dawn to bedtime. With his schoolmates, he helped feed 
      abandoned cats, chickens, dogs and pigs, kept the temple areas clean and 
      neat, and grew edible plants to give to the villagers. </P>
      <P>At school, the young Ngerm was not an outstanding student. On one of 
      his year-end school reports, his teacher wrote: &quot;1. He is diligent and 
      finishes work fast and neat; 2. He has not yet been found to bully friends 
      or forced to come to school; 3. He has good memory and likes to do things 
      by himself; 4. He is as intelligent as anyone else.&quot;</P>
      <P>When he was 16, Ngerm&#39;s father died. This meant the teenager had to 
      drop out of school and take over the family&#39;s grocery store business. In 
      addition, the young man had to make overnight boat trips to the town of 
      Surat Thani to buy stock, take care of the household chores, his mother 
      and siblings. Despite the heavy burdens of all this newfound 
      responsibility, he considered those years &quot;full of fun&quot;.</P>
      <P>At 20, Ngerm was ordained a monk, in part to follow the tradition of 
      the day, and to fulfil his mother&#39;s wishes. His ordination name was 
      Inthapanyo (&quot;the wise one&quot;). After three days in the monkhood, he started 
      breaking away from some of the &quot;conventions&quot;. Instead of reading to lay 
      people directly from scriptures, the young monk gave impromptu lectures, 
      trying to make dharma relevant to daily events. His style attracted people 
      from the village and he was invited to give sermons quite frequently.</P>
      <P>After he passed the first level examination in dharma studies (nak-tham 
      tri), he started giving dharma lessons to student monks at a temple in 
      Chaiya.</P>
      <P>&quot;He had a gift for digesting and explaining difficult things. He used 
      props and concrete examples to make his points clear. People loved 
      listening to him. And he enjoyed teaching and seeing his student monks do 
      well on exams. Out of 30 monks he taught, 29 passed,&quot; Poj said.</P>
      <P>To further his education in dharma, the monk went to Bangkok, which he 
      believed to be the land of the &quot;Awakened Ones&quot;, as it was a hub of 
      scriptures and gurus. However, he was quickly disillusioned by the lack of 
      commitment to Buddhist teachings displayed by some of the monks and found 
      himself a misfit among them.</P>
      <P>&quot;Buddhadasa Bhikkhu was unhappy to see the lax practices of so many 
      monks in Bangkok. They dined after 12pm, had physical contact with women 
      and engaged in superstitious rituals. They strove for power, titles, 
      decorations and wealth.&quot;</P>
      <P>Bored and disenchanted with Bangkok, the monk flunked the exam and 
      decided to go back to his hometown. With the help of his brother and some 
      monk friends, he sought a solitary hermitage where he could study and 
      practise dharma. &quot;... I have been pursuing the way of the world since the 
      minute I was born. From now on, I will no longer do so. ... I will bid 
      farewell to the world and seek the purity of the araya [awakened] ... to 
      free my mind from the world,&quot; Buddhadasa Bhikkhu wrote.</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE BEGINNING OF THE PATH</P>
      </B>
      <P>An abandoned monastery called Wat Trapangjik was the perfect location 
      for the young monk to begin a new chapter in his life. An overgrown 
      jungle, there were no people around, rather beasts such as poisonous 
      snakes, boars and wild birds.</P>
      <P>&quot;In the Buddha&#39;s time, as written in the scriptures, the Buddha advised 
      his disciples to go to the forest, to sit under the trees in search of the 
      ultimate truth,&quot; Poj said.</P>
      <P>That was exactly what Buddhadasa did. For three months, he received no 
      visitors, abstained from speaking, took only one meal a day. His 
      residence, or kuti, was a small hut with a corrugated roof.</P>
      <P>The self-taught monk read and studied many scriptures and books in 
      search of the path to becoming &quot;Awakened&quot;. During this time, he wrote a 
      book entitled Tam Roy Phra Arahant (In Pursuit of the Awakened Ones). He 
      also kept journals of his observations during the intensive three-month 
      solitary retreat.</P>
      <P>It was here in 1932 that he declared himself to be slave of Buddha, or 
      &quot;Buddhadasa&quot;. A white stone pillar with this declaration inscribed on it 
      still sits in the forest. The kuti, now rundown, is also still there. The 
      only thing that has changed is the virgin forest. </P>
      <P>&quot;This place was a turning point for the young monk and inspired the 
      creation of Suan Mokkh,&quot; said Poj. </P>
      <P>This commitment to build the garden sanctuary was documented in his 
      Dharma Practice Calendar in 1934: &quot;I will sacrifice everything and aim 
      only for sublime happiness in order to share it with others.&quot;</P>
      <P>For almost 12 years, Wat Trapangjik was a monastery where Buddhadasa 
      was the only permanent resident monk. Many called him a &quot;crazy monastic&quot;. 
      However, some dharma friends such as his brother and other progressive 
      monks made occasional visits to discuss Buddhist teachings with him.</P>
      <B>
      <P>SUAN MOKKH FOREST MONASTERY</P>
      </B>
      <P>In &quot;Telling It in the Twilight Years&quot;, Buddhadasa Bhikkhu said in a 
      series of interviews given to Phra Pracha Prasanthammo: &quot;I once thought 
      about living alone as a hermit, but that would have been the end of Suan 
      Mokkh. This communal co-existence on the other hand has benefited far more 
      people.&quot;</P>
      <P>In 1943, with the help of his mother, brother and friends, Buddhadasa 
      moved Suan Mokkh to its current location. The 300-rai forest monastery in 
      Chaiya was designed to be a sanctuary for awakening people to dharma. </P>
      <P>In later years, the monk ventured to create three different venues on 
      the same compound: One for women, another for foreigners, the third for 
      monks. </P>
      <P>Nature, to the monk, was the best dharma teacher. Therefore, at Suan 
      Mokkh, trees serve as walls and pillars, their branches and shady leaves 
      as roofs, the sand and rocks become chairs.</P>
      <P>&quot;Buddha was born on the ground, he journeyed on foot to teach dharma, 
      and he died lying on the earth. I will follow him, to always keep my feet 
      on the ground,&quot; he once told people who offered to tile the sandy ground 
      in front of his kuti where he worked and welcomed visitors.</P>
      <P>The monk&#39;s kutis, which were also his office and library, will soon 
      function as a museum. Metta, the monk&#39;s nephew, said people at the temple 
      plan to renovate all the kutis to show how he lived, what kinds of books 
      he read and how the prolific monk-writer worked.</P>
      <P>&quot;The monk was self-taught. He read many books of all kinds. He read 
      about Christianity, Islam, philosophy and more. When he kept fish, he read 
      books on fish,&quot; said Metta.</P>
      <P>&quot;He learned from everything, even his own illnesses. He used to say 
      that each time he got sick, he learned more and became wiser.&quot;</P>
      <P>A few years before he passed away, Buddhadasa moved to a new kuti, 
      originally designed as a toilet. &quot;He said the bathroom was spacious and 
      convenient to move about in,&quot; Metta explained.</P>
      <P>Buddhadasa did not favour concrete structures over nature, but in the 
      years since its establishment, Suan Mokkh has grown steadily with the 
      addition of several buildings to welcome the increasing numbers of 
      visitors.</P>
      <P>An old wooden structure known as Sala Nang-ngarm (beauty queen 
      pavilion) houses three skeletons: one each of a baby, a man and a woman 
      who was a former beauty queen of Thailand. This aims to remind visitors of 
      the impermanence of life and urges them to follow the monk&#39;s suggestion -- 
      &quot;to put an end to our suffering before we die&quot;.</P>
      <P>Buddhadasa Bhikkhu also wanted to promote art at the monastery. The 
      Spiritual Entertainment Theatre enshrines paintings and sculptures that 
      symbolise dharma. The external walls of the theatre are decorated with 
      replicas of ancient Indian bas-relief sculptures representing scenes from 
      Lord Buddha&#39;s life, which the monk saw during his trip to India. </P>
      <P>Even at the end of his life, Buddhadasa Bhikkhu used his death as a 
      lesson for the people. Near Mount Buddha Thong, a small hill inside the 
      monastery complex, is the stone pillar which serves as a memorial of the 
      monk&#39;s cremation back in 1993.</P>
      <P>It is amazing to see the amount of work and merit an &quot;ordinary&quot; monk 
      accomplished in one lifetime. The monastery&#39;s Sala Dhammakot (Propagation 
      of Dharma Hall) showcases all his work, books, tapes, articles and awards 
      well as his remains, which were placed beneath a Buddha statue.</P>
      <P>It&#39;s impossible to thoroughly delve into 87 years of Buddhadasa 
      Bhikkhu&#39;s &quot;live simply, aim for the highest&quot; legacy in just one or two 
      days. But the inspiration which he has imparted through his teachings and 
      the existence of Suan Mokkh itself may, the organisers believe, inspire 
      more to follow his path. And that, if achieved, will be more than enough.</P>
