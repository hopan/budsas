    <p>&nbsp;<strong><i>Mudita</i></strong> means <em><strong>appreciative
    joy</strong></em> at the success and good fortune of others.
    Evaluation of achievement is a precursor to mudita, and
    appreciation a component of mudita. Seeing the good in others
    and learning to recognize and admire what good there is, is
    what mudita tacitly implies. Laughter and exhilaration are
    not characteristics of mudita. Mudita is joy and appreciation
    flowing quietly out of the core of one's heart towards others
    like the waters from a spring flowing outwards from the
    bowels of the earth. Spontaneous and sincere participation in
    another's glorious hour is possible only when the quality of
    mudita is developed to its fullest. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;Genuine joy in the prosperity of others is indeed a
    rare quality. The virtue of mudita may be best noticed at
    work in the joy of parents over the success of their
    offspring, and in the genuine ecstasy of teachers over the
    success of their pupils, particularly in the latter situation
    when the threat of the younger eclipsing the older is always
    imminent. While it is easy to practice mudita within the
    narrow circle of one's family and friends, to identify
    oneself with the joys and triumphs of outsiders requires
    deliberate effort. Yet the capacity for doing so is rooted in
    man's nature. Smiling faces of adults make children respond
    readily with their own smiles. This potential in the child
    should be nurtured and activated by parents and
    educationists. For the seed of mudita planted early in a
    child will grow and blossom and bear fruit in his adolescence
    and in his adult life. To some extent, man is a product of
    his environment -- with this in mind, adults, parents,
    teachers and wardens who handle children should be of a
    cheerful disposition and an appreciative nature. &nbsp; </p>

    <p>&nbsp;Latent in man are both noble characteristics as well
    as vicious tendencies. It is strange that the vices latent in
    man seem almost natural and spontaneous, whereas the dormant
    virtues have to be brought to the surface with great effort.
    As one advances in years, activating and developing the
    potential of mudita becomes more and more difficult -- though
    not impossible. Seeds will not take root in hard and crusty
    soil. One has to loosen and soften the soil if one expects
    shoots from seeds. In children the heart is tender and seeds
    planted therein will take root early and grow fast. So the
    best time to activate and develop the positive and saintly
    tendencies which lie dormant in every human being is during
    the tender years. When a child receives praise and
    approbation, he will naturally learn to give it to others for
    he knows the joy of recognition and appreciation. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;Envy and jealousy are the chief opponents of mudita,
    or appreciative joy. These noxious qualities arise partly out
    of a lack of confidence in one's achievements and one's
    capacity to achieve. Dislike, boredom -- nuances of the Pali
    term <strong><i>arati</i></strong> -- may be considered as
    enemies of mudita. The opposite sterling virtues which can
    vanquish these enemies are loving-kindness, <strong><i>metta</i></strong>,
    and compassion, <strong><i>karuna</i></strong>. Mudita is
    placed third in the listing of the Brahma Viharas, for mudita
    is the natural outcome of the two preceding benign mental
    states. Metta and karuna are the forces that urge one to
    alleviate the sufferings of others with purely altruistic
    motives, expecting nothing in return -- not even gratitude.
    What matters to the Buddhist is the little bit of joy he has
    brought to another's heart by relieving him of even a little
    bit of sorrow, of suffering. Little do people realize how a
    kind word, a warm smile, a loving touch can act as a balm to
    a sorrow-laden heart. We can now see how mudita becomes a
    natural result of metta and karuna. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;Too often people are much more ready to sympathize
    with the misfortunes of others than to rejoice with them in
    their good fortune. Where is a definition of a friend:
    &quot;What are friends? Are they not dear sweet people who
    abuse you behind your back and take an inward deep pleasure
    in hearing of your faults and misfortunes?&quot; We have to
    take ourselves to task whenever we recognize these
    psychological perversities within us, and with great effort
    try to eradicate these unwholesome tendencies which seem to
    be deep-rooted. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;We have to be honest with ourselves and look within.
    Whenever traces of envy or jealousy enter our hearts, we
    should recognize the emotion as one which is unwholesome. We
    should also make an effort not to let it take hold of us. Let
    us ask this question: Why are we envious? Because someone
    possesses something we do not. Why do we not have that which
    we want, that which would give us joy? The answer lies in our
    own <strong><i>kamma</i></strong>. In the light of the Buddha
    Dhamma no one is to blame but ourselves. The greatest sorrow
    for a woman is the inability to bear a child. Why accumulate
    more bad kamma by envying those who have children?
    Unwholesome states of mind such as hatred and anger are said
    to be the causes of infertility. So why promote such a state
    in a future birth too by continuing that evil train of
    thought? This line of thinking, of arguing, needs very great
    effort. It is not easy. That is why the Buddha praised
    effort, <strong><i>viriya</i></strong>, as a noble virtue.
    &quot;If it were not possible to do good I would not tell you
    to,&quot; said the Buddha. This mode of thinking helps to
    eradicate delusion -- <strong><i>moha</i></strong>. The
    source of all unwholesome kamma is ignorance of moha. When
    the vail of moha is lifted, one sees clearly that craving is
    the source of all sorrows. Craving gives rise to jealousy,
    envy, covetousness, avarice, greed -- all enemies of mudita. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;Let the fertile woman not look down upon her less
    fortunate sister who is denied the great joy of motherhood.
    Let not the one endowed with beauty scorn her plain-looking
    sister. Let not the wealthy insult the poor. After all, we
    must remember that this earthly existence is but a short
    sojourn in our journey through Samsara. The Buddha says there
    is no one on earth who has not in a previous existence been a
    mother, a father, a sister, a brother, a child to us. So let
    us suffuse the whole world with metta, with karuna and with
    mudita. This is why the Brahma Viharas are described as <strong><i>appamanna</i></strong>
    -- illimitables (all embracing). They are so-called because
    they find no barrier or limit. They embrace all living
    beings. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;Jealousy can poison a man's system, mar his
    character, and ruin his social relationships. And what is
    life but a series of relationships? It is only in death that
    we are alone. Today jealousy and greed for power have
    poisoned the mind of the world. We now witness jealousy on a
    global scale. We are destroying each other and our home --
    the earth. The situation at the present is so very grave that
    we can no longer talk of individuals or groups or nations. We
    have to speak for Earth. Carl Sagan, the eminent astronomer,
    exasperated by the wanton destruction of our beautiful little
    planet and its resources asks, &quot;Who speaks for
    Earth?&quot; The practice of mudita never seemed to be as
    important as in the present day. The forces of evil seem to
    have been unleashed in full measure in human hearts the world
    over. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;Advances in science and technology have been of
    immense value to man's material progress and development, but
    the negative by-products of this progress are truly
    frightening. Destruction of natural resources, pollution,
    unhealthy rivalry and dangerous competition have reached such
    colossal proportions that life on earth is threatened.
    Discoveries and inventions in the fields of science and
    technology should be for a better and more comfortable life.
    But now many of those discoveries' are a threat to life
    itself. It is indeed depressing that the irony of this
    situation is not considered with sufficient concern. The ills
    of the world are insidiously increasing so that there is a
    growing sense of cosmic gloom and defeatism. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;Man's predicament as perceived by the modern poet,
    George Barker, is embodied in the following words: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>&nbsp;When will men again Lift irresistible fists Not
        bend from ends But each man lift men Nearer again. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;Many men mean Well: but tall walls Impede, their
        hands bleed and They fall, their seed the Seed of the
        fallen. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;See here the fallen Stooping over stones, over
        their Own bones, but all Stooping doom beaten. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;Whom the noonday wishes Whole, whom the heavens
        compel, And to whom pass immaculate messages, When will
        men again Lift irresistible fists Impede impediments Leap
        Mountains, Laugh at Walls? </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;Looking on, dejected and dispirited, is not the
    solution. We have to struggle to save ourselves and our
    planet. This is why institutions like the United Nations
    Assembly exist. Though satisfactory results may not always be
    forthcoming, the fact that while a section is destroying,
    inventing weapons of hate, another section of mankind is
    arguing, demonstrating, petitioning for peace. As long as
    such forces opposing evil are in existence, there is hope.
    This means that there is still sympathy and love in men's
    hearts for their fellow beings. So we must be hopeful.
    Conflict is eternal; conflict is natural. Conflict helps us
    to rediscover lost values. We must not see only hatred in
    conflict. Conflict is the natural prerequisite of a
    satisfactory solution. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;A section of the world today is enveloped by the
    thick veil of delusion. Hence their inability to see the
    truth. Failure to perceive the Truth is delusion. So it is
    with persistent effort and enduring patience that those who
    wish to be noble and serviceable must sublimate themselves
    and serve humanity, both by example and by precept. The
    cultivation of mudita and the practice of this virtue can
    relieve humanity of the suffering it has brought upon itself.
    Those with right understanding must by personal example work
    out salvation for themselves and for their fellow beings. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;Diligent practice of mudita will make a person more
    amenable, flexible, and understanding. He will learn to live
    outside himself. He will experience a new kind of happiness,
    the joy of sharing. This virtue will elevate him to eradicate
    the cankers of jealousy and egoistic craving; &quot;We&quot;
    and &quot;ours&quot; will be substituted for &quot;me and
    &quot;mine.&quot; Wholesome camaraderie will build up, and he
    will gradually embrace the whole world with loving-kindness
    -- <strong><i>sabbe satta bhavantu sukhitatta</i></strong>.
    The ego will gradually disintegrate, and he will gain insight
    into <strong><i>anatta</i></strong>, the Buddha's central
    doctrine. The fetters of attachment to self will break first,
    and with it all other fetters of attachment, which will lead
    him gradually toward renunciation. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;The Buddha advocates the sharing not only of
    material resources, but of spiritual resources as well. The
    transferring of merit to our dear departed ones is a truly
    beautiful sharing. Our loved ones who are no more with us
    physically feel such a sense of joy in the thought that they
    are not forgotten; the joy that accrues to them by our
    enlightened acts is <i>anumodana</i>. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;Mankind is on the eve of a nuclear war. Sure and
    certain destruction will be the fate of the human race if war
    breaks out. Now is the hour to muster benign forces within
    the human heart on a global scale. The virtues of metta,
    karuna, mudita and upekkha must be practiced to combat the
    degrading forces of greed and hatred which cause dangerous
    divisions. Once the sparks of divinity in men's hearts are
    released, all divisions of creed, colour, religion and race
    will recede into insignificance. Then only one creed will be
    in evidence: the creed of humanity. So let us activate,
    cultivate, and develop the sublime qualities -- Brahma
    Viharas. These powers hidden within the human heart are yet
    untapped, yet it is through these powers that humanity can be
    saved. This seems to be the way -- the only way out of the
    present entanglement. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&quot;The inner tangle and the outer tangle -- This
    generation is entangled in a tangle. And so I ask Gotama this
    question: Who succeeds in disentangling this tangle?&quot; </p>
    <p>&nbsp;The answer of the enlightened One given centuries
    ago embodies the solution to the present tangle. It is, in
    fact, the answer to every generation -- past, present,
    future. &quot;He who succeeds,&quot; says the Buddha,
    &quot;in disentangling this tangle, is the wise man,
    established well in virtue, who has developed consciousness
    and understanding.&quot; </p>
