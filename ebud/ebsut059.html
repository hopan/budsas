      the Buddha delivered his noble messages, appears to have been hallowed as 
      the text of the Buddhavacana. The language of the Buddhavacana is called 
      Pali or Magadhi and sometimes Suddha-Magadhi, presumably in order to 
      distinguish it from Ardha-Magadhi, the language of Jaina Canons. Magadhi 
      means the language or dialect current in the Magadha. In Pali Lexicon, the 
      definition of Pali is given thus: <A HREF="#Ref">1</A> <I>pa paleti, 
      rakkhati &#39; ti pali</I>. Since it preserves the Buddhavacana (words) in the 
      form of the sacred text, it is called Pali. In fact, the word Pali 
      signifies only &quot;text&quot; &quot;sacred text&quot;. <A HREF="#Ref">2</A></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">According to the tradition current in 
      Theravada Buddhist countries, Pali is Magadhi, Magadhanirutti, 
      Magadhikabhasa, that is to say, the language of the region in which 
      Buddhism had arisen. The Buddhistic tradition makes the further claim that 
      the Pali Tipitaka is composed in the language used by the Buddha himself.
      <A HREF="#Ref">3</A> For this reason Magadhi is also called Mulabhasa
      <A HREF="#Ref">4</A> as the basic language in which the words of the 
      Buddha were originally fixed. However, for Pali now arises the question, 
      which region of India was the home of that language which was the basis of 
      Pali.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Westergrd <A HREF="#Ref">5</A> and E.Kuhn
      <A HREF="#Ref">6</A> consider Pali to be the dialect of Ujjayini, because 
      it stands closest to the language of the Asokan-inscriptions of Girnar 
      (Guzerat), and also because the dialect of Ujjayini is said to have been 
      the mother-tongue of Mahinda who preached Buddhism in Ceylon (Sri Lanka). 
      R.O. Franke had a similar opinion by different means <A HREF="#Ref">7</A>; 
      and he finally reached the conclusion that the original home of Pali was 
      &quot;a territory, which could not have been too narrow, situated about the 
      region from the middle to the Western Vindhya ranges&quot;. Thus it is not 
      improbable that Ujjayini was the centre of its region of expansion. Sten 
      Konow <A HREF="#Ref">8</A> too has decided in favour of the Vindhya region 
      as the home of Pali.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Oldenberg (1879) <A HREF="#Ref">9</A> and 
      E.Muller (1884) <A HREF="#Ref">10</A> consider the Kalinga country to be 
      the home of Pali. Oldenberg thinks that Buddhism, and with it&#39;s the 
      Tipitaka, was introduced into Ceylon rather in course of an intercourse 
      between the island and the neighboring continent extending over a long 
      period. However, E.MUller bases his conclusion on the observation that the 
      oldest settlements in Ceylon could have been founded only by the people of 
      Kalinga, the area on the mainland opposite Ceylon and not by people from 
      Bengal and Bihar.</FONT></P>

      is of the opinion that Buddha himself spoke the dialect of his native 
      province Kosala (Oudh) and it was most likely in this same dialect that he 
      first began to proclaim his doctrine. Later on, however, he wandered and 
      taught in Magadha (Bihar) he probably preached in the dialect of this 
      province. When in course of time the doctrine spread over a large area, 
      the monks of various districts preached each in his own dialect. It is 
      probable that some monks coming from Brahmin circles also attempted to 
      translate the speeches of Buddha into Sanskrit verses. However, the Buddha 
      himself absolutely rejected it, and forbade learning his teachings in any 
      other languages except Magadhi. Here it is related <A HREF="#Ref">12</A>, 
      how two Bhikkhus complained to the Master that the members of the order 
      were of various origins, and that they distorted the words of the Buddha 
      by their own dialect (Sakaya niruttiya). They, therefore, proposed that 
      the words of the Buddha should be translated into Sanskrit verses 
      (Chandaso). The Buddha, however, refused to grant the request and added: 
      Anujanamibhikkhave sakaya niruttiya buddhavacanam pariyapunitum. Rhys 
      Davids and Oldenberg <A HREF="#Ref">13</A> translate this passage by &quot;I 
      allow you, oh brethren, to learn the words of the Buddha each in his own 
      dialect&quot;. This interpretation, however, is not accorded with that of 
      Buddhaghosa, according to whom it has to be translated by &quot;I ordain the 
      words of the Buddha to be learnt in his own language (i.e., in Magadhi, 
      the language used by Buddha himself)&quot;. In fact, the explanation given by 
      Buddhaghosa is more acceptable, because neither the two monks nor Buddha 
      himself have thought of preaching in different dialects in different 
      cases.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Magahi or Magadhi <A HREF="#Ref">14</A> is 
      spoken in the districts of Patna, Gaya, Hazaribagh and also in the western 
      part of Palamau, parts of Monghyr and Bhagalpur. On its eastern frontier 
      Magahi meets Bengali. Dr.Grierson called the dialect of this region 
      Eastern Magahi (Magadhi). He (Dr.Grierson) has named western Magadhi 
      speeches as Bihari. In this time he includes three dialects, Magahi 
      (Magadhi), Maithili and Bhojpuri. Dr.Grierson, after a comparative study 
      of the grammars of the three dialects, had decided Maithili, Magahi and 
      Bhojpuri as three forms of a single speech. There are four reasons for 
      terming them as Bihari, viz.,</FONT></P>

        <LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Between Eastern Hindi and Bengali have 
        certain characteristics, which are common to the three dialects.</FONT></LI>

        Gujarati, Punjabi, Marathi, etc.</FONT></LI>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The name is appropriate from the 
        historical point of view. Bihar was so named after so many Buddhist 
        Viharas in the state. Ancient Bihar language was probably the language 
        of early Buddhists and Jainas.</FONT></LI>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is not a fact that in Bihar there is 
        no literature. In Maithili we have extant ancient literature.</FONT></LI>
      </OL>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Though Hindi is highly respected as a 
      literary language in Biharyetthe Maithili, Magahi and Bhojpuri languages 
      are deeply entrenched in the emotions of the people. The fact is that 
      Bihari is a speech distinct from Eastern Hindi and has to be classified 
      with Bengali, Oriya and Assamese as they share common descent from 
      Magadhi, Prakrit and Apabhransha. It is clear <A HREF="#Ref">15</A> that 
      an uneducated and illiterate Bihari when he goes to Bengal begins to speak 
      good Bengali with little effort but ordinarily it is not easy for an 
      educated Bihari to speak correct Hindi. Dr.Grierson has inclined to decide 
      that Magadhi was a dialect of Magadha (Bihar) and some parts of West 
      Bengal and Uttar Pradesh.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The area covered by the Buddha&#39;s 
      missionary activities included Bihar and Uttar Pradesh including the Nepal 
      Tarai. So it may be assumed that the Buddha spoke in a dialect or dialects 
      current in those regions. Welhelm Geiger <A HREF="#Ref">16</A> considers 
      that Pali was indeed on pure Magadhi, but was yet a form of the popular 
      speech which was based on Magadhi and which was used by Buddha himself. It 
      may be imagined that the Buddha might choose a widespread language which 
      was used or understood by common people in the region, because through 
      which he could propagate his noble teachings to the common people. Thus, 
      Pali or the dialect of Magadha was more probably the language of the 
      common people and also a lingua franca of a large region including mainly 
      Magadha (Bihar).</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Pali is the name given to the language of 
      the texts of Theravada Buddhism, although the commentarial tradition of 
      the Theravadins states that the language of the canon is Magadhi, the 
      language spoken by Gotama Buddha. The term Pali originally referred to a 
      canonical text or passage rather than to a language and its current use is 
      based on a misunderstanding which occurred several centuries ago. The 
      language of the Theravadin canon is a version of a dialect of Middle 
      Indo-Aryan, not Magadhi, created by the homogenisation of the dialects in 
      which the teachings of the Buddha were orally recorded and transmitted. 
      This became necessary as Buddhism was transmitted far beyond the area of 
      its origin and as the Buddhist monastic order codified his teachings.</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The tradition recorded in the ancient 
      Sinhalese chronicles states that the Theravadin canon was written down in 
      the first century B.C.E. The language of the canon continued to be 
      influenced by commentators and grammarians and by the native languages of 
      the countries in which Theravada Buddhism became established over many 
      centuries. The oral transmission of the Pali canon continued for several 
      centuries after the death of the Buddha, even after the texts were first 
      preserved in writing. No single script was ever developed for the language 
      of the canon; scribes used the scripts of their native languages to 
      transcribe the texts. Although monasteries in South India are known to 
      have been important centres of Buddhist learning in the early part of this 
      millennium, no manuscripts from anywhere in India except Nepal have 
      survived. Almost all the manuscripts available to scholars since the PTS 
      (Pali Text Society) began can be dated to the 18th or 19th centuries C.E. 
      and the textual traditions of the different Buddhist countries represented 
      by these manuscripts show much evidence of interweaving. The pattern of 
      recitation and validation of texts by councils of monks has continued into 
      the 20th century.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The main division of the Pali canon as it 
      exists today is threefold, although the Pali commentarial tradition refers 
      to several different ways of classification. The three divisions are known 
      as pi.takas and the canon itself as the Tipitaka; the significance of the 
      term pitaka, literally &quot;basket&quot;, is not clear. The text of the canon is 
      divided, according to this system, into Vinaya (monastic rules), Suttas 
      (discourses) and Abhidhamma (analysis of the teaching). The PTS edition of 
      the Tipitaka contains fifty-six books (including indexes), and it cannot 
      therefore be considered to be a homogenous entity, comparable to the 
      Christian Bible or Muslim Koran. Although Buddhists refer to the Tipitaka 
      as Buddha-vacana, &quot;the word of the Buddha&quot;, there are texts within the 
      canon either attributed to specific monks or related to an event 
      post-dating the time of the Buddha or that can be shown to have been 
      composed after that time. The first four nikayas (collections) of the 
      Sutta-pitaka contain sermons in which the basic doctrines of the Buddha&#39;s 
      teaching are expounded either briefly or in detail.</FONT> </P>

      </B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is the last chapter on the 
      pre-Mahayana in this book. It covers a period from around the 6th century 
      BCE to the 2nd century CE. Within the scope of this chapter I will attempt 
      to simply sketch out various key aspects of Buddhist language and 
      literature over a period of eight centuries. This will be rather more an 
      investigation of the issues raised by the these topics than a detailed 
      study.</FONT></P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Language</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Three key terms which we need to consider 
      are Sanskrit, Pali and Prakrit. We will also need to consider the terms 
      Magadhi and Ardha-Magadhi. What does Sanskrit mean? It has a root meaning 
      which does not actually refer to a language as such but to the concept of 
      something being refined or purified. The term Sanskrit can be found in 
      Buddhist texts used in the sense of meaning that which is refined as 
      opposed to that which is natural which is called Prakrit. Likewise in <I>
      Samkhya</I> the principle of <I>Prakriti</I> is nature, hence Prakrit is 
      that which is natural. So in a sense then Sanskrit does not refer to a 
      language as such but to that which is refined or purified speech.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The languages in which the Vedas are 
      written are not quite the same as classical Sanskrit which was 
      standardised by Panini in about the 2nd century BCE. Despite the 
      variations in the linguistic forms from the Rig Veda, which is 
      considerably different from classical Sanskrit, the languages of the 
      majority of Indian high cultural texts are all in forms of Sanskrit. Some 
      of the later texts, such as the <I>Purana</I>s and the Epics are often not 
      in very refined Sanskrit, but they are still in Sanskrit. Also from around 
      the second century BCE onwards Buddhist texts began to be produced in 
      Sanskrit. These texts are often in a kind of Sanskrit mixed with 
      vernacular forms and which is often referred to as ‘Buddhist Hybrid 
      Sanskrit’. They are hybrid as they are a mix of Sanskrit and Prakrit. So 
      you should bear in mind that the term Sanskrit does not simply refer to 
      the classical standard form of the language but rather to a group of 
      related language forms which share a common heritage in grammar, 
      vocabulary and syntax.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In a similar manner the term Prakrit, 
      which means ‘natural [speech]’ refers to a group of language forms. Indeed 
      Prakrits appear in Sanskrit texts. For instance, classical Sanskrit 
      dramas, such as Kalidasa’s ‘Little clay cart’ include speeches by 
      different characters in various forms of Prakrit. For instance, whereas 
      the cook speaks in a ‘cook’s Prakrit’ and monkeys speak in a Prakrit 
      appropriate for monkeys, the king the leading characters and the narrator 
      speak in Sanskrit. This is similar to the modern linguistic situation in 
      India where within a single environment or location a variety of language 
      forms are spoken by different people. For instance in a monastery in Bodh 
      Gaya, the cooks and workers will speak in varieties of local dialect, but 
      the monks will speak in standard Hindi as well as their mother tongues, 
      and the leading figures will also be able to converse in English. In other 
      words the use of multiple languages according to social register is a 
      common feature in South Asia.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There are also three other elements which 
      need to be considered. First, there is the Dravidian element in the 
      language situation in India. This term refers to a completely different 
      language group nowadays spoken in the forms of Tamil, Malayalam, Telegu 
      and Kannada in the Southern states of India. There is also an isolated 
      pocket of the Dravidian languages in the Brahui language of modern 
      Pakistan. This language group is based on a quite distinct vocabulary and 
      grammar. Second, it should be noted, for completeness sake, that there are 
      also a variety of ‘tribal’ languages spoken in India which belong to 
      various other language groups again. These include the languages of the 
      tribal groups in Bihar, such as Santhali and Gond. Third there are also 
      languages from distinct language groups spoken in the Himalayan and 
      Burmese border regions of South Asia.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The situation at the time of the Buddha 
      was probably very similar with a wide variety of languages being spoken in 
      the area in which he lived. The dominant Prakrit language of his period in 
      the area where he was active was called Magadhi, as is the present Hindi 
      dialect of the area. This name is also preserved in the name given to the 
      Prakrit of many of the Jaina scriptures. These were compiled from oral 
      sources based on traditions active mainly in the Magadh area and the 
      language of these scriptures is called ‘Adha-Magadhi’, that is 
      ‘Half-Magadhi’. It is a form of cleaned up Magadhi, half way between 
      everyday speech and a ‘pure’ language.</FONT></P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Language and meaning</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The most important reason to consider any 
      of this is that we need to consider how the Buddha would have addressed 
      his audiences. He would have needed to speak in such a manner as would 
      have been comprehensible to his audience. Clearly is a situation of such 
      linguistic diversity he would have had to modulate his forms of speech 
      according to the audience he was addressing. Speaking to a king and to a 
      gang of street children, you need to speak in different ways.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Also we should consider that modern 
      mass-education and media have been rapidly erasing the differences between 
      dialects but that the situation in pre-modern cultures is one in which 
      language forms vary considerably over short distances. There is a Hindi 
      saying that after every three villages the language (that is the dialect) 
      changes. So in that the Buddha was born on the Nepali border then his own 
      language would not have been the same as that of Rajgir in Magadh or 
      Sarnath in Uttar Pradesh. There are elements in the texts of the Pali 
      canon which can be regarded as indicative of slight differences in 
      language perhaps reflective of these ancient dialect differences.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Surely when the Buddha was addressing King 
      Bimbasara he would have expressed himself in a different register than 
      when he was addressing an ascetic who was visiting from another part of 
      India, such as Bahiya who had come from Maharashtra to visit the Buddha. I 
      would speculate that a skilled orator would express even the same notion 
      to both audiences in different ways in order to get the teaching across as 
      well as possible. If then you had been listening to both speeches you 
      would have heard two versions of the same teaching. Were you then to be 
      asked ‘which was the genuine teaching of the two’ you would have had to 
      say that both were genuine, although they were different in exact wording 
      as they carried the same teaching.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The question of how to teach and the 
      languages in which to teach is indeed addressed in the Pali canon. It is 
      said that the Buddha was asked when teaching in different areas should the 
      teachings be in a single language or adapted to the local language. The 
      Buddha said that the teachings should be made in the language of the area. 
      So disciples of the Buddha would have been teaching in a variety of 
      languages according to the contexts in which they found themselves, so 
      that people could understand them.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Buddha is also said to have favoured 
      natural language, Prakrit, over refined speech, Sanskrit, as the latter 
      would not have been comprehensible to the general public. So what then is 
      the relationship between Prakrit and Pali?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In a sense the term Pali, like Sanskrit, 
      does not refer to a language at all. Richard Gombrich pointed out that it 
      actually means ‘sacred scripture’ and is a descriptive term for the 
      Theravada scriptures and the language they are in. It is a standardised 
      and consistent language based on earlier dialects. It is not exactly what 
      the Buddha said, it is a standardised form of what the Buddha said. It is 
      close to the Prakrit Magadhi languages that the Buddha probably spoke in, 
      but it is not identical to them.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Pali canon features long set phrases 
      which are repeated countless times in identical terms. Such as the 
      formulation of the Noble Truths and set descriptions like ‘he saluted the 
      Buddha and sat down at one side of him’. These set doctrinal phrases and 
      stock descriptive elements are, however, normally contextualised within 
      passages which are each in a sense unique.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It seems to therefore be appropriate to 
      point out that we have no way of knowing when the tradition of explaining 
      the Pali canon with further commentorial material began. The textual 
      traditions now extant always feature the main texts and subsidiary 
      commentaries. It is known than that this tradition goes back in Sri Lanka 
      to the time of the introduction of Buddhism, when it is said that 
      commentaries explaining the texts were introduced along with the texts 
      themselves. (I am using the term text here to refer to a spoken text, not 
      a written text). This pattern of text and commentary is common in South 
      Asian literature. It is also a feature of non-Buddhist Indian literature 
      and a <I>Sutra</I> (Skt) or<I> Sutta</I> (Pali) means a ‘string’ or 
      ‘thread’ and is the condensed essence of a text onto which a commentary 
      should be stung.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The repetition of set phrases and material 
      to contextualise and explain them is a feature which is typical of texts 
      with commentaries. Part of the motivation for this is clearly that it is 
      no good giving a teaching in a language nobody understands, it has to be 
      accessible. Likewise even if the main teaching is linguistically 
      comprehensible it will probably need an explanation to contextualise and 
      make the meaning clear to the particular audience which is being 
      addressed. Thus the issue of what constitutes ‘the speech of the Buddha’ (<I>Buddhavacana</I>) 
      is further complicated here by the possibility that we may have multiple 
      versions of reported versions of what the Buddha said, all genuine, but 
      all slightly different.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There is also an issue which is raised by 
      a reference in the canon to two Brahmin brothers who had become monks and 
      remembered the teachings and asked for permission to chant them in the 
      manner of a Vedic chant. But the Buddha said that this was not 
      appropriate. Despite this the Buddhist texts are chanted, but the manner 
      and styles of their chanting do not conform to the Vedic patterns for the 
      chanting of texts.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If we entertain the notion that the Pali 
      texts are not the actual speech of the Buddha, but standardised versions 
      of what he said, what then would be the relationship of the Sanskrit 
      versions of the texts to the Pali versions? The Sanskrit versions are also 
      standardised versions and would stand in similar relationship to the 
      original utterances.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If we put aside the Theravada claim that 
      the Pali texts are literal word of the Buddha then we have to consider 
      this possibility. The existence of other Prakrit versions also seems to 
      point to the same truth. None of the extant versions are simply ‘the 
      literal words’ of the Buddha, all textual traditions are, in one way or 
      another, standardised versions of the words of the Buddha. The canon 
      itself contains references to how it is important to understand the 
      intended meaning of the text and not get caught up in the literal meaning.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the present day the various Sanskrit 
      and Prakrit versions of the canon are not all perfectly preserved. There 
      are large sections of the canons of a number of <I>Nikaya</I> Buddhist 
      traditions extant in their original language forms and, fortunately, more 
      extensive translations of these texts into Chinese. Therefore it is 
      possible to compare the Sanskrit, Prakit and Pali versions of some texts.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">An instance of this is the <I>Dhammapada</I>. 
      This is available in Pali, Sanskrit, two Prakrits, Chinese and Tibetan 
      translations. The various traditions do not have exactly the same text. 
      The number of verses vary, the order of the verses vary and the texts of 
      the verses vary and to some extent even the meaning of individual verses 
      vary.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The common endeavour behind all of this 
      was clearly a constant effort by different people in diverse locations to 
      keep the Buddha’s teachings comprehensible. For some people it seemed that 
      Pali was the best, for some Prakrits, for some a widely know standard 
      language, Sanskrit, seemed the most appropriate. For some it was necessary 
      to translate the texts into totally new languages, such as Chinese. In the 
      article by (I have forgotten his name) on the translation of the Lotus 
      Sutra into Chinese there is a fine description of this translation 
      process. It needed one or more Indian Pandits and one or more central 
      Asian and Chinese Pandits who would sit together. The India Pandit reads 
      out the text to the Chinese Pandit who writes it down and then it is 
      compared for meaning by the various people involved. In the particular 
      case that was being studied in this article it is argued that although the 
      text is described as being in Sanskrit, the Indian Pandit was apparently 
      reading it out in Prakrit based on the evidence of the kinds of mistakes 
      that were being made in translation. So this suggests that not only do we 
      need to consider the languages of the written forms of the texts but of 
      the spoken forms of exposition which were employed. We must remember then 
      that the text consists of the text, the expounder and the listener.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Linguistic change and the Growth of 
      Buddhism</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One other point about the linguistic 
      changes in the growth of the canon. It seems to reflect to some extent the 
      geographical spread of Buddhism. By the second century CE Buddhism had 
      spread throughout South Asia and into Central Asia and China. Therefore 
      the issue of how to give the teachings must have been of prime concern in 
      the Buddhist world. The common consensus was clearly that the texts needed 
      to be translated into languages appropriate for the peoples of the areas 
      in which Buddhism was active. But at the same time there is of course the 
      overarching need to maintain the meaning of the teachings while the form 
      of expression varies. Within the North Indian linguistic area is was 
      possible to maintain key terms in forms which were commonly employed, <I>
      sukha, dukkha, dharma, karma, nirvana, samsara</I>, etc.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But, once the texts started being 
      translated into Chinese a new set of problems was apparent. Just as terms 
      such as <I>dharma, nirvana, samsara </I>present problems for translation 
      into English, so to is there a problem when translating such terms into 
      Chinese. There was, for instance, no common view of reincarnation <I>
      samsara </I>as a given truth in Chinese.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Interestingly enough the first school of 
      Chinese translation, the old school, translated by finding the most 
      similar Chinese terms available for Indic terms, normally finding terms 
      from Taoism that were equivalent. Thus the Buddha became a teacher of the 
      Tao rather than the <I>dharma</I>. This translation approach was standard 
      from the beginnings in the 1st/2nd century CE up to around the 5th 
      century. At this point the translators revised their views and 
      retranslated the texts again using Chinese equivalent versions of the 
      Indic terms rather than Taoist equivalents.</FONT></P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Buddhist literature</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">So was the canon of the Nikaya Buddhist 
      traditions exactly the same for all the traditions? I have indicated above 
      that in the case of the <I>Dhammapada</I> there were variations between 
      the different traditions. Variations in the number of verses and verses 
      that are common to all traditions and unique to individual traditions. You 
      cannot simply say that one version is the original version, yet it is 
      desirable to consider how the versions related to each other. It is likely 
      that non of the extant versions are the original version as oral 
      traditions are often more fluid than textual traditions. So rather than 
      saying that any one textual version it might be better to propose that all 
      the versions are but windows onto an earlier oral tradition. There are in 
      the case of other texts instances where the Pali versions of texts seem 
      more developed than other versions. For instance the Pali <I>
      Mahaparinibbana sutta</I> seems more complex than the version translated 
      into Chinese from the Sanskrit Sarvastivada tradition. The latter having a 
      more simple description of the funeral rites and the former a more 
      elaborate version.</FONT></P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Nikaya literature: <I>vinaya</I>, <I>sutta</I>, 
      and <I>abhidharma pitaka</I>s</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There are basically three parts of the <I>
      Nikaya</I> Buddhist canon. The <I>Sutta pitaka</I>, the <I>Vinaya pitaka</I> 
      and the<I> Abhidhamma pitaka</I>. The <I>Sutta pitaka </I>is fairly 
      consistent in some parts over the various versions, in particular the <I>
      Digha</I> and <I>Majjima, Anguttara </I>and <I>Samyakta Nikaya</I>s are 
      fairly consistent in their contents, if not in the exact forms of the 
      texts.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">However the next <I>Nikaya</I>, <I>
      Khuddaka Nikaya</I> which in the Pali version contains 14 texts has a much 
      greater variation in its contents. It includes the <I>Khuddaka Pattha</I>, 
      a sort of early version of a collection of the chants for daily recitation 
      and the <I>Dhammapada</I>, which I have already noted has considerable 
      variations between the various versions. The next text is the <I>Udana</I>, 
      which at least in the Sarva stiva da version is similar to the name given 
      to the <I>Dhammapada </I>which is called the <I>Udanavarga</I>. There is 
      also the <I>Itivuttika</I> further sayings of the Buddha and the <I>jataka</I>s. 
      The number of the <I>jataka</I>s also varies from tradition to tradition. 
      There are also instances of completely different works being included in 
      this part of the canon by different traditions.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Sarvastivada tradition included a text 
      called the <I>Mahavastu</I> in the canon, a kind of life of the Buddha, 
      but the <I>Theravada</I> tradition does not include this text. While the
      <I>Theravada</I> tradition included the <I>Vimanavattu</I> and the <I>
      Pettavatu </I>in its canon, tales on the good and bad results of giving or 
      not giving to the <I>samgha</I>. These last two texts are regarded as very 
      late by scholars. So to are the following texts called the <I>Buddhavamsa</I>, 
      an account of the previous 24 Buddhas and the <I>Cariya-pitaka</I> which 
      is an account of how the Buddha manifested the ten perfections in his 
      previous lives as a Bodhisattva. The very fact that the title of the last 
      includes the term <I>pitaka </I>in its title, which is a term that means 
      basket or winnowing fan suggest that it must have come from a time when 
      the canon could be put into baskets, clearly only possible once it had 
      been written down.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Pali canon was first written down in 
      the first century BCE in Sri Lanka according to Sri Lankan sources. The 
      traditional explanation of this is that it was due to fear of parts of the 
      canon getting lost that led to it being written down. It is said that 
      during a famine there was only a only a single monk left alive who knew 
      one section of it and this was the cause of it being set down in writing. 
      You may think it was odd that it was not previously written down, but 
      there seems to have been a reluctance to write things down in ancient 
      India.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">To return to the contents of the canon the 
      next part is the <I>Vinaya pitaka</I> which includes details on how the 
      monks and nuns should live and stories to explain the rules of the 
      monastic code. Even in the fifth century CE when Chinese pilgrims were 
      visiting India and trying to get copies of the <I>Vinaya</I> they found it 
      quite difficult as in many places it existed only in the form of oral 
      tradition. The reluctance to commit to writing parts of the canon seems to 
      have been a long standing aspect of the tradition in India. People simply 
      preferred to remember the whole thing. It was indeed one specialisation 
      that monks could have was to memorise entire parts of the canon, and 
      memorisation of the <I>Vinaya pitaka </I>was apparently a common 
      phenomena.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The last part of the canon is the<I> 
      Abhidhamma pitaka</I>, a philosophical study of the Buddha’s teachings. 
      This contains seven works in the Theravada version. In the Sarva stiva da 
      version the number and nature of the works was somewhat different. Certain 
      parts show evidences of having been based on similar earlier traditions, 
      others are clearly distinctive contributions of the various schools. It is 
      not clear if all schools had their own <I>Abhidhamma pitaka </I>traditions 
      or they were shared in common by various traditions. The main <I>
      Abhidhamma pitaka </I>traditions seem to have been those of the Theravada 
      and the Sarva stiva da<I> </I>traditions.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The different <I>Abhidhamma pitaka </I>
      traditions are acknowledged to be later parts of the canon which were not 
      in existence at the time of the first council and they post date the <I>
      Sutta </I>and <I>Vinaya pitaka</I>s. There are considerable variations 
      between the different philosophical traditions. The Theravada tradition 
      held that there were only four realities <I>rupa, citta, cetasaka</I> and
      <I>Nibbana</I>, whereas the Sarva stiva da<I> </I>tradition held that 
      there were five realities and included space a <I>ka sa </I>as a fifth 
      reality. Also whilst the Theravada tradition held that only the present 
      moment ‘existed’ when things were perceived, the Sarva stiva da<I> </I>
      tradition held that things ‘existed’ in the past, present and future. This 
      last view accounts for the name of the tradition which means ‘all exists’. 
      Due to this it is natural that the philosophical texts vary in their 
      contents. Despite sharing a common interest in philosophical analysis. 
      Indeed the differences between the traditions form the basis for a 
      Theravada tradition text, the <I>Katthavattu</I> or ‘Points of 
      controversy’ which outlines the differences between the traditions as seen 
      from a Theravada viewpoint.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A point of note in this is that in the <I>
      Katthavattu</I> the philosophical position on the possibility of 
      transferring merit to deceased relatives of the Theravada tradition is put 
      as that it is impossible in distinction from that of the other schools 
      which say that it is possible. But, this viewpoint also conflicts with the 
      views expressed in the <I>Khuddaka Nikaya</I> of the Theravada<I> </I>
      canon itself, in which the transfer of merit is clearly regarded as 
      possible. A further twist to this issue is that in the later text called
      <I>Milanda Panha</I> a compromise is suggested that merit can be 
      transferred to some classes of<I> preta</I>, and this is the current view 
      of most Theravada tradition followers.</FONT></P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Nikaya and Mahayana literature</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There is a further question which is worth 
      addressing here is. ‘What parts of the <I>Nikaya</I> Buddhist canon are 
      also accepted by Mahayana Buddhist traditions?’ Interestingly enough 
      though the question becomes not really what are accepted texts, so much as 
      what are texts that interest different traditions. The <I>Sutta</I> texts 
      for instance are accepted as genuine by the Mahayana tradition, but they 
      are of little interest to the Mahayana it seems. However, almost all the 
      traditions agree on the importance of the <I>Dhammapada</I> as the essence 
      of the Buddha’s teachings.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The <I>Vinaya pitaka</I> is also a 
      commonly held part of the early canon. Although that majority of East 
      Asian and Himalayan traditions follow the Sarva stiva da <I>Vinaya</I> 
      rather than the <I>Theravada Vinaya</I>, however there are in theory no 
      major differences. This is of course quite separate from the question of 
      how the <I>Vinaya</I> is interpreted which evidently varies widely between 
      the Northern and Southern traditions.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The <I>Abhidhamma </I>contains almost no 
      texts which are common between <I>Nikaya</I> Buddhists, let alone between 
      the <I>Nikaya</I> Buddhists and the Mahayana Buddhists. However, there is 
      a similar fascination with philosophy in all the traditions.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is also vital to realise that there is 
      much in Theravada tradition which is unique to it and not held in common 
      with other <I>Nikaya</I> Buddhist traditions. The great synthesis of 
      teachings in the <I>Visuddhimagga</I>, ‘The Path of Purification’ by 
      Buddhaghosa which was composed in the 5th century CE is distinctly 
      Theravada<I> </I>in its viewpoint. It was based on a translation into Pali 
      of the existing Singhalese commentaries on the canon and records 
      traditions which may well go back in origin to India but had undergone 
      centuries of evolution in Sri Lanka. Buddhaghosa himself was from North 
      India, from near Bodh Gaya and went to Sri Lanka to translate their 
      vernacular commentaries into Pali.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The famous Sri Lankan chronicles, such as 
      the <I>Mahavamsa</I> are also distinctly Sri Lankan Theravada creations 
      that link the history of Buddhism to that of the ruling dynasties of Sri 
      Lanka.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There was also a continuous tradition of 
      creating new Pali texts in South East Asia, in Burma, Thailand, Cambodia 
      and Laos. It is interesting to note that in this case the argument for 
      Pali as the sacred language has completely altered. The early argument for 
      Pali it seems was, as suggested above, that it was comprehensible to the 
      people as it was close to everyday speech. Evidently in Sri Lanka and 
      South East Asia this was not the case. Rather it was seen as being the 
      authentic language of the Buddha. In a sense then it has become a kind of 
      purified language whose function is akin to that of Sanskrit in India, a 
      kind of sacred <I>lingua franca</I> comprehensible over a wide area and 
      felt to be the essence of refinement and imbued with great power and 
      sophistication.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Earliest Buddhist Manuscripts</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Finally, as an epilogue let us consider 
      the case of the earliest Buddhist manuscripts yet discovered. A few years 
      ago the British Library in London was approached to find out if it was 
      interested in acquiring what appeared to be some old manuscripts which had 
      emerged from war torn Afghanistan. These were a collection of rolled up 
      birch bark manuscripts. These are very difficult materials to deal with as 
      they normally crumble into dust as you touch them. In this case they were 
      stored in urns and they were purchased in the urns. The library spent a 
      year and a half gradually humidifying and unrolling the manuscripts a 
      millimetre at a time and ended up with fragile sheets of birch bark 
      sandwiched between perspex sheets. It should be born in mind that birch 
      bark is a bit like vellum, as long as its kept in normal conditions it is 
      pliable and an excellent writing surface, it only become so crumbly if 
      left to dry out in an arid environment for two thousand years. These were 
      then photographed and digitised. They are a very exciting discovery as it 
      has become apparent that they date from around the first century CE. They 
      are written in a dialect of Prakrit in a script called <I>Kharoshti</I>, 
      and the number of scholars it is said who can read this script are said to 
      be merely a handful. The <I>Kharoshti</I> script was popular in the North 
      Western part of India and dropped out of use by the time of the Islamic 
      invasions of India. The group of scholars who are working on these 
      manuscripts are still working on deciphering them.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The initial reports indicate that they are 
      all fragments of works. This turns out to be because they are fragments of 
      old manuscripts which had been re-copied and the old manuscripts were 
      interred in an urn and buried as if they the body of the Buddha. This in 
      itself is fascinating as it shows that the Buddhists buried their old 
      manuscripts, Hindu’s also treat their manuscripts like their dead and 
      prefer to ideally place them into rivers as they do the ashes of bodies.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The contents of the manuscripts include 
      sections from <I>Dhammapada</I>, the rhinoceros verses, and verses in 
      praise of the lake now known as Manasarover by Mount Kailash, known in 
      Buddhist literature as lake Anavatapta. There also indications that they 
      productions of the Dhammaguptika tradition. They contain no parts of the
      <I>Vinaya </I>or <I>Abhidhamma pitaka</I>s and appear to be all drawn from 
      the<I> Sutta pitaka</I>. However, we are still waiting for further 
      detailed reports on their contents.</FONT></P>
      <B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Conclusion</FONT></P>
      </B>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In conclusion then it is clear that the 
      breadth and depth of Buddhist literature is hard to comprehend. Even were 
      you to become a master of the Theravada <I>Tipitaka</I> you would still 
      not have read the greater part of the literature of the other <I>Nikaya</I> 
      Buddhist traditions. Also to be able to do a good comparative study of 
      this literature in real depth you would need to know not just Pali, 
      Prakrit and Sanskrit, but also to access the translations of the parts of 
      the <I>Nikaya</I> Buddhist canons lost in Indic languages you need to 
      learn Chinese to read these portions in translation. This is as they say

      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A question often asked is: <I>&quot;Did the 
      Buddha speak Pali?&quot;</I> If so, how much of the original language has been 
      retained? If not, how much has translation affected the accurate 
      transmission of the teachings? There seems to be no one answer to these 
      questions but I offer the following as the results of my investigation.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The paramount power in India for two 
      centuries, spanning both before and after the Buddha, was the Kingdom of 
      Kosala, of which the Buddha&#39;s birth kingdom, Magadha, was a fiefdom. 
      Magadhi seems to be a dialect of Kosalan, and there is some evidence that 
      this was the language that the Buddha spoke. The Pali of the Canon seems 
      to be based on the standard Kosalan as spoken in the 6th and 7th centuries 
      BC. The script used on the rock edicts of Asoka is a younger form of this 
      standard. On one of the Asoka pillars (about 300 BC) there is a list of 
      named Suttas which can be linguistically placed within the Singhalese 
      Canon.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Sanskrit was also widely spoken and 
      warrants discussion. It seems to have been the language of the Brahmin&#39;s, 
      the &#39;spiritual&#39; class. It is etymologically older than Pali but, as 
      regards texts and inscriptions, the native tongue (Kosalan) was the more 
      common or popular medium. In the Text we see the Buddha encouraging his 
      disciples to teach in the popular language of any area. However after the 
      Buddha&#39;s death, what were considered more &#39;learned&#39; forms were gradually 
      made use of, despite the fact that these gave a less faithful picture of 
      the living speech. Slowly the efforts to represent the real facts of the 
      spoken language gave way to another effort, the expression of learned 
      phraseology, until roughly 300 AD, classical Sanskrit became used 
      exclusively in relation to Buddhism. This trend is reflected in the 
      scripture of later Buddhist traditions.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The use of Pali is practically confined to 
      Buddhist subjects, and then only in the Theravada school. It&#39;s exact 
      origin is the subject of much learned debate and from the point of view of 
      the non-specialist, we can think of it as a kind of simplified, common 
      man&#39;s Sanskrit. The source of the Pali Text we have lies in the North of 
      India. It is definitely not Singhalese in origin as it contains no mention 
      of any place in Sri Lanka, or even South India. The similes abounding in 
      the Singhalese literature are those of a sub-tropical climate and of a 
      great river valley rather than those of a tropical island.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Being an essentially oral language, 
      lacking a strong literary base of its own, it adopted the written script 
      of each country it settled in. It is clear that by the time the Text 
      arrived in Sri Lanka, with Asoka&#39;s son Mahinda, about 240 BC, it was 
      considered closed.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Conclusion: </FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Any historical study is much like a jigsaw 
      puzzle. Piecing together information from a scrap of parchment here, a 
      clay tablet there; comparing various bits of antiquity, the opinions and 
      insights of others; analysing and evaluating - and then - coming to a 
      conclusion. The more Buddhist history books I studied, to try and 
      determine precise information, the more opinions I ended up collecting. 
      History, it seems, can be very much a matter of opinion.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Very few undisputed facts exist by which 
      to prove the authenticity of the Pali Canon. Even the dates of the Buddha 
      are questionable. The earliest reliable dates in Indian history that we 
      have are those for Emperor Asoka&#39;s rule; 274 - 236 BC. We can also be 
      relatively certain that the Text remained unchanged from the time it was 
      written down, about 80 BC.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As regards the reliability of the Text I 
      felt two items to be of greatest importance.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">* Firstly: The reason that anything 
      survives the rigours of more than 2000 years of history is that it is 
      considered to be of great value. Presumably the reason for this evaluation 
      was that the teaching was seen to work, i.e. to lead to the transcendence 
      of suffering. Such a known treasure would have been well guarded and part 
      of this protection would have been a tremendous concern for retaining the 
      &#39;jewel&#39; in its entirety, i.e. accurately.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">* Secondly: After several centuries of 
      travelling to many different lands and being translated into different 
      languages, the disparity between the various renderings of the main Text 
      existing today in Pali, Sanskrit, Chinese and Tibetan is typically 
      greatest in matters of least importance. Only very rarely are differences 
      founded on doctrinal matters. It can be seen that these works are clearly 
      not independent compositions, being very similar in their substantive 
      content. This &quot;authenticity by comparison&quot; is an important item in support 
      of scriptural accuracy. More specifically, the Vinaya is almost without 
      exception, identical in every Buddhist tradition.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">On a more general note:</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I feel that the majority of us who have 
      come to give the Text some consideration, originally set out in search of 
      a guide by which to find a way to resolve the root-problem of our personal 
      existence. The process of production warrants investigation but surely the 
      true test of any guide book is its ability to lead one to the desired 
      destination. The whole energy behind the Buddha&#39;s teaching was the ending 
      of suffering. If what you glean from the Text eases or ends your suffering 
      then the teaching has been accurately transmitted. What is of greatest 
      importance is to take the teachings that seem relevant, that feel 
      applicable to your life, and to make them a personal reality, to turn the 
      theory into practice.</FONT></P>
