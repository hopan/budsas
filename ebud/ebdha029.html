<i>Ajahn Munindo, who is currently the senior incumbent at Ratanagiri (Harnham) Monastery in Northumberland, U.K., presents these reflections in response to a question posed during a 10 day retreat held there during vassa 1995.</i>
<P>
<b>Question:</b> 
<BR>Harsh and cruel words can come out so quickly when one is in a heated
discussion or argument, to one's immediate regret. How can one try to
avoid this?
<P>
<b>Answer:</b>
<BR>Well the experience of regret is actually the message; it's the
lesson, the dukkha that happens when we make a mistake. It's really
important that we understand that, because otherwise it's like fighting
ourselves. It's as though healing is taking place, but we are resisting
it.
<P>
When there's some heat in a discussion, something is going on that we
are not so happy about, we can end up saying something hurtful to
somebody. Then afterwards, when we remember what happened, we feel
regret. Now that regret is right, it is appropriate - not just the
mental dimension of regret, the thought: 'I wish I hadn't said that' -
but the actual feeling of embarrassment, the heat as we go red in the
face and the feeling in the stomach or the throat. That's the
consequence of having generated hurtful action. It's also the doorway
beyond.
<P>
Now we need to have the appropriate attitude to regret, otherwise we'll
never learn. The Buddha said regularly that it's only through seeing the
consequence of our harmful actions that we can be released from them.
That is why the whole teaching, the basic Buddhist teaching, is
established on mindfulness of dukkha. It is only through mindfulness of
dukkha that we can see the end of dukkha. By feeling the consequence of
our inappropriate speech - in other words, by suffering consciously -
the whole body mind gets the message. We realise: 'I don't want to do
this, I don't want to be this way.'
<P>
This is a very simple but very important message, because often we
intellectualise around the consequences of our heedlessness. We say
something unkind, and we feel the pain of regret and embarrassment. Then
maybe we start to feel guilty, sticking darts into ourselves for having
been so foolish, really getting off on feeling guilty. We go up into our
heads and we stop feeling, no longer experiencing the reaction; instead,
we theorise about it and say something like: 'Well my parents always did
this to me. What else do you expect?... Of course it's unfortunate and
I'm sorry I said it, but it's perfectly understandable.'
<P>
But when we go on like that we're not in touch with the reaction any
more; we're not being mindful in that moment. This is the displacement
activity of the age. Instead of being sensitive to the actual feeling,
we think about the cause of our problems. We miss the opportunity to put
ourselves into the optimum position for reading feeling accurately - and
to move through, and beyond it. 
<P>
For example, we might do an astrological interpretation: 'I've got Mars
in Leo, she's got Mars in Pisces. What else do you expect? Of course we
speak to each other like that, that's how we are.' Now while that might
alleviate some of the regret for a while, actually it's just
displacement, it's not really dealing with it; it won't really help us
in taking responsibility for our heedlessness. So if we habitually allow
the passions to come out through our mouth as cruel and harsh words when
'I' am not getting my way, we really need to take an interest in how to
adjust that. The painful kamma made in causing hurt to other beings
through our unkind speech is enormous. If we think unkind thoughts then,
mostly, we are the only ones that suffer; but we can just slice people
to pieces with words. So if we have such a disposition, such a habit, we
should be interested in how to alter it.
<P>
From the Buddhist perspective, the way we show interest in it is by
feeling the regret - really letting it sink into our bones. This may
sound as though we are being caught up with guilt again, but we really
need to see and understand the neurotic tendency that we have of making
ourselves and one another feel guilty - otherwise we'll never get past a
certain point in practice. When guilt gets a hold on us, then as soon as
we start to feel suffering we grasp it, we indulge in it: 'Well I should
suffer, I should be miserable. Look how hopeless I am... those awful
things I've said - it's just despicable! I should know better after all
these years...' And of course, I should know better so, in a sense, I
can justify my argument. But really what I'm doing is feeling very
righteous, hating myself for having made a mistake; and there's
absolutely no justification for that. Instead, what we need to do is
learn the lesson that by getting caught up and following these wild
passions - shooting that energy out through our mouths - we cause
suffering for ourselves and others. We don't have to look very far to
see the horror of what's going on in the world, the suffering that gets
caused in this way.
<P>
But then we can also consider the consequences of exercising restraint -
how we feel about ourselves then. We can notice how it feels if we're
about to really let somebody have it but, rather than following that, we
just do whatever we need to do to stop it: clenching our fists, going
outside - doing anything to stop it, even if it is just blind repression
(well it won't be blind, because we know what we are doing). The Buddha
said that sometimes you've got to push the tongue up against the roof of
your mouth, and just grit your teeth... sometimes passion is that
strong. But you just do anything to stop it from coming out and hurting
somebody.
<P>
So if we do that, and then stop and think about it - in a cool moment,
not when the passion is still going - how do we feel about ourselves? If
the passion is still going, we'll probably say: 'Well, yeah, I should
have really told them!' - we might imagine that we'd feel good if we
really tell somebody. But when we're cool and clear and we reflect on
it, how does it feel not to have actually blasted them and hurt them
with our speech?... We feel good. There is a natural sense of self
respect that comes from such containment. The body mind gets the message
that actually it is appropriate to contain the passions. If we can learn
this little by little, then we'll no longer be seduced into thinking
that we'll feel good if we follow these upthrusts of wild energy. It's
only when we don't really inspect these things that we have the delusion
that we are going to feel better by following them. Of course the same
thing applies to heedlessly following any desire.
<P>
Guilt is one of the things that can get in the way of working like this;
another is a lack of a sense of well-being. Even though we've got the
theory down - to be mindful of dukkha and all that - if we don't have a
good strong sense of well-being within ourselves then it's not going to
work. While we may not feel guilt we can just get crushed and depressed,
thinking about how many times we've failed: 'I just keep doing this
thing over and over again. Every time she says that, I say this. When is
it ever going to change?'... and we can get really depressed. If that is
the case then we have to use discernment and actually observe what's
going on, for without a really wholesome well established sense of
well-being within ourselves, we can end up destroying the spirit by
dwelling too much on our mistakes. So it can sometimes be skilful to
distract ourselves, if we've made a mistake or said something really
terrible and we find ourselves caught up with regret, but without a
sense of well-being.
<P>
Basically, remorse is the message, and when we get that message then
we'll stop indulging in heedlessness. However in order to get that
message, we've got to be strong with a sense of well-being; it's better
not to hammer away too much, thinking: 'Well I've got to be mindful of
dukkha and all my mistakes,' all the time. Really, we also have to be
mindful of a sense of well-being, and what maintains that sense of
well-being.
<P>
We need to develop positive, wholesome kamma, rather than always making
negative kamma through generating thoughts and speech of ill will. We
can generate kind, compassionate thoughts when we do the chanting: 'May
I abide in well being, in freedom from affliction, in freedom from
hostility. May I maintain well being in myself.' And then: 'May all
beings be well. May they be free from suffering, may they not be parted
from the good fortune that they have attained.'
<P>
If you know somebody else who sincerely says nice things, who really
feels these things and expresses them, you like to have them around.
It's exactly the same thing with ourselves.We actually feel good about
ourselves when we have the perception of ourselves as somebody who says
those sorts of things. While meditation on these divine abidings
(kindliness, compassion, joy and equanimity) is helpful, sometimes we
are so out of practice with exercising our hearts in this way that just
to think of them is not enough; sometimes we also need to say it. We can
actually go through this recitation on our own, or write it down, or
better still tell others. We can also make gestures of good will in
daily life; we can engage in a conversation with somebody who we would
not normally bother engaging with, we can offer well-being, we can make
gifts for people. This is the principle of dana, generosity. When we
have this operating within us, it conditions, strengthens and nourishes
a sense of well-being. We know that we are a source of well-being, of
good will because we're giving it out.
<P>
When we are strong in this sense of well-being, it means that we'll be
able to learn the lessons we need to learn. Say we've opened our mouth
and shot some toxic waste out into the world, polluting the psychosphere
for goodness knows how many miles around us, and we should have known
better, but we've done it; and now we've got the appropriate dose of
regret and remorse. If we've got these supportive conditions, this sense
of well-being - we'll be able to take it, we can get the message. But if
we don't have that sense of well-being, then we need to be cautious
about how much remorse and regret we open up to.
<P>
As we progress in our meditation practice, our whole appreciation of the
world starts to change. We start to see through some of the apparent
realities of life - the apparent solidity of 'me', and the apparent
solidity and validity of the perception of 'you' and 'the world'. When
this starts to get shaken up, there's a reappraisal of how we relate to
each other and to ourselves. With insight meditation we start to
actually see the perception of somebody as just that.
<P>
For example, I have this perception of Andy. Now my perception of Andy
is entirely my business, entirely my responsibility; it is actually very
very little to do with that person. I could reach out and touch Andy,
but what I would touch is a totally different reality from what's going
on in my mind as a perception of Andy. When we start to see this, it's
very interesting, because it becomes clear that what I do with this
perception affects me. So if I have a very kind caring attitude towards
Andy, I benefit actually more then he does; similarly, even if he had
done something really wretched, it would be harmful to me to dwell on
nasty, resentful, miserable thoughts about him. In fact it would be
doing very little to him - compared to what it would be doing to me!
<P>
We begin to appreciate that the whole world is what we perceive in our
own consciousness. When we start to appreciate that, we don't want to go
around hurting people, because it's like sticking darts in ourselves. So
every time I generate ill will towards somebody else, I am actually
generating toxins in my own system; I'm the one that will physically,
emotionally and psychically suffer as a result of that. It may manifest
outwardly into some form of hurt on other people, but primarily what
it's doing is generating the conditions for enormous suffering in
myself.
<P>
When insight arises in meditation and we start to see this, it becomes
clear that any perception of somebody in our mind is entirely our
business. For example, when thinking of my father I can see that as a
perception in my mind, and that's entirely my business; the process
happening on the other side of the planet is a completely different
affair from what's going on in my mind. Now I'm very interested in
having a very healthy, wholesome, pleasant relationship with what is
going on in my mind, regardless. As it happens, I have a good father so
that's no problem; but some people's fathers are not so good, so they
could be spending a lot of time dwelling on unpleasant thoughts about
their fathers. What they are really doing is torturing themselves. It's
very helpful to see this.
<P>
This is not actually something we can imagine but, as practice proceeds,
we will come to appreciate that the perceptions of each other that we
have in our minds are primarily our affair. They're our business, and we
maintain them, we feed them. We also have the power to release out of
them.
<P>
When, in meditation, we start to undo the perceptions of self and other,
our relationship to the passions also changes. It's not that we have to
spend the rest of our life fighting off our unwholesome passions, we
come to see that the passionate flare-ups are simply a reflection of our
false views; they are conditioned by the way we think. If we start to
think more clearly and see more accurately, then there are just not the
causes for these flare-ups of the passions.
