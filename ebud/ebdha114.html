  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
  Try to note the cessation or the ending of things in little ways by paying special
  attention to the ending of the outbreath. This in your daily life, you're noticing the
  ordinary endings that no-one ever pays attention to. I've found this practice very useful
  because it's a way of noticing the changing nature of the conditioned realm as one is
  living one's daily life. As I understand it, it was to these ordinary states of mind that
  the Buddha was pointing, not to the special highly-developed concentrated states.<br>
  <br>
  The first year that I practised, I was on my own and I could get into higlily-developed
  concentrated states of mind which I really enjoyed. Then I went to Wat Pah Pong
  (Thailand), where the emphasis was on the way of life in accordance with Vinaya discipline
  and a routine. There one always had to go out on alms-round every morning, and do the
  morning chanting and evening chanting. If you were young, and healthy, you were expected
  to go on these very long alms-rounds - they had shorter ones that the old feeble monks
  could go on. In the days, I was very vigorous so I was always going on these long, long,
  alms-rounds and then I'd come back tired, then there would be the meal and then in the
  afternoon we all had chores to do. It was not possible under those conditions to stay in a
  concentrated state. Most of the day was taken up by daily life routine.<br>
  <br>
  So I got fed up with all this and went to see Luang Por Chah (Ajahn Chah) and said, 'I
  can't meditate here', and he started laughing at me and telling everyone that, 'Sumedho
  can't meditate here!' I was seeing meditation as this very special experience that I'd had
  and quite enjoyed and then Luang Por Chah was obviously pointing to the ordinariness of
  daily life, the getting up, the alms-rounds, the routine work, the chores: the whole thing
  was for mindfulness. And he didn't seem at all eager to support me in my desires to have
  strong sensory deprivation experience by not having to do all these little daily tasks. He
  didn't seem to go along with that; so I ended up having to conform and learn to meditate
  in the ordinariness of daily life. And in the long run that has been the most helpful.<br>
  <br>
  It has not always been what I wanted because one wants the special; one would love to have
  blazing light and marvellous insights in Technicolor and have incredible bliss and ecstasy
  and rapture - not be just happy and calm - but over the moon!<br>
  <br>
  But reflecting on life in this human form: it is just like this, it's being able to sit
  peacefully and get up peacefully and be content with what you have; it's that which makes
  our life as a daily experience something that is joyful and not suffering. And this is how
  most of our life can be lived - you can't live in ecstatic states of rapture and bliss and
  do the dishes, can you? I used to read about the lives of saints that were so caught up in
  ecstasies they couldn't do anything on any practical level. Even though the blood would
  flow from their palms and they could do feats that the faithful would rush to look at,
  when it came to anything practical or realistic they were quite incapable.<br>
  <br>
  And yet when you contemplate the Vinaya discipline itself, it is a training in being
  mindful. It's about mindfulness with regard to making robes, collecting alms food, eating
  food, taking care of your kuti; what to do in this situation or that situation. It's all
  very practical advice about the daily life of a bhikkhu. An ordinary day in the life of
  Bhikkhu Sumedho isn't about exploding into rapture but getting up and going to the toilet
  and putting on a robe and bathing and doing this or that; it's just about being mindful
  while one is living in this form and learning to awaken to the way things are, to the
  Dhamma.<br>
  <br>
  That's why whenever we contemplate cessation, we're not looking for the end of the
  universe but just the exhalation of the breath or the end of the day or the end of the
  thought or the end of the feeling. To notice that means that we have to pay attention to
  the flow of life - we have to really notice the way it is rather than wait for some kind
  of fantastic experience of marvellous light descending on us, zapping us or whatever.<br>
  <br>
  Now just contemplate the ordinary breathing of your body. You notice if you're inhaling,
  that it's easy to concentrate. When you're filling your lungs, you feel a sense of growth
  and development and strength. When you say somebody's 'puffed up', then they're probably
  inhaling. It's hard to feel puffed up while you're exhaling. Expand your chest and you
  have a sense&nbsp; of being somebody big and powerful. However, when I first started
  paying attention to exhaling, my mind would wander; exhaling didn't seem as important as
  inhaling - you were just doing it so that you could get on to the next inhalation.<br>
  <br>
  Now reflect: one can observe breathing, so what is it that can observe? What is it that
  observes and knows the inhalation and the exhalation - that's not the breathing, is it?
  You can also observe the panic that comes if you want to catch a breath and you can't; but
  the observer, that which knows, is not an emotion, not panic-stricken, is not an
  exhalation or an inhalation. So our refuge in Buddha is being that knowing; being the
  witness rather than the emotion or the breath or the body.<br>
  <br>
  With the sound of silence, some people hear fluctuations of sound or a continuous
  background of sound. So you can contemplate it, you notice that - can you notice it if you
  put your fingers in your ears? Can you hear it in a place where they are using the chain
  saw? or when you're doing exercises or when you're in a fraught emotional state? You're
  using this sound of silence as something to remember to turn to and notice - because it's
  always present here and now. And there's that which notices it.<br>
  <br>
  There is the desire of the mind to call it something, to have a name for it, have it
  listed as some kind of attainment or project something on to it. Notice that, the tendency
  of wanting to make it into something. Somebody said it's probably just the sound of your
  blood circulating in your ears, somebody else called it 'the cosmic sound,' 'the bridge to
  the Divine.' That sounds nicer than 'the blood in your ears'. It might be the sound of the
  Cosmos or it might be that you've got an ear disease. But it doesn't have to be anything;
  it's what it is, it's 'as that.' Whatever it is, it can be used as reflection because when
  you're with that, there is no sense of self, there is mindfulness, there is the ability to
  reflect.<br>
  <br>
  So it is more like a straight edge that you can go to, to keep you from going all wobbly.
  It is something you can use to compose yourself in daily life, when you're putting on your
  robes, when you're brushing your teeth, when you're closing a door, when you're coming
  into the meditation hall, when you're sitting down. So much of daily life is just habitual
  because we aim at what we consider to be the important things of life - like the
  meditation. So, walking from where you live to the Meditation Hall can be a totally
  heedless experience - just a habit - clump, clump, clump, slam bang! Then you sit here for
  an hour trying to be mindful.<br>
  <br>
  This way you begin to see a way of being mindful, of bringing mindfulness to the ordinary
  routines and experiences of life. I have a nice little picture in my room that I'm very
  fond of - of this old man with a coffee mug in his hand, looking out of the window into an
  English garden with the rain coming down. The title of the picture is 'Waiting.' That's
  how I think of myself; an old man with my coffee mug sitting there at the window, waiting,
  waiting... watching the rain or the sun or whatever. I don't find that a depressing image
  but rather a peaceful one. This life is just about waiting, isn't it? We're waiting all
  the time - so we notice that, We're not waiting for anything, but we can be just waiting.
  And then we respond to the things of life, to the time of day, the duties, the things move
  and change, the society we are in. That response isn't from the force of habits of greed,
  hatred and delusion but it's response of wisdom and mindfulness.<br>
  <br>
  Now how many of you feel you have a mission in life to perform? It's something you've got
  to do and some kind of important task that's been assigned to you by God or fate or
  something. People frequently get caught up in that view of being somebody who has a
  mission. Who can be just with the way things are, so that it is just the body that grows
  up, gets old and dies, breathes and is conscious? We can practise, live within the moral
  precepts, do good, respond to the needs and experiences of life with mindfulness and
  wisdom - but there's nobody that has to do anything. There's nobody with a mission, nobody
  special, we're not making a person or a saint or an avatar or a tulku or a messiah or
  Maitreya. Even if you think: 'I'm just a nobody.'even being a nobody is somebody in this
  life, isn't it., You can be just as proud of being nobody as of being somebody and just as
  deluded attached to being nobody. But whatever you happen to believe, that you're a nobody
  or a somebody or you have a mission or you're a nuisance and a burden to the world or
  however you might view yourself, then the knowing is there to see the cessation of such a
  view.<br>
  <br>
  Views arise and cease, don't they? 'I'm somebody, an important person who has a mission in
  life': that arises and ceases in the mind. Notice the ending of being somebody important
  or being nobody or whatever - it all ceases, doesn't it? Everything that arises, ceases so
  there's a non-grasping of the view of being somebody with a mission or of being nobody.
  There's the end of that whole mass of suffering - of having to develop something, become
  somebody, change something, set everything right, get rid of all your defilements or save
  the world. Even the best ideals, the best thoughts can be seen as dhammas that arise and
  cease in the mind.<br>
  <br>
  Now, you might think that this is a barren philosophy of life because there's a lot more
  heart and feeling in being somebody who's going to save all sentient beings. People with
  self-sacrifice who have missions and help others and have something important to do are an
  inspiration. But when you notice that as dhamma, you are looking at the limitations of
  inspirations and the cessation of it. Then there is the dhamma of those aspirations and
  actions rather than somebody who has to become something or has to do something. The whole
  illusion is relinquished and what remains is purity of mind. Then the response to
  experience comes from wisdom and purity rather than from personal conviction and mission
  with its sense of self and other, and all the complications that come from that whole
  pattern of delusion.<br>
  <br>
  Can you trust that? Can you trust in just letting everything go and cease and not being
  anybody and not having any mission, not having to becomes anything? Can you really trust
  in that or do you find it frightening, barren or depressing? Maybe you really want
  inspiration. 'Tell me everything is all right; tell me you really love me; what I'm doing
  is right and Buddhism is not just a selfish religion where you get enlightened for your
  own sake; tell me that Buddhism is here to save all sentient beings. Is that what you're
  going to do, Venerable Sumedho? Are you really Mahayana or Hinayana?'<br>
  <br>
  What I'm pointing to is what inspiration is as an experience. Idealism: not trying to
  dismiss it or to judge it in any way but to reflect on it, to know what that is in the
  mind and how easily we can be deluded by our own ideas and high-minded views. And to see
  how insensitive, cruel and unkind we can be by the attachment we have to views about being
  kind and sensitive. This is where it is a real investigation into Dhamma.<br>
  <br>
  I remember in my own experience, I always had the view that I was somebody special in some
  way; I used to think, 'Well I must be a special person. Way back when I was a child I was
  fascinated by Asia and as soon as I could, I studied Chinese at the university, so surely
  I must have been a reincarnation of somebody who was connected to the Orient.'<br>
  <br>
  But consider this as a reflection: no matter how many signs of being special or previous
  lives you can remember or voices from God or messages from the Cosmos, whatever - not to
  deny that or say that those things aren't real - but they're impermanent. They're <em><strong>anicca,
  dukkha, anatta</strong></em>. We're reflecting on them as they really are - what arises
  ceases: a message from God is something that comes and ceases in your mind, doesn't it?
  God isn't always talking to you continuously unless you want to consider the silence the
  voice of God. Then it doesn't really say anything does it? We can call it anythiny - we
  can call it the voice of God or the divine or the ringing of the cosmos or blood in your
  ear drums. But whatever it is, it can be used for mindfulness and reflection - that's what
  I'm pointing to, how to use these things without making them into something.<br>
  <br>
  Then the missions we have are responses, not to experience, that we have in our lives -
  they're not personal anymore, it's no longer me, Sumedho Bhikkhu, with a mission as if I'm
  specially chosen from above, more so than any of you. It's not that any more. That whole
  manner of thinking and perceiving is relinquished. And whether or not I do save the world
  and thousands of beings or help the poor in the slums of Calcutta or help to cure all
  lepers and do all kinds of good works - it's not from the delusion of being a person, it's
  a natural response from wisdom.<br>
  <br>
  This I trust; this is what <em><strong>saddha</strong></em> it is - is a faith in the
  Buddha's word. Saddha: it's a real trust and confidence in Dhamma; in just waiting and
  being nobody and not becoming anything, but being able to just wait and to respond. And if
  there's nothing much to respond to, it's just waiting - coffee cup, watching the rain, the
  sunset, getting old, witnessing the ageing process, the comings and goings in the
  monastery - the ordinations and the disrobing, the inspirations and the depressions, the
  highs and the lows, inside the mind, outside in the world. And there is the response
  because we have vigour and intelligence and talent, then life to us asking us to respond
  to it in some skilful and compassionate way, which we are very willing and able to do. We
  like to help people. I wouldn't mind going to a Buddhist leper colony - I'd be glad to -
  or working in the shanty towns of Calcutta or wherever, I'd have no objections; those
  kinds of things are rather appealing to my sense of liability!<br>
  <br>
  But it's not a mission, it's not me having to do anything; it's trusting in the Dhamma.
  Then the response to life is clear and of benefit because it's not coming from me as a
  person and the delusions of ignorance conditioning mental formations. And one observes the
  restlessness, the compulsiveness, the obsessiveness of the mind and lets it cease. We let
  it go and it ceases.</font><font size="4"></p>
