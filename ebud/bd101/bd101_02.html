    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>What is Buddha?</strong></font></p>
    <p>The word &quot;Buddha&quot; means &quot;The Awakened (or
    Enlightened) One&quot;. A Buddha was previously a human
    being, who had reached the highest peak of spiritual
    cultivation through purification and mastery of the mind,
    attaining the highest achievement possible by anyone. Having
    awakened to reality, He is one who has found True Happiness
    in realising the true nature of all things. With the
    attainment of Enlightenment (realisation of the Truth of all
    things), Wisdom and Compassion is perfected among other
    countless positive qualities. Having become a Buddha, one
    transcends the limitations of a human (and gender) and
    becomes much greater than a human, gaining ultimate peace and
    liberation. </p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Can I become a
    Buddha?</strong></font></p>
    <p>The potential of attaining Enlightenment or Buddhahood
    exists in each and every sentient being (including us). We
    all possess within ourselves the perfect goodness of
    Buddha-nature (potential for Buddhahood), which is like the
    bright full Moon. The path towards Enlightenment is the
    clearing of the dark clouds of defilements (negative
    qualities- chiefly Ignorance) that overshadow our
    Buddha-nature, to let it shine forth. There are already
    countless Buddhas in existence and there will be countless
    more as long as there are those earnest in seeking the Truth.
    </p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Who is the
    Buddha?</strong></font></p>
    <p>The Buddha is the greatest character that ever appeared in
    the history of Humankind - being an embodiment of the person
    perfect in thought, word and deed. He was the wisest and most
    loving being that ever graced the Earth, an example of how
    great we can all become. &quot;The Buddha&quot; refers to the
    historical Shakyamuni Buddha who lived in northern India more
    than 2,500 years ago (at about 563 B.C.). He is regarded as
    the founder of Buddhism for our world. He was a prince who
    had an entire kingdom of riches to inherit, who chose to
    renounce it at the age of 29 in search of Enlightenment
    (realisation of the Truth of all things and True Happiness)
    out of Compassion for all beings. After He attained
    Enlightenment at 35, He taught the Truth inspiringly and
    tirelessly for 45 years to all who were willing to learn from
    Him. He passed away into the deep peace of Parinirvana at 80.
    </p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>What did the
    Buddha teach?</strong></font></p>
    <p>The Buddha&#146;s message is a joyous one. He found the
    precious treasure of Freedom in the Truth and teaches us how
    to follow the way that leads us to this same treasure. Though
    He tells us that we are in deep darkness, He also teaches us
    the path that leads us to light. He wishes us to rise from a
    life of unreal dreams into a higher life of Wisdom where all
    love and do not hate. His appeal is universal, because He
    appeals to reason, and to the universal search for True
    Happiness in us. He put Truth to the crucial test of personal
    experience, encouraging everyone to doubt His teachings,
    believing that great realisations arise from clearing great
    doubts. He taught us to watch ourselves and become awake, to
    seek and to find True Happiness like He did.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>How can the
    Buddha help me?</strong></font></p>
    <p>The Buddha is a spiritual genius as He reached the goal of
    the spiritual quest, Enlightenment by Himself. However, He
    could see that while we too can attain Enlightenment, we
    might need a lot of help. Out of Compassion, He devoted the
    rest of His life to being a guide to all who were willing to
    learn from Him, teaching all that had to be taught before
    passing away into everlasting bliss. He proved to be just as
    ingenious in showing us the path to True Happiness. As long
    as we keep our hearts and minds open, the Buddha still
    inspires us through His precious teachings. </p>
