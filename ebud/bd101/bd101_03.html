        <p><em>The Buddha&#146;s teachings are based upon the
        solid foundation of Truth in the Four Noble Truths which
        can be known by all. They are not beliefs with unknown
        basis accepted on mere faith. They start from the centre
        of our very own undeniable direct human experience.</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>What are the
    Four Noble Truths?</strong></font></p>
    <p>The Buddha was only interested in showing us a clear
    direct path to True Happiness. The Four Noble Truths form the
    heart of the Buddha&#146;s Teaching. They are noble because
    they are taught by the Noble Ones- those who have direct
    perception of reality. By understanding them, we become
    ennobled.</p>
    <p><em><strong>The First Noble Truth : The Truth of Dukkha:</strong></em></p>
    <p>Life is full of Dissatisfaction- We undergo many
    unsatisfactory experiences which should be identified: Birth,
    Aging, Sickness and Death&#133; Departure from what we love,
    Being with what we dislike, Failing to achieve what we
    want&#133;</p>
    <p><em><strong>The Second Noble Truth : The Truth of the
    Origin of Dukkha:</strong></em></p>
    <p>The Cause of Dissatisfaction- These unsatisfactory
    experiences have causes which should be identified: Craving
    (Wanting), Hatred (Not Wanting) and Ignorance (Lack of
    Wisdom)</p>
    <p><em><strong>The Third Noble Truth : The Truth of the End
    of Dukkha- Nirvana:</strong></em></p>
    <p>Life can be Without Dissatisfaction- There is a peaceful
    state where there are no unsatisfactory experiences:
    Enlightenment or Nirvana</p>
    <p><em><strong>The Fourth Noble Truth : The Truth of the Path
    Leading to the End of Dukkha:</strong></em></p>
    <p>The Way to Life Without Dissatisfaction- There is a path
    to lead us to this state of peace and True Happiness: The
    Noble Eightfold Path.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Why is there so
    much &quot;Suffering&quot; in Buddhism?</strong></font></p>
    <p>The use of the word &quot;suffering&quot; in Buddhism can
    be misleading. When we hear the Buddha say &quot;life is
    suffering&quot;, we wonder what He is saying, as most of us
    don&#146;t experience extreme misery most of the time. </p>
    <p>The actual word used is the Pali term &quot;dukhka&quot;
    which means that &quot;things aren&#146;t completely right in
    our lives- there are many unsatisfactory conditions in our
    existence; something always seems amiss.&quot;
    &quot;Suffering&quot; used in Buddhism thus refers to all
    kinds of dissatisfactions big and small.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>What about
    happiness?</strong></font></p>
    <p>To live is to experience a greater or lesser degree of
    dissatisfaction. The Buddha never denied that there is joy
    and happiness in life. But the nagging problem of
    dissatisfaction is always around, while &quot;happiness&quot;
    is always swiftly fleeting by. This is the only problem in
    our lives. But it is the BIGGEST problem as it encompasses
    all problems we face. The Buddha is only drawing our
    attention to the fact that suffering is an inevitable part of
    life, that it is a problem that all experience, and wish to
    avoid, and that it can be overcome with the attainment of
    Nirvana (True Happiness).</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Are the Four
    Noble Truths pessimistic?</strong></font></p>
    <p>Some say Buddhism is a pessimistic religion- that it keeps
    talking about suffering. This is definitely untrue. But
    neither is Buddhism a blindly optimistic religion. It is
    however, realistic and full of hope as it teaches that True
    Happiness is achievable through personal endeavour, one being
    the master of one&#146;s life. </p>
    <p>Problems and difficulties exist whether we think of them
    or not. But only with honest recognition of them is solving
    them possible. The Buddha stated the indisputable truth that
    life is full of dissatisfaction so that He could teach us the
    way out of dissatisfaction towards True Happiness! </p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>How are the
    Four Noble Truths important?</strong></font></p>
    <p>To realise the Four Noble Truths is the central task of
    the Buddhist life as they lead to True Happiness. You will
    discover that the structure of the Four Noble Truths is the
    most simple, logical, scientific and systematic
    problem-solving formula possible. As these truths solve the
    ultimate problem of suffering, they are very important
    indeed.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>How do the Four
    Noble Truths work?</strong></font></p>
    <p>The first Truth states our problem of suffering. The
    second states the cause of the problem. The third states the
    ideal state without the problem, and the fourth Truth states
    how this ideal state can be achieved. </p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>What is the
    origin of the Four Noble Truths?</strong></font></p>
    <p>The Four Noble Truths were first taught by the Buddha
    during His first sermon at the Deer Park in Isipatana (of
    ancient India near Benares) after He attained Enlightenment-
    that was more than 2500 years ago. The sermon was called the
    Dharmmacakkappavattana Sutra (The Teaching of the Turning of
    the Wheel of Truth) All the teachings that the Buddha later
    gave were either further in-depth elaboration of the Four
    Noble Truths, or teachings that led to them. He used a wide
    variety of skillful means and methods in teaching them to
    different people. </p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>What is the
    Noble Eightfold Path?</strong></font></p>
    <p>The Noble Eightfold Path (of the Fouth Noble Truth) is a
    systematic and complete formula to rid Dissatisfaction and
    attain True Happiness. It contains everything needed for
    virtuous living, clarity of understanding and the attaining
    of Wisdom. The eight aspects of the Noble Eightfold Path
    include the following:</p>
    <p align="left"><em><strong>Perfect Speech</strong></em></p>
    <p>We should make an effort to notice and comment upon
    others&#146; good qualities and achievements instead of
    venting our anger or frustration on others. We can give each
    other moral support, console them in times of grief, and
    teach them the Dharma. Speech is a powerful tool to influence
    others. When used wisely, many will benefit. </p>
    <p>Perfect Speech includes the avoidance of: Lying,
    Tale-bearing, Harsh Speech, Idle Talk </p>
    <p align="left">We should: Praise, Criticise Constructively,
    Spread the Truth, Say Healing Words, Keep Necessary Silence</p>
    <p align="left"><em><strong>Perfect Action</strong></em></p>
    <p>The practice of Perfect Action involves the respect for
    the life, property and personal relationships of others. It
    helps to develop a character that is self-controlled and
    mindful of the rights of others. </p>
    <p>Perfect Action include the avoidance of: Killing,
    Stealing, Sexual Misconduct</p>
    <p>Perfect Action also includes physically acting in ways
    that benefit others. This includes helping and rescuing
    others from danger or suffering. It ranges from helping the
    elderly cross a busy street to rescuing a drowning person and
    so on.</p>
    <p align="left"><em><strong>Perfect Livelihood</strong></em></p>
    <p>Perfect Livelihood means earning one&#146;s living in a
    way that is not harmful to others. In the choice of
    one&#146;s occupation, one should show respect for the life
    and welfare of all beings.</p>
    <p>There are 5 trades that the Buddha considered as unworthy
    means to make one&#146;s living. They should be avoided as
    they cause suffering and unhappiness to others or create
    disunity in society. The trades that ought to be avoided are:
    Trade in Deadly Weapons, Animals for Slaughter, Slavery,
    Intoxicants and Poisons</p>
    <p align="left"><em><strong>Perfect Effort</strong></em></p>
    <p>Effort is needed to cultivate Virtue or develop one&#146;s
    mind, because one is often distracted or tempted to take the
    easy way out of things. The Buddha teaches that attaining
    True Happiness and Enlightenment depends upon one&#146;s own
    efforts. Effort is the root of all achievement. Thus, no
    matter how great the Buddha&#146;s achievement may be, or how
    excellent His Teaching is, one must put the Teaching into
    practice before one can expect to obtain the desired results.
    .</p>
    <p>There are four types of Perfect Effort that should be
    practiced:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>1) Effort to Prevent the Arising of Unwholesome
        Thoughts (of Craving, Aversion and Ignorance)<br>
        2) Effort to Rid Unwholesome Thoughts that have Arisen <br>
        3) Effort to Develop Wholesome Thoughts (of Wisdom and
        Compassion...) <br>
        4) Effort to Maintain the Wholesome Thoughts that have
        Arisen (even when they are unappreciated)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><em><strong>Perfect Mindfulness</strong></em></p>
    <p>Mindfulness is an essential quality in everyone&#146;s
    daily activities. It is a mental factor that enables us to
    remember, and keep our awareness and attention on what is
    beneficial in terms of thoughts, words and deeds. For
    example, when we awake in the morning, we can determine,
    &quot;<i>Today I will try not to harm others and will benefit
    them as much as possible.</i>&quot; Mindfulness helps to keep
    this thought in our mind all day and makes us aware whether
    or not our daily actions correspond to this motivation. The
    mind must be constantly aware of what is happening for
    neither mishaps nor misgivings to occu<b>r. </b></p>
    <p>Perfecting Mindfulness is necessary if one is to progress
    towards Wisdom and Enlightenment. The mind must be controlled
    and protected against distractions. Greed and Anger should be
    consciously avoided. Attention is given to the mind because
    it is through the mind that everything is comprehended,
    interpreted and understood. If lasting happiness is to be
    attained, the undisciplined mind must first be looked after.
    To tame the mind is to tame the world.</p>
    <p align="left"><em><strong>Perfect Meditation</strong></em></p>
    <p>Meditation is the gradual process of training the mind to
    focus on a single object, and to remain fixed upon that
    object without wavering. The object of concentration may be a
    material thing such as a flower or a quality such as
    Loving-kindness. Even if one was to practice meditation for
    only a few minutes a day, one will experience its benefits.
    The constant practice of meditation helps one to develop a
    calm and concentrated mind, and prepares one for the
    attainment of Wisdom and Enlightenment ultimately.</p>
    <p align="left"><em><strong>Perfect Understanding</strong></em></p>
    <p>Perfect Understanding is the seeing of all things as they
    really are, rather than as they appear to be. In order to see
    things as they really are, one must observe one&#146;s self
    and situation carefully, examining the meaning of what is
    observed. It is the true knowledge of all things realised by
    oneself through practice.</p>
    <p>An inquiring and analytical attitude is important in
    acquiring Perfect Understanding. The Buddha taught us not to
    rely upon hearsay, tradition or authority for the Truth but
    to judge the Truth in the light of our own unbiased and
    objective experience. The Buddha taught that just as a wise
    man does not accept any metal that glitters as being gold on
    the advice of another, but tests its properties for himself,
    so should one not accept what is heard without testing it by
    one&#146;s own experience. </p>
    <p>Nonetheless, in seeking the Truth, one can do well to turn
    to the Teaching of the Buddha for help. This is the first
    step towards developing right Understanding. One should
    listen to and study the Teaching of the Buddha and the
    explanations of qualified teachers. But listening to the
    Buddha&#146;s Teaching alone is not enough. One must also be
    attentive and try earnestly to remember and practice it.</p>
    <p>The Buddha says developing Perfect Understanding is like a
    blind man who has his eyesight restored, and whose attitude
    towards things he used to like and dislike changes because he
    can now see them accurately.</p>
    <p align="left"><em><strong>Perfect Thought</strong></em></p>
    <p>Thoughts influence one&#146;s words and actions. If one
    speaks or acts out of Greed or Anger, then one will speak or
    act wrongly and suffer consequently. It is necessary to
    purify one&#146;s thoughts if one really wishes to improve
    one&#146;s conduct. Perfect Thought is knowing how to use the
    knowledge that we have for the benefit of one and all.</p>
    <p>Perfect Thought means to avoid Craving and Ill-Will and to
    cultivate thoughts of Renunciation (giving up Attachment),
    Loving-Kindness and Compassion. Craving should be avoided
    because it can never be fully satisfied, leading to
    unwholesome actions. Thoughts of Renunciation remove Craving,
    while thoughts of Loving-Kindness and Compassion remove
    Ill-Will.</p>
