        <p><em>When we wish to become Buddhists formally, the
        first step is to go to the Triple Gem- the Buddha, Dharma
        and Sangha for refuge. It is an expression of one&#146;s
        faith and determination in walking the Buddha&#146;s
        path. Since the time of the Buddha, taking this Threefold
        Refuge has identified a person as a Buddhist.</em></p>

    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Why Take
    Refuge?</strong></font></p>
    <p>If we observe the world carefully, we will notice much
    pain, suffering and frustration experienced by all. We will
    look for a way to end these distressing conditions just as a
    traveller caught in a storm seeks shelter. If he finds
    shelter in a strong and safe building, he will call out to
    the others struggling in the storm to join him in his refuge.
    Similarly, one chooses to become a Buddhist when he
    understands who the Buddha is and how the Triple Gem can
    provide him the way to end suffering. Out of Compassion, he
    also encourages others to take the same refuge.</p>
    <p>The Buddha, Dharma and Sangha are called the Triple Gem
    because they represent qualities excellent and precious like
    a gem. Once we recognise these unique qualities after careful
    consideration and are confident that the Triple Gem can lead
    us towards happiness and Enlightenment, we take refuge in it.
    Therefore, it is not out of mere faith, but with an
    open-minded attitude and enquiring spirit that we begin
    practising the Buddha&#146;s Teaching. </p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Buddha</strong></font></p>
    <p>The word &quot;Buddha&quot; means the &quot;Fully
    Enlightened One&quot;, or the &quot;Awakened One&quot;. It is
    the title given to those who have attained supreme and
    perfect Enlightenment. Buddhists acknowledge the Buddha as
    the embodiment of the highest Morality, deepest
    Concentration, and perfect Wisdom. The Buddha is also known
    to His followers as the &quot;Perfected One&quot; because He
    has eradicated all Craving, Ill Will and Ignorance, having
    overcome all unwholesome actions, putting an end to all
    suffering.</p>
    <p>The Buddha is the Fully Enlightened One because He has
    realised the Truth and sees things as they really are. He
    knows through His perfect Wisdom, what is good and what is
    not good for everyone. Out of Compassion He shows us the path
    leading towards True Happiness.</p>
    <p>The Buddha&#146;s exemplary Conduct, perfect Wisdom and
    great Compassion make Him an excellent teacher. Using
    skillful means, He is able to reach out to all His followers
    so that they can understand His Teaching.</p>
    <p align="left"><em><strong>The Buddha as a Doctor</strong></em></p>
    <p>Refuge is likened to the doctor, medicine and nurse a sick
    person relies upon to be cured. We are like a sick person as
    we are afflicted with many unsatisfactory situations in life.
    Seeking a solution, we consult a qualified doctor, the Buddha
    who diagnoses the cause of our illness and the disturbing
    attitudes and the confused actions we have done under their
    influence. Then He prescribes the medicine of the Dharma, the
    teachings on how to gain the realisations leading to
    Enlightenment.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Dharma</strong></font></p>
    <p>The Buddha taught the Dharma solely out of Compassion for
    all who suffer in the cycle of birth and death. The Dharma is
    therefore taught without any selfish motives. It is well
    taught and completely good, by nature pure and bright like a
    light that destroys the darkness of ignorance. When the
    Dharma is studied and practised, it brings many benefits now
    and in the future.</p>
    <p>The Dharma is the Teaching about the nature of life. This
    Teaching of the Buddha is contained in the collection of
    scriptures called the Tripitaka. These consist of the sermons
    (Sutra Pitaka) taught by the Buddha, the disciplinary rules
    of the monastic community (Vinaya Pitaka) and the philosophy
    and psychology of Buddhism (Abhidharma Pitaka).</p>
    <p>We get to know about the Dharma by reading the scriptures.
    We can also learn from the writings and explanations of
    qualified teachers. Once we have familiarised ourselves with
    the Dharma through reading and listening, we have to realise
    its truth for ourselves by putting it into practice. This
    means purifying our conduct and cultivating Mental
    Development until the Teaching becomes part of our own
    experience.</p>
    <p align="left"><em><strong>The Dharma as Medicine</strong></em></p>
    <p>We must practice the Dharma, which is like the medicine
    the Buddha gave us, to attain Enlightenment. It is not enough
    just to hear the Dharma. We have to actively apply it in our
    daily lives and in our relationships with others. This means
    we try to be mindful and notice when disturbing attitudes
    arise. Then, we apply the remedies enabling us to perceive
    the situation clearly. If sick people have medicine but
    don&#146;t take it, they never get cured. Similarly, we may
    have an elaborate shrine at home and a huge library of Dharma
    books but if we, for example, do not apply patience when we
    meet a person who annoys us, we miss an opportunity to
    practise.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Sangha</strong></font></p>
    <p>The Sangha that a Buddhist takes refuge in is the
    community of Noble Ones who have led exemplary lives and
    attained extraordinary insight into the true nature of
    things. Their lives and achievements show others that it is
    possible to progress on the path to Enlightenment.</p>
    <p>However, the Sangha also generally refers to the fourfold
    community of monks (bhikkhus), nuns (bhikkunis), men and
    women lay followers (though &quot;Sangha&quot; is usually
    used to address monks and nuns who have renounced the lay
    life to practice and teach the Dharma full time.) Monks and
    nuns are respected for their good conduct and experience in
    meditation. They are also respected for their diligence,
    mindfulness and calmness. Wise and learned, they are able
    teachers of the Dharma, like trusted friends who inspire us
    along the path of Good Conduct.</p>
    <p>The lay followers accept the Four Noble Truths and the
    other teachings of the Buddha and seek happiness and
    Enlightenment as their common goal in life. They also uphold
    common moral values. Thus a Buddhist can look to other
    members of the lay community for help and advice in times of
    need.</p>
    <p align="left"><em><strong>The Sangha as Nurses</strong></em></p>
    <p>The Sangha are like nurses who help us take the medicine
    of Dharma. The nurses remind us when we forget which pills to
    take. If we have difficulty swallowing huge pills, the nurses
    break them into smaller pieces for us. Similarly, the Sangha
    helps us practise the Dharma correctly when we are confused.
    Any fellow practitioner who is more advanced than us can be
    our spiritual friends who help us. </p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>The Journey to
    Enlightenment</strong></font></p>
    <p>To better understand the idea of taking refuge, imagine a
    traveller who wants to visit a distant city where he has
    never been. He will need a guide, a path to follow and even
    travelling companions on the way. A Buddhist working towards
    attaining happiness and Enlightenment is like this traveller.
    The Buddha is his &quot;guide&quot;, the Dharma his
    &quot;path&quot; and the Sangha his &quot;travelling
    companions.&quot;</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Taking Refuge</strong></font></p>
    <p>One expresses intention of taking the Triple Gem as as
    refuge by repeating the following lines thrice:</p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#000080"><em><strong>&quot;I
    go to the Buddha for refuge.<br>
    I go to the Dharma for refuge.<br>
    I go to the Sangha for refuge.&quot;</strong></em></font></p>
    <p>These lines can be repeated by one alone before an image
    of the Buddha or repeated line by line after a monk. A
    Buddhist may repeat the Threefold Refuge daily to remind
    himself that he has made a commitment to attain the goal of
    happiness and Enlightenment through the guidance and
    inspiration of the Triple Gem.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Benefits of
    Taking Refuge</strong></font></p>
    <p>Taking the Threefold Refuge is the first step on the path
    to Enlightenment. Thereafter, through Good Conduct and Mental
    Development, self-mastery, Wisdom and Compassion is achieved.
    Even if Enlightenment is not achieved in this life, one who
    takes refuge in the Triple Gem is more likely to have
    favourable conditions for attaining Enlightenment in a future
    life. </p>
