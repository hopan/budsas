    <h2 align="center"><font color="#800000">What&#146;s so
    Wonderful about Buddhism?</font></h2>
    <h3 align="center"><font color="#800000"><em>Some Outstanding
    Features of Buddhism</em></font></h3>
    <hr width="25%">
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>A Perfect
    Example</strong></font></p>
    <p>The historical Buddha is an embodiment of all the virtues
    that He preached. He translated all His words into action. He
    was tireless in His spreading of the Truth and was the
    perfect model example. At no time did He ever show any human
    weakness or base passion. His qualities of Morality, Wisdom
    and Compassion are the most perfect the world has ever known.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>You Can Become
    Perfect</strong></font></p>
    <p>The Buddha represents the highest peak of spiritual
    cultivation possible. He taught that all could attain true
    perfection. No other founder of a religion has ever said that
    its followers too have the same chance to gain the same
    experience of peace, happiness and salvation as Him. But the
    Buddha taught that anyone could attain the same bliss of
    supreme Enlightenment if one was to practice as He did.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Beyond Religion</strong></font></p>
    <p>If the definition of &quot;religion&quot; is the
    unquestionable belief and worship in a supreme entity, with
    the obligation to carry out rites and rituals, Buddhism is
    definitely not a religion. It is beyond all conventional
    definitions of religion- for Buddhism encourages intelligent
    doubting and believes in the potential supremacy of the
    individual. Rites and rituals are seen as ceremonies that
    help inspire us- they do not give us Wisdom and True
    Happiness.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Universality</strong></font></p>
    <p>As the Buddha&#146;s concern is the True Happiness of all
    beings, His teachings can be practiced in society or
    seclusion, by all of every race and belief. It is totally
    unbiased and truly universal.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Purification of
    the Mind</strong></font></p>
    <p>Buddhism is the only religion that encourages not just the
    ceasing of all evil and the doing of all good- but also
    teaches the purification of one&#146;s Mind, which is the
    root of all good and evil, and the cause of both suffering
    and True Happiness.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Self-Reliance</strong></font></p>
    <p>When the Buddha was meditating to gain Enlightenment, no
    gods came to reveal any hidden secrets of spiritual power. No
    one gave Him any religious laws to teach. He said, &quot;I
    never had any teacher or divinity to teach me or tell me how
    to gain Enlightenment. I achieved supreme Wisdom by my own
    effort, energy, knowledge and purity.&quot; Likewise, we can
    attain this highest goal through perseverance in improving
    ourselves.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Freedom of
    Thought</strong></font></p>
    <p>From the intellectual and philosophical content of
    Buddhism rose the freedom of thought and inquiry unparalleled
    by any other established world religion or philosophy. Though
    the Buddha urges us to consider His teachings, there is no
    obligation or compulsion whatsoever to believe or accept any
    Buddhist doctrine.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Education of
    the Truth</strong></font></p>
    <p>The Buddha is the greatest teacher of the Truth (reality
    of all things). Buddhism is the perfect education about us
    and the Universe we live in. It is the teaching beyond
    worldly knowledge- of the highest Wisdom that leads to the
    realisation of True Happiness. It is interesting to note that
    the first university established in the world is the great
    Nalanda Buddhist University in India, which flourished from
    the second to the ninth century. It was opened to students of
    Buddhism all over the world and was the school of many
    outstanding Buddhist scholars and sages.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Standing
    Unchallenged</strong></font></p>
    <p>The Buddha was an unequalled teacher. He freely and
    actively invited both His followers and those of other
    beliefs to challenge His teachings from every possible angle
    till there was no room for any kind of doubt. True to His
    injunctions, His followers have debated about His doctrine
    and even founded different schools of Buddhism according to
    their understanding without violence or bloodshed. The Buddha
    knew that if one really believed that one knows the Truth,
    one should not be afraid to have it challenged, as the Truth
    will always win. His replies to numerous questions enriched
    the Buddhist doctrine into a vast religious field. We are
    today able to answer any questions about Buddhism, simply by
    referring to the Buddha&#146;s explanations.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>No Blind Faith</strong></font></p>
    <p>The Buddha did not promise heavenly bliss or reward to
    those who called themselves His followers. Nor did He promise
    salvation to those who had faith in Him. To Him, religion is
    not a bargain but a noble way of life to gain Enlightenment
    and salvation for oneself and others. He did not want
    followers who believed Him blindly; He wants us to think and
    understand for ourselves.</p>
    <p>The Buddha urges all to come forth to discover more about
    Buddhism and not simply believe in it. He advised choosing a
    proper religion by considering and investigating it in
    various ways, without accepting anything through emotion or
    blind faith. This is why Buddhism is called the religion of
    analysis. In it is the scientific logical analysis of mind
    and matter which modern thinkers appreciate.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>From Experience
    and Reason to Faith</strong></font></p>
    <p>Buddhism is the only religion, which was explained to
    Mankind through the experience, realisation, Wisdom and
    Enlightenment of the founder (the Buddha) without introducing
    it as a message by a god. It starts from the root of known
    experience and not blind faith. Human problems must be
    understood by one through human experience and solved by
    developing great humane qualities. One should find the
    solution through the purification and development of the
    human Mind, and not through outsiders. That is why the Buddha
    never introduced Himself as a supernatural saviour. He did
    not acknowledge that there is such a saviour. According to
    Him, we are our own saviours.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>The Whole Truth</strong></font></p>
    <p>The Buddha encourages us to face the facts of life
    courageously without acting hypocritically and to accept the
    Truth whatever and whenever it may be. All that He taught
    were timeless practical truths leading us towards True
    Happiness.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Scientific</strong></font></p>
    <p>Buddhism never found the need to give new interpretations
    to its teachings. Newly verified scientific discoveries never
    contradict the teachings of the Buddha as the method and
    teachings of Buddhism are scientific. Buddhism&#146;s
    principles can be maintained under any circumstances without
    changing its basic ideas. The understanding capacity of the
    value of these religious ideas may diminish and disappear
    from Man&#146;s Mind. And Man may experience the difficulty
    of practicing these principles in a corrupted society.
    However, the value of the Buddha&#146;s teaching will be
    appreciated by every cultured and understanding person at any
    time. As complimented by Albert Einstein (Physicist and
    Mathematician), winner of the Nobel Prize, who is popularly
    regarded as the most outstanding scientist of the twentieth
    century,</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>&quot;The religion of the future will be a cosmic
        religion. It should transcend a personal God and avoid
        dogmas and theology. Covering both the natural and the
        spiritual, it should be based on a religious sense
        arising from the experience of all things, natural and
        spiritual and a meaningful unity. Buddhism answers this
        description... If there is any religion that would cope
        with modern scientific needs, it would be Buddhism.&quot;</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Supreme
    Philosophy</strong></font></p>
    <p>As complimented by Bertrand Russell (Mathematician,
    Philosopher, Author and Social Critic), winner of the Nobel
    Prize, who is popularly regarded as the most outstanding
    philosopher of the twentieth century,</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>&quot;Of the great religions of history, I prefer
        Buddhism&#133;</i></p>
        <p><i>Buddhism is a combination of both speculative and
        scientific philosophy. It advocates the Scientific Method
        and pursues that to a finality that may be called
        Rationalistic. In it are to be found answers to such
        questions of interest as &#145;What is mind and matter?
        Of them, which is of greater importance? Is the Universe
        moving towards a goal? What is Man&#146;s position? Is
        there living that is noble?&#146; It takes up where
        science cannot lead because of the limitations of the
        latter&#146;s instruments. Its conquests are those of the
        Mind.&quot;</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Supreme
    Psychology</strong></font></p>
    <p>In the course of their work many psychologists have found,
    as the pioneering work of Dr. C.G. Jung (founder of the
    Jungian school of psychology- a pioneer of modern psychology)
    has shown, we are closer to the Buddha. To read a little
    Buddhism is to realise that the Buddhists knew, more than two
    thousand five hundred years ago, far more about our modern
    problems of psychology than they have yet been given credit
    for. They studied these problems long ago, and found the
    answers too. As complimented by Jung,</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>&quot;As a student of comparative religions, I
        believe that Buddhism is the most perfect one the world
        has seen. The philosophy of the theory of evolution and
        the law of Karma are far superior to any other
        creed&#133; </i></p>
        <p><i>It was neither the history of religion nor the
        study of philosophy that first drew me to the world of
        Buddhist thought but my professional interest as a
        doctor. My task was to treat psychic suffering and it was
        this that impelled me to become acquainted with the views
        and methods of that great teacher of humanity (the
        Buddha), whose principal theme was the chain of
        suffering, old age, sickness and death.&quot; </i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>No Fear</strong></font></p>
    <p>The Buddha is a major historical figure who promoted the
    rise of rational faith against the superstitions of religion.
    He emancipated man from the thralldom of the priests, and was
    the first to show the way to freedom from hypocrisy and
    religious dictatorship. Buddhism is a religion that uses
    reason and no element of fear to coerce anyone in any way to
    believe in it.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Universal
    Compassion</strong></font></p>
    <p>As the Buddha&#146;s Compassion is universal, He sees all
    creatures great and small, from insects to beasts, as equal
    ultimately, each with the same rights for happiness as
    Humankind.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Non-Violence</strong></font></p>
    <p>There is no such thing as a just war in Buddhism. The
    Buddha taught that &quot;the victor breeds hatred and the
    defeated lives in misery. He who renounces both victory and
    defeat is happy and peaceful.&quot; Not only did the Buddha
    teach non-violence and peace, He was probably the first and
    only religious teacher who went to the battlefield to prevent
    the outbreak of a war.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Human Equality</strong></font></p>
    <p>The Buddha was among the first to speak against the caste
    system on individual rights and the equality of all human
    beings despite differences in social standing, race and
    religion. He also encouraged the spirit of social
    co-operation and active participation in society at all
    levels. According to the Buddha, the only classification of
    human beings is based on the quality of their moral conduct.
    He Buddha said:</p>
    <p>&quot;Go into all lands and preach this teaching. Tell
    them that the poor and the lowly, the rich and the high are
    all one and that all castes unite in this religion as do the
    rivers in the sea&quot;</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Sexual Equality</strong></font></p>
    <p>The Buddha, seeing the two sexes as ultimately equal in
    rights, was the first religious teacher who gave women full
    freedom to participate in the religious life. His move to
    allow women to enter the Sangha (Buddhist order of monks and
    nuns) was extremely radical in His times.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Democracy</strong></font></p>
    <p>The Buddha was the first to advocate the spirit of
    consultation and the democratic process. In the Sangha (Order
    of monks and nuns) community, each member has individual
    rights to decide on matters of general concern. When a
    serious question arose, the issues are put forth before and
    discussed in a manner similar to today&#146;s democratic
    parliamentary system</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Socio-Economical
    Balance</strong></font></p>
    <p>The Buddha condemned the caste system, recognised the
    equality of all people and spoke on the need to improve
    socio-economical conditions and recognised the importance of
    a more equitable distribution of wealth among the rich and
    the poor through social co-operation and active participation
    in society.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Greenness</strong></font></p>
    <p>Buddhism strongly encouraged care and respect for the
    ecological environment as He clearly saw the close
    interdependence between man and nature. </p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>No Sacrificial
    Rites</strong></font></p>
    <p>The Buddha disapproved of animal sacrifice as He saw it
    cruel and unfair for anyone to destroy any living being for
    one&#146;s selfish &quot;benefit&quot;.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>No Flowery
    Display of Miracles</strong></font></p>
    <p>To the Buddha, miracles are but manifestations of
    phenomena not understood by the common man. They are not seen
    as demonstrations of Enlightenment or Wisdom as supernatural
    powers can be mastered by anybody. The supernatural is seen
    as natural phenomena not understood by the unenlightened.
    Miracles are seen as by-products of spiritual development- of
    minor importance and relevance to the real task of spiritual
    development itself. Though the Buddha has full mastery of
    psychic powers, He uses them only out of Compassion and
    skillful means to enlighten others. He never used His powers
    to win followers through blind faith and dependency in
    miracles. He taught that the highest miracle is the
    conversion of an ignorant person to a wise one.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>No Political
    Abuse</strong></font></p>
    <p>The Buddha was from a warrior caste and was brought into
    association with kings, princes and ministers. But He never
    resorted to the influence of political power to introduce His
    Teaching. Nor did He allow His Teaching to be misused for
    gaining political power. However, He urged all kings to be
    morally strong, teaching that a country should not be ruled
    by Greed but with Compassion and consideration for the
    people.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>No
    Non-Forgiveness</strong></font></p>
    <p>There is no concept of &quot;unforgivable sin&quot; in
    Buddhism. The Buddha said that all deeds are either skillful
    or unskillful due to the presence or absence of Wisdom
    respectively. There is always hope as long as one recognises
    one&#146;s mistakes and changes for the better.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>No Stubborn
    Exclusivity</strong></font></p>
    <p>The Buddha taught that if any religion has the Four Noble
    Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, it may be regarded as a
    proper religion. This is because a truly helpful religion
    must lead to the total eradication of suffering (as in the
    Four Noble Truths), showing clearly a rational path towards
    True Happiness (as in the Noble Eightfold Path in Buddhism).</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Harmonious
    Missionary Work</strong></font></p>
    <p>An outstanding example of the qualities and approach of a
    Buddhist missionary is Emperor Asoka, who sent Buddhist
    missionaries to many parts of the Asian and Western world to
    introduce the Buddha&#146;s message of peace. One of his
    scripts engraved in stone on the Asoka Pillars, which still
    stands today in India says,</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>&quot;One should not honour only one&#146;s
        religion and condemn the religion of others, but one
        should honour others&#146; religion for this or that
        reason. In so doing, one helps one&#146;s own religion to
        grow and renders service to the religions of others too.
        In acting otherwise, one digs the grave of one&#146;s own
        religion and also does harm to other religions.&quot;</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Holy wars, crusades, inquisitions and religious
    discrimination do not mar the annals of Buddhist history.
    Buddhist missionaries have no need or desire to convert those
    who already have a proper religion to practice. Buddhists are
    happy to see the progress of other religions so long as they
    help people to lead a religious way of life according to
    their faith and enjoy peace, harmony and true understanding.
    However, the Buddha also urged us to share the Truth with
    those who might be interested in it:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><em>&quot;Go forth, O Bhikkhus (monks), for the good
        of the many, for the happiness of the many, out of
        Compassion for the world, for the good, benefit and the
        happiness of gods and men... Let not two go by one way.
        Preach, O Bhikkhus, the Dharma, excellent in the
        beginning, excellent in the middle, excellent in the end,
        both in spirit and in the letter. Proclaim the Holy Life
        altogether perfect and pure.&quot;</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>The Worthiest
    Goal</strong></font></p>
    <p>Attainment of Buddhahood, or the achievement of True
    Happiness for oneself and others is the most difficult yet
    most worthwhile thing to do. Because practicing Buddhism
    means following the Noble Eightfold Path (or the Middle Way),
    Buddhists never have to go into any form of extremism.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Complete
    Overview of Humankind and Religion</strong></font></p>
    <p>The Buddha explained rationally and in detail on how all
    other religious beliefs evolved though history with the
    changes in the thinking of Humankind. He also gave us a
    comprehensive overview of the effects of religion on
    Humankind. </p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Complete Path
    Towards True Happiness</strong></font></p>
    <p>The Buddha&#146;s teachings form a complete colossal
    inter-linking syllabus, which covers every timeless aspect of
    life. The ancient collection of Buddhist Scriptures was said
    to pile up to &quot;the height of seven elephants&quot;. The
    Buddha expounded for 45 years on all that was necessary to
    eradicate suffering and attain True Happiness. He asked His
    assembly of thousands of disciples thrice, on whether they
    had any remaining doubts before His passing away. There were
    none.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Happiness in
    This Life</strong></font></p>
    <p>Buddhism is not a wholly otherworldly religion. Though
    practicing Buddhism in this life has positive effects that
    extend beyond this life, much of the direct practical fruits
    of our practice can also be seen in this very life. </p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Everything is
    Open</strong></font></p>
    <p>According to the Buddha, the Truth is an open thing for
    all to discover for themselves. When we study the life and
    teachings of the Buddha, we can see that everything is open
    to everybody. While there are certain advanced teachings that
    require specific guidance of experienced teachers, there are
    no secrets in Buddhism.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Goodwill and
    Understanding</strong></font></p>
    <p>The Buddha&#146;s message of goodwill and understanding to
    all beings is a universal message. The world today needs this
    noble message more than ever before in the history of
    Humankind. </p>
