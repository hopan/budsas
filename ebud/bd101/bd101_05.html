    <hr width="25%">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><em>The Five Precepts are recommendations given by the
        Buddha proposed to be lived by one who wishes to lead a
        peaceful life while contributing to the happiness of
        family and society. The Five Precepts are voluntarily
        observed by lay Buddhists. But they are not commandments
        that have to be strictly abided by. They form the basis
        of universal morality in the Virtue aspect of the Noble
        Eightfold Path, which is very important in the beginning
        of practicing the Buddhist path. </em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Are Precepts
    fixed rules?</strong></font></p>
    <p>Following the precepts blindly without Wisdom and
    understanding is never encouraged. The Five Precepts should
    never be stuck by blindly disregarding the circumstances;
    there are sometimes exceptional occasions when upholding them
    might create more suffering for others, proving unwise. At
    these times, the Five Precepts might have to be bent. (For
    instance, we might have to tell white lies to protect someone
    in danger- this is &quot;bending&quot; the Fourth Precept
    which is against lying.) Whenever any of the Five Precepts is
    not upheld, it should only be for the welfare of others and
    not for selfish gain.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>What are the
    benefits of Precepts?</strong></font></p>
    <p>The Buddha once told a priest that it is much better to
    &quot;sacrifice&quot; one&#146;s unwholesome conduct by
    observing the Five Precepts than killing animals to
    &quot;sacrifice to the gods&quot;. He taught that observing
    them not only expresses one&#146;s gratitude for present good
    fortune, but also increases the opportunity for happiness and
    good fortune in the future. One who mindfully observes these
    five training guidelines of wholesome conduct will find peace
    in everyday life and is unlikely to bring trouble upon
    oneself or others. </p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>Are the Five
    Precepts hard to observe?</strong></font></p>
    <p>The Five Precepts are never meant to restrict as they
    protect oneself and others when observed well. Breaking a
    precept is not considered a sin - it is seen as an unskillful
    act due to the lack of Wisdom. A lay Buddhist may find the
    Five Precepts difficult to observe completely and constantly
    in the beginning, but one should not be disheartened. Even if
    one is able to observe only one or two precepts successfully,
    one is already laying the foundation for happiness now and in
    the future. One may make a daily renewal of one&#146;s
    determination to observe the precepts to remind oneself of
    the ideal way of life one should lead. One should try his
    very best to achieve this ideal. In doing so, one will
    discover inner peace and always be at ease with the world. We
    have to remember that though we are imperfect, we can all
    strive towards perfection.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>How do I take
    the Five Precepts?</strong></font></p>
    <p>To show that one is resolved to observe the Five Precepts,
    a Buddhist may recite them before a Buddha image or repeat
    them after a monk. The ceremony for receiving the precepts is
    usually after the ceremony of going for the Threefold Refuge.
    </p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>What are some
    other Precepts?</strong></font></p>
    <p>All other sets of Buddhist precepts, including the Eight
    and Ten Precepts (Precepts for Lay Buddhist Training and
    Retreats), the Bhikkhu and Bhikkuni Precepts (Precepts of
    Monks and Nuns) and the Bodhisattva Precepts (Precepts to
    benefit as many as possible), are extensions of these Five
    Precepts. </p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>The First
    Precept: </strong></font><strong><br>
    Respect for Life: To Not Kill ; To Protect</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p align="left">I undertake the training rule to abstain
        from taking life<br>
        (so that I will practice Compassion by protecting and
        benefiting all life)</p>
        <p><i>Aware of the suffering caused by the destruction of
        life, I undertake the precept to cultivate Compassion and
        protect human, animal and plant life. I am determined not
        to kill or injure, not to let others do so, and not to
        support any act of physical or mental harm.</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>The Second
    Precept<br>
    </strong></font><strong>Respect for Personal Property: To Not
    Steal ; To be Generous</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p align="left">I undertake the training rule to abstain
        from taking the not given<br>
        (so that I will practice Generosity by sharing and giving
        my material and spiritual wealth)</p>
        <p><i>Aware of the suffering caused by exploitation,
        injustice, theft and oppression, I undertake the precept
        to cultivate Loving-kindness for the well being of people
        and animals. I will practice Honesty and Generosity by
        sharing my wealth, time, energy, empathy, encouragement
        and other resources, especially the gift of Truth with
        those in need. I am determined not to possess or steal
        anything (including time- by being late or irresponsible
        at work) that should belong to others. I will respect the
        property of others and the public and prevent others from
        profiting from suffering of any living being.</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>The Third
    Precept<br>
    </strong></font><strong>Respect for Personal Relationships:
    To Not Indulge the Senses ; To be Content</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p align="left">I undertake the training rule to abstain
        from misconduct regarding objects and subjects of sense
        pleasures,<br>
        (especially adultery, so that I will practice contentment
        and channel my energies towards spiritual development)</p>
        <p><i>Aware of the suffering caused by sexual misconduct,
        I undertake the precept to cultivate responsibility and
        protect the safety and integrity of individuals, couples,
        families and society. I am determined not to engage in
        sexual relations without love, responsibility and a
        long-term commitment. To preserve the happiness of others
        and myself, I will respect the commitments of others. I
        will do everything in my power to protect children from
        sexual abuse and prevent couples and families from being
        broken by sexual misconduct. </i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>Aware of the suffering caused by sensual
        indulgence, I will also not mindlessly indulge my senses
        of sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch and/or mind in the
        sense pleasures (eg. shows, music, food, sex etc.) such
        that I am distracted from the path towards
        self-improvement.</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>The Fourth
    Precept<br>
    </strong></font><strong>Respect for Truth: To Not Lie ; To Be
    Truthful</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p align="left">I undertake the training rule to abstain
        from false speech<br>
        (and other unwholesome modes of speech, so that I will
        communicate positively)</p>
        <p><i>Aware of the suffering caused by unmindful speech
        and inability to listen to others, I undertake the
        precept to cultivate loving speech and deep listening to
        bring joy and happiness to others and relieve them of
        their suffering. I will speak truthfully, with words that
        inspire self-confidence, joy and hope. I am determined
        not to spread news, criticise or condemn on that which I
        do not know for certain. I will refrain from uttering
        words that can cause division or discord in family or
        community. I will make the effort to reconcile and
        resolve conflicts big and small.</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font color="#800080"><strong>The Fifth
    Precept<br>
    </strong></font><strong>Respect for Mental and Physical
    Well-being: To Not Take Intoxicants ; To Be Mindful</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p align="left">I undertake the training rule to abstain
        from taking alcohol, and that which causes intoxication<br>
        (so that I will be more healthy and not break the
        precepts through loss of mindfulness)</p>
        <p><i>Aware of the suffering cause by unmindful
        consumption, I undertake the precept to cultivate good
        physical and mental health, for myself, my family and
        society by practicing mindful eating, drinking and
        consuming. I will ingest only items that preserve peace,
        well-being and joy in body and mind, and the collective
        body and consciousness of my family and society. I am
        determined not to use alcohol, drugs or any other
        intoxicant, or to ingest foods or items that contain
        negative elements so as to cultivate greater awareness,
        attention and clarity of mind. I am aware that to damage
        my body or my mind with these poisons is to let down my
        family and society. I will work to transform violence,
        fear, anger and confusion in myself and in society by
        balancing a physical and mental diet. I understand that a
        proper diet is crucial for positive self and society
        transformation and advancement in Mental Development. </i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>(This precept is sometimes interpreted as either
        total abstinence from intoxicants or as permissible
        moderate intake so long as there is no indulgence of the
        senses or impairment of health or mindfulness. The best
        safeguard is total abstinence, which better ensures
        mindfulness in following the first four precepts.)</i></p>
