    <p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was
    staying in Gaya, at Gaya Head, with 1,000 monks. There he
    addressed the monks: </p>
    <p>&quot;Monks, the All is aflame. What All is aflame? The
    eye is aflame. Forms are aflame. Consciousness at the eye is
    aflame. Contact at the eye is aflame. And whatever there is
    that arises in dependence on contact at the eye --
    experienced as pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain --
    that too is aflame. Aflame with what? Aflame with the fire of
    passion, the fire of aversion, the fire of delusion. Aflame,
    I tell you, with birth, aging and death, with sorrows,
    lamentations, pains, distresses, and despairs. </p>
    <p>&quot;The ear is aflame. Sounds are aflame. Consciousness
    at the ear is aflame. Contact at the ear is aflame. And
    whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the
    ear -- experienced as pleasure, pain or
    neither-pleasure-nor-pain -- that too is aflame. Aflame with
    what? Aflame with the fire of passion, the fire of aversion,
    the fire of delusion. Aflame, I tell you, with birth, aging
    and death, with sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, and
    despairs. </p>
    <p>&quot;The nose is aflame. Aromas are aflame. Consciousness
    at the nose is aflame. Contact at the nose is aflame. And
    whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the
    nose -- experienced as pleasure, pain or
    neither-pleasure-nor-pain -- that too is aflame. Aflame with
    what? Aflame with the fire of passion, the fire of aversion,
    the fire of delusion. Aflame, I tell you, with birth, aging
    and death, with sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, and
    despairs. </p>
    <p>&quot;The tongue is aflame. Flavors are aflame.
    Consciousness at the tongue is aflame. Contact at the tongue
    is aflame. And whatever there is that arises in dependence on
    contact at the tongue -- experienced as pleasure, pain or
    neither-pleasure-nor-pain -- that too is aflame. Aflame with
    what? Aflame with the fire of passion, the fire of aversion,
    the fire of delusion. Aflame, I tell you, with birth, aging
    and death, with sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, and
    despairs. </p>
    <p>&quot;The body is aflame. Tactile sensations are aflame.
    Consciousness at the body is aflame. Contact at the body is
    aflame. And whatever there is that arises in dependence on
    contact at the body -- experienced as pleasure, pain or
    neither-pleasure-nor-pain -- that too is aflame. Aflame with
    what? Aflame with the fire of passion, the fire of aversion,
    the fire of delusion. Aflame, I tell you, with birth, aging
    and death, with sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, and
    despairs. </p>
    <p>&quot;The intellect is aflame. Ideas are aflame.
    Consciousness at the intellect is aflame. Contact at the
    intellect is aflame. And whatever there is that arises in
    dependence on contact at the intellect -- experienced as
    pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain -- that too is
    aflame. Aflame with what? Aflame with the fire of passion,
    the fire of aversion, the fire of delusion. Aflame, I say,
    with birth, aging and death, with sorrows, lamentations,
    pains, distresses, and despairs. </p>
    <p>&quot;Seeing thus, the instructed noble disciple grows
    disenchanted with the eye, disenchanted with forms,
    disenchanted with consciousness at the eye, disenchanted with
    contact at the eye. And whatever there is that arises in
    dependence on contact at the eye, experienced as pleasure,
    pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain: With that, too, he grows
    disenchanted. </p>
    <p>&quot;He grows disenchanted with the ear, disenchanted
    with sounds, disenchanted with consciousness at the ear,
    disenchanted with contact at the ear. And whatever there is
    that arises in dependence on contact at the ear, experienced
    as pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain: With that,
    too, he grows disenchanted. </p>
    <p>&quot;He grows disenchanted with the nose, disenchanted
    with aromas, disenchanted with consciousness at the nose,
    disenchanted with contact at the nose. And whatever there is
    that arises in dependence on contact at the nose, experienced
    as pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain: With that,
    too, he grows disenchanted. </p>
    <p>&quot;He grows disenchanted with the tongue, disenchanted
    with flavors, disenchanted with consciousness at the tongue,
    disenchanted with contact at the tongue. And whatever there
    is that arises in dependence on contact at the tongue,
    experienced as pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain:
    With that, too, he grows disenchanted. </p>
    <p>&quot;He grows disenchanted with the body, disenchanted
    with tactile sensations, disenchanted with consciousness at
    the body, disenchanted with contact at the body. And whatever
    there is that arises in dependence on contact at the body,
    experienced as pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain:
    With that, too, he grows disenchanted. </p>
    <p>&quot;He grows disenchanted with the intellect,
    disenchanted with ideas, disenchanted with consciousness at
    the intellect, disenchanted with contact at the intellect.
    And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at
    the intellect, experienced as pleasure, pain or
    neither-pleasure-nor-pain: He grows disenchanted with that
    too. </p>
    <p>&quot;Disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through
    dispassion, he is fully released. With full release, there is
    the knowledge, 'Fully released.' He discerns that 'Birth is
    depleted, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is
    nothing further for this world.' &quot; </p>
    <p>That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks
    delighted at his words. And while this explanation was being
    given, the hearts of the 1,000 monks, through no clinging
    (not being sustained), were fully released from
    fermentation/effluents. </p>
