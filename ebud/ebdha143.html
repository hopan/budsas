    <p><font color="#000080"><strong>The &quot;Doctrine of the
    Elders&quot; </strong></font></p>
    <p>Theravada (Pali: thera &quot;elders&quot; + vada
    &quot;word, doctrine&quot;), the &quot;Doctrine of the
    Elders,&quot; is the name for the school of Buddhism that
    draws its scriptural inspiration from the Pali Canon, or
    Tipitaka, which scholars generally accept as the oldest
    record of the Buddha's teachings. For many centuries,
    Theravada has been the predominant religion of Sri Lanka,
    Burma, and Thailand; today Theravada Buddhists number over
    100 million worldwide. In recent decades Theravada has begun
    to take root in the West -- primarily in Europe and the USA. </p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><strong>The many names of Theravada </strong></font></p>
    <p>Theravada Buddhism goes by many names. The Buddha himself
    called the religion he founded Dhamma-vinaya, &quot;the
    doctrine and discipline,&quot; in reference to the two
    fundamental aspects of the system of ethical and spiritual
    training he taught. Owing to its historical dominance in
    southern Asia (Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Burma), Theravada is
    also identified as &quot;Southern Buddhism,&quot; in contrast
    to &quot;Northern Buddhism,&quot; which migrated northwards
    from India into China, Tibet, Japan, and Korea. Theravada is
    often equated with &quot;Hinayana&quot; (the &quot;Lesser
    Vehicle&quot;), in contrast to &quot;Mahayana&quot; (the
    &quot;Greater Vehicle&quot;), which is usually a synonym for
    Tibetan Buddhism, Zen, Ch'an, and other expressions of
    Northern Buddhism. The use of &quot;Hinayana&quot; as a
    pejorative has its origins in the early schisms within the
    monastic community that ultimately led to the emergence of
    what would later become Mahayana. Today scholars of many
    persuasions use the term &quot;Hinayana&quot; without
    pejorative intent. </p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><strong>Pali: the language of
    Theravada </strong></font></p>
    <p>The language of the Theravada canonical texts is Pali, a
    relative of Magadhi, a language probably spoken in central
    India during the Buddha's time. Most of the sermons the
    Buddha delivered were memorized by Ven. Ananda, the Buddha's
    cousin and close personal attendant. Shortly after the
    Buddha's death (ca. 480 BCE), the community of monks --
    including Ananda -- convened to recite all the sermons they
    had heard during the Buddha's forty-five years of teaching.
    Each recorded sermon (sutta) therefore begins with the
    disclaimer, Evam me sutam -- &quot;Thus have I heard.&quot;
    The teachings were passed down within the monastic community
    following a well-established oral tradition. By about 100 BCE
    the Tipitaka was first fixed in writing in Sri Lanka by
    Sinhala scribe-monks. </p>
    <p>Of course, it can never be proved that the Pali Canon
    contains the actual words uttered by the historical Buddha
    (and there is ample evidence to suggest that much of the
    Canon does not). The wisdom the Canon contains has
    nevertheless served for centuries as an indispensable guide
    for millions of followers in their quest for Awakening. </p>
    <p>Many students of Theravada find that learning the Pali
    language -- even just a little bit here and there -- greatly
    deepens their understanding of the path of practice. </p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><strong>A brief summary of the
    Buddha's teachings </strong></font></p>
    <p>What follows is a brief synopsis of some of the key
    teachings of Theravada Buddhism. I've left out a great deal,
    but I hope that even this rough outline will be enough to get
    you started in your exploration. </p>
    <p>Shortly after his Awakening, the Buddha (&quot;the
    Awakened One&quot;) delivered his first sermon, in which he
    laid out the essential framework upon which all his later
    teachings were based. This framework consists of the Four
    Noble Truths, four fundamental principles of nature (Dhamma)
    that emerged from the Buddha's honest and penetrating
    assessment of the human condition and that serve to define
    the entire scope of Buddhist practice. These truths are not
    statements of belief. Rather, they are categories by which we
    can frame our direct experience in a way that is conducive to
    Awakening: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>1. <strong>Dukkha:</strong> suffering,
        unsatisfactoriness, discontent, stress; </p>
        <p>2. <strong>The cause of dukkha:</strong> the cause of
        this dissatisfaction is craving (tanha) for sensuality,
        for states of becoming, and states of no becoming; </p>
        <p>3. <strong>The cessation of dukkha:</strong> the
        relinquishment of that craving; </p>
        <p>4. <strong>The path of practice leading to the
        cessation of dukkha:</strong> the Noble Eightfold Path of
        right view, right resolve, right speech, right action,
        right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and
        right concentration. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To each of these Noble Truths the Buddha assigned a
    specific task which the practitioner is to carry out: the
    first Noble Truth is to be comprehended; the second is to be
    abandoned; the third is to be realized; the fourth is to be
    developed. The full realization of the third Noble Truth
    paves the way for the direct penetration of Nibbana
    (Sanskrit: Nirvana), the transcendent freedom that stands as
    the final goal of all the Buddha's teachings. </p>
    <p>The last of the Noble Truths -- the Noble Eightfold Path
    -- contains a prescription for the relief of our unhappiness
    and for our eventual release, once and for all, from the
    painful and wearisome cycle of birth and death (samsara) to
    which -- through our own ignorance (avijja) of the Four Noble
    Truths -- we have been bound for countless aeons. The Noble
    Eightfold Path offers a comprehensive practical guide to the
    development of those wholesome qualities and skills in the
    human heart that must be cultivated in order to bring the
    practitioner to the final goal, the supreme freedom and
    happiness of Nibbana. In practice, the Buddha taught the
    Noble Eightfold Path to his followers according to a
    &quot;gradual&quot; system of training, beginning with the
    development of sila, or virtue (right speech, right action,
    and right livelihood, which are summarized in practical form
    by the five precepts), followed by the development of
    samadhi, or concentration and mental cultivation (right
    effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration),
    culminating in the full development of
    pa&amp;ntilde;&amp;ntilde;a, or wisdom (right view and right
    resolve). The practice of dana (generosity) serves as a
    support at every step along the path, as it can help erode
    the heart's habitual tendencies towards craving and as it can
    teach valuable lessons about the causes and results of one's
    actions (kamma). </p>
    <p>Progress along the path does not follow a simple linear
    trajectory. Rather, development of each aspect of the Noble
    Eightfold Path encourages the refinement and strengthening of
    the others, leading the practitioner ever forward in an
    upward spiral of spiritual maturity that culminates in
    Awakening. </p>
    <p>Seen from another point of view, the long journey on the
    path to Awakening begins in earnest with the first tentative
    stirrings of right view, the first flickerings of wisdom by
    which one recognizes both the validity of the first Noble
    Truth and the inevitability of the law of kamma (Sanskrit:
    karma), the universal law of cause and effect. Once one
    begins to see that harmful actions inevitably bring about
    harmful results, and wholesome actions ultimately bring about
    wholesome results, the desire naturally grows to live a
    skillful, morally upright life, to take seriously the
    practice of sila. The confidence built from this preliminary
    understanding inclines the follower to place an even greater
    trust in the teachings. The follower becomes a
    &quot;Buddhist&quot; upon expressing an inner resolve to
    &quot;take refuge&quot; in the Triple Gem: the Buddha (both
    the historical Buddha and one's own innate potential for
    Awakening), the Dhamma (both the teachings of the historical
    Buddha and the ultimate Truth towards which they point), and
    the Sangha (both the monastic community that has protected
    the teachings and put them into practice since the Buddha's
    day, and all those who have achieved at least some degree of
    Awakening). With one's feet thus firmly planted on the ground
    by taking refuge, and with the help of an admirable friend
    (kalyanamitta) to help show the way, one can set out along
    the Path, confident that one is indeed following in the
    footsteps left by the Buddha himself. </p>
    <p>Buddhism is sometimes na&amp;iuml;vely criticized as a
    &quot;negative&quot; or &quot;pessimistic&quot; religion and
    philosophy. After all (so the argument goes) life is not all
    misery and disappointment: it offers many kinds of joy and
    happiness. Why then this pessimistic Buddhist obsession with
    unsatisfactoriness and suffering? </p>
    <p>The Buddha based his teachings on a frank assessment of
    our plight as humans: there is unsatisfactoriness and
    suffering in the world. No one can argue this fact. Were the
    Buddha's teachings to stop there, we might indeed regard them
    as pessimistic and life as utterly hopeless. But, like a
    doctor who prescribes a remedy for an illness, the Buddha
    offers hope (the third Noble Truth) and a cure (the fourth).
    The Buddha's teachings thus give cause for an extraordinary
    degree of optimism in a complex, confusing, and difficult
    world. One modern teacher summed it up well: &quot;Buddhism
    is the serious pursuit of happiness.&quot; </p>
    <p>The Buddha claimed that the Awakening he re-discovered is
    accessible to anyone willing to put forth the effort and
    commitment required to pursue the Noble Eightfold Path to its
    end. It is up to each of us individually to put that claim to
    the test. </p>
    <p><font color="#000080"><strong>Theravada comes West </strong></font></p>
    <p>Until the late 19th century, the teachings of Theravada
    were little known outside of Southern and Southeast Asia,
    where they had flourished for some two and one-half
    millennia. In the last century, however, the West has begun
    to take notice of Theravada's unique spiritual legacy and
    teachings of Awakening. In recent decades, this interest has
    swelled, with the monastic Sangha from the various schools
    within Theravada establishing dozens of monasteries across
    Europe and North America. In addition, a growing number of
    lay meditation centers in the West, operating independently
    of the Sangha, currently strain to meet the demands of lay
    men and women -- Buddhist and otherwise -- seeking to learn
    selected aspects of the Buddha's teachings. </p>
    <p>The turn of the 21st century presents both opportunities
    and dangers for Theravada in the West: Will the Buddha's
    teachings be patiently studied and put into practice, so that
    they may be allowed to establish deep roots in Western soil,
    for the benefit of many generations to come? Will the current
    popular climate of &quot;openness&quot; and
    cross-fertilization between spiritual traditions lead to the
    emergence of a strong new form of Buddhist practice unique to
    the modern era, or will it simply lead to the dilution and
    confusion of these priceless teachings? These are open
    questions; only time will tell. </p>
    <p>Fortunately, the Buddha left us with some very clear and
    simple guidelines to help us find our way through the
    perplexing maze of purportedly &quot;Buddhist&quot; teachings
    that are available to us today. Whenever you find yourself
    questioning the authenticity of a particular teaching, heed
    well the Buddha's advice to his stepmother: </p>
    <p>The qualities of which you may know, 'These qualities lead
    to passion, not to dispassion; to being fettered, not to
    being unfettered; to accumulating, not to shedding; to
    self-aggrandizement, not to modesty; to discontent, not to
    contentment; to entanglement, not to seclusion; to laziness,
    not to aroused persistence; to being burdensome, not to being
    unburdensome': You may definitely hold, 'This is not the
    Dhamma, this is not the Vinaya, this is not the Teacher's
    instruction.' </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><em>As for the qualities of which you may know, 'These
        qualities lead to dispassion, not to passion; to being
        unfettered, not to being fettered; to shedding, not to
        accumulating; to modesty, not to self-aggrandizement; to
        contentment, not to discontent; to seclusion, not to
        entanglement; to aroused persistence, not to laziness; to
        being unburdensome, not to being burdensome': You may
        definitely hold, 'This is the Dhamma, this is the Vinaya,
        this is the Teacher's instruction.' -- AN VIII.53 </em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The truest test of these teachings, of course, is whether
    they yield the promised results in the crucible of your own
    heart. The Buddha presented us with a challenge; it is up to
    each of us individually to put that challenge to the test. </p>
