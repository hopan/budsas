      <P><FONT SIZE="6">A</FONT>s ancient religions like Buddhism become 
      established in Australia for the first time, we all need to rethink our 
      understanding of religion. The Oxford English Dictionary defines religion 
      as &quot;the belief in a superhuman controlling power, especially in a personal 
      God or gods entitled to obedience and worship&quot;. This is not good enough! 
      Since its beginnings in N.E. India 2588 years ago, Buddhism has never 
      believed in a superhuman controlling power, nor has it acknowledged a 
      personal God entitled to obedience and worship. The Buddha clearly 
      rejected the existence of a creator God. Buddhism does not fit such 
      definitions of religion as are found in such authoritative works as the 
      Oxford English Dictionary. Yet Buddhism is understood by all as a 
      religion.</P>
      <P>We need to refine our understanding of the meaning of the word 
      &#39;religion&#39;, so as to include such belief systems as Buddhism. At present, 
      out of prejudice or intellectual laziness, Buddhism is being bent and 
      misshapen to fit into old but comfortable ideas of religion. For example, 
      I heard here earlier today a speaker state that the Buddha was another 
      prophet of God. This simply is not true. The Buddha was neither God nor 
      prophet of God. Buddhism dispenses with the need for such a God. As a wit 
      once remarked, Buddhism is the world&#39;s only true non-prophet religion! So, 
      it is unreasonable to change Buddhism to fit outmoded definitions of 
      religion. Instead we need to change the definition.</P>
      <P>Buddhism, like all religions, addresses the perennial questions about 
      that which transcends the mundane. With its teachings on Karma and 
      Reincarnation, with its mystical practices of meditation and insight, with 
      its wisdom teachings and emphasis on the compassion that is non-violent, 
      and with its rich liturgy of ceremony and ritual - Buddhism certainly 
      qualifies as a religion. It is said that &quot;fools rush in where angels fear 
      to tread&quot;, but this saying obviously does not apply to Buddhists like me, 
      so here is my attempt at a more inclusive definition of &#39;religion&#39;:</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>Religion:</B> a belief system, bestowed or realised, which gives 
      meaning to life in relation to that which transcends the mundane.</P>
      </I>
      <P>Definitions are valuable. The current, inadequate definitions of 
      religion can exclude belief systems such as Buddhism and relegate the 
      ideas that they contain. Excluding and demeaning such a large community of 
      people has in the past, and will in the future, lead to strife for us all. 
      Already such strife is apparent. In the seventeen years that I have been 
      in Australia as a Buddhist monk, I have seen Buddhists disadvantaged in 
      areas of life such as law, because their religious culture was 
      misunderstood.</P>
      <P>For example, Buddhist practice effectively extinguishes the emotion of 
      guilt. When a Buddhist errs, they are taught to follow, what I call here 
      in Australia, the AFL Code - Acknowledge, Forgive and Learn. The 
      self-punishment that is guilt is seen as unhelpful. So should a Buddhist 
      face sentencing in a court of law, their religion-based equanimity 
      concerning what they have done can so easily be misconstrued by the 
      sentencing Judge as a lack of remorse and a penalty more severe than 
      otherwise handed down.</P>
      <P>In another example, a Caucasian Buddhist some years ago discovered that 
      her husband had been sexually abusing her two children. The husband went 
      to jail and both she and her children were obliged by law to undergo 
      counselling. In the period between the awful discovery and the first 
      appointment with the counsellor, she had quickly come to terms with the 
      trauma, accepted it and forgiven her husband. She had no more desire for a 
      relationship with the man, but she bore him no ill will. When she said so 
      to the counsellor it was viewed as denial and, in short, she would not be 
      released from obligatory counselling until she admitted an anger at her 
      husband that she simply did not have. It took a long and detailed letter 
      from me to convince the psychologist in charge that her early acceptance 
      and forgiveness were standard Buddhist practice and not denial, so that 
      she could be released. By the way, her quick settling of the problem led 
      to her children also accepting the trauma easily. Their scars were small 
      ones and the family prospered.</P>
      <P>I will give a last example, one that is personal. Buddhist monks split 
      their time between serving the lay Buddhist community and their own 
      spiritual development in seclusion. The latter requires a peaceful 
      monastery, usually outside of the city, but not too distant. Then the 
      monks take the qualities that they nurture in their monastery, such as 
      compassion and wisdom, out into the city to serve the community. The local 
      Buddhist monastery is looked on as the heart of the religion and the 
      source of Buddhists&#39; guidance. Our monastery in Serpentine, just south of 
      Perth, has recently been threatened, first by a gravel pit &#39;next door&#39;, 
      and then by a rifle range. Both threats were overcome. But a third 
      development has been approved, sending huge clay laden trucks thundering 
      along our monastery boundary from 6am-6pm for many, many days. So far we 
      have been unable to stop what is threatening the very existence of our 
      monastery. As the monastery is being threatened, so is the religious 
      practice of the large lay Buddhist community who depend on our monastery. 
      If we were a school, hospital or hospice, then the need for quiet would be 
      recognised in planning law and trucking would be stopped. A monastery, in 
      particular a Buddhist monastery, is not recognised in law and there is the 
      root of our problem. Should our legislators recognise the vital importance 
      of a monastery to the ordinary Buddhist, of which there are several 
      hundred thousand already in Australia, then we would not be so 
      disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>In summary, Buddhists do not seek to be treated differently in law, 
      they seek to be understood better by law. Nor do they have a &#39;divine&#39; law, 
      which they take as superior to secular law and which can override it. Even 
      the Buddhist transcendent law of Karma is seen by Buddhists as finding 
      expression in secular law, never displacing it. When our legal system 
      takes on board not only the Judaeo-Christian paradigm but also other 
      paradigms, such as the Buddhist and Aboriginal, then we will be moving to 
      a more just legal system for all.</P>
