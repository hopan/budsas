    trong sách Pháp Trụ Ký. Sách này do vị Ðại A-la-hán Nan Ðề Mật Ða La 
    (Nandimitra) trước thuật và Tam Tạng Pháp sư Huyền Trang (600-664) dịch ra 
    chữ Hán. </font></p> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ngài Nan Ðề Mật Ða La (còn có tên là Khánh Hữu) 
    người Tích Lan, ra đời khoảng năm 800 năm sau Phật Niết bàn. Theo Pháp 
    Trụ Ký (Fachu-chi), thì Ngài chỉ lược thuật lại kinh Pháp Trụ Ký do 
    Phật thuyết giảng mà thôi. Sách này trình bày danh tánh, trú xứ và sứ 
    mệnh của 16 vị La-hán. Các Ngài đã đạt được Tam minh, Lục thông và 
    Bát giải thoát, vâng thừa giáo chỉ của Phật, kéo dài thọ mạng, trụ tại 
    thế gian tại thế gian để hộ trì chánh pháp và làm lợi lạc quần 
    sanh. Mỗi khi các tự viện tổ chức lễ hội khánh thành, làm phúc, cúng 
    dường trai Tăng, các Ngài cùng với quyến thuộc thường vận dụng thần 
    thông đến để chứng minh, tham dự, nhưng chúng ta không thể nào 
    thấy được. Hiện nay, tuổi thọ trung bình của loài người là 80 tuổi. 
    Tuổi thọ này - theo Pháp Trụ Ký - sẽ giảm dần còn 10 tuổi là giai 
    đoạn cuối cùng của kiếp giảm. Sau đó, sang giai đoạn kiếp tăng, tuổi 
    thọ con người từ 10 tuổi tăng dần đến 70.000 tuổi. Bấy giờ các Ngài 
    sẽ chấm dứt nhiệm vụ và nhập Niết bàn. (Bởi vì khi tuổi thọ loài 
    người đến 80.000 tuổi thì đức Phật Di Lạc sẽ ra đời). </font></p>

    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sau khi Pháp Trụ ký được dịch sang chữ Hán, 
    Thiền sư Quán Hưu (832-912), vốn là một họa sĩ tài ba đã vẽ ra hình 
    ảnh 16 vị A-la-hán. Tương truyền, nhân Thiền sư nằm mơ cảm ứng thấy 
    được hình ảnh của các Ngài rồi vẽ lại. Những hình ảnh này ngày nay người 
    ta còn tìm thấy tàng trữ nơi vách tường Thiên Phật động tại Ðôn Hoàng 
    thuộc tỉnh Cam Túc, Trung Quốc. Sau Thiền sư Quán Hưu còn có hoạ sĩ Pháp 
    Nguyện, Pháp Cảnh và Tăng Diệu cũng chuyên vẽ về các vị La-hán. </font><font 
    COLOR="#00007f"><b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Vì sao 16 vị La-hán trở thành 18 vị?</font></b></font></p> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Từ khi có hình ảnh 16 vị La-hán, các chùa thường tôn 
    trí hình ảnh của các Ngài, và từ con số 16 người ta thêm tôn giả Khánh Hữu 
    thành 17 và tôn giả Tân Ðầu Lô thành 18 (nhưng không biết ai là tác giả 
    đầu tiên của con số 18 này). </font></p> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thật ra tôn giả Khánh Hữu (<i>Ch'ing-yu</i>, 
    tên dịch nghĩa ra chữ Hán) 
    vốn là Nan Ðề Mật Ða La (tên phiên âm từ chữ Phạn <i>Nandimitra</i>), người đã 
    thuyết minh sách Pháp Trụ Ký; còn Tân Ðầu Lô chính là Tân Ðầu Lô 
    Bạt La Ðọa Xà, vị La-hán thứ nhất trong 16 vị. Do khômg am tường kinh 
    điển và không hiểu tiếng Phạn mà thành lầm lẫn như thế!</font></p> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Về sau, Sa môn Giáp Phạm và Ðại thi hào Tô Ðông 
    Pha (1036-1101) dựa vào con số 18 này mà làm ra 18 bài văn ca tụng. Mỗi bài 
    đều có đề tên một vị La-hán. Rồi họa sĩ Trương Huyền lại 
    dựa vào 18 bài văn ca tụng của Tô Thức mà tạc tượng 18 vị La-hán, nhưng 
    lại thay hai vị 17 và 18 bằng tôn giả Ca Diếp và Quân Ðề Bát Thán. Do 
    thế mà từ con số 16 lần hồi trở thành con số 18. Từ đời Nguyên trở đi, 
    tại Trung Quốc cũng như Việt Nam, con số 18 này được mọi người mặc 
    nhiên chính thức công nhận, con số 16 chỉ còn lưu giữ trong sổ sách mà thôi. 
    Nhưng, tại Tây Tạng, ngoài 16 vị trên, người ta thêm Ðạt Ma Ða La 
    <i>(Dharmatara)</i> và Bố 
    Ðại Hòa Thượng <i>(Pu-tai Ho-shang)</i>; hoặc thêm hai tôn giả Hoàng Long và Phục Hổ, hoặc thêm Ma 
    Da Phu nhân <i>(Maya)</i> và Di Lặc <i>(Maitreya)</i> để thành ra 18 vị. </font><font COLOR="#00007f"><b></p> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ngoài ra, còn có hai sự tích khác về 18 vị La-hán</font></b></font></p> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Sự tích thứ nhất được kể trong tập sách 
    viết bằng chữ Hán của thầy Giáo thọ Hoằng Khai, trụ trì chùa Càn An, 
    tỉnh Bình Ðịnh, vào năm Tự Ðức thứ tư (1851). Theo sách này thì nước 
    Triệu có nàng công chúa tên là Hy Ðạt, vốn rất chí thành mộ đạo, nàng 
    chuyên niệm danh hiệu đức Phật A Di Ðà. Năm 15 tuổi, nàng ăn một 
    đóa hoa sen vàng rồi hoài thai đến 6 năm mới sinh ra 18 đồng tử. Các 
    đồng tử ấy về sau được đức Quan Âm hóa độ và thọ ký để 
    họ trở thành 18 vị La-hán. </font></p> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nội dung sự tích này khá lý thú, tương đối có 
    giá trị về mặt văn chương, nhưng cốt truyện lại pha trộn tinh thần 
    Phật, Khổng, Lão nên ít có giá trị về mặt lịch sử. </font></p> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. Sự tích thứ hai: tương truyền ngày xưa tại Trung 
    Quốc có 18 tên tướng cướp rất hung hãn. Về sau họ hồi tâm cải tà 
    quy chánh, nương theo Phật pháp tu hành và đắc quả A-la-hán. </font></p> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sự tích này tương đối có ý nghĩa, nhưng lại có 
    tính cách huyền thoại, do đó ít được người ta chấp nhận. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">W</font>hen you enter the chief hall of a
    Buddhist temple in China you cannot fail to notice two rows of large yellow figures -- one
    along the east and the other along the west wall. These figures, which are usually
    numbered and labelled, are called the Eighteen Lohan, and if you ask your guide what they
    are he will probably reply &quot;belong jess.&quot; This answer may not be deemed
    satisfactory, but further inquiry will only elicit the information that these are images
    of Buddha's eighteen great disciples. The names, however, show that this information is
    not quite correct, some of them being unknown to the original Buddhist canon. If you go on
    to Korea and visit the curious old Buddhist temples in that country, you will find that
    Buddha's Hall has rows of similar figures, but sixteen in number. If you continue your
    journey and visit Japan, you will find there also Sixteen Rakan lining the side walls of
    the Buddhist temples. Lohan and Rakan are for A-lo-han, the Chinese way of expressing the
    Sanskrit word Arhan for Arhat. Suppose you could go back and travel to Lhassa, there also
    you would find Sixteen Arhats, or as they are called there, Sthaviras, in the Chief Hall
    of Buddha's temples. Tibet, however, seems to have also its Eighteen Lohan, imported from
    China apparently in modern times.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we examine the Buddhist literature preserved in the
    libraries of the great monasteries in China, we find in it mention of only sixteen great
    Arhats, the number eighteen being apparently unknown even to the comparatively modern
    native treatises. As for the pictures and images of these sixteen, they are mainly derived
    from the works of one or two painters of the T'ang dynasty. About the year 880 an artist
    named Kuan Hsiu made pictures of the Sixteen Lohan, which were given to a Buddhist
    monastery near Ch'ien-t'ang in the province of Chekiang. These became celebrated, and were
    preserved with great care and treated with ceremonious respect. In the reign of Kien-lung
    of the present dynasty an official, while on duty in the district, had copies of these
    pictures made by competent artists and sent them to the emperor. His Majesty had further
    copies made, and ordered them to be printed and distributed. It was found that wrong names
    had been given to several of the figures, so the emperor ordered that all the names should
    be compared with the original and correctly transcribed according to the new system. But
    the question remains, who are these Arhats? and the answer is to be found in the Buddhist
    scriptures. They are patrons and guardians of Sakyamuni Buddha's system of religion and
    its adherents, lay and clerical.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">An early mention of spiritual protectors of Buddha's
    religion after his decease is found in the &quot;Sutra of Sari putra's Questions,&quot;
    No. 1,152 in Mr. Bunyio Nanjio's Catalogue. We do not know when or by whom this book was
    translated or when it Teas brought to China, but its translation has been referred to the
    fourth century of our era. In this treatise the Buddha is represented as com mitting his
    religion to the protection of Sakra and the four Devarajas. He also entrusts the
    propagation of his system after his death to four &quot;Great Bhikshus.&quot; The names of
    these are given as Mahakasyapa, Pindola, Kun te-pan-t'an, and Rahula. These men were to
    remain in existence and not experience final Nirvana until the advent of Maitreya as
    Buddha. Three of these names are well known, and the unknown one is apparently the
    Kun-t'ou p'o-han of the &quot; Tseng-i-a-han-ching &quot; (ch. 23). These characters
    evidently represent the Pali name Kundo-vahan, which means Mungoose-bearing, a name to be
    remembered in connection with what follows. The composition of this sutra may probably be
    referred to the end of the last century B.C. Then in a sastra, the name of which is
    restored as &quot; Arya-Vasumitra-bodhisattva- sangiti-sastra,&quot; Nanjio, No. 1,289, we
    find mention of sixteen &quot;Brahmans&quot; over whom Buddha is lord. These are probably
    the Sixteen Arhats, although a note added to the text gives the name of the second one as
    Ajita- Maitreya. This treatise, which was probably composed in the first century of our
    era, was translated in the year 384.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In another treatise called the
    &quot;Ju-ta-sheng-lun,&quot; the &quot; Mahayanavataraka-sastra&quot; of Nanjio, No.
    1,243, we have further mention of guardians of Buddhism. Here we have ninety-nine lakhs of
    &quot; great arhats&quot; and also sixteen called &quot;Great Sravakas.&quot; Of these
    only two names are given, Pindola and Rahula, the reader being supposed to be acquainted
    with the sutras from which the author quotes. These guardians of Buddha's religion are
    dispersed over the world, the names of some of their spheres being given. Among these are
    Purva-Videha, the Wheat (Godhuma) region, the Chestnut (Priyangu) region, the Lion (Simha)
    region, and the &quot;Bhadrika place.&quot; This sastra was corn posed by the learned
    Buddhist Sthiremati, and translated into Chinese by Tao-t'ai and others about A.D. 400.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The test, however, from which all our knowledge of the
    names of the Sixteen Arhats or Lohan of Buddhist temples in China, Japan, and Korea may be
    said to be derived is that entitled &quot;
    Ta-A-lo-han-Nan-t'i-mi-to-lo-so-shuo-fachu-chi.&quot; This means &quot;The record of the
    duration of the law, spoken by the great Arhat Nandimitra.&quot; The treatise, which was
    translated by the celebrated Yuan-chuang (Hiouen Thsang), is No. 1,466 in Nanjio's
    Catalogue. The name of the author is not known, but he must have lived long after the time
    of Nandimitra, and apparently he was not a native of that arhat's country. There seems to
    have been also a previous translation of the same or a similar original, and to it
    Yuan-chuang and other writers appear to have been indebted.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The book begins with the statement that according to
    tradition within 800 years from Buddha's decease there was an arhat named Nandimitra at
    the capital of King Sheng-chun in the Chih-shih-tzu country. Nanjio took Sheng-chun to be
    Prasenajit and Chih-shih-tzu to be Ceylon according to the Chinese notes in the &quot;
    Hsi-yu-chi.&quot; But Prasenajit's capital was Sravasti in Kosala, and we do not find any
    king with that name in the annals of Ceylon. The &quot; Chih-shih-tzu &quot; country of
    this passage is probably the Shih-tzu-kuo which we know from the 16th chapter of the
    &quot; Tseng-i-a-han-ching &quot; was in the Vrijjian territory. The original home of the
    Aryan immigrants into Ceylon was not far from this district, and the name Simhala-dvipa
    may have been derived from this Lion-country. The words Sheng-Chun may stand for either
    Prasenajit or Jayasena. (1) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The sutra then proceeds to narrate how the great Arhat
    Nandimitra answered the questions of his perplexed and desponding congregation about the
    possible continued existence of Buddhism in the world. He tells his hearers that the
    Buddha when about to die entrusted his religion to sixteen great Arhats. These men are to
    watch over and care for the religious welfare of the lay-believers and generally protect
    the spiritual interests of Buddhism. They are to remain in existence all the long time
    until Maitreya appears as Buddha and brings in a new system. Then, according to
    Nandimitra, the Sixteen Arhats will collect all the relics of Sakyamuni and build over
    them a magnificent tope. When this is finished they will pay their last worship to the
    relics, rising in the air and doing pradakshina to the tope. Then they will enter an
    igneous ecstasy and so vanish in remainderless nirvana. At his hearers' request Nandimitra
    gives the names of these Protectors of the Faith, their homes or spheres of action, and
    the numbers of their retinues. These Arhats are the Sixteen Rakan of the Japanese and
    Koreans and constitute sixteen of the Eighteen Lohan of the Chinese. They have incense
    burnt before their images, but generally speaking they are not worshipped or consulted
    like the gods and P'usas of the temples.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The names of the Sixteen Arhats or Lohan, together with
    their residences and retinues, are now given according to this sutra of the Duration of
    the Law and in the order in which that work gives them. Variations as to the names which
    have been noticed in other lists and in different temples are also given. But as to the
    pictures and images of the Sixteen we must remember that these, whether merely works of
    art or consecrated to religion, are not supposed to be faithful representations of the men
    indicated by the names attached. The pictures and images are to be taken merely as symbols
    or fanciful creations. (2) </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Pin-tu-lo-Po-lo-to-she, Pindola the Bharadvaja. </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He has a retinue of 1,000 arhats, and his place is the
    Godhanga region in the west. Sometimes the name of this arhat is transcribed Pin-tou-lo,
    and sometimes he is styled Bharadvaja simply. Pindola was one of Buddha's great disciples,
    became an arhat, and was distinguished as a successful disputant and defender of
    orthodoxy, with a voice like the roar of a lion. (3) But he had a weakness for exhibiting
    his magical powers before all sorts of people, and sometimes for unworthy objects. On one
    occasion, according to the Pali and other editions of the Vinaya, in order to show his
    superhuman powers, he rose in the air, took a sandal-wood bowl off a very high pole, and
    floated about with it for a time over the heads of an admiring crowd. This proceeding
    brought a severe rebuke from the Master, and was the occasion of a rule prohibiting the
    use of sandal-wood bowls. (4) The Buddha also on this occasion announced to Pindola that
    he was not to &quot;take Nirvana,&quot; but was to remain in existence protect Buddha's
    system until the coming of Maitreya. (5) We read also of Pindola working a miracle with a
    hill in order to go to a breakfast given by Sudatta's wife, and some make this to be the
    occasion on which Buddha rebuked him and told him he was to remain in existence to foster
    Buddhism until the advent of Maitreya to bring in a new system. (6) But Pindola sometimes
    wrought miracles for good purposes, and his exhibition of magical powers at Rajagriha led
    to the conversion of an unbelieving lady. (7) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Pindola has been living ever since Buddha's time, and he
    has appeared on several occasions to pious workers for Buddhism. In India it was once the
    custom for lay believers when giving an entertainment to the Buddhist monks to &quot;
    invite Pindola.&quot; The arhat could not be seen, but the door was left open for him, and
    it was known by the appearance of the flowers or the condition of the mat reserved for him
    whether he had been present. (8) When King Asoka summoned his great assembly Pindola was
    living on the Gandhamali (or Gandhamadana) mountain with a company of arhats 60,000 in
    number. Called to the assembly, he flew swan-like to the place of meeting, and on account
    of his undoubted seniority he was chosen president. He was then a very old man with white
    hair and long eyebrows, which he had to hold back with his hands in order to see.&quot;
    (9) As he often has very long eyebrows in his pictures and images, the Chinese have come
    to know him popularly as the &quot;Ch'ang-mei-seng&quot; or &quot;Long-eyebrowed
    Monk.&quot; But Lohans with other names also have this characteristic in the fancy
    portraits which adorn temples and pictures.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the seventh century Pindola came to China and appeared
    to Tao-hsuan, the great Vinaya doctor and signified his approval of the work which that
    zealous monk had been doing. (10) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We find the name Pindola explained in Chinese com
    mentaries as meaning Pu-tung or Unmoved, but this cannot have been intended for a
    translation of the word. The Tibetans give &quot;Alms-receiver&quot; as the equivalent,
    connecting the name with pinda, but it may have been derived from the name of a place
    transcribed Pin-t'ou in Chinese. This was a town or village in the Kosala country in
    Buddha's time. In a far-back existence Pindola had been a bad son and a cruel man, and
    owing to his bad Karma he had to suffer in hell for a very long period. Here his food was
    &quot;tiles and stones,&quot; and even when he was born to be a pious arhat of wonderful
    powers, he retained a tendency to live on &quot;tiles and stones.&quot; (11) We cannot
    wonder that he was thin and ribbed.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some pictures and images represent Pindola sitting and
    holding a book in one hand and his alms-bowl in the other; others have him holding a book
    reverently in both hands; and sometimes we find him with an open book on one knee and a
    mendicant's staff at his side.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">2. Ka-no-ka-Fa-tso, Kanaka the Vatsa.</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This arhat is appointed to Kashmir with a retinue of 500
    other arhats. He was originally a disciple of Buddha, and it was said of him that he
    comprehended all systems good and bad. (12) The Tibetans, in their usual manner, have
    translated the name literally &quot;Gold calf.&quot;</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">3. Ka-no-ka-Po-li-tou-she, Karaka the Bharadvaja.</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This arhat's station is in the Purva-Videha region and he
    has 600 arhats under his authority. He is sometimes pictured as a very hairy old man, and
    some paintings give him a small disciple at his side.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">4. Su-p'in-t'e, Subhinda.</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">His sphere of action is the Kuru country in the north, and
    he has a retinue of 800 arhats. This name does not occur in several of the lists, but it
    is found in the temples in China, Korea, and Japan. Instead of it we find occasionally
    Nandimitra, and the new recension and the Tibetan give A-pi-ta, which may be for Abhida.
    The Tibetan translation of the name is inseparable or indissoluble, and this seems to
    point to an original like Abhinda or Abhida.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This arhat appears as a venerable sage with a scroll in
    his right hand, or as sitting in an attitude of meditation. He is also represented as
    sitting with an alms-bowl and an incense-vase beside him, holding a sacred book in the
    left hand, while with the right he &quot;cracks his fingers.&quot; This gesture is
    indicative of the rapidity with which he attained spiritual insight.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">5. No-ku-lo, Nakula.</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The sphere of this arhat's action is Jambudripa, that is,
    India, and his retinue is composed of 800 arhats.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This name is found in the Chinese, Korean, and Japanese
    temples, but in some lists instead of it we find Pa-ku-la or p'u-ku-lo, that is, Vakula.
    This was the name of one of Buddha's great disciples, often mentioned in the scriptures.
    Vakula became an arhat, but he led a solitary, self-contained life; he never had a
    disciple and he never preached a word. He was remarkable for his wonderful exemption from
    bodily ailments and for the great length of life to which he attained. When King Asoka
    visited his tope and showed his contempt for Vakula by offering a penny, the arhat was
    equal to the occasion and refused the coin. (l3) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We must, however, go by Yuan-chuang's text and read
    Nakula. This word means Mungoose, and we remember the arhat called Kundo-vahan or
    Mungoose-bearer already mentioned. We read also of a Nakula's father, in Pali.
    Nakula-pita, who became a devoted lay adherent of Buddha's teaching. Nakula was a Vrijjian
    resident at Uruvilva, but we do not find much about him in the scriptures. He may be the
    same person with Nakulapita converted when he was 120 years old, but made young and happy
    by Buddha's teaching. (14) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nakuls is often represented, as in the Tibetan picture,
    with a mungoose as his emblem, and sometimes instead of that animal he has a three-legged
    frog under his left arm. Sometimes he is represented as meditating or as teaching with a
    little boy by his side.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">6. Po-t'e-lo, Bhadra.</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This arhat was appointed to T'an-mo-lo-Chow, that is,
    Tamra-dvipa or Ceylon, and he was given a retinue of 900 other arhats. We sometimes find
    him called Tamra Bhadra, apparently from the name of his station.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Bhadra of the Buddhist scriptures was a cousin of the
    Buddha and one of his great disciples. He was a good preacher, and could expand in clear
    and simple language the Master's teaching. Hence he is often represented as expounding the
    contents of a book which he holds in one hand. He took his profession very seriously and
    aimed at spiritual perfection.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Bhadra often appears in pictures and images accompanied by
    a tiger which he soothes or restrains, but he is also represented without the tiger and in
    an attitude of worship.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">7. Ka-li-ka, Kalika or Kala.</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This arhat has 1,000 other arhats under him and resides in
    Seng-ka-t'a. This has been supposed to be Ceylon, but it is evidently the name of some
    other region. The Chinese characters may stand for Simhata, and something like this may
    have been the name of the &quot;Lion country &quot; in the Vrijjian territory already
    mentioned. (l5) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This arhat is apparently the great disciple called
    &quot;Lion King Kala&quot;, who attained arhatship and was honoured by King Bimbisara.
    (16) He is represented as studying a scroll or sitting in meditation, or holding a leaf of
    a tree, or he has extremely long eyebrows which he holds up from the ground.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">8. Fa-she-lo-fuh-to-lo, Vajraputra.</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He has 1,100 arhats and resides in the Po-la-na division
    of the world, that is, in Parna-dvipa perhaps.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In some temples and lists of the Lohan the name is given
    as Vajriputra. This may be the Vajjiput of the village of the same name who became a
    disciple and attained to arhatship. (17) He is represented as very hairy, or as very lean
    and ribbed.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">9. Shu-po-ka, Supaka perhaps.</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This arhat is stationed on the Gandhamadana mountain and
    has an establishment of 900 arhats. Instead of the character for Shu we find in some
    places Kie, that is Ka, making the name Kapaka, but this is evidently wrong. In the new
    transcription we have Kuo-pa-ka, that is, Gopaka. The Tibetans have the two Chinese
    transcriptions Kapaka and Supaka, but their translation is Sbed-byed, which requires the
    form Gopaka (or Gopa), meaning protector. We do not know of any disciple of Buddha named
    Supaka, but we read of one named Gopaka, a sthavira at Pataliputra.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The representations of this arhat often show him with a
    small figure of a saint above his right shoulder or close to his side, but he also appears
    with a book or a fan in his hand.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">10. Pan-t'o-ka, Panthaka or Pantha.</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This arhat's sphere is the Trayastrimsat Heaven, and he is
    attended by 1,300 arhats.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He is sometimes called simply Pantha or Panthaka, and
    sometimes Ta or Maha-Panthaka, Great Panthaka, to distinguish him from his young brother,
    who is No. 16 of this list. The name is explained as meaning way or road, or &quot;born on
    the road,&quot; and a legend relates how it was given to the two boys because their births
    occurred by the roadside while their mother was making journeys. (l8) But we find the name
    also explained as meaning &quot;continuing the way,&quot; that is, propagating Buddhism,
    and the Tibetan translation gives &quot;doctrine of the way&quot; as its signification.
    But this explanation belongs rather to the younger brother, who also is frequently styled
    simply Pantha or Panthaka. We occasionally find in books Pa (or Sa) -na-ka for Pan- thaka,
    apparently a copylst's error. Pantha is also found transcribed Pan-t'a, and for the second
    syllable we find t'u or t'e.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Panthaka was distinguished as among the highest of
    Buddha's disciples, who &quot; by thought aimed at excellence.&quot; (19) He was also
    expert in solving doubts and difficulties in doctrine for weaker vessels, and he had
    extraordinary magical powers. (20) He could pass through solids and shoot through the air,
    and cause fire and water to appear at pleasure. He could also reduce his own dimensions
    little by little until there was nothing left of him. (21) These magical powers were
    called into request by Buddha when he made his expedition to subdue and convert the fierce
    dragon-king Apalala. (22) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The various pictures and images represent Panthaka as
    sitting under a tree or teaching from an open book, or as holding a scroll, or as sitting
    in profound meditation with his arms folded. He is also frequently depieted in the act of
    charming a dragon into his alms-bowl.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This Panthaka is not to be confounded with the Upasaka of
    the same name who accompanied Mahinda in his mission for the conversion of Ceylon.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">11. Lo-hu-lo, Rahula.</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To Rahula was assigned the Priyangu-dvipa, a land of
    aromatic herbs, (23) and he had a suite of 1,100 arhats.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Rahula, the son of Buddha, was distinguished as a disciple
    for his diligent study of the canon and his uncompromising thorough strictness in carrying
    out the rules of his profession. He is often represented in pictures and images as having
    the large &quot;umbrella-shaped&quot; head, prominent eyes, and hooked nose which some
    books ascribe to him. But in many cases he is apparently represented without any
    distinctive features or attribute. It is his lot to die and return to this world as
    Buddha's son for several times, and he is not to pass finally out of existence for a very
    long time.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">12. Na-ka-si-na, Nagasena.</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This arhat was appointed to the Pan-tu-p'o or Pandava
    Mountain in Magadha, with a retinue of 1,200 arhats.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nagasena is, I think, the disciple called Seni in the
    &quot; Tseng-i-a-han-ching &quot; and the &quot;Fen-pie-kung-te- lun.&quot; In the former
    this bhikshu is selected for praise as an orthodox expounder of the principles or
    essentials of Buddhism. The latter treatise also calls him first in exposition. It adds
    that he was a bhikshu thirty years before he attained arhatship, because he made the
    laying down of dogma the one chief thing postponing to this release from sin, that he was
    skilled in analysis and the logical development of principles, and that he left a treatise
    embodying the results of his studies. (24) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now this Se-ni is, I think, the Nagasena who composed the 
    original work which was afterwards amplified into the &quot;Questions of Milinda.&quot; 
    In the &quot; Tsa-pao-tsang-ching &quot; We have this Nagasena, called also Se-na, a man 
    of commanding presence, proud and learned, subtle-minded and ready-witted, and he is put 
    through a severe ordeal by a king called Nan-t'e or Nanda. (25) Then these Nanda and 
    Nagasena are evidently the Min-lin-t'e and Nagasena of one translation of the '' 
    Abhidharma-kosa-vyakhya-Sastra '' and the Pi-lin-t'e and Lung-chun, Dragon-host of the 
    other translation. (26) They are also the Mi-lan and Na-hsien of the &quot; 
    Na-hsien-pi-chiu-ching &quot; (27) and the Milinda and Nagasena of the &quot; Questions of 
    Milinda.&quot; (28) </font></p> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This Nagasena was, or was taken to be, a contemporary of
    the Buddha and Sariputra, although he is also supposed to be living long after Buddha's
    time. He is called arhat by the author of the introduction to the &quot;Questions,&quot;
    but in the body of the book he is not an arhat. In this treatise he defends against his
    cross-examiner the unity and consistency of Buddha's teachings, and explains and expands
    hard doctrines with great learning and richness of illustration. He became the head of the
    Church in Milinda's country to watch over and maintain Buddhist orthodoxy. His treatise
    must have existed in various lands and in different forms from a comparatively early
    period. The &quot; Abhidharma-kosa-sastra &quot; and the &quot; Tsa-pao-tsang-ching &quot;
    quote from a text which is neither the &quot;Na-hsien-pi-chiuching&quot; nor the
    &quot;Questions,&quot; and these two last differ very much.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">13. Yin-kie-t'e, Angida.</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This arhat's station is the mountain called Kuaug-hsie or
    Broad-side, that is, Vipulaparsva, and he has a retinue of 1,300 arhats. In one place I
    have seen Mu instead of Yin, and the Tibetans have Angija, but all other tran- scriptions
    are apparently either Angida, or Angila.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of Buddha's great disciples was named Angaja, and he
    was noted for the cleanness and fragrance of his body. (29) Another great disciple was
    Angila, who was described as being perfect in all things. (30) These two names may
    possibly indicate only one person.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Lohan called Angida is sometimes the fat, jolly
    creature who is supposed to be Maitreya or his incarnation. Other pictures or images make
    him a lean old monk with a staff and a book containing Indian writing. This latter is the
    old traditional representation handed down from the period of the T'ang dynasty.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">14. Fa-na-p'o-ssu, Vanavasa.</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A Korean temple has Fa-lo-p'o-ssu, giving Varavasa, but
    all the other transcriptions seem to have Vanavasa.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This arhat, who has a retinue of 1,400 other arhats, is
    stationed on the K'o-chu or Habitable Mountain. He is sometimes represented sitting in a
    cave meditating with eyes closed, or his hands make a mudra, or he nurses his right knee.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">15. A-shih-to, Asita or Ajita.</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These characters do not represent Yuan-chuang's ordinary
    transcription either for Asita or Ajita, and it is probable that here he adopted the
    transcription of a predecessor. The new authorized reading gives Ajita, and it is so in
    the Tibetan. But Ajita is Maitreya, and that Bodhisattva, according to all accounts,
    remains in Tushita Paradise until the time comes for him to become incarnate on this
    earth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So he cannot properly be a guardian of Sakyamuni's system,
    which must have passed away before he can become Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This arhat, whom we may call Asita, resides on the
    Gridhrakuta Mountain, and has 1,500 arhats in his suite. It cannot be that he is the old
    seer Asita who came from his distant home to see the newly-born infant who was to become
    Buddha. The images and pictures generally represent the arhat as an old man with very long
    eyebrows, nursing his right knee or absorbed in meditation.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">16. Chu-ch'a, (t'a) -Pan-t'o-ka, Chota-Panthaka.</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first part of the name is also given as Chou-li or
    Chu-li. These transcriptions stand for the Sanskrit Kshulla and Pali Chulla (or Chula),
    and Chota is a dialectic form still preserved in the vernacular. The words mean little,
    small, and this Panthaka received the above name in order to distinguish him from his
    elder brother already noticed. He is also called Hsiao-lu or Little Road, the elder
    brother being Ta-lu or Great Road.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Chota-Panthaka has a household of 1,600 arhats, and his
    station is the Ishadhara Mountain, a part of the great range of Sumeru. As a disciple
    Little Pantha was at first and for a long time exceedingly dull and stupid, the result of
    bad Karma. He could not make any progress in the spiritual life, being unable to apply his
    mind or commit to memory even one stanza of doctrine. (31) He was accordingly slighted by
    the Brethren and their lay patrons, but the Master always had pity and patience. On one
    occasion the King invited Buddha and the disciples to breakfast, but Little Pantha was
    excluded. When Buddha discovered this he refused to sit down to breakfast until the
    despised disciple was bidden to the feast. (32) And when Little Pantha was expelled by his
    elder brother as being incorrigibly dull and stupid, Buddha brought him back and would not
    allow him to be expelled. He comforted the sorrowing disciple and gave him the words
    &quot;Sweeping broom&quot; to repeat and keep in mind. In the effort to do so the
    intellectual faculties of the poor dullard were stimulated, and he came to see that the
    two words meant that all attachment to things of this world was defilement and to be swept
    away by the broom of Buddha's doctrine. (33) Having entered on the good way he went on
    towards perfection, and became noted as one of the first disciples in &quot;mental aiming
    at excellence&quot;; he was chiefly occupied with the mind and mental contemplation. (34)
    By his determined perseverance he attained a thorough insight into religious truths, and
    expounded these with such power and eloquence that even giddy nuns, who came to laugh and
    mock, remained to be impressed and edified. (35) In process of time Little Pantha attained
    arhatship, with the powers of flying through the air and of assuming any form at pleasure.
    He had also other miraculous powers, and on one occasion he produced 500 strange oxen and
    proceeded to ride one of them. (36) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This arhat is sometimes pictured as an old man sitting
    under and leaning against a dead tree, one hand having a fan and the other held up in the
    attitude of teaching. He is also represented as a venerable sage sitting on a mat-covered
    seat and holding a long staff surmounted by a hare's head.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">17 and 18. </font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There does not seem to be any historical account of the
    first introduction of the Lohan into the Halls of Buddhist temples, nor can it be
    ascertained when the number of these guardians was raised from sixteen to eighteen in
    Chinese temples. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In some of these, down to the present time, the number of
    the Lohan is still sixteen, e.g. in the Pao-ning-ssu, near Mount Omi, visited by Mr.
    Baber. (37) Some Chinese have supposed that there were formerly eighteen gods regarded as
    protectors of Buddhist temples, and that the Lohan took their places. But we know nothing
    about these gods, and the supposition need not be taken into consideration. Another
    suggestion, and one which seems not improbable, is that the Buddhists in this matter
    imitated a certain Chinese institution. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we read the history of the reigns of T'ang Kao Tsu
    and T'ai Tsung, we find the record of an event which may have given the idea of grouping
    the Lohan in the Chief Hall of a temple and of raising their number to eighteen. In the
    year 621 T'ai Tsung instituted within the palace grounds a very select college composed of
    eighteen members. These dons were officials of high standing, of sound learning and good
    literary attainments, and faithful adherents and personal friends of the founder. Among
    them were such famous men as Tu Ju-mei and his friend Fang Hsuan-ling; Yu Chi-ming,
    learned scholar and loyal statesman, who wrote the preface to Yuan-chuang's &quot;
    Hsiyu-chi &quot;; Lu Te-ming, and K'ung Ying-ta. The members took their turns in batches
    of three in attending on duty, and while in the college they were liable to be visited and
    interrogated by the emperor. He had portraits of the members made for the college, and
    each portrait was furnished with a statement of the name, birthplace, and honours of the
    original. The merits of each were described in ornate verse by one of the number, Chu
    Liang. These favoured men were called the Shih-pa-hsue-shih or Eighteen Cabinet Ministers,
    and they were popularly said to have teng-ying-chou, to have become Immortals. It is this
    Hall of the Eighteen which I think may have led to the installation of the Eighteen Arhats
    in Buddha's Hall. The names of these venerable ones are given, and sometimes their
    stations and retinues are added. There are also temples in which the Lohan are arranged in
    groups of three.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But these Eighteen Lohan have never received authoritative 
    recognition, and they are not given even in the modern accepted Buddhist treatises. We 
    find them, however, occasionally in modern Chinese works of art. The South Kensington 
    Museum has a pair of bowls on which they are painted, and the British Museum has them on 
    an incense-vase. This vase is remarkable for departing so far from the established 
    doctrine of the Lohan as to represent three of the eighteen as boys or very young men. The 
    modern Chinese artist, followed by the Japanese, apparently takes the Lohan to be 
    Immortals, and he shows them crossing to the Happy Land of Nirvana or leading lives of 
    unending bliss among the pines of the misty mountain-tops.</font></p> 
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As to the persons who should be admitted as guardian
    Lohans of Buddha and his religion, there has been a great diversity of opinion, and
    consequently different worthies have been added in different places. In many old temples
    we find the 17th and 18th places given respectively to Nandimitra and a second Pindola.
    This Nandimitra, in Chinese Ch'ing-yu, is the arhat already mentioned as describing the
    appointment and distribution of the Sixteen Arhats. As one of the additional Lohans we
    sometimes find the well-known Imperial patron of Buddhism, Liang Wu Ti (A.D. 502 to 550),
    or Kumarajiva, the great translator who flourished about A.D. 400.. In some temples we
    find Maitreya or his supposed incarnation the Pu-tai-ho shang, or Calico-bag (cushion)
    Monk. This monk is said to have lived in the sixth century A.D., but he was not honoured
    as a Lohan until modern times. He is the special patron of tobacco-sellers, and his jolly
    fat little image often adorns their shop-fronts. Another interesting person sometimes
    found among the Eighteen Lohan is the Indian Buddhist Dharmatara (or Dharmatrata), in
    Chinese Fa-Chiu. This is perhaps the Dharmatara who was a great master of Dhyana and
    learned author, and lived about the middle of the first century of our era probably. He is
    sometimes called a great Upasaka, and is represented as receiving or introducing the
    Sixteen (or Eighteen) Lohan. Writing about Lhassa the learned Mr. Chandra Das has the
    following: &quot;In the Na-chu Lha Khang Chapel erected by one of the Sakya Lamas named
    Wang Chhyug Tsondu, were the most remarkable statue-like images of the Sixteen Sthaviras
    called Natan Chudug, arranged to represent the scene of their reception by Upashaka Dharma
    Tala, one of the most celebrated and devout Buddhists of ancient China.&quot; (38) In
    Tibet the Sixteen Arhats are called Sthaviras, and &quot;Natan Chudug&quot; means Sixteen
    Sthaviras. Then &quot;Dharma Tala&quot; is for Dharmatara, who was Indian, not Chinese. He
    is also now one of the Eighteen Lohan in Tibet as in China. Another illustrious personage
    installed as one of these Lohan in many temples is Kuanyin P'usa. He appears as such in
    his capacity as Protector of Buddhism and Buddhists.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(1) The &quot; Chih-shih-tzu-kuo&quot; of this sutra and
    the &quot; Shih-tzu-kuo&quot; of the &quot; TSeng-i-a-han-ching&quot; are probably the
    Simhadvipa of Schiefner's &quot; Tara- natha,&quot; S. 83. This last cannot be Ceylon, and
    the mention of the Lusthain. in it reminds us of the garden in the Shih-tzu-kuo. In the
    Sarvata Vinaya Yao-shih, ch. 8, we have mention of a Shih-tzu district which lay between
    Sravasti and Rajagriha.</font></p>
