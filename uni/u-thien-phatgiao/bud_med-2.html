      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">As the discourse 
      explains, the meditator reflects on this very body encased by the skin and 
      full of impurities from the soles up and from the hair of the head down 
      thinking thus: &quot;There are in this body, hair of the head, hair of the 
      body, nails, teeth, flesh, sinews, bones, etc. Thus he lives contemplating 
      foulness in this body.&quot;</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">This may not be a 
      subject of meditation quite agreeable to the Westerner. The young in the 
      East or West, in particular, do not like to regard the body as foul. 
      However, whether we like it or not, if we dispassionately review this 
      &quot;fathom-long body&quot; we will not see anything beautiful in it such 
      as pearls and gems, etc., but only a heap of repulsive parts. &quot;Beauty 
      is skin deep.&quot; Young or old it is good to understand the real nature 
      of this body, and the fact that we all confront <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">birth, 
      ageing </i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">and</span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> 
      death. </i>We live, love and laugh, yet our life is dark with ageing, 
      smothered with death, bound up with change, and these qualities are so 
      inherent in it -- even as greenness is to grass, and bitterness to quinine 
      that not all the magic and power of science can ever transform it.</font></p>

      </span></a></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">This view of life is 
      neither pessimistic nor optimistic, but realistic. Do not think that the 
      Buddhist outlook on life and the world is a gloomy one, and that the 
      Buddhist is in low spirits. Far from it, he smiles as he walks through 
      life.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">From the contemplation 
      of the body <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(kayanupassana) </i>let 
      us now proceed to contemplation of feelings or sensations <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(vedananupassana). 
      </i>In this meditation we are expected to become mindful of our feelings: 
      pleasant, unpleasant or neutral. When experiencing a pleasant feeling, the 
      meditator knows that it is a pleasant feeling because he is mindful of the 
      feeling. The same with regard to all other feelings. He tries to 
      experience each feeling as it really is.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Generally, people are 
      depressed when they are experiencing unpleasant feelings and are elated by 
      pleasant feelings. This mental exercise of mindfulness helps a man to 
      experience all feelings with a detached outlook, with equanimity and to 
      avoid becoming a slave to sensations. Through insight meditation <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">(vipassana) </i>he also learns to realize that there is only a feeling, 
      a sensation. That, too, is not lasting and there is no permanent entity or 
      &quot;self&quot; that feels.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The contemplation of 
      mind <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(cittanupassana), </i>which is 
      the third type of mindfulness, speaks to us of the importance of studying 
      our own mind, of being aware of our diverse thoughts. Thoughts in this 
      context are those of lust, hatred and delusion, which are the root causes 
      of all wrong doing, and their opposites that counteract those unwholesome 
      states of mind. Rather than thoughts of lust it concerns lust as a state 
      of mind <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(saragam cittam, etc.).</i></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The meditator tries to 
      know through mindfulness both the wholesome states of mind and the 
      unwholesome states of mind. He sees them without attachment or aversion. 
      This kind of dispassionate discernment of the mind makes a man understand 
      the real function of his mind, its real nature and behaviour. Those who 
      practise contemplation of the mind learn to control the mind.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">A feature of the modern 
      world is its superficiality. Modern man will object, but if he makes an 
      impartial introspection, he cannot deny this. Modern man does not pause to 
      think deeply. External appearance goes a great way with him. See the 
      extent to which modern man is influenced by advertisements and shopwindow 
      exhibitions. If these did not influence him, shopowners would not spend 
      the enormous sums they do on advertisements. Buddhist meditation has a 
      cure for this superficiality: <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">cittanupassana, 
      </i>mindfulness of thought or contemplation of mind.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Modern man does very 
      little independent thinking. He seldom forms his own views. The style of 
      dress he adopts, the brand of articles he buys, is decided for him by 
      advertisers. How easily he is moved by the shouting of slogans. Slogans 
      and political propaganda mould man's mind, and life tends to be 
      mechanical; man has become a puppet controlled by others.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Modern man has become 
      enmeshed in all sorts of ideas, views, opinions and ideologies both wise 
      and foolish. He is film-fed, television-minded, and radio-trained. Today 
      what is presented by the newspapers, radio, television, some novels and 
      pictures, by certain literature on sex, psychology and by sex-ridden films 
      tend to confuse man, and turn him from the path of rectitude and 
      understanding. But the man who practises mindfulness will be protected 
      from the subtle persuasive power of advertisement or the shouts of the 
      propagandists, or the dramatic effects of mass movements.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Another weakness of 
      modem man is his desire for change and for quick results. The absence of 
      calm in him is a great deficiency. Calm begets mental strength. Absence of 
      calm begets impatience and the impatient man is never satisfied. He always 
      wants something new and startling. He is disappointed if he takes up the 
      morning newspaper and finds no banner headlines.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Modem man craves for 
      variety. He craves for sensations, he is fed on sensations. He continually 
      yearns for something fresh, for new methods, new machinery, new drugs, a 
      new way of life, a new ideology. There is no end to this. This modern 
      attitude is symptomatic of a disease -- <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">the 
      disease of mental unrest.</i></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Here again the practice 
      of mindfulness is the much needed cure. Mindfulness leads to calmness, and 
      calmness gives an even tone to one's life. Trained in calmness, he will 
      shed a host of unnecessary desires. He will &quot;walk through the uneven 
      with an even stride&quot; <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(visame 
      samam caranti). </i><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn2" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-style: italic" class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">The 
      contemplation of the mind also makes us realise that what we call mind is 
      only an ever-changing process consisting of changing mental factors and 
      that </span>there is no abiding entity called ego or self.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The fourth and the last 
      type of mindfulness is the contemplation of mental objects or mind 
      contents <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(dhammanupassana). </i>This 
      covers all the essential Dhamma, the teaching of the Buddha, most of which 
      are discussed in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Buddha's 
      Ancient Path </i>by the present writer.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The contemplation of 
      mental objects is not mere thinking or deliberation -- rather it goes hand 
      in hand with mindfulness in discerning mind objects as and when they arise 
      and cease <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(samudayavaya). </i>When, 
      for example, sense desire is present in him the meditator knows: 
      &quot;There is sense desire in me,&quot; or when sense desire is absent, 
      he knows: &quot;There is no sense desire in me,&quot; and so on. The same 
      with regard to the other hindrances <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(nivaramani).</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">In the same manner he

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">He discerns with 
      mindfulness the six internal and the six external sense-bases. Herein the

      </b>mind and mind objects, and knows well the fetter arising dependent on 
      both. He also knows the ceasing of the fetter.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Similarly he discerns 
      the seven factors of enlightenment <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

      Four Noble Truths in this context are not intellectual categories to be 
      cogitated upon, but palpable illustrations of them which the meditator 
      comes across and identifies.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">&quot;Thus 
      he lives mindfully investigating and understanding the</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">mental 
      objects. He lives independent, clinging to nothing in the world&quot;. The 
      fourfold mindfulness is a teaching (Dhamma) on which all aspects</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">of the Dhamma converge.</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The description of each type of 
      mindfulness in the discourse ends with the words: <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">&quot;He 
      lives independent clinging to nothing in the</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">world&quot;; 
      for &quot;everything when clung to fails.&quot;</i> <a style="mso-endnote-id:edn6" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>
      [6]<![endif]>
      </span></a>This is the result aimed at by the meditator to be achieved by 
      the earnest and ever zealous. &quot;Lives independent&quot; means aloof 
      from craving and wrong views <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(tanha, 
      ditthi). </i>Here &quot;world&quot; means the world of being, one's own 
      psycho-physical organism. He does not cling to this process of mind and 
      body and regard it as a permanent ego entity or self.</font></p>

      </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">It is because of our 
      greed, our craving, that we cling to people and things. If we can practise 
      the art of dealing with things with a detached outlook, then we learn to 
      let go. Our bonds are not in the sense organs or in sense objects. They 
      are due to our greed that arises when the sense organs come in contact 
      with sense objects. <a style="mso-endnote-id:edn7" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title><span style="mso-special-character:

      </span></a>So the problem and solution, the malady and the remedy, lie 
      within. Learn the art of giving up. It is hard to live clinging to nothing 
      in the world and our efforts to reach such spiritual heights may appear 
      impossible. Yet it is possible and worth striving for again and again; for 
      by dint of effort and hard work, many have attained those heights in this

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">In this connection it is

      </span></a>Let us listen to him:</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Using the simile 
      of a raft, monks, I teach the Dhamma designed for crossing over and not 
      for retaining. Listen and attend carefully to what I say.&quot;</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yes, Venerable 
      Sir,&quot; the monks replied. The Buddha continued:</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Monks, a man sets 
      out on a journey and comes to a vast stretch of water. The near bank is 
      beset with fears and dangers, the far bank is safe. But no boat goes to 
      the further shore and there is no bridge. He thinks: 'Vast, indeed, is 
      this stretch of water, the near bank is unsafe but the further one is 
      without danger. I had better collect grass, leaves, branches and wood to 
      make a raft and with its aid using my hands and feet, ferry myself across 
      to the further shore.'</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then, monks, that 
      man having made a raft crosses over safely to the further shore striving 
      with his hands and feet. Having crossed he thinks: 'This raft has been 
      very useful, for with its aid I have reached the further bank safely. I 
      had better carry it on my head or back and go wherever I want.' &quot;What 
      do you think, monks, if he does this is he acting rightly about the 
      raft?&quot; &quot;No, indeed, Lord.&quot;</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:0cm 7.2pt 28.8pt 36.0pt 72.0pt 100.8pt"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Suppose

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">'This raft has been very 
      useful, with its aid I have reached the further bank safely. I had better 
      beach it, or let it float down the vast stretch of water and go wherever I

      interesting to note that the word <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">&quot;dhamma&quot;

      <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

      </i>Clinging even to such high mental attainments as these should be given

      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">In the Satipatthana

      feelings, mind </i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">and </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">mental 
      objects. The</i> contemplation of the body makes us realise the true 
      nature of the body, without any pretence, by analysing it right down to 
      its ultimates, its fundamental elements. This mental scrutiny of our own 
      body helps us to understand that it is a process without any underlying 
      substance or core that may be taken as permanent and lasting.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">A special feature of 
      this all-important mental factor of mindfulness is that it involves a 
      method of looking at things objectively rather than subjectively. So it is 
      important to know the difference between objective and subjective looking. 
      The practice of all the four types of meditation on setting up of 
      mindfulness is done objectively without any subjective reaction. One 
      should not be an interested observer, but a bare observer, to practise 
      mindfulness. Then only can one see the object in its proper perspective, 
      as it really is, and not as it appears to be.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">When you observe a thing 
      subjectively, your mind gets involved in it, you tend to identify yourself 
      with it. You judge, evaluate, appraise and comment on it. Such subjective 
      looking colours your observation. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">So in the practice of the four types of mindfulness, that is,</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">mindfulness 
      of body, of feelings, of the mind, and of mental objects,</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">one 
      should contemplate it without any biases, prejudices, likes and</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dislikes 
      and other preconceived considerations and notions. In other</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">words, 
      mindfulness should be practised in an objective way as if you</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">are 
      observing the object from outside.</i></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">When &quot;contemplating

      or mental objects conceming your body, but only the body itself. In this 
      connection we should take to heart the precise and clear way the Buddha 
      taught Bahiya. Bahiya was the leader of a religious sect who assumed 
      himself to be an Arahat, a consummate one. But later, on the advice of 
      another, he went to the Buddha to learn the technique, the process, 
      whereby one can become an Arahat. Knowing that Bahiya was a man of 
      understanding, the Buddha taught him the technique in these words:</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&quot;Bahiya, thus 
      should you train yourself: </i><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><i>'</i>In 
      what is seen there</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">should be to 
      you only the seen; in the heard there should be only the</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

      <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">only what is sensed; in the 
      cognizing there should be only the</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">cognizing.' 
      &quot;</i></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Here the idea of &quot;I 
      am seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching and cognizing&quot; is 
      removed. The &quot;I&quot; concept, the ego-illusion, drops away. This 
      kind of attention removes tension, it calms and relaxes the mind, and that 
      is the reason why meditators do not need much sleep. Let alone deep 
      meditation, many do not know the art of seeing even a natural phenomena; 
      for they have not trained themselves in observing things objectively.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Suppose you are gazing 
      at a gorgeous sunset. If you start commenting, judging, and observing it 
      subjectively, then you are not seeing the sunset, you do not really see 
      its beauty.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">But if you view it 
      objectively with a calm and quiet mind, with complete attention, then you 
      will see the beauty of the sunset in all its fullness, and also that the 
      so called beauty is ephemeral, impermanent and ever changing. This applies 
      to many other things. If you can look at a rose or a lotus objectively 
      without any subjective reaction, then you will see. If you are a lover of 
      music and if you listen to music with undivided attention, you may enjoy 
      the music more than the musician does.</font></p>

      Concentration with the aid of wise attention subdues the second type of

      incapable of removing the latent tendencies. It is through wisdom, which 
      is insight, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">As we discussed earlier, 
      the starting point <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

      sila, </i>virtuous behaviour. Standing on the firm ground of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">sila, 
      </i>the meditator should endeavour to discipline the fickle mind. The 
      Buddha pointed out to his disciples ways and means of overcoming verbal 
      and physical ill behaviour. By taming his tongue, controlling his bodily 
      actions, and making himself pure in the way he earns his living, the 
      meditator establishes himself well in moral habits. While thus restraining 
      himself in word and deed, he tries to guard the doors of the senses; for 
      if he lacks control over his senses, unhealthy thoughts are bound to fill 
      his mind. He maintains his balance putting away all likes and dislikes. 
      This control of the senses he practises with zest. He eats moderately and 
      mindfully and is devoted to wakefulness.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Now if he is earnest and 
      mindful, he will advance without faltering and start the more difficult 
      task of meditation. Taking up a subject of meditation that suits his 
      temperament and continuing with it without stopping, he gains 
      concentrative calm by overcoming the hindrances which obstruct the 
      meditation. Thus the meditator who strives mindfully gains control over 
      his fickle mind. With his speech, actions and sense organs subjugated and 
      his mind under control, he has now gained self-mastery.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Thus training himself in 
      virtue and concentration <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

      all things as they really are <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(yathabh|tam). 
      </i>Viewing things as they really are implies, as we have discussed above, 
      seeing the transient, unsatisfactory and selfless nature of all 
      conditioned and component things. To such a meditative disciple of the 
      Buddha, the &quot;world&quot; is not the external or empirical world, but 
      the human body with its consciousness -- the world of the five aggregates 
      of clinging. It is this that he tries to understand as impermanent, 
      unsatisfactory and without self or ego entity. It is to this world of body 
      and mind that the Buddha referred when he said to Mogharaja: &quot;Ever 
      mindful, Mogharaja, see the world as void <i>(sunna)</i> –having given 
      up the notion of a self (underlying it) -- so may one overcome Mara

      It goes beyond the intellect, beyond theory, beyond conceptual 
      interpretation, to the actual experiencing of life itself.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Thus comprehending 
      things as they really are, thus realising the true nature of the five 
      aggregates of clinging, by washing out the impurities of his mind, he 
      &quot;lives independent, clinging to nothing in the world.&quot;</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The reader will note 
      that in this self-purification and self-mastery for final deliverance, 
      there is no coercion or compulsion by any external agency, there are no 
      rewards or punishments for deeds done or left undone. Deliverance from 
      mental taints lies absolutely and entirely in one's own hands, not in 
      someone else's -- be it human or divine. The door is free of all bolts and 
      bars except those that man himself has made. Not even a supreme Buddha can 
      deliver a man from the fetters of existence except by showing him the 
      path. The path is virtue, concentration and wisdom.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">All life's problems can 
      be reduced to one single problem, that of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dukkha,

      Buddhas or Enlightened Ones of all ages is the Noble Eightfold Path. The 
      efficiency of this path lies in the practice of it. The Buddha's 
      meditation path, which is the Noble Eightfold Path, still beckons the 
      weary pilgrim to the haven of Nibbana's security and peace. &quot;The 
      journey of a thousand miles begins with one step&quot; and as the old

      </i>because they are virtues to be extended towards all beings, without 
      exception, irrespective of race, caste, colour, community, creed, East or

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Subha-vimokkha

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Latent in the human mind 
      are defilements of diverse type, so it is natural for man to entertain 
      unwholesome thoughts. However, each and every defilement has its opposite 
      virtue; thus it is possible to develop a virtue to overcome and eliminate 
      a defilement. When developing the sublime states no living being is to be 
      excluded. These qualities make no distinction between man and man as high 
      and low, rich and poor, strong and weak, wise and unwise, dark and fair, 
      brahmin and candala, or as Christian, Hindu, Jew, Muslim, Buddhist, etc.; 
      for these sublime states, as we saw above, are boundless, and no sooner do 
      we try to keep men apart on the basis of false distinctions, than the 
      feeling of separateness creeps in and these boundless qualities become 
      limited, contrary to the high ideals they represent.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The 
      brahma-vihara </i>can also be taken as subjects of meditation, then they 
      are called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

      of the sublime states.&quot; By cultivating these positive virtues one can 
      maintain a calm and pure mind.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">When practising 
      meditation on the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">brahma-viharas, </i>it 
      is easier to start with oneself. For instance, when meditating on love, 
      proceed thus: &quot;May I be well, may I be happy; may I be free from 
      illness, may no harm come to me,&quot; and so forth. Then think of a 
      teacher, a friend, an indifferent person and lastly an enemy (if any, but 
      one should not create an enemy), and radiate thoughts of love towards 
      them. It may appear very difficult to extend love to an enemy, but this 
      difficult thing one has to do to remove discrimination. Love should be 
      extended to all without any compromising limitations.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">You may ask why love 
      should be radiated to oneself. Is it not selfish to do so? Seemingly it 
      may be, but by doing so it becomes easier to extend our love to others: 
      &quot;I like to be well and happy, so let other beings also be well and 
      happy.&quot; &quot;As I am so they are: as they are so am I,&quot; thus 
      comparing self with others cultivate love towards all. <a style="mso-endnote-id:

      sensual attachment or selfish affectionate desire <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(pema)

      </i>Carnal love when disguised as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">metta 
      </i>can do much harm to oneself and others. We have to be on our guard 
      against this masked enemy, sensuality and greedy possessiveness. If the 
      feeling of love is the direct result of attachment and clinging, then it 
      is not really <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">metta.</i></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">To love someone means to 
      develop an attachment to the loved one, and when the latter is equally 
      fond of you, a bond is created, but when you are separated or when the 
      dear one's affection towards you wanes, you become miserable and may even 
      behave foolishly. In his formulation of the Noble Truth of Suffering, the 
      Buddha says: &quot;Association with the unloved is suffering, separation 
      from the loved is suffering, not to get what one wants is suffering.&quot; 
      <i>Metta</i>, however, is a very pure sublime state which, like 
      quicksilver, cannot attach itself to anything.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">It is difficult to love 
      a person dispassionately, without clinging, without any idea of self, me 
      and mine; for in man the notion of &quot;I&quot; is dominant, and to love 
      without making any distinction between this and that, without barriers 
      between persons, to regard all as sisters and brothers with a boundless 
      heart, may appear to be almost impossible. But those who try even a little 
      will be rewarded; it is worthwhile.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Vicious thoughts of 
      animosity and hatred are most detrimental and harmful to those who harbour 
      them. When people are angry, they can behave very much as the other 
      animals do. They growl and bite, or cringe and fawn. This is due to man's 
      ignorance. This is as true on the personal as it is on the international 
      level.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Metta 
      </i>is the best antidote for anger in ourselves. It is the best medicine 
      for those who are angry with us. Let us extend love to all who need it 
      with a free and boundless heart. Love is the language of the heart, a 
      language that comes from the heart and goes to the heart. Love is a force 
      linking heart with heart to heal, and uniting us in true companionship. 
      Highly developed thoughts of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">metta </i>seem 
      to possess magnetic power. By radiating such sublime thoughts it is 
      possible to influence and win over people.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Through love one adds to 
      the fund of human happiness, one makes the world brighter, nobler and 
      purer and prepares it for the good life better than in any other way. 
      There is no ill-luck worse than hatred it is said, and no safety from 
      others' hostility greater than the heart of love, the heart in which hate 
      is dead. Love is an active force. Every act <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">of</span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> 
      metta </i>is done with the stainless mind to help, to succour, to cheer, 
      to make the paths of others easier, smoother, and more adapted to the 
      conquest of sorrow, the winning of the highest bliss.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The way to develop love 
      is through thinking out the evils of hate, and the advantages of non-hate; 
      through thinking out according to actuality, according to kamma, that

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Karuma

      encouraged wrangling, animosity and violence. Addressing the disciples he

      quarrels with me. An exponent of the Dhamma does not quarrel with anyone

      </span></a>The entire dispensation of the Buddha is permeated with this 
      sublime quality of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">karuma.</i></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Goodness and violence 
      cannot co-exist; goodness constructs while violence destroys. Compassion 
      cannot be cultivated by one who is obsessed with thoughts of selfishness. 
      It is the self-sacrificing man who fills his heart with pure thoughts of 
      pity and wishes to help and serve others. The selfish cannot be of real 
      service to others for their selfish motives prevent them from doing good. 
      No sooner do they become selfish and self-possessed than they fail to 
      soften their hearts. Hard-heartedness is overcome by pity, by sympathy. If 
      you remove compassion from the teachings of the Buddha, you remove the 
      heart of Buddhism; for all virtues, all goodness and righteousness have 
      compassion as their basis, as their matrix <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(karuma 
      nidhanam hi silam).</i></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">All the virtues <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(paramita) 
      </i>that a Bodhisatta, one bent on Enlightenment, cultivates are initiated 
      by compassion. Compassion is guided by wisdom and wisdom by compassion. 
      They go hand in hand, they are the backbone of Buddhism, the guiding 
      principles.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Compassion is surely not 
      a flabby state of mind. It is a strong enduring thing. When a person is in 
      distress, it is compassion that spurs us to action and incites us to 
      rescue the distressed. And this needs strength of mind.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">People are fascinated by 
      a study of the various types of machinery which science has invented. What 
      is urgently needed is a study of the machinery of the human mind. It is 
      this study that can help to clear the misunderstanding between man and 
      man.</font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Gladness at others' 
      success is the third sublime state, known as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">mudita. </i>It is not mere sympathy but sympathetic, altruistic or 
      appreciative joy. Its direct enemy is jealousy and the indirect enemy is 
      exhilaration. Jealousy is a vice that defiles our hearts and makes us 
      unhappy.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">When others are in 
      distress we show our compassion, we sympathize with them and try to 
      relieve them of their distress. But to appreciate another's success we 
      need sympathetic joy. It is this quality of the heart that makes us 
      rejoice over the success of others as we rejoice over our own. Jealous 
      people cannot feel happy when others are progressing, but they rejoice 
      over the failures and misfortunes of others. Some parents feel jealous 
      when others' children are doing well while their own are not successful. 
      This is meaningless, and bears unpleasant fruit.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Jealousy is a vice 
      shared by people of different walks of life -- intellectuals, politicians 
      and even men of large calibre. If that is so, need one speak of the poor 
      and the illiterate? However, at times, the latter are more co-operative 
      and unselfish.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Instead of entertaining 
      thoughts of jealousy, we should work hard with determination to surmount 
      obstacles and fulfil our hopes. Let us also bear in mind that our kamma, 
      or moral causation also has a role to play in our lives.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mudita 
      </i>is the congratulatory attitude of a person, it removes aversion. 
      Through meditation and the study of the vicissitudes of life, we can 
      cultivate this sublime virtue of appreciating others' happiness, welfare 
      and progress. When we learn to rejoice with the joy of others, our hearts 
      get purified, serene and lofty.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Seeing a starving man we 
      offer him food out of compassion <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

      and that he feels happy, then we too feel happy and pleased. Such selfless 
      action really brings us unalloyed joy, sympathetic joy <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">(mudita</i>). You will now see how these sublime states function 
      together supporting one another.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Times New Roman">IV- Equanimity <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(Upekkha)</i><o:p>

      </font></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The fourth and the last 
      sublime state is equanimity, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">upekkha. </i>It is &quot;even-mindedness,&quot; mental equipoise and not 
      hedonic indifference. Equanimity is the result of a calm concentrative 
      mind. The four sublime states are interrelated and interdependent, but it 
      is equanimity that guards the rest: love, compassion and sympathetic joy. 
      Equanimity is the most essential quality, deep and difficult to cultivate.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Life is not a bed of 
      roses. One needs much patience, energy and determination to cultivate 
      these qualities without being selfish or partial. Equanimity or balance of 
      mind guides the other three qualities and keeps the meditator in a place 
      of security. It brings about self-reliance.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">We are all confronted 
      with the eight vicissitudes of life <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">(attha</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">loka dhamma): </i>gain 
      and loss, good repute and ill repute, praise and censure, pain and 
      pleasure. It is hard to be undisturbed when touched by this welter of 
      experience. But the man who cultivates equanimity is not upset. He does 
      not waver. Amidst blame and praise, success and failure, he is firm as a 
      solid rock. This, of course, is the attitude of the Arahats, the 
      Consummate Ones. Of them it is said: &quot;Truly the good give up longing 
      for everything. They prattle not with thoughts of craving. Touched by pain 
      or happiness, the wise show neither elation nor depression. <a style="mso-endnote-id:edn25" href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">People of lesser 
      attainment who understand the nature of human life and its ups and downs, 
      who cultivate equanimity, can also face the vicissitudes of life with a 
      brave heart. They see things in their proper perspective, how things come 
      into being and pass away. Free from anxiety and restlessness, they can see 
      the fragility of the fragile. Quiet minds ... go on, in fortune or 
      misfortune, at <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">their</span><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

      </span></a></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The proximate cause of 
      equanimity is the understanding that all beings are the result of their 
      actions <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(kamma). </i>The direct 
      enemy of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">upekkha </i>is attachment 
      and the indirect or the masked enemy is callousness or unintelligent 
      indifference.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Understanding the 
      working of kamma, action or moral causation, and how kamma comes to 
      fruition <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(kamma-vipaka), </i>is very 
      necessary to cultivate equanimity. In the light of kamma one will be able 
      to keep a detached attitude toward all beings, even inanimate things.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Upekkha

      are two extremes. The meditator who follows the Middle Path is neither

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">&quot;Nivarama&quot; 
      </i>means those states which hinder and obstruct mental development. They 
      are called hindrances because they completely close <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in,</span><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> 
      </b>cut off and obstruct. They close the door to deliverance. What are the 
      five?</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:21.25pt"><font face="Times New Roman">1. 
      Sense desire <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(kamacchanda),<br>
      </i>2. Ill will <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(vyapada),<br>
      </i>3. Sloth and torpor <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(thina-middha),<br>
      </i>4. Restlessness and worry <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(uddhacca-kukkucca)<br>
      </i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">5</span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">.</i> Sceptical doubt <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(vicikiccha).</i></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">1. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Kamacchanda 
      </i>is lust for sense objects. Sensual thoughts definitely retard mental 
      development. They disturb the mind and hinder concentration. Sensuality is 
      due to non-restraint of the senses, which when unguarded gives rise to 
      thoughts of lust so that the mind-flux is defiled. Hence the need for the 
      meditator to be on his guard against this hindrance which closes the door 
      to deliverance.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:18.0pt"><font face="Times New Roman">2. 
      The next is ill will. As in the case of sense-desire, it is unwise and 
      unsystematic attention that brings about ill will. When not checked, ill 
      will propagates itself, saps the mind and clouds the vision. It distorts 
      the entire mind and thus hinders awakening to truth, blocks the path to 
      freedom. Lust and ill will, based on ignorance, not only hamper mental 
      growth, but act as the root cause of strife and dissension between man and 
      man and nation and nation.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:18.0pt"><font face="Times New Roman">3. 
      The third hindrance is sloth and torpor, a morbid state of the mind and 
      mental properties. It is not, as some are inclined to think, sluggishness 
      of the body; for even the Arahats, the Consummate Ones, who are free from 
      this ill, also experience bodily fatigue. This sloth and torpor, like 
      butter too stiff to spread, makes the mind rigid and inert. It thus 
      lessens the yogi's enthusiasm and earnestness for meditation so that he 
      becomes mentally sick and lazy. Laxity leads to greater slackness until 
      finally there arises a state of callous indifference.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">4. The fourth hindrance 
      is restlessness and worry, another disadvantage that makes progress 
      difficult. When the mind becomes restless like flustered bees in a shaken 
      hive, it cannot concentrate. This mental agitation prevents calmness and 
      blocks the upward path. Worry is just as harmful. When a man worries over 
      one thing and another, over things done or left undone, and over 
      misfortunes, he can never have peace of mind. All this bother and worry, 
      this fidgeting and unsteadiness of mind, prevent concentration. Hence 
      these two drawbacks, restlessness and worry, are included in the five 
      hindrances that retard mental progress.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">5</span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">.</i> 
      The fifth and the last hindrance is sceptical doubt. The Pali word &quot;<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">vi 
      + cikiccha&quot; </i>means literally &quot;without <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(vigata) 
      </i>medicine <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(cikiccha).&quot; </i>The 
      commentators explain this hindrance as the inability to decide anything 
      definitely; it includes doubt with regard to the possibility of attaining 
      the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">jhana, </i>mental absorption. 
      Perplexity is really a dire disease, and unless we shed our doubts, we 
      will continue to suffer from it. As long as we continue to take a 
      sceptical view of things, sitting on the fence, this will be most 
      detrimental to mental development.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The mind that is 
      obsessed by these five hindrances cannot concentrate successfully on any 
      object of a wholesome nature. It is true that a man can concentrate on an 
      object with thoughts of lust or ill will, etc.; but that is wrong 
      concentration <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(micchasamadhi). </i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">As</span> 
      long as impurities or passions <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(kilesa) 
      </i>exist in man, evil and unwholesome thoughts will continue to arise. 
      The meditator who practises <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">samadhi, 
      </i>however, is incapable of committing any evil; for the hindrances are 
      under control.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">To overcome the 
      hindrances, one has to develop five psychic factors known as factors of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">jhana 
      (jhana~ga). </i>They are: <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">vitakka,</i> 
      <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">vicara, piti, sukha, </i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">and</span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> 
      ekaggata. </i>It is these psychic factors that raise the meditator from 
      lower to higher levels of mental purity. The consciousness that is 
      associated with them becomes known as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">jhana. 
      </i>These psychic factors, in order, step by step, subdue the hindrances 
      that block the path of concentration. Each is the exact opposite of a 
      specific hindrance.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Sense desire is subdued 
      by <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ekaggata, </i>one-pointedness or

      from time to time. What five?</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:4.5pt 9.0pt"><font face="Times New Roman">1. 
      If through reflection on an object, evil, unwholesome thoughts associated 
      with desire, hate and delusion arise in a meditator, he should (in order 
      to get rid of them) reflect of another object which is wholesome. Then the 
      evil, unwholesome thoughts are removed; they disappear. By their removal 
      the mind stands firm and becomes calm, unified and concentrated within 
      (his subject of meditation).</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;As a skilled 
      carpenter or his apprentice knocks out and removes a coarse peg with a 
      fine one, so should the meditator get rid of that evil object by

      thoughts associated with desire, hate and delusion are removed, they 
      disappear. By their removal the mind stands firm ... within.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">2. &quot;If the evil 
      thoughts still arise in a meditator who reflects on another object which 
      is wholesome, he should consider the disadvantages of evil thoughts thus: 
      'Indeed, these thoughts of mine are unwholesome, blameworthy, and bring 
      painful consequences.' Then his evil thoughts are removed, they disappear. 
      By their removal the mind stands firm ... within.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">3. &quot;If the evil 
      thoughts still arise in a meditator who thinks over their disadvantages, 
      he should pay no attention to, and not reflect on those evil thoughts. 
      Then the evil thoughts are removed, they disappear. By their removal the 
      mind stands firm ... within.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">4. &quot;If the evil

      thoughts. Then the evil unwholesome thoughts are removed, they disappear. 
      By their removal the mind stands firm ... within.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">5. &quot;If the evil 
      thoughts still arise in a meditator who reflects on the removal of their 
      root, he should with clenched teeth, and tongue pressed against his palate 
      restrain, overcome and control the (evil) mind with the (good) mind. Then 
      the evil thoughts are removed, they disappear. By their removal the mind

        to the Theragatha</i>: &quot;He received a subject of study from the 
        Master, but was unable to concentrate, owing to his meeting people while 
        he stayed in Cool Wood. And he thought: &quot;My body is too delicately 
        reared to arrive happily at happiness. A recluse's duties involve bodily 
        fatigues.' So he disregarded the painful sores on his feet gotten from 
        pacing up and down, and strove his utmost but was unable to win. And he 
        thought: 'I am not able to create either path or fruit. Of what use is 
        this religious life to me? I will go back to lower things and work 
        merit. Then the Master discerned, and saved him by the lesson on the 
        Parable of the Lute, showing him how to temper energy with calm. Thus 
        corrected, he went to Vulture's Peak, and in due course won 
        Arahatship.&quot; <i>Psalms of the Brethen </i>by Mrs Rhys Davids (PTS)
