    </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Meditation forms the very 
    heart and core of the Buddha's teaching. As the subject is vast, this work 
    will discuss some aspects of Buddhist meditation with special reference to 
    Satipatthana, &quot;setting up or application of mindfulness.&quot;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The world today is not 
    what it was half a century ago. Ideas of good and bad are changing fast, 
    moral attitudes are in flux and the general outlook of people is very 
    different.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">We live <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in</span><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal"> </b>an age of rush and speed. Tension is everywhere. If you stand at 
    the corner of a busy street and scan the faces of the people hurrying 
    feverishly by, you will notice that most of them are restless. They carry 
    with them an atmosphere of stress. They are mostly pictures of rush and 
    worry. Rarely will you find a picture of calm, content and repose in any of 
    these faces. Such is the modern world.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Today's world is 
    characterised by inordinate haste leading to quick decisions and imprudent 
    actions. Some shout when they could speak in normal tone, others talk 
    excitedly at a forced pitch for long periods and finish a conversation 
    almost exhausted. Any kind of excitement is a stress in the physiologist's 
    sense of the word, and stress causes the speeding up of bodily processes. It 
    is not seldom that a person driving a vehicle gets agitated on seeing the 
    green colour of the traffic lights giving place to amber. The anxious man 
    regards even a minor event as if it were a crisis or a threat. As a result 
    man is worried and unhappy.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Another feature of the 
    modern world is its noisiness. &quot;Music hath charms,&quot; they say, but 
    for many today, even music is not agreeable if there is no noise; the louder 
    the noise, the greater is the music to them. Those who live in big cities 
    have no time to think of the noise, they are conditioned by it and 
    accustomed to it. This noise, stress and strain have done much damage by way 
    of ailments --heart diseases, cancer, ulcers, nervous tension and insomnia. 
    Many of our illnesses are caused by anxiety, nervous tension, economic 
    distress and emotional unrest -- all products of modem life.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Our nervous exhaustion is 
    increasing with the speeding up of our life. People often return home after 
    work with their nerves on edge. As a consequence their concentration is 
    weakened and mental and physical efficiency are lowered. Man becomes easily 
    irritated and is quick to find fault and pick a quarrel. He becomes morbidly 
    introspective and experiences aches and pains and suffers from hypertension 
    and sleeplessness. These symp-toms of nervous exhaustion clearly show that 
    modern man's mind and body require rest -- rest of a high quality.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Let us bear in mind that a 
    certain aloofness, a withdrawing of the mind from the busyness of life is a 
    requisite to mental hygiene. Whenever you get an opportunity, try to be away 
    from the town and engage yourself in quiet contemplation, call it yoga, 
    concentration or meditation. Learn to observe the silence. Silence does so 
    much good to us. It is quite wrong to imagine that they alone are powerful 
    who are noisy, garrulous and fussily busy. Silence is golden, and we must 
    speak only if we can improve on silence. The greatest creative energy works 
    in silence. Observing silence is important. We do that in our meditation. 
    Hear these words of the Buddha:</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When, disciples, you 
    have gathered together there are two things to be done: either talk about 
    the Dhamma (the doctrine, what is righteous) or observe noble silence.&quot;

    Value of Solitude</span></b><span style="color:maroon"><o:p>
    </o:p>      
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">People are so used to 
    noise and talk that they feel lonely and out of place if they do not speak. 
    But if we train ourselves in the art of cultivating silence, we will learn 
    to enjoy it.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:18.0pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Go 
    placidly amid the noise and haste and remember that there</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">is 
    peace in silence. We must take time off to go into retreat in</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">search of silence. We must, now and then, break away from motion to 
    remain motionless. It is a peaceful form of existence.</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">In lonely retreat we experience the value of silent contemplation.</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">We 
    make an inward journey. When we withdraw into silence, we</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">are 
    absolutely alone to see ourselves as we really are and then</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">we can learn to overcome the weaknesses and limitations in</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ordinary 
    experience.</i></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Time spent in secluded 
    contemplation is not wasted; it goes a long way to strengthen a man's 
    character. It is an asset to our daily work and progress if we can find the 
    time to cut ourselves off from routine and spend a day or two in quiet 
    contemplation. This is surely not escapism or living in idleness, but the 
    best way to strengthen our mind. This is beneficial introspection; for it is 
    by examining our thoughts and feeling that we can probe into the inner 
    meaning of things and discover the powers within.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Modern man is starved for 
    solitude. A little solitude every day, a little aloofness, a little cutting 
    away from the &quot;madding crowd,&quot; is very necessary to give balance 
    to the mind which is greatly upset by the rush and speed, din and turmoil, 
    clash and clang of modern life. It is in and through solitude that the human 
    mind gains in strength and power.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Modern man seeks happiness 
    outside himself instead of seeking it within. Thus he has brought the 
    external world under his sway. Science and technology seem to promise that 
    they can turn this world into a paradise. Today there is ceaseless work 
    going on in all directions to improve the outer world. Scientists pursue 
    their experi-ments with undiminished vigour and determination. Man's quest 
    to unravel the hidden secrets of nature continues unabated. Modern 
    discoveries and methods of communi-cation have produced startling results. 
    All these improve-ments, though they bring their rewards, are entirely 
    material and external. In spite of all this, man cannot yet control his 
    mind. Therefore, for all his scientific progress he remains discontent, 
    anxious and tense.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">People are searching for 
    solutions to their various problems in vain because their approach, their 
    method, is wrong. They think all problems can be solved externally. Most of 
    the problems, however, are internal. They spring from the world within, and 
    so the solution, too, is to be sought within.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Those interested in 
    protecting the environment have raised their voice against air, sea and land 
    pollution. But what of our mind pollution? Are we equally interested in 
    protecting and cleansing our minds? As the Buddha points out: &quot;For a 
    long time has man's mind been defiled by greed, hatred and delusion 
    (ignorance). Mental defilements make beings impure; mental cleansing 
    purifies them.&quot; <a style="mso-endnote-id:edn2" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title><span style="mso-special-character:
footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>
    [2]<![endif]>
    </span></a>The Buddhist way of life is an intense process of cleansing one's 
    action, speech, and thought. It is self-development and self-purification 
    resulting in self-realization. The emphasis is on practical results and not 
    on philosophical speculation or logical abstraction. Hence the need to 
    practise daily a little meditation, to behave like the hen on her eggs; for 
    we have been most of the time behaving like the squirrel in the revolving 
    cage.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Meditation is not a 
    practice of today or yesterday. From time immemorial people have been 
    practising meditation in diverse ways. Yogis, saints and enlightened ones of 
    all ages have gone on the path of meditation and have attributed all their 
    achievements to meditation. There never was, and never will be, any mental 
    development or mental purity without meditation. Meditation was the means by 
    which Siddhattha Gotama, the Buddha, gained supreme enlightenment.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Meditation is not only for 
    India or for the Buddha's time, but for all mankind -- for all times and 
    climes. The boundaries of race and religion, the frontiers of time and 
    space, are irrelevant to the practice of meditation.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">All religions teach some 
    kind of meditation or mental training for inner development. It may take the 
    form of silent prayer, reading individually or collectively from some holy 
    scriptures, or concentrating on some sacred object, person or idea. And it 
    is believed that these mental exercises, at times, result in seeing visions 
    of saints or holy men, engaging <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in</span><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> 
    </b>conversation with them, or hearing voices, or some mysterious 
    occurrences. Whether they are illusions, imaginations, hallucinations, mere 
    projections of the subconscious mind or real phenomena, one cannot say with 
    certainty. Mind is an invisible force capable of producing all these 
    phenomena.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Trance is carried so 
    far by certain yogis and mystics that it becomes anaesthetic, and they do 
    not feel anything.&quot;<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn3" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>
    [3]<![endif]>
    </span></a>We have seen people in &quot;meditation&quot; postures who have 
    fallen into a kind of coma and seem to be lost in thought. Others witnessing 
    such occurrences wrongly think that this is a kind of meditation <i>(bhavana).<o:p>
    </o:p>      
    </i></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhist books tell us 
    that through meditative absorption <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">(jhana),</i> through the development of mental faculties, man is capable 
    of gaining psychic powers. But it is very important to bear in mind that the 
    Buddhist <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">jhana </i>is not a state of 
    auto-hypnosis, coma or unconsciousness. It is a state of mental purity where 
    disturbing passions and impulses are subdued and calmed down so that the 
    mind becomes unified and collected and enters into a state of clear 
    consciousness and mindfulness.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">It is interesting to 
    observe that these phenomena have gained some acceptance through recent 
    research in parapsychology. Interest in the subject of extra-sensory 
    perception, in experimental psychology, is slowly gaining ground and the 
    results obtained seem to be beyond ordinary comprehension. These are, 
    however, only side-products which are of minor significance when compared 
    with man's final deliverance, his release from bonds, from mental fetters. 
    At times these paranormal happenings may even act as fetters and retard 
    realization and enlightenment.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The meditation taught in 
    Buddhism is neither for gaining union with any supreme being, nor for 
    bringing about mystical experiences, nor for any self-hypnosis. It is for 
    gaining tranquillity of mind <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(samatha) 
    </i>and insight <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(vipassana), </i>for 
    the sole purpose of attaining unshakable deliverance of the mind <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(akuppa 
    ceto vimutti) -- </i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">that supreme 
    security from bondage attainable through the total</span> extirpation of all 
    mental defilements. All may not be able to reach such heights as unshakable 
    deliverance of the mind, but failure does not matter so long as we are 
    sincere and pure in our motives. Let us strive on, falter not. It<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> 
    </b>is worth striving again and again. Some day, if not in this life, we may 
    reach the summit that those who really strove have reached.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Even if we fail to attain 
    full enlightenment, we will surely be rewarded in our efforts. A fast-moving 
    society needs a little meditation to ease the stress and tension and to 
    withstand the vicissitudes of life. Through meditation we can overcome most 
    of our psychological or psychosomatic problems and anxiety disorders, 
    emotions and impulses, and gain mental calm and peace.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span style="color:maroon">Self-Mastery 
    and Drugs</span></b><span style="color:maroon"><o:p>
    </o:p>      
    </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha says: 
    &quot;Though one may conquer in battle a million men, yet he indeed is the 
    noblest victor who conquers himself.&quot;<a style="mso-endnote-id:
edn4" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>
    [4]<![endif]>
    </span></a>This is nothing other than self-mastery. <a style="mso-endnote-id:edn5" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>
    [5]<![endif]>
    </span></a>It means mastering our minds, or emotions, likes and dislikes and 
    so forth. Milton echoes the words of the Buddha when he says: &quot;The 
    command of one's self is the greatest empire a man can aspire unto, and 
    consequently, to be subject to our own passions is the most grievous 
    slavery.&quot;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:21.6pt"><font face="Times New Roman">Control 
    of the mind is the key to happiness. It is the force behind all true 
    achievement. The movements of a man void of control are purposeless. It is 
    due to lack of control that conflicts of diverse kinds arise in our mind. 
    And if conflicts are to be controlled, if not eliminated, we must give less 
    rein to our longings and inclinations and endeavour to live a life 
    self-governed and pure. Everyone is aware of the benefits of physical 
    training. However, we are not merely bodies, we also possess a mind which 
    needs training. Mind training or meditation is the key to self-mastery and 
    to that contentment which brings happiness.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Of all forces the force of 
    the mind is the most potent. It is a power by itself. To understand the real 
    nature of life, we have to explore the innermost recesses of our mind which 
    can only be accomplished by deep self-introspection based on purity of 
    conduct and meditation.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">From the Buddhist point of 
    view the mind or consciousness is the core of our existence. All our 
    psychological experiences, such as pain and pleasure, sorrow and happiness, 
    good and evil, life and death, are not caused by any external agency. They 
    are the result of our own thoughts and their resultant actions.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">In recent times people 
    have been busy examining and investigating psychic phenomena, the study of 
    which seems to reveal the hidden resources of the human mind. The urge in 
    man to seek spiritual guidance, his desire for inner development, is on the 
    increase. This is a good sign. Western interest in Indian thought, yoga and 
    meditation is increasing at an amazing rate. The reason is not far to seek. 
    There is a mounting feeling of restlessness among the people the world over. 
    This feeling is prevalent mostly among the youth. They want a quick remedy 
    for the turmoil of the materialistic world. They are in search of peace and 
    tranquillity.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The problem of youth finds 
    no solution in the dogmatic creeds of hereditary religion. The question of 
    the inner world remains unanswered. The value placed on the material aspects 
    of life which are taken so much for granted by modern man, seems so 
    superficial to the searching mind. The problems of the Western world are 
    basically psychological. Obviously material knowledge and scientific and 
    technogical know-how have not brought man the answer to world problems, to 
    man's problems. This type of knowledge has only led to the multiplication of 
    problems.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Young people who took to 
    narcotic drugs in the belief that it has the answer to their mental 
    frustration, are now turning to yogic discipline and meditation. Surely 
    narcotic drugs cannot do for us what true meditation can do. Drugs are no 
    substitute for true meditation in the search for a quiet mind. Drugs weaken 
    the mind rather than strengthen it.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The world is beset 
    by a new plague, a disease which is incurable for most of those it touches, 
    fatal for many, a pestilence which promises a flight into the world of 
    dreams away from a life which is allegedly devoid of purposes and value, a 
    disease which above all threatens the children of our technological age: 
    narcotics. Millions of young people are already infected with this disease, 
    thousands of them are condemned to an early death, hundreds of thousands are 
    addicted or psychologically dependent on the soft-drugs, such as hashish, 
    which cause brain damage, impair efficiency and lead to character 
    disintegration ...&quot; <a style="mso-endnote-id:edn6" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>

    </span></a></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">There is indisputable 
    evidence that meditation can produce physiological changes that may, in 
    turn, have beneficial psychological side-effects. Attempts have already been 
    made to measure these effects. Dr. Herbert Benson, who experimented with 
    meditation for nearly a decade, was mainly interested in finding out how 
    factors that are psychological in nature come to exert physical effects on 
    the heart, blood pressure and other aspects of the circulatory system and 
    its functions. His ideas and research are fully presented in his book, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The</i> 
    <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Relaxation Response. </i>Research done 
    at Harvard University, Cambridge, U.S.A. revealed that hundreds of youths 
    who took LSD and smoked marijuana abstained from using them after several 
    months of meditation.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn7" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>

    </o:p>      
    </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Meditation is not a 
    voluntary exile from life or something practised for the hereafter. 
    Meditation should be applied to the daily affairs of life, and its results 
    obtained here and now. It is not separated from the work-a-day life. It is 
    part and parcel of our life. This fact becomes clear when we study the 
    four-fold setting up, or application of mindfulness <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(satipatthana). 
    </i>When free from the rush of city life, from nagging preoccupation with 
    the world, we are not so liable to lose control. It is only in society that 
    it takes some effort to check such lapses. Any meditation we do is of 
    immense help in enabling us to face all this with calm. If we ignore 
    meditation, life lacks meaning, purpose and inspiration.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">There was a time when many 
    thought that meditation is only for the recluses, yogis and forest dwellers. 
    Things, however, have changed, and now there is a growing interest in 
    meditation. If by meditation is meant mental discipline or mind culture, it 
    goes without saying that all should cultivate meditation irrespective of 
    sex, colour, creed or any other division. Modern society is in danger of 
    being swamped by distractions and temptations which can only be controlled 
    if we undertake the dificult task of steadily training our minds.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">It is very difficult, 
    indeed, for people to turn away from accustomed modes of thought and 
    conduct, but meditation can help to ease the burden of chaotic cares in 
    life. The ultimate aim of Buddhist meditation is to gain full enlightenment, 
    self-mastery and complete mental health or Nibbana through the conquest of 
    mental defilements. But apart from this ultimate aim there are other 
    advantages and benefits that can be derived through meditation. It can 
    inspire us to discover our own intelligence, richness and natural dignity. 
    Meditation can also stimulate the latent powers of the mind, aid clear 
    thinking, deep understanding, mental balance and tranquillity. It is a 
    creative process which aims at converting the chaotic feelings and 
    unwholesome thoughts into mental harmony and purity. It is the most 
    meaningful therapy for the problems of modern life. When the mind is trained 
    through meditation, it can perceive things that are beyond the range of 
    normal senses. All these benefits can be obtained through meditation, not 
    all at once, but gradually, through systematic training and practice.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">In</span><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> 
    </b>addition, meditation has physical ramifications. Meditation can relax 
    the nerves, control or reduce <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">the </span>blood 
    pressure, make us zestful by stemming the dissipation of energy through 
    tensions, improve our health and keep us fit. The medical profession has 
    taken cognizance of the use of meditation as is shown by this article:</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;It has now been 
    proved that high blood pressure and other diseases connected with the heart 
    could easily be cured by Buddhist meditation. Dr. Buddhadasa Bodhina-yake, 
    Consultant Psychiatrist, Harley Hospital Essex, UK, and Postgraduate Tutor 
    of the British Medical Federation in charge of doctors' appointments in East 
    London, said that the British Cardiac Society had recently accepted the 
    curative effects of Buddhist meditation. Dr. Bodhinayake stated that over 
    68,000 British patients were now practising <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

    other meditation practices, this had an effect on both sides of the brain. 
    Thus it was capable of bringing the marvellous results on patients. He said

    the word <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">&quot;passana&quot; </i>to 
    see and the prefix <i>&quot;vi&quot;</i> denoting special, particular. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Vipassana 
    </i>therefore means seeing beyond what is ordinary, clear vision. It is not 
    surface seeing or skimming, not seeing mere appearances, but seeing things 
    as they really are. This means seeing everything in terms of the three 
    characteristics, the signs of all phenomenal existence: impermanence, 
    suffering and egolessness <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(anicca,

    insight meditation, with calm concentration of mind as its basis, that

    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">This code of conduct <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(sila) 
    </i>is the stepping-stone to the Buddhist way of life. It is the basis for 
    mental development. One who is intent on meditation or concentration of mind 
    should develop a love of virtue that nourishes mental life and makes it 
    steady and calm. This searcher of the highest purity of the mind practises 
    the burning out of the passions.</font></p>

    gossip, but I will talk only words that promote concord, harmless words, 
    agreeable to the ear, full of love, heart pleasing, courteous, worthy of 
    being born in mind, timely, fit and to the point; others may be covetous, I 
    will not covet; others may mentally lay hold of things awry, but I will lay 
    mental hold of things fully aright. Energetic, steeped in lowliness of

    </i>or the code of conduct set forth by the Buddha, therefore, is not a set 
    of mere negative prohibitions but an affirmation of doing good -- a career 
    paved with good intentions for the welfare and happiness of mankind. These 
    moral principles aim at making society secure by promoting unity, harmony 
    and mutual understanding among people.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Virtue aids the 
    cultivation of concentration <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(samadhi). 
    </i>The last three factors of the Noble Eightfold Path, namely: right 
    effort, right mindfulness and right concentration, form the concentration 
    group. This is called training in concentration <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(samadhi-sikkha). 
    </i>Progressing in virtue the meditator practises mental culture. Seated in 
    cloister cell, or at the foot of a tree, or under the open sky, or in some 
    other suitable place, he fixes his mind on a subject of meditation and by 
    unceasing effort washes out the impurities of his mind and gradually gains 
    mental absorption by abandoning the hindrances.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">High concentration is the 
    means to the acquisition of wisdom or insight. Wisdom consists of right 
    understanding and right thought, the first two factors of the path. This is 
    called training in wisdom <i>(panna-</i><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">sikkha). </i>Thus the path is virtue, concentration and wisdom which are 
    referred to in the discourses of the Buddha as the threefold training <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(tividha-sikkha). 
    </i>None of them, however, is an end in itself, each is a means to an end. 
    One cannot function independently of the others. As in the case of a tripod, 
    which falls to the ground if even a single leg gives way, so here, one 
    cannot function without the support of the others. These three go together 
    supporting each other. Virtue strengthens concentration. Concentration in 
    its turn promotes wisdom, and wisdom helps us to get rid of the clouded view 
    of things -- to see life as it really is, that is to see life and all things 
    pertaining to life as arising and passing <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(udaya-vaya).

    that is imperishable, the happiness of stillness, of relief and perfect 
    peace, immeasurably deep and pure, which can be overturned by nothing and by 
    none, the highest truth. That is the very crown of the meditative life; it 
    is its greatest fruit. With the attainment of that fruit all birth, old age 
    and death are brought to an end, the pure life of holiness is lived out, all 
    that must be done, is done, and the world holds nothing more for him. This, 
    in short, is the way by which the meditator by gradual training attains his 
    goal. Thus we see that virtue, concentration and wisdom are not isolated 
    qualities but integral parts of the Noble Eightfold Path which is also the 
    path of meditation already outlined.</font></p>

    </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Now let us proceed to the 
    special procedure attached to the practice of meditation, to discuss one 
    very important aspect of Buddhist meditation, namely, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">satipatthana, 
    </i>the &quot;setting up, the application of, mindfulness.&quot; The word <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">&quot;patthana,&quot; 
    </i>the shortened form of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">&quot;upatthana,&quot; 
    </i>means literally &quot;placing near (one's mind),&quot; that is, 
    remaining aware, setting up, establishing, applying or arousing. To raise up 
    the person to a keen sense of awareness in regard to an object, and to bring 
    into play, call forth, and stir up the controlling faculty, the power, the 
    enlightenment factor, and the way factor of mindfulness -- this is the 
    setting up of mindfulness.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The Discourse on the 
    Setting up of Mindfulness (Satipatthana Sutta), is one of the most important 
    discourses delivered by the Buddha. It occurs twice in the Buddhist Canon.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn18" href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title><span style="mso-special-character:
footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>
    [18]<![endif]>
    </span></a>The opening lines of the discourse clearly state: <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Satipatthana 
    is the one and only way</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(ekayano 
    maggo) for the purification of beings, for the surmounting</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">of 
    sorrow and lamentation, for the abandoning of pain and grief, for</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">reaching 
    the right path and realising Nibbana.</i></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The setting up of 
    mindfulness is fourfold: Application of mindfulness in regard to: 1. the 
    body <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(kayanu-passana); </i>2. feeling 
    or sen<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">sations (vedana-nupassana); </i>3. 
    activities of the mind <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(cittanupassana);</i> 
    and 4. mental objects or mental contents <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(dhammanupassana). 
    </i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">The</span> essental thing here 
    is mindfulness <i>(sati)</i>, attention or observation <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">(anupassana).</i></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">As mentioned above, 
    concentrative calm is fulfilled by the conjunction of the last three factors 
    of the Noble Eightfold Path, namely: right effort, right mindfulness and 
    right concentration. These form the three strands of the rope; they are 
    intertwined and interrelated. Mindfulness, however, is considered as the 
    strongest strand for it plays an important role in the acquisition of both 
    calm and insight. Mindfulness is a certain function of the mind, and 
    therefore, a mental factor. Without this all-important factor of mindfulness 
    one cannot recognize sense objects, one cannot be fully aware of one's 
    behaviour. It is called right mindfulness because it avoids misdirected 
    attention and prevents the mind from paying attention to things unwholesome, 
    and guides its possessor on the right path to purity and freedom.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Right mindfulness sharpens 
    the power of observation and assists right thinking and right understanding. 
    Orderly thinking and reflection is conditioned by man's right mindfulness. 
    The discourse states clearly how a meditator becomes aware of his thoughts, 
    mindfully watching each and every one of them, be they good or evil, 
    salutary or otherwise. The earnest student will note that even reading the 
    discourse makes him watchful, earnest and serious-minded. Right mindfulness 
    is a quality that no sensible man would treat with contempt. Truly it is 
    essential to cultivate mindfulness in this confused age when so many people 
    suffer from mental imbalance.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Right mindfulness is 
    instrumental not only in bringing concentrative calm, but in promoting right 
    understanding and right living. It is an essential factor in all our 
    actions, both worldly and spiritual. Now we see that meditation is not 
    escapism, running away from life and society, not a voluntary exile from 
    life, but the ideal form of life itself.</font></p>

    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:7.2pt 28.8pt"><font face="Times New Roman">It 
    is only when we sit down for meditation that we can analyse ourselves 
    seriously without pretence. Then the concept of a self or ego disappears. We 
    see only a conflux of mind and body void of any permanent entity, any core 
    or an indestructible ego. Looked at from this point of view, we are neither 
    oriental nor occidental, neither man nor woman.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:7.2pt 28.8pt"><font face="Times New Roman">Life 
    is just a process that goes beyond the boundaries of caste, colour, creed, 
    race and space.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">So try to be straight, 
    transparently straight with yourself, your feelings and thoughts. Try to see 
    yourself as you really are and not as you appear to be. This cannot be done 
    unless you are sincere and have confidence in yourself. Open-mindedness or 
    free inquiry is a necessity in the Buddhist system of meditation. Without it 
    the beginner cannot lay the foundation on which the superstructure has to be 
    built. And as truth is a personal and individual concern, neither 
    information nor instruction can inspire a meditator unless he is trained in 
    the methods of self-inquiry.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Meditation, therefore, is 
    vital because it is through meditation that the secrets of the mind can be 
    unlocked.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The discourse on 
    mindfulness prescribes the technique for mental culture. It shows us how to 
    get beyond the intellect to the actual experience of life itself, to 
    discover the deeper universal maladies of the human mind and to work for its 
    deliverance -- supreme security from bondage.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Now let us proceed with 
    the discussion of the contemplation of the body <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(kayanupassana), 
    </i>especially the method known as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">anapanasati 
    </i>or mindfulness of in-breathing and out-breathing. This is a well-known 
    meditation liked and practised by many the world over, a universally 
    applicable method for concentrating and calming the mind. It was used by the 
    Bodhisatta, Siddhattha Gotama, when striving for enlightenment under the 
    Bodhi tree, and the Buddha himself was emphatic on the importance of 
    practising it. This meditation is described as peaceful, sublime, 
    unadulterated, happy living <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(santo 
    ceva panito ca asecanako ca sukho ca viharo) </i><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn19" href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-style: italic" class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>

    </span></a>. It <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

    </i>is not a &quot;breathing exercise&quot; for physical vigour and is not 
    similar to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">pranayama </i>taught in 
    Hindu yoga systems.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The type of place 
    recommended for this meditation is a forest, the foot of a tree, or a lonely 
    place either under the open sky or in<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

    from the din and bustle, clash and clang of busy life. Your own bedroom or 
    your &quot;shrine room,&quot; if you are fortunate to have one, may be a 
    more private place for you.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:0cm 21.6pt 36.0pt 72.0pt 108.0pt 144.0pt 180.0pt 1440.0pt"><font face="Times New Roman">For 
    this meditation one needs the sitting posture. Sit erect with legs crossed, 
    but not stiff and rigid; be mindful and alert. You may sometimes feel 
    uncomfortable if the legs are interlocked, or if sitting on the hard floor 
    interferes with your concentration. Then you can adopt a posture that does 
    not bring discomfort. You may sit on a chair with a straight back, but for 
    this particular meditation, unlike the others, the body (spinal column) and 
    head should be erect, balanced and upright. You should sit comfortably but 
    without leaning or lying back, otherwise you may become sleepy. Hands may be 
    relaxed on the lap, or the right palm may placed on the left, palm facing 
    up. Eyes may be half-closed, or shut, without strain, lips should be closed, 
    the tongue touching the upper palate. All these indicate that a person bent 
    on this meditation should also have his body collected, which is an asset to 
    his mental concentration and mindfulness.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Keep the body as 
    motionless as possible, the mind alert and keenly observant. Body and mind 
    alike must be as well strung as a bow, and as well-tuned as a lyre. 
    Meditation is really a practical occupation. Just as the tortoise shelters 
    its limbs under its shell, so should the meditator guard his five sense 
    organs and overcome the sex impulse with mindfulness. He should preserve all 
    his energy to gain mental development. Try to do your meditation regularly. 
    If possible, at the same time, every day; for these psychological factors 
    make for the success of the meditation.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:21.6pt"><font face="Times New Roman">The 
    in-breathing and out-breathing, we know, is automatic. Normally no one tries 
    to breathe consciously, or mindfully but when practising breathing 
    meditation it is essential to breathe mindfully and to be aware of the 
    breath. The normal flow of breath should be noticed, observed. Breathing 
    calms down the body and prepares it for deep meditation. What is aimed at is 
    the power of concentration. Psychologists have recognized the value and 
    importance of mindful breathing as tending to ease the tension of body and 
    mind. This meditation is, therefore, a really practical occupation, 
    therapeutic in the best sense of the word. It is not for mere intellectual 
    understanding but to liberate oneself from mental defilements and to attain 
    purity and peace of mind.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">In<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> 
    </b>this breathing meditation, the most important thing is to be mindful of 
    the breathing. It is essential to be mindful, to be aware <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(sati), 
    </i>and attentive and observant <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(anupassana) 
    </i>in all the four types of meditation on mindfulness. Relax utterly, leave 
    the world of stress when you sit down for meditation. When you do the first 
    three in-breathings, imagine that you are taking in all that is good and 
    pure in the environment, in the cosmos. When you do the first three 
    out-breathings imagine that you are putting out all the &quot;toxic&quot; 
    thoughts in you, all that is bad and ugly. That is how you should get into 
    the meditative frame of mind.</font></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Now start your meditation 
    on mindfulness of in and-out-breath<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">ing 
    </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">(anapanasati). </i>Your breathing should be very natural and effortless. 
    Breathe calmly. There should not be any effort to control the breath. Merely 
    allow the breath to ebb and flow freely in its own natural rhythm under the 
    light of full awareness.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The meditator breathes in 
    and breathes out mindfully with full awareness. He is mindful of the breath 
    and not of himself. His one and only aim is to focus the mind on the breath 
    to the exclusion of all other thoughts and to fix the mind there; for if 
    what is in the marginal zone breaks in upon the focal zone, he will find it 
    difficult to concentrate, he becomes discursive. It may be helpful for a 
    beginner to make note of &quot;in&quot; and &quot;out,&quot; when doing the 
    breathing meditation. If you experience difficulty in keeping your attention 
    on the breath, count &quot;one&quot; <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">for inspiration, &quot;two&quot; for</span><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

normal">, </i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">&quot;two&quot; at the 
    end of an expiration and so forth. Do not count to less than five </span>or 
    more than ten since your attention might divert from breaths to counts. Give 
    up counting when concentration can be focused on breath alone.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">When you practise 
    mindfulness on in-breathing and out-breathing, fix your attention at the 
    point where the moving air strokes the nostrils or the upper lip. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Note 
    your breath as it goes in and out, but do</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">not 
    follow the breath into your lungs or out into the air. There should</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">not 
    be any holding or stopping of your breath. </i>It should be quite natural 
    without any effort or force on your part. Keep your focus at the nose 
    breath. At times the breath may become so fine that you can hardly catch it. 
    You may no longer notice the breath, but that must not be taken to mean that 
    your mind is blank. This is just impossible; for you cannot think of a mind 
    void of thoughts. When you cannot notice the breath you are aware of this, 
    and that certainly is not a blank mind. You will become aware of the breath 
    again.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Whenever your mind wanders 
    to other thoughts, be aware of them, but do not get involved in them 
    emotionally or intellectually; do not comment, condemn, evaluate or appraise 
    them, but bring your attention back to the natural rhythm of your breathing. 
    Your mind may be over-whelmed by evil and unwholesome thoughts. This is to 
    be expected. It is in meditation that you understand how your mind works. 
    Become aware of both the good and evil, the ugly and beautiful, the 
    wholesome and unwholesome thoughts. Do not become elated with your good 
    thoughts and depressed with the bad. These thoughts come, and they go like 
    actors on a stage. When you hear sounds, become aware of them and bring your 
    attention back to your breath. The same with regard to smell, taste (which 
    you may get mentally), touch, pain, pleasure and so forth. Observe the 
    thoughts in a calm detached way. Mindfulness means observing whatever 
    happens inside oneself, whatever one does, not judging it as good or bad, 
    but just watching with naked awareness. It is really using full 
    concentration on whatever one is doing or experiencing.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">You may also get mental 
    images produced by memory or imagination, such as light, colour, figures, 
    etc. Do not be deceived by them thinking that this is a mental development. 
    Far from it, they are hindrances that retard progress. Become aware of these 
    images without getting mentally involved in them; bring your attention to 
    your breath. One needs much patience and effort to get away from these 
    by-products and to get busy with the real task of practising concentration. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">How 
    strong and stupendous should the mental effort</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">and

    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha really did not

    the Buddha, took refuge in him, and followed him who showed the path to 
    peace and enlightenment; the path is open to all. Occasionally he went into 
    long solitude.</font></p>

    Five Hindrances</span></b><span style="color:maroon"><o:p>
    </o:p>      
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">As you proceed developing 
    this mindfulness by degrees, your mind will get fully concentrated on the 
    breath. You will notice that there is only a breath and the mind noticing it 
    and nothing behind it -- no self or any permanent ego entity or anything of 
    that nature. The breath and you are not two things, only a process, a mere 
    rise and fall of the breath like the waves of the sea. In the highest sense 
    there is a meditation, but no meditator. If you can come to that level of 
    understanding, then your concentration is very high and with this comes 
    rapturous joy, calm and peace of mind, and this will be a tremendous 
    experience for you, a kind of experience you have never had before.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">This may be only for a 
    short while, and your mind may again become discursive. It may wander and 
    you may <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">find it diffcult to 
    concentrate. You may feel lazy or</span> sleepy, bored or restless, and get 
    fed up with your meditation. It does not matter, that is how the human mind 
    works. Now you know the behaviour of your mind through self- experience and <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">not</span><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal"> </b>through books or hearsay. You should whip up enthusiasm, marshal 
    energy and onward ever bravely press forgetting yourself. One day, you may 
    even attain <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">jhanic </i>experience or 
    meditative absorption by casting out the hindrances. This concentration, 
    this calming meditation <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(samatha-bhavana) 
    </i>is essential for right unders-tanding, penetration and insight <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(vipassana), 
    </i>to the attainment of complete mental health -- Nibbana.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">There are many obstacles 
    that confront a meditator, but there are five hindrances in particular that 
    obstruct concentration and the path to deliverance. They are called 
    hindrances <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(nivaramani)</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> 
    <a style="mso-endnote-id:edn25" href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>
    [25]<![endif]>
    </span></a></span>because they completely close in, cut off and obstruct. 
    They close the door to deliverance. What are the five? Sense desire, ill 
    will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and worry, sceptical doubt.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">A mind that is obsessed by 
    such detrimental forces cannot concentrate successfully on any object of 
    wholesome nature. Without right effort the five hindrances to mental 
    progress cannot be overcome. The function of right effort is fourfold: to 
    prevent, abandon, develop, and maintain. Right effort is the persevering 
    endeavour (a) to prevent the arising of evil unwholesome thoughts that have 
    not yet arisen in the mind; (b) to discard such evil thoughts already 
    arisen; (c) to produce wholesome thoughts not yet arisen; and (d) to promote 
    and maintain the good thoughts already present. <a style="mso-endnote-id:edn26" href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>
    [26]<![endif]>
    </span></a></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The unwholesome thoughts 
    referred to here are the three root causes of all evil, namely: thoughts of 
    greed (lust), hatred, and delusion (ignorance). All other defilements rally 
    round these root causes, while wholesome thoughts are their opposites.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The four right efforts are 
    the requisites for concentration. Right effort functions together and 
    simultaneously with the other two factors of the group, namely: right 
    mindfulness and right concentration. Right effort removes the evil and 
    unhealthy thoughts that act as a barrier to the calm of absorption and 
    promotes and maintains the healthy mental factors that aid the development 
    of concentration. When the meditator's mind slackens, it is time for him to 
    summon courage, whip up effort and overcome indolence. Obduracy of mind and 
    of mental factors is a dangerous enemy to meditation, for when a man's mind 
    is inert, slackness arises. This leads to greater slackness which produces 
    sullen indifference.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span style="color:maroon">Avoid 
    Extremes</span></b><span style="color:maroon"><o:p>
    </o:p>      
    </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Mind culture through such 
    great efforts is not something that can be gained overnight. It needs time 
    and regular practice of mental exercises. An athlete or body-builder does 
    not stop training after a day or two, but goes on with his program. Regular 
    exercises, without unnecessary strain, are the key to physical fitness. If 
    he practises only by fits and starts, he will never be a good athlete. When 
    training the mind, the same golden rule has to be applied -- regular work 
    and perseverence.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">One need not struggle with 
    evil thoughts when doing mental exercises. It should all be natural. If we 
    try to fight with thoughts we shall not succeed. Instead we should note and 
    watch our thoughts as they rise, and try to ease the tension. The technique 
    is like that of swimming. If you do not move your limbs, you will sink; if 
    you whirl about, you will also sink. Again, it is like trying to fall asleep 
    -- if you struggle with the thought of sleep, you will never fall off; it 
    will only be a mental torment to you. You must not make any effort to sleep. 
    It must come naturally, and you should only relax the tense muscles. So this 
    is, shall we say, an effortless effort to stay vigilant and be aware in the 
    present.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Again self-torment is one 
    of the two extremes (the other is self-indulgence) that the Buddha wants the 
    meditator to avoid as profitless, and not leading to calm and enlightenment <a style="mso-endnote-id:edn27" href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title><span style="mso-special-character:
footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>
    [27]<![endif]>
    </span></a>. It is useless to torture the body (as is still done by Indian 
    ascetics) in order to stop the arising of evil thoughts; for such torments 
    often end in aversion and frustration. When the mind is frustrated, callous 
    indif-ference to meditation follows. All our mental exercises should be 
    natural and performed with awareness. &quot;Zeal without prudence is like 
    running in the night.&quot;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">As the Buddha points out, 
    extremes should be avoided everywhere by those who wish to gain deliverance 
    of mind through enlightenment. They should keep to the Middle Path. In the 
    practice of right effort, too, one has to follow the same median way.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">A horseman, for instance, 
    watches the speed of his mount and whenever it goes faster than he wants, he 
    reins it back. On the other hand, whenever the horse shows signs of slowing 
    down, he spurs it<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> </b>on and thus 
    keeps to an even speed. Even so should one cultivate right effort, neither 
    overdoing it, lest one be flurried, nor becoming slack lest one become 
    slothful. Like the horseman one should always be prudent in one's effort.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">When the strings of the 
    lute are overstrung, or too slack, it is not in tune and not playable. If, 
    on the other hand, the strings are neither overstrung nor too slack, but 
    keyed to the middle pitch, then it is in tune and playable. Even so, effort 
    when too strenuous leads to flurry, and when too slack to indolence. <a style="mso-endnote-id:edn28" href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>

    compound word <i>&quot;</i><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">sati-sampajanna&quot;

    are co-operative. It is clear comprehension of one's activities and bodily 
    movements.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The meditator who is 
    mindful of his bodily activities becomes aware of his postures: when going

    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In walking to and

    mindfulness would mean taking up the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">kammatthana,</i> 
    immediately, even before one opens up one's eyes. The term can also apply to 
    such situations as (i) keeping awake mindfully (not allowing sleep to 
    overcome one) when one is intent on meditating in the sleeping posture (due 
    to illness or other physical disabilities), and (ii) on sleepless nights 
    when one vainly struggles to &quot;catch&quot; elusive sleep, mindfulness 
    and clear comprehension would help one to accept the situation with calmness 
    and understand the cause of insomnia. In that very calmness and 
    understanding, perhaps, sleep will come on its own.</font></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">One has to understand the 
    question of mindfulness and clear comprehension in a wider sense. Of course 
    the fourfold effort already mentioned is a good safeguard. Mindfulness has 
    to be spread over all situations at the outset so that its calmness helps 
    one to take stock of a situation wisely. But (as an aspect of the Middle 
    Path itself) <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">upon</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">occasion

    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The suttas tell us the 
    interesting story of the Thera Maha Phussa. Practising mindfulness he was 
    always watching his thoughts. If while walking an evil thought were to 
    occupy his mind, he would stop and would not proceed until the evil thought 
    had been got rid of. People who noticed this used to wonder whether he had 
    lost his way, or lost something on the way. Later, through constant practice 
    of mindfulness and clear comprehension, he achieved his wish, attained 
    purity of mind, and became an Arahat, a man without taints. This indicates 
    that the ancients were aware of their thoughts not only when seated in a 
    given posture at a particular time for meditation, but always.</font></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">If you do your sitting 
    meditation for a considerable time, you may need to ease your aching limbs. 
    Then you can start your walking meditation. Walk slowly, mindful of the 
    movements. Now you need not think of the breath but become aware of the 
    walk. If your mind wanders, give attention to your walking without getting 
    involved in other thoughts. If you stop, turn or look round, be mindful and 
    apply clear comprehension. When your foot touches the ground, you get a 
    sensation; become aware of it. Walking also is an exercise in mindfulness.</font></p>

    while in meditation, rub and stretch them. You can also relax in a lying

    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The practice of clear 
    comprehension regarding the postures of the body helps us to remove 
    discursive thoughts, improves our power of concentration and develops 
    awareness and heedfulness.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha gives a very 
    striking parable to emphasize the importance of developing mindfulness 
    relating to body:</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Suppose, monks, a 
    large crowd gathers together crying: 'Oh, the fairest girl, a country 
    beauty!' Then, monks, that most beautiful girl, expert in dancing and 
    singing, displays all her charms, and still a large crowd flocks together 
    crying, 'Oh, the fairest girl is dancing, she is singing. Then comes a man 
    fond of his life, not fond of death, in love with pleasure and not with 
    pain, and they say unto him: 'Look here, my man! Here is a bowl brimful of 
    oil. You should carry it between the multitude and the fairest girl. Right 
    on your heels comes a man with uplifted sword. If you were to spill a drop, 
    off goes your head!'</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Now what do you 
    think, monks? Would that man, not paying serious attention to that bowl of 
    oil, give his mind to things outside and become careless?&quot;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Surely not, 
    Venerable Sir.&quot;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Well, monks, this is 
    a parable I have made to make clear the meaning (what I have to say). This 
    is the meaning of it: The bowl brimful of oil, monks, is a term for 
    mindfulness relating to the body. Wherefore, monks, thus must you train 
    yourselves: 'Mindfulness relating to the body shall be cultivated by us, 
    shall be made much of, made a vehicle (of expression), established, made 
    effective. It shall be increased and well applied.'</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thus, monks, must 
    you train yourselves. <a style="mso-endnote-id:edn35" href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>
