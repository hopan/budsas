      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Upon the Full Moon of the month of 
      Visakha, now more than two thousand five hundred years ago, the religious 
      wanderer known as Gotama, formerly Prince Siddhattha and heir to the 
      throne of the Sakiyan peoples, by his full insight into the Truth called 
      Dhamma which is this mind and body, became the One Perfectly Enlightened 
      by himself.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">His Enlightenment or Awakening, called 
      Sambodhi, abolished in himself unknowing and craving, destroyed greed, 
      aversion and delusion in his heart, so that &quot;vision arose, super-knowledge 
      arose, wisdom arose, discovery arose, light arose -- a total penetration 
      into the mind and body, its origin, its cessation and the way to its 
      cessation which was at the same time complete understanding of the 
      &quot;world,&quot; its origin, its cessation and the way to its cessation. He 
      penetrated to the Truth underlying all existence. In meditative 
      concentration throughout one night, but after years of striving, from 
      being a seeker, He became &quot;the One-who-Knows, the One-who-Sees.&quot;</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When He came to explain His great 
      discovery to others, He did so in various ways suited to the understanding 
      of those who listened and suited to help relieve the problems with which 
      they were burdened.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">He knew with his Great Wisdom exactly what 
      these were even if his listeners were not aware of them, and out of His 
      Great Compassion taught Dhamma for those who wished to lay down their 
      burdens. The burdens which men, indeed all beings, carry round with them 
      are no different now from the Buddha-time. For then as now men were 
      burdened with unknowing and craving. They did not know of the Four Noble 
      Truths nor of Dependent Arising and they craved for fire and poison and 
      were then as now, consumed by fears. Lord Buddha, One attained to the 
      Secure has said:</FONT> </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Profound, Ananda, is this Dependent 
        Arising, and it appears profound. It is through not understanding, not 
        penetrating this law that the world resembles a tangled skein of thread, 
        a woven nest of birds, a thicket of bamboos and reeds, that man does not 
        escape from (birth in) the lower realms of existence, from the states of 
        woe and perdition, and suffers from the round of rebirth.&quot;</FONT> </P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The not-understanding of Dependent Arising 
      is the root of all sorrows experienced by all beings. It is also the most 
      important of the formulations of Lord Buddha&#39;s Enlightenment. For a 
      Buddhist it is therefore most necessary to see into the heart of this for 
      oneself. This is done not be reading about it nor by becoming expert in 
      scriptures, nor by speculations upon one&#39;s own and others&#39; concepts but by 
      seeing Dependent Arising in one&#39;s own life and by coming to grips with it 
      through calm and insight in one&#39;s &quot;own&quot; mind and body.</FONT> </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;He who sees Dependent Arising, he sees 
        Dhamma.&quot;</FONT> </P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Let us now see how this Teaching is 
      concerned with our own lives. The search of every living being is to find 
      happiness, in whatever state, human or non-human, they find themselves. 
      But what it is really important to know is this: <I>the factors which give 
      rise to unhappiness, so that they can be avoided; and the factors from 
      which arise happiness, so that they can be cultivated.</I> This is just 
      another way of stating the Four Noble Truths. In the first half of this 
      statement there is <I>unhappiness</I> or what is never satisfactory, 
      called in Pali language, Dukkha.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This Dukkha is the first Noble Truth which 
      we experience <I>all the time,</I> usually without noticing it, which does 
      not make the dukkha any less! First, there is <I>occasional dukkha:</I> 
      birth, old age, disease and death, for these events usually do not compose 
      the whole of life. Then we have <I>frequent dukkha:</I> being united with 
      what one dislikes, being separated from what one likes, not getting what 
      one wants, and this is everyday experience. Finally, as a summary of all 
      kinds of dukkha there is <I>continuous dukkha:</I> the five grasped-at 
      groups, that is to say body, feeling, perceptions, volitions (and other 
      mental activity) and consciousness, the components of a human being. 
      Explanation of these in full would take too long here but all the readers 
      are provided with these kinds of dukkha in themselves. They should look to 
      see whether these facts of existence are delightful or not. This Dhamma 
      &quot;should be thoroughly known&quot; in one&#39;s own person and life, that is where 
      the first Noble Truth may be discovered.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Then <I>the factors which give rise to 
      unhappiness</I> were mentioned. Here again one&#39;s person and life should be 
      investigated. Now when living creature are killed intentionally by me, 
      when I take what is not given, when I indulge in wrong conduct in sexual 
      relations, when I speak false words and when I take intoxicating drinks 
      and drugs producing carelessness -- now are these things factors for 
      happiness or unhappiness? When I covet the belongings of others, when I 
      allow ill-will to dwell in my heart, and when I have as the tenants of my 
      heart ignorance, delusion, and views which lead astray -- is this for my 
      welfare or destruction? There are many ways of describing these factors 
      which make for unhappiness but all of them derive from unknowing and 
      craving which are just two sides of the same thing. This is the Second 
      Noble Truth of the Arising of Dukkha. When craving is at work, when 
      unknowing clouds one&#39;s understanding, then one is sure to experience 
      dukkha. Lord Buddha instructs us for our own benefit and for the happiness 
      of others, that this craving &quot;should be relinquished.&quot;</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Now <I>happiness</I> in the second half of 
      the statement above can be of many kinds. Two kinds dependent upon 
      conditions can be seen illustrated by the world, while one kind, 
      unsupported by conditions &quot;should be realized&quot; in one&#39;s own heart. We are 
      all looking for happiness so let us see what is needed for it. First, 
      there is materially produced happiness. This is born of possessions and 
      jugglery with conditions of life &quot;out there.&quot; Called <I>amisa-sukha</I> in 
      Pali, this happiness is most uncertain; for all the factors supporting it 
      are subject to instability and change. Moreover, they are out in the world 
      and not in one&#39;s own heart, so that they call for expert jugglery to save 
      one from dukkha. And failure and disappointment cannot be avoided if one 
      goes after this sort of happiness. So this sort of happiness is 
      short-lived and precarious. A great improvement on this is the happiness 
      which comes from practicing Dhamma, called non-material happiness or <I>
      niramisa-sukha.</I> This kind of happiness is made sure whenever a person 
      performs wholesome kamma, such as doing the following ten things: giving, 
      moral conduct mind-development, reverence, helpfulness, dedicating 
      meritorious acts to others, rejoicing in the meritorious acts of others, 
      hearkening to Dhamma, teaching Dhamma and setting upright one&#39;s views. 
      People who practice this Dhamma, purifying their hearts in this way, are 
      sure to reap happiness. But this happiness, though more lasting than the 
      first, is not to be relied upon forever. As a fruit of it one may dwell 
      among the gods for aeons, or be born as a very fortunate man but even the 
      gods have to pass away, let alone man. And the fruits of kamma, good or 
      evil, are impermanent, so it cannot be relied upon to produce a permanent 
      happiness. This can only be found by removing entirely the cause for 
      dukkha: when craving is uprooted no growth of dukkha can take place. On 
      the contrary, with purity, compassion and wisdom one has reached the 
      Supreme Happiness of Nibbana which is stable, indestructible and never 
      subject to changing conditions. This is the Third Noble Truth of the 
      Cessation of Dukkha by the removal of its cause. A good deal of hard work 
      is needed to get to this &quot;which should be realized,&quot; and that work must be 
      done along the right lines, hence the Fourth Noble Truth.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is called the Truth of the Path, 
      &quot;which should be cultivated.&quot; It comprises elements of wisdom: Right View 
      and Right Attitude; elements of moral conduct: Right Speech, Right Action, 
      and Right Livelihood; and elements of meditation: Right Effort, Right 
      Mindfulness and Right Collectedness. These will not be explained in detail 
      here.[<A HREF="#n1" NAME="1">1</A>] It is certain that any one who 
      practices Moral Conduct, Collectedness and Wisdom in his life has the 
      conditions which sustain happiness. From his practice he may have 
      Dhamma-happiness or the Supreme Happiness, according to the degree he 
      practices, for the latter requires well-developed meditation both in calm 
      and in insight.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">These Four Noble Truths -- Dukkha, Cause, 
      Cessation, and Path -- are the heart of the Dhamma and they are in the 
      heart of every man who cares to see them. From their seeing and 
      understanding comes happiness but by trying to escape them only more 
      misery is born.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">These Truths are illustrated by the 
      formula of Dependent Arising which is found elaborated in various ways. 
      The simplest form is:</FONT> </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Craving being, dukkha is; by the arising 
        of craving, dukkha arises; craving not being, dukkha is not; by the 
        cessation of craving, dukkha ceases.</FONT> </P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But Dependent Arising can be given in much 
      more detailed ways than this. The important principle to understand is 
      that whatever is experienced by us, all that arises due to many 
      conditions. An aspect which grows in size from birth throughout youth, 
      which develops certain characteristics in maturity, and as old age creeps 
      on becomes infirm in various ways, and finally dies. The processes which 
      govern this growth and decline are of great complexity and 
      interdependence. The body, to keep going at all, needs clothes, food, 
      shelter and medicines at least. But once the internal chemistry (also 
      dependently originated) starts the process leading to old age and death, 
      none of the exterior supporting conditions can do more than retard the 
      process for a little while. The body, as a whole, does not arise from 
      &quot;no-cause&quot; (the physical particles and kamma being its immediate causes); 
      nor is it derived from <I>one</I> cause. If examined, nothing which we 
      experience arises from only one, or no cause at all; on the contrary our 
      experiences all arises dependently. Sight is actually dependent on the eye 
      as base, the object to be seen, and the operation of eye-consciousness. 
      (There are other factors that also contribute: light, air,...) Similarly, 
      there is ear, sound, ear-consciousness; nose, smell, nose-consciousness; 
      tongue, taste, tongue-consciousness; body, touch, body-consciousness; and 
      mind, thoughts, mind-consciousness. All of our experience falls within 
      these eighteen elements and there is nothing which we know outside them.</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is also important to understand that 
      much of what one experiences arising dependently is the fruit of one&#39;s own 
      actions. The happiness one feels and the dukkha one feels, although 
      sometimes brought about by events in the physical world (landslides, 
      earthquakes, a sunny or a rainy day), is very often brought about by one&#39;s 
      own past intentional actions or kamma. And in the present time with each 
      deliberate action, one performs more kammas which will come to fruit as 
      experience in the future. So, if one wants to experience the fruits of 
      happiness, the seeds of happiness must be planted now. They may fruit 
      immediately, in this life, or in a future existence. We make ourselves, we 
      are the creators of ourselves, no one else has a hand in this creation. 
      And the Lord of Creation is no other than Ignorance or Unknowing. He is 
      the Creator of this Wheel of Samsara, of continued and infinitely varied 
      forms of dukkha. And this Lord resides in the hearts of all men who are 
      called &quot;ordinary-men.&quot; We shall return to this in more detail later.</FONT>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Dependent Arising is explained many times 
      and in many different connections in the Discourses of Lord Buddha, but He 
      has not compared it to a wheel. This simile is found in the Visuddhimagga 
      (&quot;The Path of Purification&quot;) and in the other commentarial literature. 
      Although Theravada tradition has many references to this simile, it does 
      not seem to have been depicted at all. But in Northern India and 
      especially in Kashmir, the Sarvastivada school[<A HREF="#n2" NAME="2">2</A>] 
      was strongly established and besides producing a vast literature upon 
      Discipline and the Further Dhamma (Vinaya and Abhidhamma), they produced 
      also a way of depicting a great many important Buddhist teachings by this 
      picture of the Wheel which is the subject of the present essay.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In Pali it is the <I>bhava-cakka</I> or <I>
      Samsara-cakka,</I> which is variously rendered in English as the Wheel of 
      Life, the Wheel of Becoming or the Wheel of Rebirth.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In their collections of stories about Lord 
      Buddha and his disciples (known as <I>Avadana),</I> there is one which 
      opens with the story of this wheel. Readers will observe that the story 
      refers to Lord Buddha&#39;s lifetime and says that He has authorized the 
      painting of this picture, as well as laying down its contents. It is 
      certain that in the Buddha-time painting was well known (it is mentioned 
      several times in the Discourses and the Discipline) while the other facts 
      given in this short introductory story are quite in accord with the spirit 
      of the Pali Discourses. Even the collection of stories in which this 
      account is contained was compiled, according to some scholars, before the 
      Christian era. So if one does not believe that this painting was ordained 
      by Lord Buddha, still it has an age of two thousand years, a venerable 
      tradition indeed. Of all &quot;teaching-aids&quot; this expression of Buddhist 
      skillful-means <I>(upaya-kosalla),</I> must surely be the oldest. Now let 
      us turn to the story.</FONT> </P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Lord Buddha was staying at Rajagaha,[<A HREF="#n3" NAME="3">3</A>] 
      in the Bamboo Grove, at the Squirrels&#39; Feeding-place. Now, it was the 
      practice of Venerable Mahamoggallana to frequent the hells for a certain 
      time, then the animal-kingdom, also to visit the ghosts, the gods and men. 
      Having seen all the sufferings to be found in the hells which beings there 
      experience as they arise and pass away, such as maiming, dismembering and 
      so forth; having witnessed how animals kill and devour others, how ghosts 
      are tormented by hunger and thirst, how the gods lose (their heavenly 
      state), fall (from it), are spoiled and come to their ruin, and how men 
      crave and come to naught but thwarted desires, -- having seen all this he 
      returned to Jambudipa (India) and reported this to the four assemblies. 
      Whatever (venerable one) had a fellow-bhikkhu or a bhikkhu-pupil leading 
      the holy life with dissatisfaction, he would take him to Venerable 
      Mahamoggallana (thinking): &#39;The Venerable Mahamoggallana will exhort and 
      teach him well&#39;. And (truly) the Venerable Mahamoggallana would exhort and 
      teach him well. Such (dissatisfied bhikkhus) would again lead the holy 
      life with keen interest, even distinguishing themselves with the higher 
      attainments since they had been taught and exhorted so well by the 
      Venerable Mahamoggallana.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;At that time (when the Lord stayed at 
      Rajagaha), the Venerable Mahamoggallana was surrounded by the four 
      assemblies consisting of bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, pious laymen and women.</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Now the illustrious Enlightened Ones who 
      Know, (also) ask questions. Thus Lord Buddha asked the Venerable Ananda 
      (why the second of his foremost disciples was surrounded by the four 
      assemblies). Venerable Ananda then related Venerable Mahamoggallana&#39;s 
      experiences and said that he instructed discontented bhikkhus with 
      success.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;(The Lord replied:) &#39;The Elder Moggallana 
      or a bhikkhu like him cannot be at many places (at the same time for 
      teaching people). Therefore, in the (monastery) gateways a wheel having 
      five sections should be made.&#39;</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Thus the Lord laid down that a wheel with 
      five sections should be made (whereupon it was remarked:) &#39;But the 
      bhikkhus do not know what sort of wheel should be made&#39;.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;The Lord explained: &#39;The five bourns 
      should be represented -- the hellish bourn, that of the animal kingdom, of 
      ghosts, of men, and the bourn of the gods. In the lower portion (of the 
      wheel), the hells are to be shown, together, with the animal-kingdom and 
      the realm of the ghosts, while in the upper portion gods and men should be 
      represented. The four continents should also be depicted, namely, 
      Pubbavideha, Aparagoyana, Uttarakuru and Jambudipa.[<A HREF="#n4" NAME="4">4</A>] 
      In the middle, greed, aversion and delusion must be shown, a dove 
      symbolizing greed,[<A HREF="#n5" NAME="5">5</A>] a snake symbolizing 
      aversion, and a hog, delusion. Furthermore, the Buddhas are to be painted 
      (surrounded by their) halos pointing out (the way to) Nibbana. Ordinary 
      beings should be shown as by the contrivance of a water-wheel they sink 
      (to lower states) and rise up again. The space around the rim should be 
      filled with (scenes teaching) the twelve links of Dependent Arising in the 
      forward and reversed order. (The picture of the Wheel) must show clearly 
      that everything, all the time, is swallowed by impermanence and the 
      following two verses should be added as an inscription:</FONT> </P>

      <A HREF="#toc" NAME="lat">
      <BOLD>[^]</BOLD></A></FONT></H3>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Tibetan legend says that Lord Buddha 
      outlined the Wheel with grains of rice while walking with bhikkhus in a 
      rice field. However this may be, in India, at least in all the 
      Sarvastivada monasteries, this painting will have adorned the gateways, 
      arousing deep emotions in the hearts of those who knew its meaning, and 
      curiosity in others. It is a measure of how great was the destruction of 
      the Buddhist religion in India that not a single example survives 
      anywhere, since no gateways to temples are known to have survived. A 
      solitary painting in Ajanta cave number seventeen may perhaps be some form 
      of this wheel.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the translation above, the pictures for 
      representing the twelve links of Dependent Arising were not given and it 
      is said that these were supplied from the scriptures by Nagarjuna, a great 
      Buddhist Teacher (some of whose verses are quoted below). From India the 
      pattern of this wheel was taken to Samye, the first Tibetan monastery, by 
      Bande Yeshe and there it was the Sarvastivada lineage of ordination which 
      was established. The tradition of painting this wheel thus passed to 
      Tibet, where, due to climatic conditions, it was painted in the vestibule 
      of the temple, there to strike the eyes of all who entered.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Tibetan tradition speaks of two kinds of 
      Wheel: the old-style and the new-style. The old-style is based upon the 
      text translated above, while the new-style introduces new features. The 
      great reformer, Je Tsongkhapa (b. 1357 C.E.), founder of the Gelugpa (the 
      Virtuous Ones, the school of which H.H. the Dalai Lama is the head), gave 
      authority for the division of the Wheel into six instead of five, and for 
      drawing the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara in the guise of a Buddha in each of 
      the five non-human realms. Both these features may be seen upon the 
      drawing of the Tibetan-style Wheel. The sixth realm is that of the titans 
      (asura) who war against the gods of the sensual-sphere heavens. These 
      troublesome and demonic characters are included in a separate part of the 
      world of the gods in my drawing. The introduction of a Buddha-figure into 
      each realm illustrates the universal quality of a Buddha&#39;s great 
      compassion, for Avalokitesvara it the embodiment of enlightened 
      compassion. The writer has preferred to retain the old-style 
      representation according to the text as it agrees perfectly with Theravada 
      teachings.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The terrors and violence of samsara, which 
      are with us all the time, may be seen plainly in the ravishment of Tibet 
      by the Chinese invaders. Tibetan artists have kept this tradition alive to 
      the present day and still paint under difficulties as refugees in India. 
      But this ancient way of presenting Dhamma deserves to be more widely known 
      and appreciated. Buddhist shrines could well be equipped with 
      representations of it in the present day, to remind devotees of the nature 
      of this whirling wheel of birth and death.</FONT> </P>

      <A HREF="#toc" NAME="sym">
      <BOLD>[^]</BOLD></A></FONT></H3>
      <H4><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Hub</FONT></H4>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We now turn to the pictures of the 
      Bhava-cakka accompanying this book. One is from a Tibetan original after 
      Waddell. The second is a modern version executed by the author, in which 
      the scenes and figures have been given a contemporary coloring.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The hub of this painting is the central 
      point for us who live in the realm of samsara, so it is the best point to 
      start a description of the symbolism. In this center circle, a cock, a 
      snake and a hog wheel around, each having in its mouth the tail of the 
      animal in front. These three, representing Greed, Aversion and Delusion 
      which are the three roots of all evil, are depicted in the center because 
      they are the root causes for experience in the wandering on. When they are 
      present in our hearts then we live afflicted in the transitory world of 
      birth and death but when they are not there, having been destroyed by 
      wisdom or pañña, developed in Dhamma-practice, then we find rest, the 
      unshakable peace of Nibbana. It is notable that Tibetan paintings show 
      these creatures against a blue ground, showing that even these afflictions 
      of mind, although powerful, have no real substance and are void, as are 
      all the other elements of our experience.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The cock of fiery yellow-red represents 
      greed <I>(lobha).</I> This greed includes every desire for all kinds of &quot;I 
      wish, I want, I must have, I will have&quot; and extends from the violent 
      passion for gross physical form, through attachments to views and ideas, 
      all the way to the subtle clinging to spiritual pleasures experienced by 
      meditators. The color of the cock, a fiery red, is symbolic of the fact 
      that the passions burn those who indulge in them. Passions and desires are 
      hot and restless, just like tongues of flame, and never allow the heart to 
      experience the cool peace of non-attachment. The cock is chosen as a 
      symbol of greed because as an animal it is observed to be full of lust and 
      vanity.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the cock&#39;s beak there is the tail of a 
      green snake indicating that people who are not able to &quot;satisfy&quot; their 
      ocean-like greeds and lusts tend to become angry. Aversion <I>(dosa)</I> 
      of any form springs up when we do not get what we want, or when we get 
      what we do not want. This also can be very subtle, from aversion to mental 
      states ranging through hostile thoughts against other beings, to 
      expressions of inward resentment finding their way out in untruthful, 
      malicious or angry words, or as physical violence. The greenness of the 
      snake indicates the coldness, the lack of sympathy with others, while the 
      snake itself is an animal killing other beings by poison and 
      strangulation, which is exactly what aversion does to those who let it 
      grow in their hearts. Our lives can be corrupted by this venomous beast 
      unless we take very good care to remove it.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">At the bottom of the picture there is a 
      heavy hog, the tail of which is chewed by aversion&#39;s snake, while in turn 
      it champs upon the tail feathers of greed&#39;s cock. This heavy hog is black 
      in color and represents delusion <I>(moha).</I> This black hog, like its 
      brethren everywhere, likes to sleep for long, to root for food in filth 
      and generally to take no care at all over cleanliness. It is a good symbol 
      for delusion which prevents one from understanding what is advantageous 
      and what is deleterious to oneself. Its heaviness is that sluggishness of 
      mind and body which it induces in people, called variously stupidity, 
      dullness, boredom; but worry and distraction with skeptical doubt also 
      arise from this delusion-root. One who is overwhelmed by delusion does not 
      know why he should restrain himself from evil, for he can see neither his 
      own benefit with wisdom, nor the benefit of others by compassion -- all is 
      blanketed by delusion. He does not know, or does not believe that kamma 
      (intentional actions) have results according to kind. Or he has wrong 
      views which lead him astray from the highway of Dhamma. When people do not 
      get what they want either using greed or aversion, then they turn dull and 
      the pain of their desire is dulled by delusion. From this black hog are 
      born the fiery cock and the cold green snake.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">These three beasts, none more dangerous 
      anywhere, are shown each biting the tail of the other, meaning that really 
      they are inseparable, so that one cannot have, say, greed, without the 
      other monsters lurking in its train. Even characters which are rooted 
      predominantly in one of these three, have the other two present, while 
      most people called &quot;normal&quot; have a sort of unhealthy balance of these 
      three in their hearts, ever ready to influence their actions when a 
      suitable situation occurs. These three beasts revolve endlessly in the 
      heart of the ordinary-man <I>(puthujjana)</I> and ensure that he 
      experiences plenty of dukkha. One should know for one-self whether these 
      beasts control one&#39;s own heart, or not.</FONT> </P>
      <H4><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The First Ring</FONT></H4>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Out from the innermost circle, the first 
      ring is divided into two (not shown at all upon the Tibetan version 
      illustrated here), one half with a white background and the other having a 
      black background. In the former, four people are seen ascending: the 
      bhikkhu holding a Dhamma-light goes on in front, being followed by a 
      white-robed nun <I>(upasika),</I> after which come a man and a woman in 
      present day dress. The four of them represent the Buddhist Community made 
      up of monks, nuns, laymen and laywomen. They are representative of anyone 
      practicing the path of good conduct in mind, speech and body. They 
      represent as well two classes of persons: &quot;going from dark to light&quot; and 
      &quot;going from light to light.&quot; In the first case, they are born in poor 
      circumstances and have few opportunities due to past evil kamma but in 
      spite of this, they make every effort to practice Dhamma for their own 
      good and others&#39; happiness. Thus they go towards the light, for the fruit 
      of their present kamma will be pleasant and enjoyable. The latter class, 
      &quot;going from light to light,&quot; are those people who have attained many 
      benefits with plentiful opportunities in their present life, due to having 
      done much good kamma in the past. In the present they continue with their 
      upward course devoting themselves to further practice of Dhamma in their 
      lives.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What is this Dhamma-practice? There are 
      two lists both of ten factors which could be explained here but the space 
      required would be too great for more than a summary. The first list is 
      called the ten Skilled Kamma-paths,[<A HREF="#n7" NAME="7">7</A>] three of 
      which pertain to bodily action, four to speech and three to mental action. 
      &quot;Paths&quot; here means &quot;ways of action&quot; and &quot;skillful&quot; means &quot;neither for the 
      deterioration of one&#39;s own mind nor for the harm of others.&quot; The bodily 
      actions which one refrains from are: destroying living creatures, taking 
      what is not given, and wrong conduct in sexual desires. In speech, the 
      four actions which should be avoided are: false speech, slanderous speech, 
      harsh speech and foolish chatter. The three actions of mind which should 
      be avoided are: covetousness, ill-will, and wrong views. Anyone who 
      restrains himself from these ten, practices a skillful path, a white path 
      which accords with the first steps of training in Dhamma.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The other ten factors are called the Ten 
      Ways of making Puñña[<A HREF="#n8" NAME="8">8</A>] (meaning actions 
      purifying the heart). They have a different range from the first list of 
      ten, being divided into three basic ways and seven secondary ones. The 
      basic factors are giving <I>(dana),</I> moral conduct <I>(sila),</I> and 
      mind development <I>(bhavana),</I> while the remaining seven are counted 
      as aspects of these three: reverence, helpfulness, dedicating one&#39;s puñña 
      to others, rejoicing in other&#39;s puñña, listening to Dhamma, teaching 
      Dhamma, and straightening out one&#39;s views. These actions lead to 
      uprightness, skillful conduct and to the growth in Dhamma of oneself, as 
      well as the benefit of others.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Those who tread upon this white path going 
      toward the light are able to be born in two bourns: either as men, or as 
      &quot;shining-ones&quot; -- the gods in the three sorts of heavens of sensuality, 
      subtle form, and formlessness. A life of good practice is thus usually 
      followed by a life in one of these two bourns, called <I>sugati</I> or the 
      good bourns. But Lord Buddha does not declare that <I>everyone</I> who has 
      led such a life is necessarily born there. This depends not only upon the 
      intensity of their Dhamma-practice but <I>also</I> upon the vision which 
      arises at the time of death. Through negligence at the last moment, one 
      can slip into the three evil bourns difficult to get out of. The round of 
      Samsara is very dangerous, even for those who lead almost blameless lives. 
      More of this below. To be born in the two good bourns is the fruiting of 
      puñña or skillful kamma and the more purified one&#39;s heart, the higher and 
      more pleasant will be one&#39;s environment.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the dark half of the ring, naked beings 
      are tumbling downwards in disorder. Their nakedness symbolizes lack of 
      shame in doing evil and their disorder shows the characteristic of evil to 
      cause disintegration and confusion. &quot;Downwards&quot; means that they are 
      falling, by the commission of sub-human actions, to sub-human states of 
      existence. In some Tibetan versions they are chained together and pulled 
      downwards by a female demon who squats at the bottom. This demoness is 
      craving of tanha (a noun of female gender). This craving is, of course, 
      not outside those who follow the path of evil but in their own hearts. On 
      this path there are two sorts of persons, those &quot;going, from light to 
      dark&quot; and those &quot;going from dark to dark.&quot; The former have good 
      opportunities in this life but do not make use of them, or else use them 
      for evil ends without laying up any further store. Instead, they prefer 
      from delusion to store up evil now for fear and distress in future. Those 
      who go from dark to dark do not have even the advantages of the former 
      group for they are born in conditions of deprivation due to past evil 
      kamma and then, driven on by the fruit of suffering received by them, they 
      commit more evil.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Ten Unskillful Kamma-paths are the 
      ways along which they walk: destroying living creatures, taking what is 
      not given, wrong conduct in sexual desires; false speech, slanderous 
      speech, harsh speech, foolish chatter; covetousness, ill-will and 
      wrong-views. They do not delight in making puñña but are by nature, mean, 
      immoral, undeveloped in mind, proud, selfish, grasp at possessions, 
      envious, never listen to Dhamma and certainly never teach it, while their 
      hearts are ridden with confused and contradictory views and ideas.</FONT>
      </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">For their pains, having pursued evil, 
      these beings upon their death, already having destroyed &quot;humanness&quot; in 
      themselves, fall down to the three lower states which are called the Evil 
      Bourns <I>(duggati).</I> These are, in order of deterioration and increase 
      of suffering: the hungry ghosts, the animals, and the hell-wraiths. Truly

      given, by dividing the devas and asuras (the gods and anti-gods or 
      titans). In this section the five, or six bourns will be described, 
      together with the ways to get to them. Birth in any bourn is a fruit or 
      effect and here we shall see the causes.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A person who has done evil persistently, 
      or even one heavy crime, is likely to see at the time of death a vision, 
      either relating to his past evil actions, or else to the bourn which his 
      past evil actions or kamma have prepared for him. When his physical body 
      is no longer a suitable basis to support life, his mind creates a body 
      ghostly and subtle in substance, which then and there begins to experience 
      one of the evil bourns. But in case his kamma drives him to be born as 
      animals, there is the vision of animals copulating and he is dragged into 
      the womb or egg of those animals.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Kamma which leads to birth as an animal is 
      a strong interest in the things which mankind shares with the animals, 
      that is, eating, drinking and sex. If a man strengthens the animal in 
      himself, to become an &quot;animal-man,&quot; he can expect only to be born as an 
      animal. Human beings interested in only these things, strengthening the 
      Evil Root of Delusion in their minds, have already the minds of animals. 
      There is no essential &quot;man-ness&quot; which can prevent such a catastrophe, for 
      no unchanging human soul exists. If a man wishes to guard himself against 
      this, he must protect the conditions for humanity <I>(manussa-dhamma)</I> 
      which are the Five Precepts. Sinking below the level of conduct of these 
      precepts, is to sink into the sub-human levels. Once rebirth as an animal 
      has taken place it is by no means easy to gain human birth again, as 
      Venerable Nagarjuna has written:</FONT> </P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Kamma dragging one to the hells, which are 
      the most fearful and miserable states, are actions involving hatred, 
      killing, torture and violence generally. People lead themselves to 
      experience hell because they have made the Evil Root of Aversion very 
      strong within themselves.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">On the other hand, those who have 
      strengthened the Evil Root of Greed while they were men, having been mean, 
      possessive and selfish, are liable to arise as spirits with strong 
      cravings forever unsatisfied, for which reason they are known as &quot;hungry&quot; 
      ghosts.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">However, it does sometimes happen that one 
      who has led an evil life turns sincerely to religion upon his deathbed. 
      When this occurs, with his mind centered upon Dhamma and purified by 
      faith, a person like this may be reborn among men, even arise among the 
      devas. That evil kamma which has been done though it may have no chance to 
      fructify in those good bourns, remains a potential for creating very 
      unpleasant results whenever conditions are favorable to its fruition. The 
      reverse of this may happen, as when good and noble men become distracted 
      at death and so remember some small evil done, or see a vision of evil 
      done in some past life, the result of which is the arising of unwholesome 
      consciousness leading to the evil bourns.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is more usual for one who has followed 
      the path of white deeds to be born as a man or among the gods. The basis 
      for the former is the practice of the Five Precepts which constitute the 
      level of humanness. They are in brief: refraining from destroying living 
      creatures; refraining from taking what is not given; refraining from wrong 
      conduct in sexual desires; refraining from false speech, and refraining 
      from distilled and fermented intoxicants which cause carelessness. Those 
      who refrain from such things, having really lived as men, having 
      strengthened the base of humanness in their own hearts, are born again as 
      men well-endowed with the riches of fine qualities; of varied 
      opportunities, as well as with a wealth of worldly goods.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The path to the heavens is cultivated by 
      those who make special efforts to live with purity and self-restraint, 
      exercising loving-kindness toward all beings and so purifying their minds 
      to some extent through meditation. At the time of death, having fulfilled 
      the ten Skillful Kamma paths and the ten Ways of Making Puñña, the heart 
      will be joyful and peaceful to varying degrees, which will result in the 
      experience of arising in one of the many heavenly levels according to the 
      degree of purity and concentration which has been attained.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">All these possibilities are within the 
      scope of the mind, the quality of which can be changed in this way or that 
      by kamma, good or bad. From the type of mind which performs the duty of 
      relinking-consciousness at birth, is determined the kind of sense-organs 
      possessed by a being, and hence the kind of world experienced by him.

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">To come now to a description of the 
      picture. In the world of <I>the gods</I> or &quot;shining-ones&quot; (deva, upper 
      right, but topmost in the Tibetan version), the gilded palaces and 
      glittering jewel trees of the gods of sensuality are shown in the lower 
      part of the drawing. The Tibetan picture shows more details of these 
      superlatively beautiful worlds in which there is also a kind of subtle 
      sexual relationship. Being based upon sensuality, as this world of men is, 
      these devas must also pay the price for this -- which is conflict. This 
      conflict is an ever-recurring battle with the asuras, the anti-gods or 
      titans who have in past times fallen through their quarrelsome nature from 
      the heavens and who now enviously try to invade the celestial realms. In 
      my picture, they share a segment of the world of gods and they are 
      equipped with ancient and modern weapons and are in the dress of soldiers. 
      But they do not only battle with the gods but also among themselves and so 
      a bit of insubordination is depicted as well. The Tibetan picture gives 
      them a world to themselves among the frontiers of which they are fleeing 
      from the victorious heavenly hosts led upon a very large elephant by 
      Sakka, the lord of the sensual-realm gods. These titans only understand 
      force, so the Buddha shown in their world bears a sword with which to duly 
      impress them, after which they may be able to hear a little Dhamma. By 
      contrast, the Buddha appearing among the gods bears a lute, in order to 
      lure them into listening to Dhamma sung in exquisite strains, for it was 
      believed that they would not be interested in mere spoken words!</FONT>

      understand Dhamma. Lord Buddha, foremost among men, sits highest in the 
      human world teaching Dhamma in a forest grove to his first five disciples. 
      In the original version which my picture follows, He is shown only in the 
      human world, thus emphasizing the value of human birth, during which it is 
      possible to gain insight into Dhamma. The religious aspirations of man are 
      represented by a Hindu temple, a Christian church and Muslim mosque, while 
      a war and a bar show his tendencies towards aversion and greed. The 
      Tibetan picture shows several mundane activities such as plowing the 
      fields, while people climb towards the top of the picture where there is a 
      temple in which they can listen to Dhamma. In the center stands a Buddha 
      carrying the almsbowl and staff, showing to men the way of peacefulness 
      leading to Sublime Peace of Nibbana. This is shown in my picture by the 
      sure Dhamma-path which issues from the mouth of the Exalted Buddha. Upon

      &quot;upholders of the world&quot;; they let this wheel whirl them round from 
      unknowing to old-age and death. The Exalted Buddha urged us not to be 
      &quot;world upholders&quot; but through Dhamma-practice to relinquish greed, 
      aversion and delusion so that by the cessation of unknowing there comes to 
      be a cessation of birth, old-age and death.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Now let us have a look at these twelve 
      links in brief.</FONT> </P>
      <H4><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">First Link:</FONT></I>
      <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Unknowing (avijja)</FONT></H4>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This Pali word &quot;avijja&quot; is a negative term 
      meaning &quot;not knowing completely&quot; but it does not mean &quot;knowing nothing at 
      all.&quot; This kind of unknowing is very special and not concerned with 
      ordinary ways or subjects of knowledge, for here what one does not know 
      are the Four Noble Truths, one does not see them clearly in one&#39;s own 
      heart and one&#39;s own life. In past lives, we did not care to see <I>dukkha</I> 
      (1), so we could not destroy <I>the cause of dukkha</I> (2) or craving 
      which has impelled us to seek more and more lives, more and more 
      pleasures. <I>The cessation of dukkha</I> (3) which perhaps could have 
      been seen by us in past lives, was not realized, so we come to the present 
      existence inevitably burdened with dukkha. And in the past we can hardly 
      assume that we set our feet upon the <I>practice-path leading to the 
      cessation of dukkha</I> (4) and we did not even discover Stream-entry. We 
      are now paying for our own negligence in the past.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">And this unknowing is not some kind of 
      first cause in the past, for it dwells in our hearts now. But due to this 
      unknowing, as we shall see, we have set in motion this wheel bringing 
      round old age and death and all other sorts of dukkha. Those past &quot;selves&quot; 
      in previous lives who are in the stream of my individual continuity did 
      not check their craving and so could not cut at the root of unknowing. On 
      the contrary they made kamma, some of the fruits of which in this present 
      life I, as their causal resultant, am receiving.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The picture helps us to understand this: a 
      blind old woman (avijja is of feminine gender) with a stick picks her way 
      through a petrified forest strewn with bones. It is said that the original 
      picture here should be an old blind she-camel led by a driver, the beast 
      being one accustomed to long and weary journeys across inhospitable 
      country, while its driver could be craving. Whichever simile is used, the 
      beginninglessness and the darkness of unknowing are well suggested. We are 
      the blind ones who have staggered from the past into the present -- to 
      what sort of future?</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Depending on the existence of unknowing in 
      the heart there was volitional action, kamma or abhisankhara, made in 
      those past lives.</FONT> </P>
      <H4><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Second Link:</FONT></I>
      <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Volitions (sankhara)</FONT></H4>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Intentional actions have the latent power 
      within them to bear fruit in the future -- either in a later part of the 
      life in which they were performed, in the following life, or in some more 
      distant life, but their potency is not lost with even the passing of 
      aeons; and whenever the necessary conditions obtain that past kamma may 
      bear fruit. Now, in past lives we have made kamma, and due to our 
      ignorance of the Four Noble Truths we have been &quot;world-upholders&quot; and so 
      making good and evil kamma we have ensured the continued experience of 
      this world.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Beings like this, obstructed by unknowing 
      in their hearts have been compared to a potter making pots: he makes 
      successful and beautiful pottery (skillful kamma) and he is sometimes 
      careless and his pots crack and break up from various flaws (unskillful 
      kamma). And he gets his clay fairly well smeared over himself just as 
      purity of heart is obscured by the mud of kamma. The simile of the potter 
      is particularly apt because the word <I>Sankhara</I> means &quot;forming,&quot; 
      &quot;shaping,&quot; and &quot;compounding,&quot; and therefore it has often been rendered in 
      English as &quot;Formations.&quot;</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Depending on the existence of these 
      volitions produced in past lives, there arises the consciousness called 
      &quot;relinking&quot; which becomes the basis of this present life.</FONT> </P>
      <H4><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Third Link:</FONT></I>
      <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Consciousness (viññana)</FONT></H4>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This relinking consciousness may be of 
      different qualities, according to the kamma upon which it depends. In the 
      case of all those who read this, the consciousness &quot;leaping&quot; into a new 
      birth at the time of conception, was a human relinking consciousness 
      arising as a result of having practiced at least the Five Precepts, the 
      basis of &quot;humanness&quot; in past lives. One should note that this relinking 
      consciousness is a resultant, not something which can be controlled by 
      will. If one has not made kamma suitable for becoming a human being, one 
      cannot will, when the time of death comes round, &quot;Now I shall become a man 
      again!&quot; The time for intentional action was when one had the opportunity 
      to practice Dhamma. Although our relinking-consciousness in this birth is 
      now behind us, it is now that we can practice Dhamma and make more sure of 
      a favorable relinking consciousness in future -- that is, if we wish to go 
      on living in Samsara.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This relinking-consciousness is the third 
      constituent necessary for conception, for even though it is the mother&#39;s 
      period and sperm is deposited in the womb, if there is no &quot;being&quot; desiring 
      to take rebirth at that place and time there will be no fertilization of 
      the ovum.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Appropriately, the picture shows a monkey, 
      the consciousness leaping from one tree, the old life, to another tree. 
      The old tree has died, while the one towards which it jumps is laden with 
      fruits -- they may be the fruits of good or evil. The Tibetan picture 
      shows a monkey devouring fruit, experiencing the fruits of deeds done in 
      the past.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Dependent upon relinking-consciousness 
      there is the arising of mind-body.</FONT> </P>
      <H4><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Fourth Link:</FONT></I>
      <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Mind-body (Nama-rupa)</FONT></H4>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is not a very accurate translation 
      but gives the general meaning. There is more included in rupa that is 
      usually thought of as body, while mind is a compound of feeling, 
      perception, volition and consciousness. This mind and body is two 
      interactive continuities in which there is nothing stable. Although in 
      conventional speech we talk of &quot;my mind&quot; and &quot;my body,&quot; implying that 
      there is some sort of owner lurking in the background, the wise understand 
      that laws govern the workings of both mental states and physical changes 
      and mind cannot be ordered to be free of defilements, nor body told that 
      it must not grow old, become sick and die.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But it is in the mind that a change can be 
      wrought instead of drifting through life at the mercy of the inherent 
      instability of mind and body. So in the illustration, mind is doing the 
      work of punting the boat of psycho-physical states on the river of 
      cravings, while body is the passive passenger. The Tibetan picture shows a 
      coracle being rowed over swirling waters with three (? or four) other 
      passengers, who doubtless represent the other groups or aggregates 
      (khandha).</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">With the coming into existence of 
      mind-body, there is the arising of the six sense-spheres.</FONT> </P>
      <H4><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Fifth Link:</FONT></I>
      <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Six sense-spheres (salayatana)</FONT></H4>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A house with six windows is the usual 
      symbol for this link (but the Tibetan shows a house with one (?) window). 
      These six senses are eye, ear, nose, tongue, touch and mind, and these are 
      the bases for the reception of the various sorts of information which each 
      can gather in the presence of the correct conditions. This information 
      falls under six headings corresponding to the six spheres: sights, sounds, 
      smells, tastes, tangibles and thoughts. Beyond these six spheres of sense 
      and their corresponding six objective spheres, we know nothing. All our 
      experience is limited by the senses and their objects with the mind 
      counted as the sixth. The five outer senses collect data only in the 
      present but mind, the sixth, where this information is collected and 
      processed, ranges through the three times adding memories from the past 
      and hopes and fears for the future, as well as thoughts of various kinds 
      relating to the present. It may also add information about the spheres of 
      existence which are beyond the range of the five outer senses, such as the 
      various heavens, the ghosts and the hell-states. A mind developed through 
      collectedness (samadhi) is able to perceive these worlds and their 
      inhabitants.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The six sense-spheres existing, there is 
      contact.</FONT> </P>
      <H4><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Sixth Link:</FONT></I>
      <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Contact (phassa)</FONT></H4>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This means the contact between the six 
      senses and the respective objects. For instance, when the necessary 
      conditions are all fulfilled, there being an eye, a sight-object, light 
      and the eye being functional and the person awake and turned toward the 
      object, there is likely to be eye-contact, the striking of the object upon 
      the sensitive eye-base. The same is true for each of the senses and their 
      type of contact. The traditional symbol for this link shows a man and a 
      woman embracing.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Where contact arises, feeling exists.</FONT>
      </P>
      <H4><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Seventh Link:</FONT></I>
      <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Feeling (vedana)</FONT></H4>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When there have been various sorts of 
      contact through the six senses, feelings arise which are the emotional 
      response to those contacts. Feelings are of three sorts: pleasant, painful 
      and neither pleasant nor painful. The first are welcome and are the basis 
      for happiness, the second are unwelcome and are the basis for dukkha while 
      the third are the neutral sort of feelings which we experience so often 
      but hardly notice.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But all feelings are unstable and liable 
      to change, for no mental state can continue in equilibrium. Even moments 
      of the highest happiness whatever we consider this is, pass away and give 
      place to different ones. So even happiness which is impermanent based on 
      pleasant feelings is really dukkha, for how can the true unchanging 
      happiness be found in the unstable? Thus the picture shows a man with his 
      eyes pierced by arrows, a strong enough illustration of this.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When feelings arise, cravings are 
      (usually) produced.</FONT> </P>
      <H4><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Eighth Link</FONT></I>
      <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Craving (tanha)</FONT></H4>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Up to this point, the succession of events 
      has been determined by past kamma. Craving, however, leads to the making 
      of new kamma in the present and it is possible now, and only now, to 
      practice Dhamma. What is needed here is mindfulness (sati), for without it 
      no Dhamma at all can be practiced while one will be swept away by the 
      force of past habits and let craving and unknowing increase themselves 
      within one&#39;s heart. When one does have mindfulness one may and can know 
      &quot;this is pleasant feeling,&quot; &quot;this is unpleasant feeling,&quot; &quot;this is neither 
      pleasant nor unpleasant feeling&quot; -- and such contemplation of feelings 
      leads one to understand and beware of greed, aversion and delusion, which 
      are respectively associated with the three feelings. With this knowledge 
      one can break out of the Wheel of Birth and Death. But without this 
      Dhamma-practice it is certain that feelings will lead on to more cravings 
      and whirl one around this wheel full of dukkha. As Venerable Nagarjuna has 
      said:</FONT> </P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In Sanskrit, the word trisna (tanha) means 
      thirst, and by extension implies &quot;thirst for experience.&quot; For this reason, 
      craving is shown as a toper guzzling intoxicants and in my picture I have 
      added three bottles -- craving for sensual sphere existence and the 
      craving for the higher heavens of the Brahma-worlds which are either of 
      subtle form, or formless.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Where the kamma of further craving is

      <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Grasping (upadana)</FONT></H4>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is an intensification and 
      diversification of craving which is directed to four ends: sensual 
      pleasures, views which lead astray from Dhamma, external religious rites 
      and vows, and attachment to the view of soul or self as being permanent. 
      When these become strong in people they cannot even become interested in 
      Dhamma, for their efforts are directed away from Dhamma and towards 
      dukkha. The common reaction is to redouble efforts to find peace and 
      happiness among the objects which are grasped at. Hence both pictures show 
      a man reaching up to pick more fruit although his basket is full already.</FONT>
      </P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">With hearts boiling with craving and 
      grasping, people ensure for themselves more and more of various sorts of 
      life, and pile up the fuel upon the fire of dukkha. The ordinary person, 
      not knowing about dukkha, wants to stoke up the blaze, but the Buddhist 
      way of doing things is to let the fires go out for want of fuel by 
      stopping the process of craving and grasping and thus cutting off 
      Unknowing at its root. If we want to stay in samsara we must be diligent 
      and see that our <I>becoming,</I> which is happening all the time shaped 
      by our kamma, is <I>becoming</I> in the right direction. This means <I>
      becoming</I> in the direction of purity and following the white path of 
      Dhamma-practice. This will contribute to whatever we become, or do not 
      become, at the end of this life when the pathways to the various realms 
      stand open and we <I>become</I> according to our practice and to our

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Birth, as one might expect, is shown as a 
      mother in the process of childbirth, a painful business and a reminder of 
      how dukkha cannot be avoided in any life. Whatever the future life is to 
      be, if we are not able to bring the wheel to a stop in this life, 
      certainly that future will arise conditioned by the kamma made in this 
      life. But it is no use thinking that since there are going to be future 
      births, one may as well put off Dhamma practice until then -- for it is 
      not sure what those future births will be like. And when they come around, 
      they are just the present moment as well. So no use waiting! Venerable

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Both pictures show the Wheel as being in 
      the grip of a fearful monster. In my drawing the monster&#39;s name is 
      engraved upon his crown so that people should not think of him as a common 
      demon. He is no such thing, for his name is Impermanence and his crown 
      shows his authority over all worlds whatever. He devours them and they are 
      all, heavens and hells together, securely held in the grasp of his taloned 
      hands. The crown upon his head is adorned with five skulls, representing 
      the impermanence of the five groups or aggregates comprising the person. 
      His eyes, ears, nose, and mouth have flames about them, an illustration of 
      the Exalted One&#39;s Third Discourse in which He says: &quot;The eye is afire...&quot; 
      and so on. Above the monster&#39;s two eyes, there is a third one meaning that 
      while for the fool impermanence is his enemy, for the wise man it helps 
      him to Enlightenment. Although the monster has adorned himself with 
      earrings and the like he fails to look attractive -- in the same way, this 
      world puts on an outer show of beauty puts its beauty fades when examined 
      more carefully.</FONT> </P>

      beginning, looping back and forth. In the same way, we have been born, 
      lived and then died countless times in the whirl of samsara. Sometimes our

      the way out of this wheel.[<A HREF="#n10" NAME="10">10</A>] In my picture, 
      He indicates with his hand the nature of samsara and warns us to beware.

      and majestic wisdom won by Him which can be described in many ways but is 
      finally beyond the limitations of everything known to us.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Tibetan picture shows in the upper

      embodiment of compassion as the way and the goal for those who follow the 
      bodhisattva-path. My picture has the Path of Dhamma of eight lotuses 
      leading to the wheel of Dhamma. The eight lotuses are the eight factors of 
      the Noble Path, the first two -- Right View, Right Attitude -- being the 
      wisdom-section; the next three -- Right Speech, Right Action, Right 
      Livelihood -- being the morality section; and the last three -- Right 
      Effort, Right Mindfulness and Right Collectedness -- being the section of 
      collectedness or meditation. The Wheel of Dhamma has at its center 
      suññata, the Void, another name for the experience of Nibbana. Around its 
      hub are the ten petals of a lotus, representing the ten perfecting 
      qualities (parami) which are necessary for complete attainment: 
      generosity, moral conduct, renunciation, wisdom, determination, energy, 
      patience, truthfulness, loving-kindness and equanimity. Eight spokes 
      radiate from the hub which stand for the practice by the Arahant, the one 
      perfected, of the Eightfold Path when each factor, instead of being just 
      right, becomes perfect. On the inside of the wheel&#39;s nave there are 37 
      jewels symbolizing the thirty-seven factors of Enlightenment, while the 
      outer edge of the nave is adorned with four groups of three jewels showing 
      the Four Noble Truths in each of the three ways wherein they were viewed 
      by the Exalted Buddha when he discovered Enlightenment.[<A HREF="#n12" NAME="12">12</A>]</FONT>

      <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This picture teaches us and reminds us of 
      many important features of the Dhamma as it was intended to by the 
      teachers of old. Contemplating all its features frequently helps to give 
      us true insight into the nature of Samsara. With its help and our own 
      practice we come to see Dependent Arising in ourselves. When this has been 
      done thoroughly all the riches of Dhamma will be available to us, not from 
      books or discussions, nor from listening to others&#39; explanations...</FONT>
