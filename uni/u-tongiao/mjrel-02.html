      <P>6. THE BUDDHA ASKS AND ANSWERS </P>
      </B>
      <P>In the middle<B> </B>of the sixth century <B>B.C., </B>many people in 
      India had begun to use some of the religious short cuts described in the 
      preceding chapter about Hindu worship. In general, this was a period of 
      disillusionment. Probably because the people had become thoroughly 
      disillusioned about life, they looked upon reincarnation with increasing 
      dread. Some of them even forgot what their most serious questions were, in 
      their frantic effort to save themselves from the 100,000 lives, which they 
      felt they were doomed to live. The art of that time shows people adoring 
      cows, deer, horses, hogs, monkeys, and elephants. Others inflicted 
      tortures on themselves -- maintaining one position for a long time, gazing 
      at the brilliant Indian sun, or in. haling smoke and fire.</P>
      <P>Many of the priests were not particularly helpful. They, too, had 
      become preoccupied with short cuts in religious living. They were not 
      taking their priestly vocations seriously enough. In one picture from this 
      period, some dogs, intended to symbolize priests, are shown in a grand 
      procession. They are reciting the prayer: &quot;Om, let us eat! Om, bring us 
      food! Lord of food, bring hither food, bring it!&quot; (Om is their shortest 
      word by which God might be addressed.) The people further expressed their 
      low opinion of the priests in this Indian proverb: &quot;Vishnu gets the barren 
      prayers, while the priest devours the offering.&quot;</P>
      <P>Hinduism was later to regain a place of respected leadership in India; 
      but, during the period described, many people were not able to find in it 
      satisfying answers to life’s disturbing problems. Because of this 
      dissatisfaction, some religious reforms shortly arose in an attempt to rid 
      Hinduism of its superficiality. One of these reforms was to be the 
      beginning of Buddhism.</P>
      <B>
      <P>PRINCE GAUTAMA </P>
      </B>
      <P>At this time when thoughtful men were questioning the value of their 
      native religion, there was born a prince named Gautama. He was the only 
      son of a rich Hindu raja of the warrior caste, and his parents expected 
      him to be-conic a ruler. His father was afraid that Gautama might do what 
      many members of the upper castes did -- become a religious seeker or a 
      pilgrim renouncing life. So in his great ambition that his son might 
      follow his own footsteps, the father did everything possible to protect 
      Gautama from influences that would lead him away from this royal life.</P>
      <P>Because of the many legends about his early life, it is difficult to 
      know the truth about Gautama. But it seems fairly clear that he was an 
      intelligent and sincere young man, sensitive to all that went on around 
      him. Possibly because of that sensitivity, his father tried to protect him 
      from knowing about the evil and unhappiness that existed outside the 
      palace walls. The stories tell us that Gautama’s parents surrounded him 
      with luxuries and all material delights. They attempted to make him feel 
      that all life was happiness and pleasure -- that there was no reason to be 
      sad or even very serious. They hoped that Gautama would simply accept the 
      royal life and never question its differences from the lives of other 
      people.</P>
      <P>Like all young people, however, Gautama had to live his life in his own 
      way, in spite of his parents’ planning. While out driving through a park 
      -- so the story goes -- he saw four things that made a lasting impression 
      on him. They were more startling than any previous experiences he had had.</P>
      <P>First, he noticed a trembling old man, broken-toothed, grey-haired, 
      crooked and bent of body, leaning on a staff. For the first time, he 
      realized that old age must come to everyone. Later, Gautama saw a diseased 
      man, quite loathsome to look upon. Gautama became further dismayed, 
      wondering whether everyone has to suffer, sooner or later. The third 
      disturbing sight was a corpse lying by the side of the road. Apparently 
      for the first time, death became real to the young prince. After these 
      sights had caused him to reflect sadly on the impermanence of life and 
      beauty, he chanced to see a monk, decently clad and of serene countenance. 
      It was then that the thought of retiring from the palace life became very 
      real to Gautama.</P>
      <P>The legends tell how his father tried to divert the prince from such 
      serious reflection. Lovely dancing maidens were sent into his palace to 
      entertain him with dance and song. In trying to drive away his sober 
      thoughts, they danced until they collapsed in exhaustion. When Gautama 
      noticed the great alterations in their appearance as they lay in the 
      awkward positions in which they had fallen, he was once more struck with 
      the sadness and ugliness of life. He resolved to leave his comfortable 
      palace immediately. In spite of his baby son and his loyal wife, and in 
      spite of the close watch of his father’s palace guards, Gautama took his 
      leave and sought out the solitude of the forest. He was not to return 
      until many years had passed and until many changes had come in his life.</P>
      <B>
      <P>GAUTAMA’S SEARCH </P>
      </B>
      <P>Gautama had left the palace with his mind filled with questions: What 
      is life? Why is there unhappiness? In the quiet and timeless Indian 
      forests, he looked for the wise men that could help him find the answers. 
      He hoped to find the contentment he had seen on the face of the monk that 
      day in the park. Since the monk had seemingly found it in the religious 
      life, Gautama determined to look to religion also.</P>
      <P>For several years he studied with the best teachers he could find. A 
      very apt pupil, he soon had learned as much as his teachers knew. One of 
      the teachers, impressed with Gautama’s learning, invited him to stay and 
      become a partner with him in teaching others. But Gautama felt he could 
      not teach others when he had not yet found the answers he himself was 
      seeking. He knew the scriptures well, but he had not found contentment 
      there. He knew the Yoga exercises, but he had not found full contentment 
      there.</P>
      <P>Still the burning questions lingered with him: Why was there 
      unhappiness? How could a man be happy?</P>
      <P>He turned more diligently to ascetic practices. He had already left all 
      material pleasure behind. He forced himself to eat less and less, and to 
      meditate more and more. Finally, the legends say, he was living on one 
      grain of rice a day, and he was spending all his time in meditation and 
      study. After six years of persevering search and strenuous self-denial, he 
      was at the point of death. And still he had not found the answers lie 
      sought. One day he collapsed from near-starvation.</P>
      <P>This proved to be a climax of Gautama’s life, for he saw once and for 
      all the futility of what he had been doing. If he continued in his 
      asceticism, he would simply die without finding the answers. What he had 
      been doing, he decided, was as foolish as trying to tie the air into 
      knots. He must go directly to the problem.</P>
      <P>Several friends had followed Gautama admiringly because of his 
      religious zeal, but when he resolved to eat again they left him. He was 
      now alone with his thoughts. He sat down under a tree and began to ponder 
      the problem of unhappiness and suffering. So agitated was he, after 
      spending six years in seeking a solution that he determined to find the 
      answer in thought and meditation before getting up again.</P>
      <B>
      <P>GAUTAMA BECOMES THE BUDDHA </P>
      </B>
      <P>After a day and part of a night, lie had found his answer. He had 
      become enlightened with the new knowledge. He had become the <I>Buddha,
      </I>the &quot;awakened one.&quot; In the joy of his new understanding, he spoke 
      aloud, though there was no one to hear. No longer, he said, was he going 
      to be subject to the unhappiness of the present life or of repeated births 
      in the round of existence; for he had won insight into man’s suffering -- 
      its nature, its cause, and its cessation. He was free from the endless 
      round of anxiety and suffering, free from the sense of sorrow and 
      alienation -- free to <I>live.</P>
      </I>
      <P>Gautama the Buddha then wondered what he should do next. Should he try 
      to teach others what he had found out for himself after years of seeking? 
      Would anyone else understand him? He soon decided that the good news, 
      which was now his, could be shared with equally earnest seekers. So he set 
      off for Benares, where lie knew he would find five of his former 
      associates who had left him when he decided to take food.</P>
      <P>They were the first to hear what he had discovered. His talk to them is 
      usually known as the Sermon on the Turning of the Wheel of the Law. It 
      dealt with the problem of suffering and how to overcome suffering. The 
      points the Buddha emphasized in this first sermon, in the excited joy of 
      his awakening, have formed the basic ideas of Buddhism. Buddhism means the 
      religion of those seeking to be awakened.</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE MIDDLE PATH </P>
      </B>
      <P>The path that Gautama had found was one he was to describe as the 
      &quot;Middle Path&quot; between extremes. The extremes to be avoided were the life 
      of sensual indulgence on the one hand and the life of drastic asceticism 
      on the other. Both led to out-of-balance living. Neither led to the true 
      goal of release from suffering. Many people never realize what 
      over-indulgence in comfort and in sensual pleasures have done to their 
      real questions and their real aims. Some who have discovered the evils of 
      over-indulgence come to regard as wicked anything that gives a sense of 
      pleasure. Both groups are reacting too strongly to the human appetites.</P>
      <P>Gautama discovered that neither extreme was wise, for neither brings 
      happiness. Over-indulgence has the same final effect on a person as has 
      the release of all tension on the strings of a violin. Extreme 
      self-denial, on the other hand, has the same general effect as tightening 
      the strings on a violin until they are at the breaking point. In neither 
      case is there the right attunement. Harmony is lacking because there is 
      either too little tension or too much. It was this lack of attunement or 
      harmony that Gautama considered to be man’s suffering. It was to help men 
      find harmony within themselves and with the universe that he began to 
      teach.</P>
      <P>Before the time of Gautama, the Hindu philosophers had taught that the 
      way to self-knowledge was as narrow as the edge of a razor. Gautama 
      discovered the meaning of this for himself and then thought of a more 
      specific way to teach it to others. In all his teachings, however, he 
      never left his Hindu tradition very far behind. Some people and some books 
      give the impression that Gautama tried to start a new religion, or that he 
      disagreed entirely with the other religious teachers of his day. This is 
      not the case.</P>
      <P>Gautama simply entered the religious search with a different question: 
      What causes so many people to be unhappy? He took the question to the best 
      teachers he could find, and he could not solve the problem with what they 
      taught him. So he lost respect for the philosophers who wanted only to <I>
      talk </I>about release from suffering. Gautama liked to remind them that 
      they were playing around with words. He warned his friends against the 
      many schools of philosophy, because the teachers tended to take their own 
      words too seriously.</P>
      <P>To find the Middle Way to harmonious living, the Buddha declared, each 
      person must search thoughtfully -- not spend his time in wordy arguments. 
      Each person must explore and experiment. &quot;Happiness he who seeks may win, 
      if he practice the seeking,&quot;<I> </I>said the Buddha.</P>
      <B>
      <P>7. WHY AM I UNHAPPY?</P>
      </B>
      <P>Even infants suffer. When they are uncomfortable, they cry. As they 
      grow older, they find other ways of expressing their discomfort. But there 
      is no <I>problem </I>of suffering for an infant, since the infant does not 
      really think about it. He simply reacts. Suffering becomes a problem only 
      when people find themselves asking, <I>&quot;Why </I>do I suffer?&quot; Or, as we 
      most often state it, &quot;Why am I unhappy?&quot;</P>
      <P>Usually by the time we are ten years of age or a little older, there 
      have been at least a few occasions when we have suffered and have also 
      wondered, &quot;Why this suffering?&quot; Apparently, this question did not occur 
      seriously to Gautama until he was about thirty years of age. This was 
      probably because his parents tried to prevent his experiencing any 
      unpleasantness.</P>
      <P>Young people who have grown up in an environment of such 
      over-protection often do not know what it is to face real unhappiness. 
      Personalities of people are different, and the particular rate at which we 
      move from childhood into adolescence varies from one person to another. 
      But, sooner or later, each person has to face the question of the reason 
      for suffering -- his own and that of others.</P>
      <P>Gautama’s whole contribution to the knowledge of mankind centers around 
      the problem of pain or unhappiness. The new knowledge to which he became 
      awakened that night under the tree was about the reason for suffering and 
      how it could be overcome. He first spoke of that knowledge in his sermon 
      to his former colleagues who had left him to go to Benares. The things lie 
      mentioned then have become the cardinal principles of Buddhism, even in 
      this day, and they are called the Four Noble Truths. The first truth, 
      which he tried to state to his friends, was the fact of suffering. </P>
      <B>
      <P>THE FIRST NOBLE TRUTH </P>
      </B>
      <P>Birth is suffering; decay is suffering; illness is suffering; death, 
      ... presence of objects we hate, ... separation from objects we love, ... 
      not to obtain what we desire is suffering... Clinging to existence is 
      suffering.</P>
      <P>When this list is studied, it becomes clear that Gautama was talking 
      about everybody’s experience, not just his own. Birth is uncomfortable, 
      both to the mother and to the child, although the child does not 
      consciously remember it. The birth of a new idea, of a new &quot;self&quot; or 
      personality, can also be quite painful; for old habits and old ideas are 
      difficult to discard. Decay also is painful, whether it is decay of a 
      tooth or decay of one’s morale and confidence. Illness is uncomfortable, 
      both mentally and physically. Both death and the fear of death, for 
      ourselves and for others, constitute suffering. Either the presence of 
      objects we hate or the absence of objects we love is a painful experience. 
      Not obtaining what we have set our hearts on can make us very miserable. 
      And, as we grow keener in our understanding of life, we become aware that 
      clinging to anything can cause us to suffer.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that so many people have said that the Buddha was 
      pessimistic about life, or that he said that all of life was suffering. If 
      we interpret accurately his words as reported in the records, that is not 
      what he said. He did teach that everything holds the <I>possibility </I>of 
      suffering; every phase of life can result in disharmony for a person. The 
      Buddha did not say that all of life <I>is </I>suffering.</P>
      <P>It is clear that Gautama’s interpretation of suffering goes beyond mere 
      physical pain. His strongest emphasis was on suffering of the mind and the 
      emotions. This was the deepest unhappiness. Gautama believed that this 
      suffering was felt by a man who was out of harmony with life. &quot;If I am 
      unhappy, it is because I am not living harmoniously. If I am not living 
      harmoniously, it is because I have not learned to accept the world as it 
      is. Perhaps I am expecting from the world things that I have no right to 
      expect. Perhaps I am clinging too strongly to one part of my world, thus 
      losing touch with the total picture.&quot;</P>
      <P>Gautama tried to take as his starting point an actual fact <I>of </I>
      experience, which no one could question and which each one could see for 
      him. In all human experience, he said, unless there is real understanding, 
      there is an element of pain. He issued the invitation: ‘Look and see for 
      yourself if this is not true of your life.&quot; He asked each person to see 
      that he was not alone in his predicament. All people, sometime in their 
      lives, must face this universal fact -- their disharmony. It is not just 
      &quot;my unhappiness&quot;; it is a problem that all men have. Gautama was reminding 
      his friends that &quot;my sorrow&quot; is &quot;world sorrow&quot; -- and that the sorrow of 
      the world is &quot;mine.&quot;</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE SECOND NOBLE TRUTH </P>
      </B>
      <P>Gautama said to his disciples, &quot;I teach only two things, suffering and 
      release from suffering.&quot; He was like the doctor who comes to see the sick 
      person. First he learns how the patient is feeling. Then he tries to 
      diagnose the cause of the illness. Gautama, like a good physician, 
      proceeded to the Second Noble Truth, the cause of suffering.</P>
      <P>Now this is the Noble Truth as to origin of suffering. It is the 
      craving thirst that causes the renewal of be-comings. This craving thirst 
      is accompanied by sensual delights and seeks satisfaction, now here, now 
      there. It takes the form of craving for the gratification of the senses, 
      or the craving for prosperity.</P>
      <P>Suffering is the result of a wrong attitude toward the world and our 
      experiences in it. The world is not bad, but our attitude of craving is 
      what makes it seem bad. This craving, or excessive desire, makes us slaves 
      of whatever we crave. Everyone has seen this principle in operation -- a 
      craving for food, a craving for popularity, a craving for success. All 
      make us lose our freedom to choose wisely. What Gautama the Buddha wanted 
      people to see is that he who craves cannot be free and thus cannot be 
      really happy.</P>
      <P>You may say that there is a kind of happiness to be found in fulfilling 
      all desires. &quot;If I could just have everything I want and do everything I 
      want to do, I would be so happy.&quot; But that kind of happiness boomerangs 
      quickly, for it does not give the deeper contentment that is man’s real 
      goal. Often we find people depending more and more on such artificial joys 
      because they are actually afraid to face the deep unhappiness and unrest 
      within themselves.</P>
      <P>Gautama advised each person to find for himself the difference between 
      the two kinds of happiness. And he told of his own observations.</P>
      <P>When in following after happiness I have perceived that bad qualities 
      developed and good qualities were diminished, then that kind of happiness 
      is to be avoided. And when following after happiness I have perceived that 
      bad qualities were diminished and good qualities developed, then such 
      happiness is to be followed.</P>
      <P>He gave some further advice to people who were searching for happiness. 
      The craving, which leads to unhappiness, he said, is caused by our 
      ignoring our real needs. If we did not so ignore them, we would not make 
      ourselves unhappy by pursuing things that will never bring satisfaction. 
      This brings us back to the same question that had been raised centuries 
      before by the Hindu wise men: &quot;Who am I really?&quot; Gautama agreed with them 
      that a person is more than the sum of his feelings and thoughts. A person 
      who is wise will always say of any feeling, ‘this is not the real me.&quot; The 
      Buddha taught that worthwhile activity in life should lead to more 
      knowledge of what is the real self, for this brings happiness.</P>
      <P>The things people desire frequently do not satisfy their real needs. 
      One Buddhist story tells how Gautama, on one of his journeys, chanced to 
      meet thirty running men. He stopped to ask what the trouble was, and they 
      told their story. While they had been picnicking, one of their woman 
      companions had sneaked away with the belongings of the others, and the men 
      were in hot pursuit of the thief.</P>
      <P>The Buddha asked one question: &quot;which do you think is better -- to go 
      on chasing this woman or to go tracking the self?&quot; The men decided that 
      searching for the real self was more important than running after 
      belongings. So, the story says, they became followers of Gautama.</P>
      <P>Like the thirty young men, we may be wasting our energies in a 
      fruitless search. If we are wise, we stop to ask ourselves, &quot;What is 
      really worth looking for?&quot; Gautama’s answer is quite direct: We should 
      look for the cause of our cravings, and then we should seek to remove the 
      cause.</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE THIRD NOBLE TRUTH </P>
      </B>
      <P>Suffering ceases with the complete cessation of craving. A person does 
      not have to remain a slave to his cravings, said Gautama. He can do 
      something about his unhappiness. Each person has a choice about the way he 
      lives. He can fill his life with simple, unquestioned, habitual 
      activities, which have arisen because of cravings. Or he can choose his 
      reactions on the basis of each situation he meets. In the first case, the 
      person is acting out of superficial &quot;needs,&quot; in ignorance of his own real 
      needs. In the second case, the person is making possible the realization 
      of his true potentialities. The choice is up to the individual, and it is 
      he who will reap the results.</P>
      <P>For example, a person may once find that by eating something he likes 
      he can take his mind off his troubles. Later on, he may choose to eat 
      something good every time he feels unhappy. But this kind of behavior can 
      hardly solve the problem. Actually, he will be simply adding to his 
      troubles while he ignores them, because he may develop indigestion and 
      excess weight and be filled to the brim with problems that are never 
      solved. This is the kind of situation that Gautama had in mind when he 
      spoke of &quot;the craving thirst that causes the renewal of becoming,&quot; in his 
      Second Noble Truth. By avoiding an actual grappling with the heart of 
      every difficulty, a person causes himself to have one new problem after 
      another. He builds the new problem on the foundation of all his unsolved 
      problems. By doing so, he continually renews his unhappiness.</P>
      <P>When the person meets a new difficulty in the same ineffective way he 
      met old difficulties, he creates new ineffective actions and unwholesome 
      habits. Can this possibly lead to lasting happiness? No, answered the 
      Buddha. Such actions and habits, he further said, come from unexamined and 
      uncontrolled desires. They lead to increasing unhappiness. They keep 
      appearing in a person’s life over and over again, in new ways, and even in 
      new lives, according to Buddhist teaching.</P>
      <P>Buddhists, like Hindus, believe in transmigration. The ineffective 
      actions and unwholesome habits must be lived out or overcome before one is 
      freed from the endless round of lives that constitute a major part of 
      man’s suffering. This is partly what Gautama meant by &quot;clinging to 
      existence&quot; in his First Noble Truth. The whole scheme of transmigration 
      and all unhappiness can be made to cease for a person if he ceases his 
      uncontrolled craving.</P>
      <P>Covetousness, resentment, infatuation -- these are earmarks of craving. 
      Actions arising from them lead to unhappiness. Happiness is gained by 
      ceasing to crave. The kind of character a person builds today determines 
      the happiness he will have tomorrow. The Buddhist would add that the kind 
      of life one lives today determines in part his chances for happiness in 
      his next reincarnation. Buddhists do not speak of a &quot;person&quot; or &quot;soul&quot; -- 
      not even the Hindu Atman -- as passing over to another life. It is the 
      influence of past lives that transmigrates to the next life.</P>
      <P>When a child grows to adulthood, we know that influences from his 
      childhood determine in large measure the kind of adult he will be. And the 
      Buddhists would add that what holds true of one life is true of all 
      conceivable lives, since this earthly life is but one episode among many 
      others.</P>
      <P>One may find it difficult to understand the Buddhist theory of past 
      influences and transmigration when extended to many lives. Yet it is easy 
      to see that such a theory contributes to our understanding of our own 
      lives now. What we are today is determined by everything that has entered 
      into our past, including the history of the human race. What we shall be 
      tomorrow is being determined today by the choices we make. We make the 
      best choice, says the Buddhist, when we choose thoughtfully, overcoming 
      selfish and over-strong desires.</P>
      <B>
      <P>8.HOW I CAN FIND HAPPINESS?</P>
      </B>
      <P>If Gautama had said only, &quot;Cease the desires that lead to unhappiness,&quot; 
      he would have left his followers without any real help. Fortunately, he 
      did not stop his teaching with just advice. He realized that most people 
      needed help in learning how to stop craving. His first sermon concluded 
      with an important Fourth Noble Truth. In giving this last statement of the 
      truths he had discovered, Gautama described the way a person might stop 
      craving. Since Gautama’s time, this way has been called the &quot;Holy 
      Eightfold Path.&quot; The eight steps are specific ways Gautama suggested for 
      people to release themselves from the clutches of their own desires.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>(1) Right Viewpoint</P>
      </B></I>
      <P>The first step toward happiness, Gautama said, is the <I>right 
      viewpoint </I>on unhappiness. Before a person can make any progress, he 
      must look at his problem for what it is. When he sees that it is his 
      ignoring of the true facts of his life that causes his trouble, and when 
      he has accepted his responsibility for that trouble, then he has entered 
      upon the Path. Gautama did not claim to have found an original way to 
      happiness. He described it as being very ancient. But he felt that most 
      people were not aware of it.</P>
      <P>Gautama said that so long as we see life from the wrong viewpoint we 
      would go on craving things as though the things would make us happy. This 
      is a way of deceiving ourselves. We must learn to see for ourselves why it 
      is a delusion. Then we are ready to take the second step, which Gautama 
      called <I>right aspiration</I>.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>(2) Right Aspiration</P>
      </B></I>
      <P>Everyone aspires after something. The trouble is that most of us, in 
      our confused mental and emotional condition, have aspired after the wrong 
      things. We have not focused our desires and efforts on worthwhile 
      objectives. But when we renounce false values that lead us into 
      unhappiness, we are in a position to choose the true values. The Buddha 
      pointed to kindness and love as being true values. Such values can be 
      attained only when a person has gone beyond the point where his primary 
      concern is &quot;I,&quot; &quot;me,&quot; and &quot;mine.’ It is after self-centeredness ceases 
      that true kindness and love are shown in a free and spontaneous way.</P>
      <P>The Buddha’s first two steps in the Path deal with the importance of 
      getting attitudes changed for the better. The next three steps deal with 
      the kind of conduct that ought to flow from right attitudes.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>(3) Right Speech</P>
      </B></I>
      <P>The third step is <I>right speech. </I>A person following the Buddha’s 
      Path can no longer take delight in gossip, slander, and abusive or idle 
      talk. His speech will be controlled, considerate, and thoughtful, because 
      it sterns from kind attitudes toward others. Some people commit worse 
      crimes through what they say than hardened criminals do. Gautama 
      recognized, just as modern psychologists do, that this is a stumbling 
      block to real maturity. </P>
      <I><B>
      <P>(4) Right Behavior</P>
      </B></I>
      <P>The next step in the Buddha’s Path is the important step of <I>right 
      behavior. </I>Gautama did not describe fully the scope of this step. But 
      his followers gradually drew up lists of the things one was not supposed 
      to do. One typical list says that a person must not kill, steal, he 
      impure, lie, or drink intoxicants. However, such negative commandments are 
      incidental to the importance of what Gautama said about behavior. He knew 
      that it was much more important to encourage people to do certain things 
      than to order them not to do others.</P>
      <P>To Gautama, right behavior meant love. Gautama taught that &quot;all that we 
      are is the result of what we have thought.&quot; Therefore, we should not 
      harbor feelings of resentment or hatred. Feelings and thoughts wreck 
      chances for happiness, as truly as do actions. &quot;He abused me, he beat me, 
      he defeated me, he robbed me’ -- in those who harbor such thoughts, hatred 
      will never cease,&quot; warned Gautama. For he had discovered that &quot;hatred does 
      not cease by hatred at any time; hatred ceases by love.&quot; And he said at 
      another time, &quot;Let a man overcome anger by love, let him overcome evil by 
      good.&quot;</P>
      <P>Gautama frequently told his friends that even if they were attacked 
      violently, either with abusive language or with sticks and stones, they 
      were not to fight back or to dwell on resentful thoughts. &quot;If someone 
      curses you, you must suppress all resentment and make the firm 
      determination, ‘my mind shall not he disturbed, and no angry word shall 
      escape my lips. I will remain kind and friendly, and with loving thoughts 
      and no secret spite.’ If then you are attacked with fists, with stones, 
      with sticks, with swords, you must suppress all resentment and preserve a 
      loving mind with no secret spite.&quot;</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>(5) Right Livelihood</P>
      </B></I>
      <P>To a man who was really earnest about finding the true happiness, the 
      fifth step was the next logical one. It is <I>right livelihood. </I>There 
      were certain occupations a man could not engage in without damaging 
      himself and others seriously, Gautama felt. Any business that involved 
      injuring life in any form was not to be followed. This included, for 
      Buddhists, the trade of the butcher, of the vendor of poisons (dopes, 
      drugs, and the like), of the slave trader or the slave owner. One must not 
      engage in making or distributing liquors. Neither must one be a soldier.</P>
      <P>This was in sharp contrast to one teaching of the Hindu religion, with 
      which Gautama was so familiar. Hindus felt that a man was born into his 
      rightful occupation. But the Buddha was convinced that one must not hinder 
      others in his own search for the happiest adjustment to life. Hence a 
      person might have to change his occupation. Gautama himself was surrounded 
      by people who had renounced the normal family life and usual occupations 
      to enter the monastic way of life. Ideally, he thought, all sincere 
      religious seekers would do this. In this way, they would most surely find 
      lasting contentment. Yet later an order of Buddhist laymen was 
      established. And more and more Buddhists through the years have continued 
      to live with their families, finding suitable occupations, rather than 
      leaving such things behind for the monastery.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>(6) Right Effort</P>
      </B></I>
      <P>The sixth step is a move beyond the level of conduct. It is<I> right 
      effort,</I> and to the Buddha those words had a special meaning. Right 
      effort means that one must find for himself his own proper rate of speed 
      on the Holy Eight-Fold Path to true happiness. A religious seeker must not 
      move too slowly or too quickly. And there is no happiness to be gained in 
      trying to keep pace with someone else. You arc yourself, with your own 
      needs and your own tempo. One task in learning to know our true selves is 
      to learn to travel at our own best pace.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>(7) Right Mindfulness</P>
      </B></I>
      <P>Gautama’s seventh emphasis was right <I>mindfulness. </I>He declared 
      that it is the mind that leads man into most of his disharmonious living. 
      Physical desires might be distracting, the Buddha admitted, but usually 
      that is because the vivid imagination creates too many desires. The desire 
      to eat in itself does not make one unhappy. Unhappiness develops from 
      excessive eating or excessive desire to eat. Part of right mindfulness 
      meant learning to see physical desires and everything else for what they 
      actually were, not as the imagination had made them appear.</P>
      <P>The Buddha s aim was to teach people that objects that appeal to the 
      senses have power to make us unhappy because they may lead to <I>excessive 
      desires. </I>He was aware that the average man had a habit of &quot;idealizing&quot; 
      women. He urged his followers to overcome this habit of enslavement to a 
      pretty face. The story is told of a traveler who once asked a Buddhist 
      monk, &quot;Tell me, have you seen a woman walking along this was’?&quot; The monk 
      replied, &quot;I cannot say whether it is a woman or a man that passed this 
      way. This I know, that a set of bones is traveling this road.&quot; This is 
      Buddhist right mindfulness carried to the extreme.</P>
      <P>Gautama hoped that his fellow travelers on the Path would develop 
      calmness in their search for happiness. In that way, each would learn to 
      stand off from himself and observe his own passions as unexcitedly as he 
      might look at the stars in the heavens. Each was to practice considering 
      his emotions for what they were, both externally and internally. This was 
      suggested for both painful and pleasant feelings. The Buddhist monk tries 
      to remember constantly that his feelings are short-lived, coming and 
      going. In this way he is able to hold himself undisturbed by his emotions, 
      not craving anything or clinging to anything. A person who can accept his 
      feelings in this objective way will be less inclined to be swept off his 
      feet by them.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>(8) Right Contemplation</P>
      </B></I>
      <P>The final step in the Path is called <I>right contemplation</I>. 
      Gautama had a great appreciation for some of the prevailing Yoga practices 
      of his day. Although he had not found in Yoga the full answers to his 
      questions about unhappiness, he had been helped by such practices to 
      &quot;silence&quot; his mind. Therefore, he told his followers of its values.</P>
      <P>The Yoga discipline was taught individually. It involved learning how 
      to quiet the irrelevant thoughts of the mind, until the person could come 
      directly to knowledge of his own true needs. This contemplation that 
      Gautama recommended was not a process of reasoning or logic. It was a 
      different way of knowing -- by insight or intuition. Because Gautama 
      recognized that people vary greatly in temperament, he suggested several 
      dozen modes of training the mind for right contemplation. His followers 
      into the Yoga practices that are still important to many zealous Buddhists 
      developed these ways.</P>
      <B>
      <P>NIRVANA </P>
      </B>
      <P>Gautama emphasized that a serious follower of the Eight-Fold Path would 
      achieve Nirvana. The minimum meaning of Nirvana is the extinction of all 
      craving, resentment, and covetousness. As we have seen, to the Buddha such 
      extinction of craving and other improper attitudes was true happiness. 
      Nirvana has another meaning, which is just as important to most Buddhists. 
      That is the release from all future reincarnations, escape from the &quot;Round 
      of Becoming.&quot;</P>
      <P>Just as Buddhists do not speak of a soul or the Atman, so they hesitate 
      to talk about a Supreme Spirit such as Brahman. They feel that such 
      matters cannot be surely determined. Talk, they say, is unimportant. 
      Knowing and searching are important. But whether or not there is a soul or 
      a Supreme Spirit, Buddhists believe there is transmigration. For the 
      influences and habit-tendencies of one life will go on reproducing 
      themselves in one form or another for an indefinite time in the future.</P>
      <P>Nirvana is not a place. It is a condition of the mind. Nirvana is 
      reached after earnest thoughtfulness and vigorous effort. Thoughtfulness 
      is one of the chief virtues of Buddhists. Thoughtlessness is deplored. 
      Buddhists have compared a thoughtless man to a monkey feverishly searching 
      for food in a forest.</P>
      <P>Nirvana does not mean the loss of personal consciousness that comes 
      with death, for Gautama achieved it and then spent many years trying to 
      help others realize it. However, Buddhists soon found it necessary to talk 
      about ultimate Nirvana. This could be achieved after one had died. They 
      called it <I>Parinirvana.</P>
      </I>
      <P>A truly happy person is the one who has given the thought and effort 
      necessary to realize Nirvana. The Buddha did not respect titles or castes 
      -- even the highest castes in India. He said that a man did not reach 
      happiness by the status of the family into which he was born. Had not he 
      himself been born a prince and yet been for a time among the unhappiest of 
      the unhappy? Not by birth, not by wealth, does one discover how to 
      overcome suffering. By seeking to overcome unwholesome desires, by keeping 
      to the practical Eight-Fold Path, by self-knowledge -- by these one 
      attains lasting happiness.</P>
      <B>
      <P>9. WHICH PATH SHALL I TAKE? </P>
      </B>
      <P>Today<B> </B>about one-fifth of the world’s people are Buddhists. The 
      story of their religion goes back to the day Gautama sat under the Bo-tree 
      and arose with a new understanding of life. Buddhism began when Gautama’s 
      five disciples heard him tell about his experiences. They became his 
      followers again, this time with real conviction. If they had kept the good 
      news to themselves, Buddhism would never have begun. As it was, they 
      gladly told all who would hear. The number of followers of the 
      &quot;Enlightened One&quot; slowly grew.</P>
      <P>Gautama spent the rest of his long life teaching and loosely organizing 
      groups of followers. Finally, when he was more than eighty, he died. His 
      saddened followers continued to meet and study and meditate together, held 
      by the memory of his talking and meeting with them. At first they kept 
      very closely to his teachings. They showed the power of his influence by 
      their insistence on doing just what they would have done had he been still 
      with them.</P>
      <P>Gradually some of them began to see and show things that reminded them 
      of their master. These things became symbols of Buddhism. The Bo-tree, the 
      &quot;Tree of Wisdom,&quot; reminds Buddhists of his enlightenment. The lotus 
      blossom is a reminder that any person can rise up, just as pure, from 
      whatever surroundings. The Buddhist wheel is a reminder of the Buddha’s 
      first sermon on eternal truth and the endless Round of Becoming. The monks 
      would turn the wheel as a symbol of putting the law of eternal truth into 
      motion.</P>
      <P>Sometime during the early years after his death, Gautama’s followers 
      wrote down his sayings and teachings, dividing them into three sections. 
      This scriptural work is known as the <I>Tripitaka, </I>which means &quot;Three 
      Baskets.&quot; Other important Buddhist teachers interpreted some of these 
      scriptures. They, too, said things that Buddhists wished to remember. 
      Additions were made to the scriptures.</P>
      <P>Gradually, followers of Gautama began to differ in their opinions on 
      what was most important in the search for understanding of life. The early 
      disagreements grew and developed into two great branches. The branch of 
      Buddhism that claims to have changed least from the form of the Buddha’s 
      teaching is <I>Hinayana </I>or Southern Buddhism. Hinayana Buddhists 
      dwell, for the most part, in Thailand, Ceylon, and Burma. The larger 
      branch is Mahayana or Northern Buddhism, which is a dominant religion of 
      China, Japan, Korea, and Tibet.</P>
      <P>The two terms have an interesting meaning. Hinayana means &quot;small 
      vehicle&quot; and indicates that a small number of people are able to achieve 
      release from life’s sorrow by its rigorous discipline. Mahayana means 
      &quot;great vehicle’ and means that a large number of people are able to 
      fulfill its requirements along the path to salvation.</P>
      <P>Neither of these branches is a real force in the religious life of 
      India, the mother country of Buddhism. It was a long time after Gautama’s 
      life before people came to look upon Buddhism as a religion apart from 
      Hinduism. After missionary monks had begun to carry Buddhist ideas to 
      other lands, the Indian people slowly began to reject it as a separate 
      religion, mostly because its teachings did not include some ideas and 
      practices that had been a part of their traditions and their society for 
      centuries. Since some Hindus, the influence of the gentle, adopted a few 
      of the Buddha’s ideas thoughtful prince survives in modern India. However, 
      the Buddha’s contributions to religious truth live on largely in other 
      lands. And in these other lands of the Far East, much of the full glory of 
      Buddhism has been achieved.</P>
      <B>
      <P>HINAYANA BUDDHISM: THE PATH OF SELF-RELIANCE </P>
      </B>
      <P>In Thailand, Ceylon, and Burma, there are many devoted Buddhists, who 
      believe themselves to be following the way of life taught by the master 
      teacher, Gautama. The underlying basis of their faith is that one is 
      responsible for his own salvation. A person’s past, present, and future -- 
      all are up to him. As the Buddha taught, so they believe. There is no god 
      who can arrange that salvation. No one can do it for you.</P>
      <P>The truly devout Hinayana Buddhist is the <I>arhat, </I>whose first 
      duty is his own salvation. He works diligently to achieve release from the 
      sorrow of many lives. He loses himself in the search for release by 
      concentrating on the teaching and philosophy that come from the teachings 
      of Gautama. His material needs for food, shelter, and clothing are limited 
      to the very minimum. Even these are usually supplied by other believers, 
      who cannot break all ties in the way the <I>arhat </I>has done. They hope 
      to gain merit through helping him.</P>
      <P>As in all other religions, there are few people who can and do put 
      everything else second to the religious search. Recognizing this fact, the 
      monks teach the people who have no other way of learning the truths as the 
      Buddha taught them. There are no priests in Hinayana Buddhist communities, 
      but there is an active order of monks. They teach the people what they 
      consider to be essential: to grow spiritually every day and to show 
      kindness to all things. Present-day Buddhists learn what Gautama taught 
      the lay people who flocked to learn from him. They are expected to observe 
      the first five rules of the ancient order of monks. They are also taught 
      to recite the universal Buddhist statement of the &quot;refuges&quot;:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>I take refuge in the Buddha;<BR>
        I take refuge in the Doctrine;<BR>
        I take refuge in the Order.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The teachings of the monks spread throughout the Hinayana Buddhist 
      lands because almost all the young boys spend time in monasteries as a 
      part of their education. There they take part in study, in religious 
      ceremonies, in meditation, and in all other activities of the monastery. 
      The monks who teach them emphasize the most important idea in Hinayana 
      Buddhism -- which they must learn to be responsible for their own 
      religious development. They are encouraged to examine and question 
      religious traditions. They are not to accept a doctrine or a practice that 
      is not helpful in their search for Nirvana. They learn the values of 
      self-control and moderation in all things.</P>
      <P>After such an education, some of the boys decide to become ordained and 
      live as monks the rest of their lives. Everyone is pleased at this turn of 
      events, since all believers feel that this is the only way to assure 
      release from the endless and sorrowful cycle of lives. The family, however 
      saddened they may be at what amounts to a loss of their son, comfort 
      themselves with the remembrance that they must not cling overmuch to 
      anything. They know that he is working to attain Nirvana. There are solemn 
      ceremonies to mark monastic vows. The boy dramatizes the Great 
      Renunciation that Gautama made, when he left his family and his kingdom, 
      took up his monk’s robe and begging bowl, and set out in search of 
      salvation.</P>
      <P>Buddhists believe that the teachings of Gautama still apply to life in 
      the twentieth century, because they came straight from Gautama’s grappling 
      with life. Since his wisdom came directly, out of what happened to him and 
      not out of books, present-day Hinayana Buddhists are encouraged to go 
      through the same kind of learning process he did. Most of them decided 
      that their Master was right in his understanding of the nature of sorrow 
      and how to overcome it. Therefore, generation after generation of 
      Buddhists find the age-old teachings valuable. This is the reason that the 
      Hinayana Buddhists of today are still very close to the spirit of the 
      earliest Buddhists in ancient India.</P>
      <P>Like most religions, Hinayana Buddhism has been with its people so long 
      that some social customs now seem to be a part of the religion. Even very 
      young children are taught the need of self-control, of the Oriental 
      respect and reverence for parents, neatness of person and home, serenity 
      of emotions and bearing. In some homes and in temples there are idols or 
      statues of the Buddha, beside which the people lay white flowers as a sign 
      of their reverence.</P>
      <P>Shot through all the colorful but serene fabric of Hinayana Buddhism 
      are the essential ideas. Man must make himself wise for his own salvation, 
      starting <I>now. </I>He must show sympathy and peace in his dealings with 
      all living beings. He must learn to control all his thoughts and his 
      actions, because these are what make up himself in this life, and these 
      are what influence all succeeding lives.</P>
      <P>No act or thought stops upon your completion of it. It continues in 
      what it causes to happen. If you become angry and give a tongue-lashing to 
      a friend, that is not the end of the act and the words. The friend, hurt 
      by your anger, may react in anger at you or even at another. In that way 
      the act continues and lives on in other acts. The same cycle is the way of 
      the kind act also. Your show of kindness toward a person or even an animal 
      causes the receiver of the kindness to act in the same way to a third 
      party.</P>
      <P>A man reaps what he sows. Buddhists believe that character is made up<B>
      </B>of the thoughts and actions that a person has sown: The <I>effects </I>
      of the thoughts and actions are what is reborn -- not the &quot;inner self&quot; or 
      the soul. A person has only to think of the life lived by Gautama, who 
      taught more by example than by words. He has shown men that all can 
      educate themselves to enlightenment and Nirvana, even if it takes more 
      than one lifetime. The effects of Gautama’s good and kind thoughts and 
      actions have continued until today and will for all time, even though 
      Gautama released himself from the wheel of rebirth. Everyone is able to do 
      what Gautama did. </P>
      <B>
      <P>MAHAYANA BUDDHISM: THE PATH OF MUTUAL AID </P>
      </B>
      <P>In its own way, Mahayana Buddhism is very different from Hinayana 
      Buddhism. This Northern Buddhism dates from the years immediately 
      following the death of Gautama, when his followers were yearning for the 
      old days when he was with them. Always they treated his memory with 
      reverence. Some of them soon came to attach special importance to anything 
      that reminded them of his life. The meeting places of some disciples 
      gradually began to look like temples. Profound changes took place in the 
      interpretations of the scriptures. These newer forms of Buddhism took the 
      name Mahayana. Mahayana arose to meet the spiritual needs of the simple, 
      hard-working, common people.</P>
      <P>Mahayana Buddhists believe that they are right in their efforts to get 
      help with their religious growth. They point to the Buddha’s own example 
      of unselfish service in teaching others how to find the path to Nirvana, 
      even when he himself had reached the goal. Love such as he had thus shown 
      became the supreme teaching of the different schools and sects of Mahayana 
      Buddhism. Mahayana Buddhists do not idealize the <I>arhat, </I>who 
      &quot;wandered lone as a rhinoceros,&quot; looking for Nirvana. Instead, they have a 
      loving respect for a compassionate saint, a Bod<I>hisattva. </I>This is a 
      person who is so attuned to the sufferings and hopes of all human beings 
      that he refuses to enter into Nirvana himself until all others can enter 
      with him. This is the dominant ideal in Chinese and Japanese Buddhism.</P>
      <P>The story of Amitabha (or Amida, as he is called in Japan) illustrates 
      the <I>Bodhisattva’s </I>place in Mahayana Buddhism. Although Amitabha was 
      originally a <I>Bodhisattva, </I>be is now referred to as a Buddha, since 
      in Mahayana Buddhism there are many Buddha’s. Amitabha Buddha is next to 
      Gautama in the hearts of Northern Buddhists. (In northern lands, Gautama 
      is called Sakyamuni Buddha, meaning &quot;the sage of the Sakya clan,&quot; to whom 
      his family belonged.) According to legends, Amitabha was a man who lived 
      infinite ages ago. He made a vow that he would devote all of his wisdom 
      and merits to the saving of others. Through the years, he built up what 
      might be called a &quot;Treasury of Merit,&quot; a tremendous checking account of 
      goodness. Mahayana Buddhists believe that anyone in need of merit can draw 
      upon this account by meditating upon the compassion of Amitabha and 
      calling upon his name.</P>
      <P>In Buddhist writings, the checking account is often referred to as the 
      &quot;Ship of Amitabha’s Vow.&quot; The &quot;Ship of the Vow&quot; is designed to carry 
      individuals across the floods of life to a &quot;Pure Land&quot; or Western 
      Paradise, which Amitabha established for all those who would have faith in 
      him. Amitabha is the central figure of some schools and sects in Mahayana 
      Buddhism. These groups comprise what is called &quot;Pure Land&quot; Buddhism, 
      because they believe that anyone who has faith in Amitabha will enter into 
      the Western Paradise upon death, and thus escape indefinitely the sorrow 
      of rebirth:</P>
      <P>The best-known Bodhisattva is Kwan-Yin (Kwannon in Japan), who is a 
      goddess of mercy. Ancient stories tell Mahayana Buddhists that she lived 
      long ago. She was so filled with love and kindness for all mankind that 
      she took a vow to help any persons anywhere who needed her. She would not 
      even enter Paradise upon her death. Instead, she went to live on an 
      island, where there is now a temple to symbolize her presence. Buddhists 
      may pray to her for aid in the task of collecting enough merit to escape 
      transmigration. Some make pilgrimages to the temple on her island in the 
      Eastern Sea of China.</P>
      <P>The basic idea in both these stories is mutual helpfulness. Buddhists 
      tell us that these arc legends written in picture-language. They are 
      designed to show us that we are not independent. We are part of the 
      interdependence of all of life. The influence of my thoughts and deeds is 
      intertwined with the influence of yours. No one is an island, all by 
      himself in the sea of life. Each person is a part of the mainland. An 
      artist drawing a picture to symbolize our lives would not draw vertical 
      threads stretching up from each of us to some heaven above. He would 
      instead draw a complex net of threads, because each individual contributes 
      to all others. Therefore, Buddhists believe that Amitabha and Kwan-Yin 
      give of their merits to all.</P>
      <P>A Buddhist poet has beautifully expressed the idea of what the 
      Bodhisattva is and what he does:</P>
      <P>I would be a protector of the unprotected, a guide to wayfarers, a 
      ship, a dyke, and a bridge for them who seek the further shore; a lamp for 
      them who need a lamp, a bed for them who need a bed, a slave for all 
      beings who need a slave.</P>
      <P>If I fulfill not my vow by deeds, I shall be false to all beings, and 
      what a fate will be mine... If I labor not this very day, down, down I 
      fall.</P>
      <P>Wherever Mahayana Buddhism has attracted large numbers of believers, 
      there are monks, philosophers, and students. There is also an organized 
      religion with many gods, and with temples, priests, and ceremonies. It is 
      still desirable to become a monk if it is possible, but there are many 
      ways for a layperson to take part in his religion. There are rituals of 
      individual worship and chanting services led by the monks. Some sects have 
      sermons and hymn singing in their services. Some have &quot;Sunday schools.’ In 
      some places, the Young Men’s Buddhist Association is a well-known feature. 
      Some large cities in the United States have Buddhist churches where you 
      may see some of these new forms of worship.</P>
      <P>Most Mahayana Buddhists stress that Sakyamuni Buddha was not just a man 
      who lived in a certain time and in a certain place. He was much more than 
      that. He was a disclosure of eternal truth. Whenever a person worships the 
      Buddha, he is actually worshiping the eternal Buddha-nature, which Gautama 
      revealed. The world is not so made that this revelation could come only in 
      our age. Mahayana Buddhists believe that there have been other Buddha’s in 
      other ages. They look for the coming of Maitreya, the future Buddha in the 
      next age. In all, they speak of untold numbers of Buddha’s, who have 
      revealed Truth to men of every age. Present in them was the same 
      Buddha-nature, which can be discovered in everyone. All can achieve 
      enlightenment or Buddha hood. Many say that <I>Bodhisattvas </I>are the 
      Buddha’s of some future age.</P>
      <P>There is another side of Mahayana Buddhism, which is quite different 
      from the ideas we have been examining. It is called Ch’an in China and Zen 
      in Japan. In Japan there is an active church based on its philosophy, but 
      it is primarily a school of thought to which many monks belong. Zen does 
      not stress any of the ideas about saviors, a Western Paradise, faith, or 
      god. Its philosophers say that all ideas and religious practices are like 
      shells which must be broken if the egg is to be eaten. People cling to 
      ideas and practices, forgetting what it is they attempt to explain or 
      show. To cling to ideas is like trying to cling to the wind or capture it 
      in a box. The wind eludes you. So does Truth, if you limit yourself to one 
      thought or one act.</P>
      <P>To the Zen Buddhist, teachers, books, or scriptures can be only 
      pointers -- like a finger pointing at the moon. Small children always look 
      at the finger, which points, rather than at the thing to which it points. 
      Most adults also become much more preoccupied by the pointer than by that 
      to which it points. The mind, the mouth, the eye, the ear, and the hand 
      provide us with opinions, impressions, and actions. But these are only 
      ways of describing or showing what has happened to us. The danger is that 
      we become wrapped up in our opinions and impressions and actions and 
      forget the experience that caused them. It is like putting too much value 
      on a frame, rather than on the picture it was designed to enhance. Or it 
      is like treasuring the cover of a book and forgetting the story in it.</P>
      <P>Zen Buddhists say that you find truth only in your experience, not in 
      thinking about it or listening to someone talk about his experience. To 
      understand the meaning of life, one must live, not make up theories about 
      it. One day a famous Zen teacher who liked to shock his pupils threw all 
      of the statues of the Buddha into the fire to provide more warmth in the 
      room. This is what Zen says everyone must do with all of his ideas -- burn 
      them up so that they will not clutter tip one’s mind unduly. All theories 
      must be broken like so many clay idols. Zen Buddhists even teach that if a 
      person says the word ‘Buddha&quot; he should wash out his mouth.</P>
      <P>Zen teachers know that by word of mouth they cannot teach the truth 
      that comes only from experience. When young men come asking about Nirvana 
      or the Buddha, Zen teachers often answer with anything that comes into 
      their minds, however absurd. Or they may resort to a sort of &quot;shock 
      therapy&quot; in which they strike the pupils. They hope that such a surprising 
      answer will startle the pupils into understanding. They repeatedly tell 
      their disciples that concentration upon a problem will not bring an 
      answer, because you merely become tangled in your own thinking. You must 
      live a life of moderation and kindness and go about your daily activities, 
      learning to question your impressions and thoughts. Suddenly some day you 
      will understand.</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE OUTREACH OF BUDDHISM </P>
      </B>
      <P>No section of the world is changing more rapidly than the Far East. 
      Conditions in Buddhist lands have changed many times since Gautama first 
      developed his answers to the riddle of why men suffer. Both Mahayana and 
      Hinayana Buddhism have proved adaptable to changing conditions and to 
      different peoples. </P>
      <P>The world of tomorrow will grow out of the world of today. So Buddhism 
      will probably continue to be a real influence in the lives of our Far 
      Eastern neighbors. Mahayana Buddhism is widening its influence by sending 
      missionaries to new sections, in the belief that what the Buddha 
      discovered can help almost everyone.</P>
      <P>&quot;Why am I unhappy?&quot; The Buddha suggests: Because you fill yourself with
      <I>wanting, </I>until the wanting is a thirst that cannot be satisfied 
      even by the things you want.</P>
      <P>&quot;How can I be happy?&quot; By ceasing to want. Just as a fire dies down when 
      no fuel is added, so your unhappiness will end when the fuel of excessive 
      desire is taken away. When you conquer selfish, unwise habits and hopes, 
      your real happiness will emerge.</P>
