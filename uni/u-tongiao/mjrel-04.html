      <P>12. SHINTO: THE WAYS OF THE GODS </P>
      </B>
      <P>There are many people who think that Shinto, the native religion of the 
      Japanese, no longer exists, or that it is rapidly dying. They think it 
      began to decline with Japan’s surrender at the end of the Second World 
      \Var. But traditional beliefs and customs have a way of living on. It is 
      never possible to decree or legislate faith out of existence. Japan’s 
      defeat in World War II and the American occupation for some years 
      following have undoubtedly changed some religious ceremonies and 
      practices. Still there is something that cannot be changed. It is the 
      underlying religious spirit of the Japanese. They call it Shinto, the &quot;way 
      of the gods.&quot;</P>
      <P>The Japanese share the Oriental respect for their cultural inheritance. 
      In the last hundred years, this reverence for the past has been put to the 
      strongest test one could imagine. Japan has survived what amounted to a 
      revolution -- the onslaught of Western industrialization and ideas, and 
      two world wars, one of which led to crushing defeat. No other country has 
      had to move so rapidly from feudalism into industrialism. Yet her people 
      still meet each day with an appreciation of its beauty, a strong respect 
      for each other, and a deep devotion to their country.</P>
      <P>It is true that Japanese ideas are changing. But since Japan’s history 
      has shown more flux during the past eighty years than in the previous 
      thousand, it is difficult to chart the changes. We must remember that the 
      future comes from the present, as the present was derived from the past. 
      Therefore, it is safe to assume that the values dearest to the Japanese 
      will go with them into the future.</P>
      <B>
      <P>KINSHIP WITH NATURE </P>
      </B>
      <P>A Japanese would probably ask, &quot;What is life?&quot; The question &quot;What is my 
      life?&quot; would not occur to him. He sees himself as only part of the living, 
      inspiring wonder of everything that exists. He has a feeling of nearness 
      to nature that the average European or American does not have. The 
      Japanese have always felt the lure of the outdoor spaces -- the sand, the 
      wind, the stars, the waves, the hum of the insects, and the music of a 
      waterfall.</P>
      <P>The Japanese believe that the same wonderful forces that move in nature 
      move in themselves. There is no difference. There is no dividing line 
      between divine and human. For this reason, a person’s religion and his 
      life have entered into each other so that it is almost impossible to tell 
      where one begins and the other ends. Those who claim that Shinto is not a 
      religion are probably confused by this tendency. To the thoughtful 
      Japanese, this is as it should be. Why should religion be something &quot;added 
      onto&quot; a person’s life?</P>
      <P>The Japanese find comfort and inspiration in the beauties of their 
      surroundings. They have built their shrines in spots of breath-taking 
      beauty. They try to keep themselves constantly attuned to the loveliness 
      all about them:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Even in a single leaf of a tree<BR>
        Or a tender blade of grass,<BR>
        The awe-inspiring Deity<BR>
        Manifests Itself.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The practice of beauty leads the Japanese to participate in ceremonies 
      and festivals that may seem strange to us. The Insect-Hearing Festival is 
      an example of this. On a quiet evening in the early weeks of autumn, the 
      emperor and thousands of his subjects sit quietly and listen to the noises 
      of various insects. Just as typical is the story of the Zen Buddhist 
      teacher who stepped before his class one day to give a lecture. He paused 
      to listen to the song of a bird outside the window, and then he dismissed 
      the class. There are sermons in nature -- and the Japanese hear them 
      freely.</P>
      <P>At the time of the blossoming of the cherry trees, the Japanese often 
      close their shops and go to the parks and to the country, to enjoy the 
      beauty of the blossoms before they fall. Sometimes they spend evenings 
      gazing at the moon. Or they will sit for hours, contemplating the beauty 
      of a garden, or a flower arrangement, or even a single twig or leaf.</P>
      <P>Admiring the beauty about them has led them to cultivate beauty in 
      their own homes and yards and in all their arts and crafts. Painstakingly 
      they have sought to capture the inspiration that life and nature offer 
      them. Sometimes they use poems to express their feeling of kinship with 
      nature.</P>
      <P>Usually, the Japanese write poetry that is quite short, with just 
      enough description to convey their feelings. Often, of course, their 
      poetry does not impart the same feelings to someone else, particularly a 
      reader from another country. But one interprets for himself. Who is to say 
      what a poem ought to mean?</P>
      <P>Here are several examples of Japanese nature poetry, which may mean as 
      much or as little as the reader can find in them:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>On the plum blossoms<BR>
        Thick fell the snow;<BR>
        I wished to gather some<BR>
        To show to thee,<BR>
        But it melted in my hands.<BR>
        <BR>
        Among the hills<BR>
        ‘The snow still lies -- But the willows<BR>
        Where the torrents rush together Are in full bud.<BR>
        <BR>
        To what shall I compare<BR>
        This life of ours?<BR>
        It is like a boat<BR>
        Which at daybreak rows away<BR>
        And leaves no trace behind it.<BR>
        <BR>
        The sky is a sea<BR>
        Where the cloud-billows rise;<BR>
        And the moon is a bark;<BR>
        To the groves of the stars<BR>
        It is oaring its way.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>
      <P>THE IMPORTANCE OF PURITY </P>
      </B>
      <P>The sky, the flowers, the trees, and the beautiful land speak to the 
      Japanese of beauty and purity. For centuries, the Japanese have looked 
      upon such sights with reverence. They have felt awe in the presence of the 
      pure loveliness of which they are so deeply aware. They have wished to be 
      worthy of it. This has prompted them to strive for inner and outer purity.</P>
      <P>A Japanese does not approach a shrine, whether in his own home or in a 
      public place, without first going through a ceremony of cleansing. There 
      are special water troughs near the public shrines, from which a worshiper 
      may dip the water for washing his hands and rinsing his mouth. Only after 
      he has purified himself in this way does he think himself worthy to 
      worship at the shrine. Thoughtful Japanese realize that this is a symbol 
      of inner purity, which does not really depend on outward cleansing.</P>
      <P>Japanese homes are models of cleanliness and order. The god shelf -- 
      center of Shinto worship in the home -- is kept spotless. The shelters of 
      the shrines are rebuilt frequently so that no decay will mar the place of 
      beauty.</P>
      <P>In old Japan, there was a semi-annual observance called the Great 
      Purification. All the people took part in the ceremony by rubbing slips of 
      paper over their bodies and then burning them or throwing them into a 
      river, lake, or ocean. Then the emperor, speaking for the Sun Goddess, 
      would pronounce all the people to be pure again. Long, long ago, the 
      ancient Japanese had probably believed that cleanliness of body was 
      important to the gods. Later Japanese came to think that the gods desired 
      moral purity as well. The Great Purification ceremonies are a symbol of 
      both.</P>
      <P>Such ceremonies serve to make people feel right again with themselves 
      and with the world. Shintoists have considered it to be very important to 
      hold the ceremonies regularly, so that all may feel free of impurity. They 
      do not worry about personal sins or errors. They are so interested in all 
      their people that they feel a shared guilt for everyone’s accumulated 
      shortcomings and impurities. This group guilt makes them seek purification 
      for the whole society of Japanese.</P>
      <B>
      <P>DEVOTION TO JAPAN </P>
      </B>
      <P>The Japanese read the classical myths of the beginnings of their land 
      in the old &quot;Chronicles of Japan,&quot; the <I>Nihojigi, </I>and &quot;The Records of 
      Ancient Matters,’ the <I>Kojiki</I>. They read of how the Sun Goddess, <I>
      Amaterasu</I>, sent her grandson to he the first ruler of the islands. 
      This is what she told him: &quot;I think that this land will undoubtedly be 
      suitable for the extension of the heavenly task, so that its glory should 
      fill the universe. It is, doubtless, the center of the world.&quot;</P>
      <P>This same high estimate of their country has been a first consideration 
      of the Japanese people. They are passionately devoted to their beautiful 
      islands. They work the soil with unlimited patience. They tend their 
      gardens and parks and farms with loving skill.</P>
      <P>Other peoples have long since become acquainted with the intense 
      loyalty the Japanese have for their country, their countrymen, and their 
      emperor. It stems from their feeling that they are the descendants of the 
      gods, that their country is the land chosen by the gods, and that their 
      emperor is the direct descendant of <I>Amaterasu. </I>This tradition, in 
      addition to the fact that for centuries the Japanese lived almost isolated 
      on their islands, has been largely responsible for the &quot;spirit of Japan.&quot;</P>
      <P>Each Japanese is interested in all Japanese. What is good for the whole 
      of Japan is what each Japanese wishes for himself. The total welfare of 
      the nation is involved. Their emperor reminds them of their divine descent 
      and their responsibility to their nation. It is because of this that the 
      Japanese were so devoted to the royal household, prior to the end of World 
      War II.</P>
      <P>To the Japanese loyalty is such a virtue that their soldiers have often 
      sacrificed their lives without the slightest hesitation. In fact, they 
      have sometimes been eager to do so, believing that their spirits would 
      then help to protect their country. Partly, the emphasis upon courage and 
      loyalty stems from the very recent feudal past of Japan, when knights were 
      taught to be steadfast soldiers. Although feudalism has been replaced, 
      this much has carried over into the present. Loyalty and honor still 
      suggest divine attitudes to the Japanese.</P>
      <B>
      <P>WILLINGNESS TO LEARN </P>
      </B>
      <P>Their fervent interest in their own culture has not kept the Japanese 
      from learning from other people. They have borrowed philosophy and ethics 
      from Confucianists, religion and art from Buddhists, and industrial 
      techniques from Westerners. But when trade in goods and ideas did come, 
      Japan received them in her own way. On Japanese soil, these became 
      Japanese.</P>
      <P>In religion, the Japanese have learned much from what the Chinese 
      Confucianists and Buddhists could teach them. But Shinto remains the 
      religious-patriotic personality of the Japanese people. For a time, State 
      Shinto -- or Shrine Shinto -- was taught in the schools in the form of 
      certain ceremonials, and was administered by a special branch of the 
      government. Recently this has been changed, and some of the seasonal 
      festivals are no longer widely observed. Today, when a Japanese calls 
      himself Shintoist, he may mean that he is a member of one of a number of 
      Shinto sects. Or he may mean that he respects and reveres the traditions 
      of the past as the &quot;way of the gods&quot; underlying even Buddhism or other 
      religions.</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE GOODNESS OF MEN </P>
      </B>
      <P>The Japanese find life very good, and they are glad to accept it as it 
      is. They are not inclined to question it. They take life in a more joyous 
      way than the followers of some religions. Even Buddhists in Japan do not 
      dwell at much length on life’s sorrow. Shintoists feel &quot;at home&quot; in the 
      world. They believe that the gods desire their happiness and well being. 
      Life is good, and men are good. How could it be otherwise, when the gods 
      have created them.?</P>
      <P>The Shinto religion has no list of commandments, no set of moral rules 
      to be followed. More than 150 years ago, one Japanese scholar wrote: &quot;It 
      is because the Japanese were truly moral in their practice that they 
      required no theory of morals, and the fuss made by the Chinese about 
      theoretical morals is owing to their laxity in practice.&quot;</P>
      <P>Another Japanese of the same period pointed out that human beings have 
      been produced &quot;by the spirit of the two Creative Deities&quot; (Izanagi and 
      Izanami). Therefore, they are naturally endowed with the knowledge of what 
      they ought to do and what they ought to refrain from. &quot;It is unnecessary 
      for them to trouble their heads with systems of morality,&quot; he added.</P>
      <P>Since the Japanese feel that human beings are really good, they have 
      never worried about being sinful. Men may make mistakes, which might be 
      called &quot;sins,&quot; but they are not <I>full </I>of sin. A Japanese worships 
      more through giving thanks than through reciting his shortcomings and 
      seeking forgiveness for them. No Shintoist is taught to think of himself 
      as &quot;a worm in the dust.&quot;</P>
      <P>Shintoists have never been concerned with an idea of an afterlife. 
      There are no teachings about a life beyond the grave, and Shintoists do 
      not pray for a future bliss. They pray for much more specific things such 
      as food, happiness, the welfare of the nation, and to express thanks. 
      Whatever Shinto lacks in not emphasizing a life beyond death, Buddhism has 
      supplied to the Japanese people. The people in Japan, like the people in 
      China, are inclined to combine teachings from various religions.</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE GODS</P>
      </B>
      <P>Most Shintoists speak of &quot;the gods.&quot; For the majority of Shintoists, 
      there are many gods and goddesses, who present all human interests and all 
      phases of nature. Thoughtful Shintoists may speak of ‘the divine.&quot; To 
      them, there is a divinity in all-natural things -- for there is nothing 
      supernatural. This quality of the divine is in man as well, although he 
      does not understand how it can be so. The reverence paid to many gods and 
      to the spirits of heroes and famous men is simply recognition of the 
      divinity that is present in all life.</P>
      <P>The more thoughtful persons in modern Japan have come to believe in one 
      God. Or, they might explain it as a belief in one source for the divine 
      quality of all life. </P>
      <P>But Shinto has largely thrived on the belief in many gods. Records from 
      901 A.D. tell of three thousand shrines in Japan, where over three 
      thousand deities were worshiped. By 1914, there were over 190,000 shrines 
      in Japan. Some of these were major shrines, visited by hundreds of 
      thousands of people during a year. Others were simple wayside shrines in 
      the outlying districts.</P>
      <P>The Sun Goddess, Amaterasu, is the center of Shinto worship. Her 
      brother, the Storm God, is widely honored, and so is the Food Goddess. All 
      the gods are descendants of the original divine pair. who gave birth to 
      the islands of Japan, as well as to the hosts of other deities. They are 
      called Izanagi, the Sky Father, and Izanami, the Earth Mother. Japanese 
      mythology fills in the details of the story of creation, including the 
      account of how Izanagi ordered Amaterasu to rule over the Plain of High 
      heaven. For many years, Amaterasu has been the symbol of everything most 
      precious in the development of the Japanese people.</P>
      <P>At the time when Amaterasu dispatched her grandson to rule over Japan, 
      she gave him the three most sacred objects in the Shinto religion. The 
      imperial jewels, which are kept in the Tokyo palace, are symbols of 
      obedience and gentleness. The sword, kept in the shrine at Owari, 
      represents wisdom and justice. And the mirror, housed in the Ise shrine, 
      symbolizes righteousness and purity. Shintoists have believed that the 
      myths and objects serve to remind them of the divine mandate by which 
      their emperors rule.</P>
      <B>
      <P>SHINTO WORSHIP</P>
      </B>
      <P>Since the recent war there have been dramatic changes in Japanese life 
      and manners. It is impossible to predict how the ancient ceremonies of 
      Shinto will be continued in the years ahead. The peace treaty signed 
      between Japan and the United States and the withdrawal of occupation 
      forces may lead to a re-emphasis on native Japanese culture. Or it may 
      not. The emperor, by his own decree, has stated that he is no longer to be 
      regarded as divinely descended from the Sun Goddess. Yet the habits and 
      feelings of loyal Japanese subjects may have been barely affected by his 
      statement.</P>
      <P>The Japanese continue to go to the shrines of their different gods and 
      goddesses, to pray for good crops or food or national prosperity. They 
      cleanse themselves in the customary way and clap their hands to show 
      respect, as Oriental people often do. Then they give an offering of money 
      or rice, take off their shoes, and enter the prayer hall.</P>
      <P>Shintoists use, not images of their gods, but symbols of them. On their 
      god shelves are tablets or slips of paper on which are written the names 
      of the gods they wish to honor. A light burns there, and the family places 
      flowers and a bit of wine or rice cake there daily, if possible. Loyal 
      Shintoists try to hold brief prayer ceremonies before the god shelf each 
      day.</P>
      <P>Shinto priests, who may live just as other men do, lead official 
      services on important religious days. They do not preach at regular 
      services each week. They are responsible for protecting the sacred objects 
      in the shrines. Frequently they have another occupation besides the 
      priesthood.</P>
      <P>Shinto shrines have a special gateway, called a <I>torri. </I>No one 
      knows exactly how this attractive structure came to be a part of the 
      shrines; its real origin is lost in antiquity. Probably it was used years 
      ago for hanging the birds that were offered as a sacrifice to the Sun 
      Goddess. Although it no longer serves that purpose, yet a <I>torri </I>
      stands at the entrance to every Shinto shrine. Sometimes there is a row of 
      them. The <I>torri </I>is a distinctive symbol of the Shinto religion.</P>
      <B>
      <P>SHINTO SECTS </P>
      </B>
      <P>The Shinto shrines or &quot;churches&quot; found in other countries are not part 
      of State Shinto but sectarian forms of Shinto. We might call them 
      denominations. They are not state-supported and do not depend upon the 
      favor of the Japanese emperor. American-Japanese followers usually prefer 
      not to refer to these movements by the name Shinto.</P>
      <P>Most of the sects, however, incorporate into their teachings and rites 
      many elements of State Shinto and of Buddhism as well. In Japan, thirteen 
      such sects are officially recognized; but there are many others not 
      officially listed. Many of them have adopted the educational and 
      missionary methods of Christian denominations. Some of them center about 
      the worship of an all-powerful, universal God. Some stress faith healing.</P>
      <P>The religious answers of the old &quot;spirit of Japan&quot; remain a force to 
      consider in the religious life of the world today. The Japanese have found 
      deep satisfaction for themselves. They have suggested that others might 
      find similar satisfaction through simply accepting life as it is and 
      appreciating it for the beauties and wonders it offers the person who 
      takes time to see and hear.</P>
