      <P>19. MOHAMMED SPEAKS FOR ALLAH </P>
      </B>
      <P>Five times a day, devout Moslems everywhere turn their faces toward a 
      small city in Saudi Arabia. Kneeling upon a prayer rug, they pray facing 
      Mecca. Often they use a prayer they call the Fatihah which do they as well 
      know as the Lord’s Prayer is to Christians:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds!<BR>
        The compassionate, the merciful!<BR>
        King on the day of reckoning!<BR>
        Thee only do we worship, and to thee do we cry for help.<BR>
        Guide thou us on the straight path,<BR>
        The path of those to whom Thou hast been gracious; -- with whom thou art 
        not angry, and who go not astray.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>These millions of people are following the Moslem ritual of prayer, 
      laid down some fourteen centuries ago by Mohammed. This is one of the ways 
      in which they show that they agree with what he told his people. Allah, 
      God, is the first reality of their lives. Devoted Moslems can repeat from 
      the <I>Koran </I>sincerely: &quot;Verily, my prayers, and my devotion, and my 
      life, and my death, belong to God.&quot;</P>
      <P>Many years have passed since Mohammed lived, instructing his followers 
      in what God required of them. But Moslems follow as closely as they can 
      the commands of the Koran, convinced that it contains exactly what 
      Mohammed said. They believe that what he had to say in the sixth century 
      still provides suitable answers to their modern questions. What is God 
      like? What am I? What is my responsibility to God? What will happen after 
      I die? What is the right way to live?</P>
      <B>
      <P>MOHAMMED’S VISION </P>
      </B>
      <P>In the darkness of one night in the year 611 A.D., a man of Mecca was 
      keeping a lonely vigil of prayer and meditation in a cave in Mount Hira, 
      just outside the city. Those who knew him well would not have been 
      surprised, for he often retired to this cave for the solitude one needs 
      for deep thought. But this one night -- known by Moslems ever after as the 
      &quot;Night of Power and Excellence&quot; -- was to bring to Mohammed a new 
      experience.</P>
      <P>Suddenly he was aroused from his thoughts by an amazing vision. The 
      angel Gabriel appeared, speaking God’s command that Mohammed must call his 
      people to the warship of Allah, the one God of all the world. Overwhelmed, 
      Mohammed spoke of his inability to do such work. In answer, Gabriel 
      repeated the commandment of Allah twice more. Mohammed fled from the cave 
      to the mountain peak, trying to see if the night air would make the 
      strange experience fade away. Even here, he heard a voice, which told him 
      that he was the Prophet of God.</P>
      <P>Confused and afraid, Mohammed rushed home to tell his wife, Khadijah, 
      what had happened. Could he be losing his mind? Khadijah reassured him, 
      comforted him, and encouraged him to rest until he was calm again. She 
      thought over the things he told her about that night. She added them to 
      what she knew of her husband’s life. And, quietly, she began to believe 
      that the vision was true.</P>
      <B>
      <P>MOHAMMED, THE RESPECTIVE CITIZEN </P>
      </B>
      <P>Khadijah had long believed that her husband was an unusual man. Since 
      the early days of their acquaintance, when Mohammed’s uncle, Ahu Talib, 
      had recommended him to her as a caravan leader, she had respected his 
      judgment and his character. He had accomplished his duties with success, 
      and respect had developed into a mutual affection. They had married, 
      although she had been a wealthy widow of forty and he only twenty-five. 
      Their marriage of fifteen years had been a happy one, despite the deaths 
      of their two infant sons; Mohammed was devoted to her and to their four 
      daughters.</P>
      <P>Khadijah knew that the men of Mohammed’s tribe, the Korcish, agreed 
      with her high estimate of her husband. They knew him as a thoughtful 
      person, given to long periods of silence. They had come to respect him for 
      this, and they often asked his advice when they needed an unprejudiced 
      opinion. He had seemed always slightly different from the people who knew 
      him, from his days as an orphaned child until now. Even as a shepherd boy 
      for his uncle, watching the sheep in the vast and empty spaces of the 
      desert, he had pondered the eternal questions of life and death. When his 
      marriage had released him from the necessity of working, he had begun to 
      take those questions out to the cave for<I><B> </B></I>lengthy meditation.</P>
      <P>Khadijah, especially, knew the extent of Mohammed’s dissatisfaction 
      with what he saw of the lives of his people as he watched them in their 
      dealings with each other. He had seen innumerable tribal conflicts in 
      which the opposing parties hid their own selfish interests under labels of 
      religion and honor. He had seen them as they traded and celebrated near 
      Mecca, especially during the seasonal fairs, drinking, gambling, and 
      dancing. He had even seen other Arabian fathers bury unwanted infant 
      daughters alive, following a widespread custom. he had watched his people 
      become so absorbed in petty tribal interest that they were unaware of the 
      dangers from aggressive foreign countries.</P>
      <P>Most carefully, he had observed their worship at the Ka’aba, the 
      religious shrine in Mecca. Twice a year, the pilgrims came from all over 
      Arabia to offer prayers and gifts to images of their three hundred sixty 
      gods, one for every day of the Arabian year. The square stone building, 
      the Ka’aba, still exists and still shelters the Black Stone, believed to 
      have fallen from Paradise. Arabian legends told how Abraham and Ishman had 
      built the Ka’aba, putting the Black Stone (a meteorite) into its corner. 
      Mohammed had watched the pilgrims there and in the marketplace in Mecca, 
      where they could buy small idols to take home with them.</P>
      <P>What he had seen of Arabian religion had left him full of questions and 
      doubts. He had contrasted Meccan worship with his memories from caravan 
      trips to other lands and with what he had learned from Christian, Jewish, 
      and Zoroastrian visitors to Mecca. What of the Zoroastrian beliefs in a 
      Day of Judgment and the punishment of sinners? Most Arabs lived without 
      regard to where their lives were taking them. What of the sacred books of 
      the Christians and the Jews, which told of revelations God had made to 
      prophets? The Arabs had no revelations to help them.</P>
      <P>They had never had a prophet. What of the single God that other peoples 
      worshiped? Arabs gave homage to three hundred sixty gods. Mohammed had 
      pondered these differences for a long time.</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE UNPOPULAR PROPHET</P>
      </B>
      <P>As Khadijah remembered all these things, she was sure that Mohammed’s 
      vision had to be true. From the first, even before Mohammed himself was 
      fully convinced, she believed that her husband was God’s chosen prophet. 
      Her unwavering belief helped him to believe in himself. Soon other visions 
      came to him, giving more details of his mission for Allah. For three years 
      he waited and meditated and spoke of Allah quietly only to relatives and 
      close friends. At the end of that period he had gathered about him a small 
      circle of just thirty followers. The time was ripe for more active work.</P>
      <P>Soon he was speaking to small groups of people in the marketplace, in 
      the streets, and in the Ka’aba. He told them that they must give up the 
      worship of their many gods and goddesses and follow the will of Allah, the 
      one God of all the world. If they did not do so, they would suffer 
      dreadful punishments after the Day of Judgment. At first the people 
      listened curiously, for this was a man they knew and respected. When 
      Mohammed continued in his strange sermons, they began to laugh and mock. 
      That they should abandon their old ways of worship was unthinkable. Had 
      not their fathers and their fathers’ fathers worshiped in the same way? 
      The gods and goddesses whose images were in the Ka’aba had always looked 
      after them. Their old rituals and customs were familiar and comfortable. 
      What did they know of Mohammed’s one God?</P>
      <P>Some of the tribe began to doubt his sanity, and others became uneasy 
      at his derision of the worship of the idols in the Ka’aba. They made their 
      living by caring for the needs of the pilgrims who came to Mecca for 
      worship. If people did what Mohammed asked, the source of their income 
      would disappear.</P>
      <P>Despite growing objection, Mohammed persisted in telling what Allah had 
      revealed to him. He warned his hearers to listen well, for these were the 
      final revelations that God would make to men. Before all things were 
      created, there was a book in Heaven, which contained all truth, Mohammed 
      told them. Part of what the book contained had been revealed to Jews and 
      to Christians through their prophets, including Jesus. But the biggest 
      part of it was being revealed to Mohammed.</P>
      <P>Finally the Koreish could stand it no longer. They refused to listen. 
      They began to disrupt his preaching and persecute his converts. They tried 
      every means to discourage him from his task. Since they would no longer 
      listen, he began to talk to strangers in town for trade or pilgrimage. The 
      Koreish warned travelers about him, but their warnings only served to whet 
      the travelers’ curiosity. Visitors carried home stories of this strange 
      preacher, who spoke in defiance of the members of his tribe. Some visitors 
      from a city named Yathrib were especially impressed with what Mohammed 
      preached to them. They were looking for a leader who could help them 
      overcome the effects of a disastrous war between two tribes. They began to 
      think that Mohammed might be a good choice for the responsibility.</P>
      <P>At the height of the persecution, Khadijah died. Her death was followed 
      by that of Mohammed’s influential uncle, Abu Talib, who had been his 
      protector, though never his convert. These two losses, added to the 
      increased persecution, troubled Mohammed greatly. He was beginning to 
      doubt that he could ever accomplish his goals in Mecca, where even the 
      safety of his growing band of followers was threatened. These 
      circumstances led to his decision to accept when the citizens of Yathrib 
      invited him to become their leader.</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE ESCAPE TO MEDINA </P>
      </B>
      <P>The departure from Mecca had to be carried out with great secrecy, or 
      the enraged Koreish might do them harm. All the two hundred followers were 
      sent on ahead. Mohammed and a long-time disciple, Abu Bekr, left at the 
      last moment. Despite all the dangers. the whole group got safely to 
      Yathrib. In honor of the arrival of their new leader, the people changed 
      the name of their city to the &quot;City of the Prophet.&quot; It is now known as 
      Medina. The movement of the Moslems to Medina is called the Hegira, 
      meaning flight or exodus. It was made in 622 AD<B> </B>and that year 
      became the first year of the Moslem calendar. Mohammed was now in a 
      position to exercise great power. He became ruler and priest, lawgiver and 
      judge, prophet and commander-in-chief <I>for </I>the whole community. He 
      drew up a constitution for his people, trying hard to unite the different 
      groups into a close-knit fellowship. The people were to help each other 
      against all enemies and in all difficulties. They were to abide by the 
      decisions of Allah, as revealed to his prophet, Mohammed.</P>
      <P>One of his first acts upon reaching Medina was to construct a simple 
      mosque for the center of the Moslem worship. He preached there frequently. 
      His sermons described simple but firm moral codes of kindness to travelers 
      and loyalty to friends. He urged that they pray often and be faithful in 
      acts of devotion to Allah. In the language of the desert, Mohammed told of 
      rewards for righteous living and punishments for a wasted life. Paradise 
      sounded like an oasis, while hell was a place of heat, thirst, and 
      loneliness.</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE TRIUMPHANT PROPHET </P>
      </B>
      <P>Mohammed had always confidently expected that Jews and Christians would 
      accept him and his message as the next chapter in a book of revelations 
      that they all held in common. Thus, when he went to Medina, he was 
      prepared to be very patient in his efforts to win over the Jewish citizens 
      to the new Medina agreement. He even asked his followers to pray facing 
      Jerusalem, and he emphasized the common elements in their traditions.</P>
      <P>However, it soon became apparent that the Jews living there had no 
      intention of calling Mohammed their prophet. A good many of them even 
      ridiculed his revelations. Relationships took a turn for the worse when 
      some of the Jews violated the terms of their agreement with Mohammed. The 
      prophet then issued a demand that they either join in Islam or leave the 
      area. The order was carried out by Mohammed’s armies. It was the first of 
      a long list of Moslem victories over opponents. Moslems have always 
      claimed that such moves were necessary to protect the development of their 
      religious community.</P>
      <P>Actually, this marks an even more important point in the history of 
      Islam. Mohammed had begun to see that his prophecies were not going to be 
      accepted readily by non-Arab peoples. Islam gradually was directed more 
      and more to Arabs. Jewish and Christian traditions were minimized and Arab 
      traditions stressed from then on. Moslems were no longer to pray toward 
      Jerusalem. They were to face Mecca. And Mohammed and his followers looked 
      with increasing eagerness toward the time when they could go to Mecca once 
      again.</P>
      <P>As the fame of the prophet spread throughout Arabia, more people became 
      converts to the new religion. Finally, Mohammed felt that it was necessary 
      for the welfare of his followers that he takes Mecca with his armies. So, 
      eight years after he had barely escaped from Mecca with his life, he 
      re-entered it as a conqueror. As always, he was generous with his foes, 
      forgiving most of them. They had only to confess their faith in Allah and 
      in his prophet.</P>
      <P>Mohammed went immediately to the shrine. He stripped the idols from the 
      Ka’aba, declaring it a place for the worship of Allah. Mecca became the 
      holy city of Islam.</P>
      <P>The fall of Mecca caused many other communities to declare their 
      submission to the prophet’s religion and rule. For some time Mohammed had 
      been convinced that his chief mission was to unify the Arab tribes by 
      bringing them together into a nation governed by the will of Allah. When 
      tribes did not pledge their allegiance, they were put to the sword and 
      overcome in holy war, which the Moslems believed represented the will of 
      Allah. Gradually the far-flung tribes united into what was to be the 
      nation of Arabia.</P>
      <P>To keep a promise he had made to the faithful, Mohammed went back to 
      live in Medina. But he made pilgrimages to Mecca, and he always looked 
      upon that as the rightful center of the worship of Allah. On his last 
      pilgrimage, he preached a sermon that was to be one of his best 
      remembered. In it, he declared that all believers were brothers, and as 
      such must ceaselessly help and respect each other.</P>
      <B>
      <P>MOHAMMED’S GIFTS TO ISLAM </P>
      </B>
      <P>Not long after his return to Medina from that last pilgrimage, Mohammed 
      died. He was sixty-two years old. Much had happened since he had sat alone 
      in the cave near Mecca and thought of the meaning of life. Allah’s message 
      had been given and received enthusiastically. The Arabs had turned from 
      idols to the worship of Allah.</P>
      <P>They no longer fought, tribe against tribe. They were all brothers. 
      They no longer danced and drank and gambled in riotous celebrations. They 
      prayed and fasted and felt the presence of Allah close beside them.</P>
      <P>The legacy Mohammed left to his followers was very great. He left them 
      united and strong enough to resist foreign aggression. He left them a 
      faith, which they found clear and satisfying. He left them a zeal for that 
      faith that led them to prescribe it for all other people. He left them 
      trained disciples to carry on the movement. He left an army capable of 
      spreading Islam to other lands in holy wars. He left them the example of 
      his life, which had been fully devoted to the will of Allah.</P>
      <P>Abu Bekr, who had often assisted in services, was a natural choice for 
      the prophet’s successor, or caliph. And, after a short period of mourning, 
      Islam went on as before toward the realization of all the prophet’s 
      dreams. History was changed. People were changed. They were changed not 
      alone through experience with the man Mohammed but through the creed he 
      taught them. It is the creed that millions of Moslems still follow, 
      declaring with complete faith: &quot;There is no God but Allah, and Mohammed is 
      his prophet.&quot;</P>
      <B>
      <P>20. MOSLEMS HEAR AND OBEY </P>
      </B>
      <P>Most modem world religions became organized religions by an accident of 
      history. In many cases, their roots are buried so deep in time that we 
      cannot know the incidents that helped them to develop. But Islam was 
      distinguished by two facts from the start. First, it became a religion as 
      the result of deliberate planning and well-considered efforts. Second, its 
      whole development took place after world history had begun to be carefully 
      recorded.</P>
      <P>In a short span of years, Mohammed had lifted himself to a unique 
      position of leadership among his people. He had had the time and the 
      opportunity to plan thoroughly to meet all the social and spiritual needs 
      of his fellow men. Mohammed, convinced that be spoke for Allah, had given 
      rules for beliefs, for religious duties, and for proper conduct. As a 
      result, Moslems found themselves with a guide to almost every activity or 
      situation undertaken by human beings.</P>
      <B>
      <P>WHAT MUST I BELIEVE?</P>
      </B>
      <P>Somewhere along in life, every thoughtful person wonders about the 
      power or force responsible for the creation of everything that we see, 
      hear, smell, taste, and touch. What kind of power or force is it? When and 
      how does it operate? What caused it to operate in the first place?</P>
      <P>Mohammed had faced these wonderings as a young man. Through his 
      visions, he believed that he had found the answers. He unhesitatingly 
      recommended these answers for everyone else. Allah, the Eternal, is the 
      source of all creation. The central confession of all believers is belief 
      in Allah: &quot;I bear witness that there is no God but Allah.&quot;</P>
      <P>Allah is just and merciful. He sees and hears everything. His presence 
      is everywhere. He knows all a person’ s acts, good or evil. On the Day of 
      Judgment, Allah judges the lives of men. In the beginning, he ordained the 
      way all things should have their existence. In the end, he determines 
      eternal destiny.</P>
      <P>Mohammed believed that the world, in its orderliness and dependability, 
      told the story of a personal, purposeful God. Allah had created all things 
      and had predestined all events. Yet men can reach him through prayer, and 
      men are free to work out their own lives. However, they must know that the 
      consequences of paradise or hell wait.</P>
      <P>Since Allah long ago removed himself from active direction of his 
      creation, it might be difficult for men to know how to do his will. But 
      Allah understood man’s need. He established three ways to reveal his will 
      to men: a prophet, the <I>Koran, </I>and the angels.</P>
      <P>The first of these ways is expressed in the second part of the Moslem 
      statement of faith: &quot;I bear witness that there is no God but Allah, and 
      Mohammed is his prophet.&quot; </P>
      <P>Moslems respect other prophets -- including Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, 
      and Jesus. But Mohammed is the last of the prophets, the &quot;seal.&quot; No other 
      prophet ever spoke with such authority. No other had such a complete 
      revelation from God. -</P>
      <P>Mohammed never claimed to be more than an ordinary man. His chief 
      quarrel with Christians was that many of them worshiped a Son, as well as 
      a Father-God. This was an addition that he could not tolerate. &quot;There is 
      none in the heavens or the earth but comes before the Merciful as a 
      servant.&quot;</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>God the Eternal,<BR>
        He is God alone!<BR>
        He begets not and is not begotten!<BR>
        Nor is there like unto Him anyone!</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Mohammed’s revelations have been preserved in the <I>Koran </I>for the 
      enlightenment of all succeeding generations. The Koran is a particularly 
      significant book to Moslems because it is identical with another book, 
      which many Moslems believe has existed in Heaven since the beginning of 
      time. In this heavenly book, the will of Allah is recorded. The same 
      revelations contained in it are the ones given to Mohammed and written in 
      the <I>Koran. </I>The <I>Koran </I>is God’s whole message to men.</P>
      <P>Orthodox Moslems have never doubted that the text of their sacred book 
      is correct. &quot;Memorizers&quot; learned the things Mohammed said. Soon after his 
      death, his words were written down in a single copy. This made it possible 
      for Moslems, almost from the start of their religion, to have a sacred 
      scripture.</P>
      <P>The third means of knowing the will of Allah is through angels. To 
      Moslems the most important is Gabriel, known to them as the &quot;angel of 
      revelation.&quot; It was Gabriel who brought Allah’s messages to Mohammed. 
      Gabriel and the other angels surround the throne of Allah, in the &quot;seventh 
      heaven&quot; of paradise, doing Allah’s will and ministering to his decrees.</P>
      <P>Another angel -- or really an ex-angel -- is the Devil, who was 
      banished from heaven because of his pride. Moslems believe that he is in 
      charge of hell and, with his assistants, works to thwart the will of Allah 
      by tempting men into evil ways. However, Allah is all-powerful and all 
      determining. So the Devil’s work is limited to what he can do in the 
      framework of Allah’s plans. The Devil can never really thwart Allah, for 
      Allah’s plans include letting the Devil do his work of temptation.</P>
      <P>God is just, but life does not always offer rewards and punishments in 
      accord with the quality of a person’s living. Must not the good be 
      rewarded and the evil punished? The <I>Koran </I>tells Moslems that a Last 
      Judgment will come at the end of this age and the beginning of eternity, 
      when Allah will judge all souls. Each will be tried on the record of his 
      life. Allah is merciful, and a good person’s reward is greater than he 
      deserves. But punishment for evil will be exactly what the sinner merits.</P>
      <P>Those believers who have followed the will of Allah will be eternally 
      rewarded by residence in paradise. The <I>Koran’s </I>description of this 
      heavenly dwelling sounds like a magnificent oasis, with flowing waters, 
      refreshing beverages, fruits and fowl, and youths and maidens serving the 
      needs of the residents. Thoughtful Moslems believe that the real appeal of 
      paradise is the eternal presence of Allah.</P>
      <P>Hell has been prepared for those who decline to submit to the will of 
      Allah. Again, the description is one such as a desert-dweller might 
      imagine. The damned suffer eternally in fire and heat. What they eat and 
      drink is like boiling water. When they call for aid, that aid becomes a 
      further torment. Some Moslems say that the <I>Koran </I>is using 
      picturesque language to describe the total lack of joy in existing without 
      Allah’ s presence.</P>
      <P>Allah, the prophet, the Koran, angels, and the Last Judgment -- these 
      things a man <I>must </I>believe. There is a sixth essential belief: in 
      Allah’s complete power and boundlessness. Actually this is a repetition of 
      some of the characteristics of Allah, pointing out the necessity of utter 
      obedience on the part of men. A man does not need to understand the will 
      of God -- in fact, it is impossible. But he must submit to it. &quot;I hear and 
      obey,&quot; describes the relationship of man to God.</P>
      <P>The name Moslem means &quot;submitter,&quot; while <I>Islam </I>means &quot;submission 
      to Allah’s will.&quot; Moslems believe that submission brings peace and 
      fulfillment. The object to the terms &quot;Mohammedan&quot; and &quot;Mohammedanism&quot; 
      because they imply a worship of Mohammed. Moslems worship only Allah.</P>
      <B>
      <P>WHAT MUST I DO?</P>
      </B>
      <P>Part of Islam’s rapid spread across the world was due to its 
      simplicity. The creed is clearly stated in six beliefs, as we have seen. 
      The religious duties of believers are just as clearly stated in five 
      requirements, which are known as the &quot;Five Pillars&quot; of Islam.</P>
      <P>Declaration of <I>Belief. </I>First, a Moslem must declare his faith 
      and pledge his loyalty. &quot;I bear witness that there is no God but Allah, 
      and that Mohammed is the prophet of Allah.&quot; Spoken before witnesses, this 
      declaration can admit a new believer into the fellowship of Islam.</P>
      <I>
      <P>Prayer. </I>The chief religious discipline of the Moslem is prayer. 
      Mohammed named five times a day for formal prayer, and he encouraged 
      private prayer as a continual practice of the presence of Allah. At 
      sunrise, at noon, in mid-afternoon, at sunset, and at nightfall Moslems 
      are called to prayer. From the minarets, &quot;pillars&quot; of prayer, the call 
      floats out to millions of devoted Moslems:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Allah is great, Allah is great . . -<BR>
        There is no God but Allah.<BR>
        Mohammed is Allah’s apostle.<BR>
        To your prayers! To your devotions!<BR>
        Allah is great; there is no God but Allah!</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>First, there is the ritual of cleansing and the placing of the prayer 
      rug. Then the Moslem kneels down, bowing in the direction of Mecca. The 
      prayer often takes the form of a renewal of submission to Allah’s will. 
      Often it is an expression of praise. For some it is recognition of the 
      fact of God’s constant presence. This last most nearly meets the wish of 
      Mohammed, who hoped that all believers might know Allah as <I>the </I>real 
      experience of life.</P>
      <P>Moslems try to be in a mosque for prayers whenever possible. These 
      simple buildings are designed so that the worshipers face Mecca. All 
      decorations are of geometric designs, in accordance with Mohammed’s 
      insistence that no images be made. Fridays are special days for public 
      prayer in the mosques. Men who go to the mosque perform the cleansing 
      ritual, perhaps gather about in groups to hear readings from the Koran, 
      and then participate in the prayer service. In each mosque, a leader 
      directs the public worship and gives weekly sermons on Moslem beliefs.</P>
      <P>Usually the congregations are made up of men, most Moslems believing 
      that women should worship at home. Mohammed himself declared that such 
      private devotions were better for women. If they do attend the services, 
      they are usually seated behind screens.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Fasting</B>. Fasting is a frequent religious act of devout Moslems. 
      There is one fast that is necessary for all believers, except those 
      excused for physical conditions or special activities. This fast occurs 
      during the month of Ramadan, the ninth month of the Moslem year. During 
      the fast of Ramadan, food and drink may not he taken between sunrise and 
      sunset. Moslems believe that fasting is a good reminder to put spiritual 
      things first. They try to read or hear the whole <I>Koran </I>during the 
      month and to be in the mosque often.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Almsgiving</B>. Belief in the brotherhood of all Moslems has helped to 
      continue an early custom of sharing their goods and money with the needy. 
      For a time, sharing was legally required in the form of a yearly &quot;tax.&quot; 
      Now it is often paid in the form of a voluntary pledge, to help the needy 
      and to support Moslem schools and mosques. Although a person may choose 
      not to pay it, very few do. Their friends expect it, and they believe that 
      their generosity to others will bring Allah’s generosity to them.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Pilgrimage.</B> Every Moslem lives with one dream and expectation for 
      this life uppermost in his thoughts. That is the pilgrimage to Mecca, a 
      city so sacred that non-believers are not admitted. Annually, during the 
      twelfth month of the Moslem calendar, the paths to Mecca are choked with 
      pilgrims. They hurry to join in the ceremonies centering around the 
      ancient Ka’aba and the Mosque of Mecca. Mohammed urged his followers to 
      make the pilgrimage every year. Now, due to the wideness of the Moslem 
      fellowship, each person is asked to go once a lifetime. While there are 
      many who are never able to make the trip, it remains the life goal of most 
      Moslems.</P>
      <P>Once arrived, the pilgrims enter the sacred bounds of Mecca, each 
      wearing a garment designed to make all Moslems, rich or poor, appear the 
      same. Rank and race and wealth forgotten, the pilgrims join in the sacred 
      rituals of the pilgrimage. They fast and thirst all day; they dramatize 
      traditional legends; they honor the Black Stone in the Ka’aba. Having made 
      the pilgrimage, the Moslem is forever after a respected person among his 
      fellows.</P>
      <P>The pilgrimage has been an important unifying agent for Islam. Mohammed 
      probably emphasized it because he expected that it would serve the cause 
      of unity among the Arab tribes. It still helps to strengthen the bond of 
      fellowship among Moslems.</P>
      <B>
      <P>WHAT THE MOSLEMS OWES TO OTHERS</P>
      </B>
      <P>For the guide to his daily living, the Moslem has to look no farther 
      than the <I>Koran. </I>A large part of the fuel for the fires of 
      Mohammed’s inspiration was the immorality and lack of worthwhile purpose 
      in the lives of his fellow men. The Koran is filled with messages 
      reflecting this concern. Other religions may develop people who live apart 
      from others, putting their personal desires and needs second to a search 
      of the spirit. Islam does not try. Islam tries to make men fit for living 
      with each other.</P>
      <P>Long ago Mohammed forbade gambling and intoxicating beverages to 
      believers. Probably, at the time he did so, he was thinking back to the 
      scenes of riot and revelry at the seasonal fairs near Mecca. If the rules 
      against gambling and intoxication caused a change in the lives of his 
      followers, even more so did his statements in regard to women. Men who had 
      been able to divorce and marry wives at will were asked to consider women 
      as creatures of the same Creator, with rights of their own. Husbands must 
      respect wives’ rights to their own dowries and must abide by certain rules 
      on divorce and remarriage. Mohammed urged every effort to prevent a 
      divorce, for nothing else was so displeasing to Allah.</P>
      <P>Americans are often startled by the Moslem practice of polygamy. The 
      Moslem, according to the <I>Koran, </I>may take four wives. (Mohammed at 
      one time, through Allah’s special permission, had ten.) However, Mohammed 
      asked that men examine their circumstances and their temperaments very 
      carefully before they did so. If they could not treat all equally in care 
      and affection, they should have only one.</P>
      <P>More and more Moslem men are marrying only one wife, either because it 
      is what they believe or what they can afford. Many Moslems now try to 
      understand the spirit or intention of the laws of the <I>Koran. </I>The 
      more liberal believers assert that monogamy is in the spirit of the <I>
      Koran. </I>They realize that times have changed since Mohammed makes the 
      laws about wives. Then the proportion of women to men was greater than 
      now. Moreover, according to the old tribal customs, the only way a man 
      could aid a poverty-stricken or widowed woman was by marrying her.</P>
      <P>Although Mohammed’s life and work insured to the Moslem woman many 
      privileges she had not enjoyed before, she still was expected to be 
      retiring and modest. Her religious acts were better done in private. It 
      was more fitting that she keeps to the seclusion of her home than that she 
      flits about. She was not to be hidden from all eyes, but modesty and 
      quietness were her most becoming qualities.</P>
      <P>In earlier days, Moslems owed a responsibility to their brothers to 
      fight if necessary. Mohammed said that a war of defense was permissible, 
      but that one must attack only when fighting for Allah. Such holy wars 
      spread Islam over a large portion of the globe in a very little time. 
      Mohammed taught that Moslems must be gracious to the conquered, bearing no 
      hostility.</P>
      <P>Actually, all the rules about the way a good Moslem lives his life stem 
      from one of the last things that Mohammed said to his followers. During 
      his last sermon at Mecca, he made the famous declaration of the 
      brotherhood of all believers. Stronger than family ties even were the ties 
      of the brotherhood. All believers were sacred and all men equal in the 
      sight of Allah. For this reason alone, kindness and respect were due to 
      parents and children, to slaves, and to all others.</P>
      <P>Moslems must be faithful in their promises to each other. They respect 
      each other’s lives and property. The measure of a man’s goodness is the 
      way he acts toward his brothers. All a man believes can be told from what 
      he does, as this Moslem proverb shows: &quot;No one of you is a believer until 
      he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.&quot;</P>
      <P>Today, when people have long been accustomed to living as nations, 
      social responsibility is well known. But the Arabs of Mohammed’s time had 
      spent their days in constant, petty bickering and fighting among tribes. 
      Mohammed was saying that a person’s responsibility was not limited to 
      those who lived in his town or belonged to his tribe. He was responsible 
      for his share in the welfare of all those who had values, interests, and 
      goals in common with him.</P>
      <P>Mohammed had enlarged the concerns of his people, turned their gaze 
      outward to the rest of the world, and helped them to fit themselves for a 
      place in the world. All this was done in the short space of twenty years. 
      The average Moslem learned his lesson well. The Moslem who follows the 
      prophet’s teachings about brotherhood is a good citizen in the world.</P>
      <B>
      <P>21. THE BROTHERHOOD OF ISLAM </P>
      </B>
      <P>During<I><B> </B></I>Mohammed’s life, disagreements among his followers 
      were largely discouraged because of the unifying effect he had upon them. 
      But upon his death, his people -- like people everywhere -- discovered 
      that there would be some lack of accord in carrying out the rest of the 
      goals of Islam. There was some discussion in the beginning about the 
      person to take Mohammed’s place in leading the faithful. It was settled 
      without much difficulty with the selection of the trusted Abu Bekr as 
      caliph. Unfortunately, succeeding vacancies in the caliphate were not to 
      be filled so easily. As the Moslem empire grew, so did disagreements.</P>
      <P>There were several groups with definite ideas about the best method of 
      selecting the caliph. The Companions, who had been Mohammed’s closest 
      associates, thought that the caliph should be one of their number. Some 
      thought that the leadership should stay in Mohammed’s family. The Koreish 
      thought that they, as the tribe of Mohammed, should have control of the 
      caliphate.</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE SPREAD OF ISLAM </P>
      </B>
      <P>Under Abu Bekr the Moslems attacked Syria in the first holy war against 
      a foreign country. The Moslem conquests had begun. Under the second 
      caliph, Omar, Moslem armies marched in other wars, which were eventually 
      to bring into the Moslem fold parts of Africa and India and all of 
      Mongolia and Spain.</P>
      <P>The most dramatic chapters in the history of Islam were written about 
      the fierce warriors who streamed out of their Arabia into conquest of the 
      world. Devout Moslems claim that they did so in a sincere effort to save 
      the whole world from the Last Judgment. The prophet had made them feel 
      that it was their mission, and if necessary they would force the world 
      into this salvation. Force was almost always necessary. It became 
      customary to offer three options to non-Moslems -- acceptance of the <I>
      Koran, </I>the payment of a special tax for the privilege of remaining 
      non-Moslems, or lastly the sword. Primitive as were their equipment and 
      supplies, the Moslems continued to win, inspired by their conviction of a 
      mission and by other less religious reasons. By Moslem law, the soldiers 
      could keep four-fifths of the booty won in a holy war. If he survived, a 
      soldier could become very wealthy. If he died, he had won direct entrance 
      into paradise.</P>
      <P>Others explain that part of the Moslems’ interest in widespread 
      conquest lay in the fact that their existence up to now had been limited 
      to the boundaries of their own infertile desert land. Before them now lay 
      the riches of land and of culture of the fertile and prosperous 
      Mediterranean civilizations. Not only the produce of the land attracted 
      them, but treasures of science, art, and philosophy as well.</P>
      <P>It was during this time that the treasury in Medina began to reach the 
      bursting point. Who had ever dreamed of such riches as were pouring in 
      from the conquered countries? And the caliph was in charge of the way it 
      was to be spent. To many, it became a matter of utmost concern to be able 
      to share in decisions concerning the selection of caliphs. The lives of a 
      good many caliphs were sacrificed to the ambition and greed of some 
      unscrupulous groups.</P>
      <P>As Islam became widespread, including more and more non-Arabs, 
      agreement became difficult and at last impossible. For centuries, however, 
      the more orthodox Moslems insisted on one religious leader for the whole 
      Moslem world. But times and situations had changed and were still 
      changing. Finally in 1924 the caliphate came to an end.</P>
      <P>During the early years after Mohammed’s death, questions were raised 
      which resulted in a major division among Moslems. This division has lasted 
      until today. Both groups consider that their way of thinking and acting is 
      in close accord with the revelations of Mohammed. Both groups believe that 
      their movements represent the correct development of the Moslem religion.</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE SUNNA</P>
      </B>
      <P>The orthodox or conservative branch of Islam is known as the <I>Sunna,
      </I>so named for its emphasis on a collection of Moslem traditions called 
      by the same name. Sunnis believe that what is contained in the Koran and 
      in the Sunna define the limits of beliefs and actions for Moslems. The <I>
      Koran </I>tells the word of Allah. The Sunna tells of actions and sayings 
      of Mohammed and of early customs of Moslems.</P>
      <P>For a time, the Sunnis believed that the Koran and the traditions must 
      be interpreted exactly as they were written. An honored teacher named 
      Ashari helped the Sunnis to develop slightly different beliefs, which 
      would allow the use of reason in interpretation. He explained some of the 
      seemingly contradictory beliefs by saying that Allah was <I>all. </I>Allah 
      had created everything and all acts, and therefore Allah was responsible 
      for both good and evil. Men must accept that, without debating about 
      whether it is possible.</P>
      <P>Some had wondered how the Koran could be eternal, as Mohammed had 
      taught them. If that were so, would that not be setting up something else 
      alongside of God? And was not the worst sin of all the worship of more 
      than one God? Ashari taught that the <I>Koran </I>in the form that Moslems 
      have is not eternal. But in the form in which it first existed in the mind 
      of Allah, it is eternal.</P>
      <P>There are always some people who are not chiefly interested in ritual 
      or religious law or in theology. There have been many Moslems of this 
      temperament. Some of them began to express their faith in ways they saw 
      among people of other religions. They felt that religious truth was not 
      confined solely to creeds and rituals. Truth could be gained from direct 
      communion with God. And so some began to practice the meditation and other 
      devotional exercises of the mystics.</P>
      <P>At first they must have been greeted with raised eyebrows, since they 
      were going beyond the usual religious practices of the Moslems. Like some 
      self-denying members of other faiths, they put on uncomfortable wool robes 
      and paid no attention to their physical and social needs. They were dubbed 
      Sufis, meaning &quot;wool-wearers.&quot; As their number increased, they began to 
      gather into brotherhoods, emphasizing utter devotion to God. Their goal 
      was union with Allah in this life, not waiting until after death.</P>
      <P>The Sufis gradually gained respect from orthodox Moslems. One of the 
      first to understand the worth of their path to God was Ghazzali, a Moslem 
      teacher who has been called &quot;restorer of religion.&quot; Ghazzali watched the 
      mystics in their devotions and himself became a Sufi. He saw the value in 
      the life of complete devotion.</P>
      <P>He began to teach a modified Sunna theology, based largely on Ashari’s 
      doctrines, but including the mystic emphasis on loving devotion. He 
      believed that a person was not a believer in a religion until he had felt 
      a religious experience. A religion has to change something about the life 
      of a believer. Without this change, a person was only on the surface of 
      religion, not at the heart of it.</P>
      <P>Real religion was arrived at through three steps. First of all, a 
      person must feel sorry for his past sins. There must be a need for a 
      change. This is repentance. Then a person must center his life around God, 
      seeing that nothing is important but this devotion. Then the believer must 
      strive to live a life free from sin. The Pillars of the Faith will help 
      him in this. And the disciplines of the Sufis will further help him.</P>
      <P>Ghazzali’s chief target in Islam was the emphasis upon reasoning as the 
      only method for learning God’s will. He said that people must be always 
      ready to give obedience to Allah, whether they understand or not. Although 
      Ghazzali formulated his teaching late in the eleventh century, it is still 
      the final authority for Sunnis.</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE SHIA</P>
      </B>
      <P>About one-fifth of the world’s Moslems belong to the non-conforming, 
      unorthodox group called the <I>Shia. </I>Principally located in Persia, 
      the Shi’ites trace their beliefs back to the prophecies of Mohammed and to 
      the Koran, too. However, the main thing dividing them from the Sunnis is 
      their belief in a tradition that Mohammed left the guidance of the 
      faithful in the care of his cousin and son-in-law, Ali. Ali, they say, was 
      the divinely appointed leader, the Imam, of the Moslem community. The 
      leadership of Islam should have centered in Mohammed’s family. Shi’ites 
      believe that the three caliphs preceding All held the caliphate unlawfully 
      and in disregard for Mohammed’s wishes. For this reason, may Shi’ites 
      curse these men in their daily prayers.</P>
      <P>Shi’ites have honored the descendants of Mohammed by making them 
      religious -- and sometimes political -- nobility. Each sect has named 
      certain of these descendants as the divine Imams for each generation, 
      believing that each of the Imarns was infallible and sinless. The sects 
      have not always agreed about who was Imams and when. Neither have they 
      agreed upon just when the line of divinely appointed Imams ended.</P>
      <P>Some of the Shi’ites believe that the last of the Imams did not die. He 
      went into hiding and he will reappear just before the Last Judgment. Until 
      that time, some Shi’ites are confident that the &quot;hidden Imam&quot; will appoint 
      representatives on earth, in order that the people may have his guidance. 
      The Shahs of Persia (Iran), who claim to descend from the seventh Imam, 
      are supposed to be the representatives of the &quot;hidden Imam.&quot;</P>
      <P>The Shi’ite sects have survived the long centuries of their 
      disagreement with the larger number of Moslems because they have clung 
      persistently to their beliefs. Sometimes they have survived persecution by 
      appearing to conform, while carrying their beliefs &quot;underground.&quot; Modern 
      Sunnis are inclined to be tolerant toward these unorthodox Moslems.</P>
      <P>Any religion that attracts the loyalty of a large number of people is 
      bound to accumulate prescribed creeds, rituals, and customs. Soon there 
      are those who see that such organization has come to preoccupy the 
      believers, so that the original inspiration and purpose have been 
      forgotten. Sometimes these observant ones start a movement to purify the 
      religion of the externals and get back to the fundamental faith.</P>
      <P>Such a purifying movement was launched in Islam in the eighteenth 
      century. Some of its effects still linger. The people who supported it had 
      become distressed at the increasing tendency to revere important teachers 
      and theologians, even Mohammed. They felt that this was coming very close 
      to worship of several gods. &quot;Get back to Allah and to the Koran&quot; was their 
      passionate advice to Moslems. The movement attracted support in Saudi 
      Arabia, where historical markers were removed from the graves of 
      Mohammed’s family and other central figures.</P>
      <B>
      <P>CHANGES IN ISLAM</P>
      </B>
      <P>Almost in spite of itself, Islam has changed somewhat from its original 
      course. For a time, change in Islam was considered to be evil. This is the 
      religion that for years forbade the translation of the <I>Koran </I>from 
      the Arabic because Allah had given it in Arabic, and it must not be 
      altered. But changes have come.</P>
      <P>Countries of the Near East have become increasingly interested in 
      modernization, industrialization, or Westernization -- call it what we 
      will. Today most Moslems feel their first loyalty to the country where 
      they live, rather than to the whole Moslem brotherhood. These facts of the 
      &quot;shrinking&quot; of the twentieth-century world have forced Islam to become 
      more tolerant of other beliefs and less brittle about its own creed.</P>
      <P>Two forces, however, have worked in the opposite direction. One of 
      these is the creation of Pakistan in India, the outgrowth of Moslem-Hindu 
      bitterness. In two parts -- one to the west of India, and a smaller 
      section to the east -- Pakistan is an interesting experiment in the relief 
      of religious conflicts. The emigration of Moslems into Pakistan has made 
      them increasingly conscious of differences between Islam and other 
      religions.</P>
      <P>The other force counteracting change has been the creation of the 
      Jewish state of Israel, with the accompanying movement of thousands of 
      Arabs out of the area where their homes had been. Moslems were highly 
      displeased with the decision. Whenever people have an enemy in common, 
      they stress the other things they share. Thus, Moslems have re-emphasized 
      their beliefs and customs.</P>
      <B>
      <P>CONTRIBUTIONS OF ISLAM </P>
      </B>
      <P>The world long ago became accustomed to what the Arab Moslems had done 
      to it. World history was changed when the first Moslem armies marched 
      against Syria. Despite the complaints of the conquered, Moslems brought 
      forces for good. Wherever they went, they furthered the arts and sciences 
      and medicine. They kept order and morality in society.</P>
      <P>Those who accepted the Allah they worshiped came to revere a God of 
      dignity and majesty -- ever ready to be approached by the lowliest of men. 
      For truly, in Allah’s eyes, no men are lowly. All are equal. The 
      brotherhood of Islam has not stopped at boundaries of nation, race, or 
      wealth. For Moslems believe that the eyes of Allah do not see the 
      senseless differences sometimes imagined by men.</P>
      <P>All this stemmed from the inspiration of a man of Mecca who felt a 
      responsibility to lift his people up from the worship of idols to the 
      worship of the one god, Allah. Toward the end of his life, he looked out 
      over his followers and prayed: ‘0h Lord! I have delivered my message and 
      accomplished my work.&quot;</P>
      <P>Moslems answered with their voices then and have answered with their 
      lives ever since: &quot;Yea, verily, thou hast.&quot;</P>
