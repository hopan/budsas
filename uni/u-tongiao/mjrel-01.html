      <P>2. THE UNITY OF LIFE </P>
      </B>
      <P>Thousand<B> </B>of years ago, the people of India, young and old, were 
      wondering about the same questions that concern us today. Sometimes they 
      tried to guess where human beings came from and where they would go after 
      this life. They questioned further, too, even as we do. How was the world 
      created, and how does it keep going? What is the purpose of the world? 
      What is the difference between right and wrong? What am I? What is my 
      place in the world? How can I really find myself?</P>
      <P>Over the centuries, the Indians kept up the search for answers to their 
      questions, constantly studying and interpreting their experiences in 
      living. Each generation gave the next some suggestions about the best kind 
      of life and the best ways of living, in the universe. Later, the people 
      decided that some of these suggestions ought to he written down, in order 
      that they might not be forgotten or changed, as was sometimes unwittingly 
      done in the telling. The written suggestions became the scriptures of the 
      Hindu religion. Some of them are so old that no one knows when they were 
      first offered as possible answers to the questions of men.</P>
      <P>The oldest ones are ancient poems and hymns, called the <I>Vedas, </I>
      which are considered to be as much as 3000 years old. The Brahmanas -- 
      rules, which the priests gave for rituals of worship -- date from between 
      1200 and 1000 B.C. The <I>Upanishads, </I>dating from about 800 B.C., are 
      answers that the renowned hermit-teachers of that period gave to questions 
      about life and the universe. The Great Epics are philosophical and 
      religious poems about legendary heroes and gods. They were ancient stories 
      that had been told for generations before they were finally set down in 
      writing at about the first century B.C. A short section of one of the <I>
      Epics, </I>the <I>Bhagavad-Gita </I>Gait, has become the favorite 
      religious text in India.</P>
      <P>If you could see all these scriptures together, you would see that the 
      Hindu &quot;bible&quot; is much longer than the Bibles of Christians and Jews. 
      Although the Hindu texts have been translated into English from the 
      original Sanskrit writing, probably there would be parts of them that you 
      could not understand without a Hinduâ€™s explanation. Many of them would be 
      interesting to you, for they contain stories and suggestions which attempt 
      to answer the questions that men of today are still asking, in India and 
      in America.</P>
      <P>The stories in these books reveal a great deal about the Indian people 
      who were searching for answers. For example, they reveal that the Indians 
      valued wisdom. Among them were great students -- not in the sense of those 
      who do assigned lessons in a school, for they did not have schools such as 
      ours. Their students were men who studied and interpreted the things that 
      went on around them, and in so doing, they became wise. The common people 
      observed that the wise men seemed to be most successful in living. They 
      did not become upset with trivial things, and neither did they have to go 
      looking feverishly for ways to be happy. They were content -- at home with 
      themselves. Since this seemed to the people to be the only true and 
      lasting happiness they saw achieved, the man who had wisdom became a kind 
      of national hero.</P>
      <P>Wisdom was valued so much that the people went to great lengths to 
      achieve it. There is one Indian story about a rich man who took much of 
      his wealth -- 1000 cows, expensive jewelry, a carriage with many mules, 
      and even his own daughter -- to pay a renowned sage to teach him the 
      meaning of life. The Indians describe a man without wisdom as being like a 
      frog in a dried-up pond, or like a fish out of water.</P>
      <P>A story in the Upanishads tells about an unhappy young main who came to 
      study under the direction of a wise teacher. The teacher first asked him 
      what he already knew. The young man responded with the titles of all the 
      books he had read and the passages he had memorized. Then he added sadly, 
      &quot;I know all this, but I do not know myself. I am unhappy. Please help me 
      to overcome this unhappiness.&quot; The teacher agreed to help, pointing out 
      that the trouble was that the boy was trying to find wisdom in knowing 
      words about life, instead of seeking meaning in living. So for a while, 
      under the tutelage of his teacher, the boy studied and meditated upon 
      himself and his reactions to daily experiences. He became much happier 
      and, at the end of a period of such study, felt that he was wise enough to 
      continue his search alone.</P>
      <P>What was the happiness which the boy found through self-study and which 
      so many Hindus seek diligently today? It was the same thing they observed 
      in their wisest men -- that at home with themselves. We all know at least 
      one person who never seems to be quite able to settle down to one thing 
      for very long, lie is always looking for something new and more exciting 
      to do next. Another person we know appears poised in almost any place he 
      finds himself. He seems to carry his contentment deep within. The Hindus 
      would unanimously say that the second of our friends is the happier, for 
      he knows himself better.</P>
      <P>Like the unhappy young student, all people are discontented when they 
      know just facts or just books or just things. Happiness can come only from 
      knowing yourself. What does it mean to be yourself. Who are you? First, 
      there is the &quot;you&quot; that people see and hear: the way you look, your voice, 
      your mannerisms, your talents. Is that you? The Hindus answer that you are 
      more than that. If you see your image in a mirror, or hear a transcription 
      of your voice, or see yourself in a home movie, you agree with them. You 
      are more than that.</P>
      <P>In addition to the parts of your personality that people see and hear, 
      there is your temperamental make-up. The Hindus have said that there are 
      three general levels of temperament. The lowest level is inertia, 
      unwillingness to change, or laziness. The second is aggressiveness and the 
      capacity to be agitated by external forces. The third and best is 
      tranquillity of spirit and the ability to remain undisturbed by outside 
      forces. Each person has a little of each of these in his make-up. The aim 
      is to eliminate inertia and aggressiveness from your temperament so that 
      you may be calm and tranquil.</P>
      <P>This is similar to the recent American emphasis on peace of mind. 
      People are much happier when they are not disturbed by every little 
      upsetting event. They can study and know themselves better when they have 
      an unruffled temperament. And they will make no progress at all toward 
      true happiness until they are willing to expand the necessary effort.</P>
      <P>If you have ever taken the time to look inside yourself and try to 
      explore what is there, you will realize that the things we have mentioned 
      are not all there is to you. You have certain attitudes toward yourself, 
      and these are part of yourself. Whether you are proud or ashamed most of 
      the time, whether you look forward to or dread the rest of your life, 
      whether you do more right things or more wrong things according to your 
      own standards -- these things help to form your feelings about yourself. 
      According to the Hindus, your feelings about yourself arise from the way 
      you look and talk and from your temperament. These feelings and the facts 
      from which they arise form what we shall call the &quot;outer self.&quot;</P>
      <P>Besides the outer self, there is an essential self, which you must know 
      in order to be really happy. This very important inner self is the Atman. 
      It is extremely difficult for anyone to help you understand exactly how to 
      know the <I>Atman. </I>This is because only you can know your own inner 
      self completely. Hindu teachers have given a few hints to help one in his 
      search for self-knowledge. They have said that, since the Atman is the 
      inner spirit of a man, it underlies all the fleeting experiences of life. 
      It remains as the unchanging, permanent substance of you. All the 
      qualities that make up the outer self are collected around the center 
      core, the <I>Atman, </I>and are affected by it. But the Atman is not 
      affected by them.</P>
      <P>Some very wonderful things happen when a person succeeds in knowing 
      what is basic and essential in himself. He learns that the everyday 
      affairs, which may formerly have bothered him very much, are not really so 
      important. This is because he has learned that the real center of his life 
      is not affected by them. He learns to take a longer view of his 
      experiences. He has perspective on life; life becomes unprejudiced and 
      less emotional. He is able to make choices and to judge events maturely, 
      because he is not blinded by his own emotions and attitudes. Hindus say 
      that he has taken the most important step toward the most important human 
      attribute -- wisdom.</P>
      <B>
      <P>WHAT IS REAL?</P>
      </B>
      <P>At the same time that the Hindus were exploring the question of what 
      the real self is, they were wondering about their world. What kind of 
      world is it? What was the power that had created the world and still made 
      it continue? They looked about them and saw the trees, the mountains, the 
      plains, and the rivers. They felt the rain and the wind. They came to know 
      all the other living creatures with which they shared the land.</P>
      <P>They realized that they could not say that the world was any one of 
      these. Nor was it just the total of the things they saw and felt and knew. 
      The world was more than all these things. The power that had made the 
      world and made it continue was indeed more than the things in the world. 
      But the world, they decided, was an evidence of that power, just as they 
      themselves were. Everything in the whole universe,â€™ including themselves, 
      was a result of the working of the creative and continuing force. All 
      things were kin, then, because all had the same origin.</P>
      <P>Thoughts such as these made them conclude that there is a <I>
      fundamental unity </I>of <I>all </I>existence and <I>all </I>experience. A 
      Hindu will tell us that all apparent differences which people think so 
      important are trivial and temporary. They seem for a time to be important, 
      but soon they fade away or change. For example, all of us can distinguish 
      between a living being and the elements of the earth. Yet, in death, all 
      living beings return to the elements. There are no exceptions. The Hindu 
      who points to such illustrations is trying to say that in the very 
      beginning there was unity (no differences). In the end, there will also be 
      unity. It is just a matter of time.</P>
      <P>In the Rig Veda, there is the Hindu Hymn of Creation, which tries to 
      explain how the world came to be. This hymn stresses that there was unity 
      in the beginning, and no distinctions could be made:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Existence was not, nor its opposite,<BR>
        Nor earth, nor heavenâ€™s blue vault, nor aught beyond.<BR>
        Death was not yet, nor deathlessness; the day<BR>
        Was night, night day, for neither day nor night<BR>
        Had come to birth.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The hymn goes on to tell about the power behind the world:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Then THAT, the primal fount<BR>
        Of light -- immobile -- rest and action joined -- <BR>
        Brooded in silent bliss. Itself beside<BR>
        In the wide universe there nothing was.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The important thing that the hymn emphasizes is the supreme unity of 
      THAT (or THAT ONE). the ALL which lies behind or beyond both existence and 
      non-existence. In THAT, there are no differences. Rest and action are 
      joined, for example. Everything is united.</P>
      <P>The Hindus use THAT to refer to the supreme One, <I>Brahman. </I>They 
      use the neuter pronoun in order to avoid any idea of a manlike God or 
      Creator or First Principle. They believe that Brahman is the ultimate 
      reality behind and beyond all the things that men find to be &quot;real&quot; from 
      experiencing them through the senses.</P>
      <P>This is a different idea about God from that of most Christians and 
      Jews. Many use the term &quot;God&quot; to mean a personalized God -- that is, a God 
      who has characteristics like a person. For example, we are familiar with 
      expressions like, &quot;God loves,&quot; &quot;God is merciful,&quot; &quot;the face of God,&quot; &quot;the 
      hand of God.&quot; Hindus say that such personal descriptions are qualities 
      people admire in other people. And since they believe that God is 
      infinitely good, people surmise that God has unlimited amounts of these 
      admirable qualities. But, say the Hindus, God -- if we use that term to 
      mean the <B>REALITY </B>and the true nature of the universe -- is beyond 
      such human representation. And that is what they mean by <I>Brahman</I>, 
      or <B>THAT.</P>
      </B>
      <P>In the Hindu religion, there are personal gods to be worshiped by those 
      persons who so desire. Often it is these gods about which we are told most 
      in writings on Hinduism. According to Hindu myths, the gods have wives 
      (who are also worshiped), and they live almost like human beings. Out of a 
      large number of gods, three are worshiped most by present-day Hindus. The 
      three together form a Hindu trinity: <I>Brahma, </I>the creator; <I><B>
      Vishnu, </B></I>the savior; <I>Shiva, </I>the destroyer and restorer.</P>
      <P>Hindus believe that the creation of the world is a continuing thing in 
      which men share, not something that happened long ago in the past. 
      Therefore, they believe that the three gods work to carry out the 
      continual creation. At the end of each cycle or age in creation, Shiva 
      destroys the old world. Brahma creates a new world. When, during the 
      cycle, men face a problem they cannot solve alone, Vishnu comes as a human 
      being or in some other form, with special powers to give the necessary 
      aid.</P>
      <P>The many other gods and goddesses are also worshiped in whatever ways 
      the people see <I>fit, </I>with prayers, praise, and gifts. Devotees 
      appeal to them to attend to and to bless all phases of human life. And 
      yet, even while they worship the personal gods, the educated Hindus know 
      that the gods are essentially human ideals that men imagine to be 
      objective reality. They do not actually exist in the form in which the 
      people think they exist. The real function of the worship of personal gods 
      is to direct the worshiper to knowledge of <I>Brahman, </I>which lies 
      beyond all menâ€™s wondering and speculation about the universe.</P>
      <P>One can always raise that most troublesome of all questions: &quot;Why was a 
      world created at all?&quot; To this men have not found a final answer, 
      according to the Hindus. Their Hymn of Creation mentions it:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Ah vain are words, and weak all mortal thought! <BR>
        Who is there truly knows, and who can say, <BR>
        Whence this unfathomed world, and from what cause? <BR>
        Nay, even the gods were not! Who, then, can know?<BR>
        <BR>
        The source from which this universe hath sprung,<BR>
        That source, and that alone, can bear it up -- None<BR>
        else: THAT<B>, </B>THAT<B> </B>alone, lord of the worlds,<BR>
        In its own self contained, immaculate<BR>
        As are the heavens above, THAT<B> </B>alone knows<BR>
        The truth of what itself hath made -- none else</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>But if men cannot know the reasons for the creation of the world, they 
      can know something more important. They can know <I>Brahman. </I>The Hindu 
      scriptures are full of suggestions about how a person may live his own 
      life in order to experience the essential unity that is the pattern of all 
      creation. When you know the Atman, your own &quot;inner self,&quot; you also know 
      the heart of the universe, Brah<I>man, </I>the &quot;inner self&quot; of all 
      creation. A person can know <I>Brahman </I>only by knowing himself. Hindus 
      say, &quot;He who knows himself will know God.&quot;</P>
      <P>One of their scripture readings describes it in this way:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>The spirit within me is smaller than a mustard seed.<BR>
        The spirit within me is greater than this earth and<BR>
        sky and the heaven and all these united. It is <I>Brahman.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      </I>
      <P>Happiness lies in the direction of finding real meaning: the real self, 
      the real nature of the universe. Brahman expresses itself in many ways -- 
      in man, through the <I>Atman. </I>But Brahman is not one of the 
      expressions: that is beyond them all. When a man truly knows the Atman, 
      then he may know <I>Brahman. </I>When he knows both, he sees that <I>Atman
      </I>and <I>Brahman </I>are united. And man realizes the supreme knowledge, 
      gains the supreme happiness. All the creatures and creations of the earth 
      arc the same, bound up in inclusive <I>Brahman. </I>There is no diversity, 
      no real difference in any part of reality. All are the same. All are one. 
      &quot;It is <I>Brahman.</I>&quot;</P>
      <B>
      <P>3. WHAT IS MY PLACE IN THIS UNIVERSE?</P>
      </B>
      <P>Why canâ€™t I be happy?<BR>
      Why do I make so many mistakes?<BR>
      Why am I so often afraid?</P>
      <P>These are the questions people often ask themselves and others when 
      they are thinking about the ways they live their lives. For thousands of 
      years, men of every race and nationality have offered seemingly good 
      explanations for ways to be happy. Yet, persons in every generation and in 
      every land live unhappy and sometimes worthless lives -- by their own 
      confession.</P>
      <P>Hindus say that one of the biggest reasons for manâ€™s unhappiness is <I>
      maya</I>. Each person born into this world suffers from confusion and 
      finds it difficult to know the important things in his experience because 
      of <I>maya. </I>The world is <I>maya</I> in the sense that it is always 
      changing from what it is into something else that changes and so on 
      without ceasing. No man can know what the world is, for the world never 
      is: that is, it never stands still long enough to be studied and 
      explained; it is always becoming. Therefore, men easily become bewitched 
      into attaching great importance to something that in reality is trivial.</P>
      <P>Hindus do not mean that the world is not important, but they emphasize 
      the fact that the world as we see it is not the real world. It continually 
      confuses us. For example, if you look down a straight stretch of railroad 
      tracks on a level roadbed, you will see the tracks meet in the distance. 
      Actually they do not meet, but to you they appear to do so.</P>
      <P>The eye, the hand, the ear, the touch -- all deceive us again and 
      again. How can we be so sure that the world we &quot;know&quot; through our 
      first-hand experience is the real world? We cannot be sure, answers the 
      Hindu. Because we are so often confused by apparent truth, we must learn 
      to interpret all our experiences, in order to find reality.</P>
      <P>No matter how carefully wise men explained the danger of confusion 
      because of <I>maya </I>and the importance of knowing Atman and Brahman, 
      there were still some people who lived miserable lives. The Hindus were 
      concerned about these unhappy people. Why did this happen? How could it be 
      prevented? They wondered about such things as the inequality in abilities 
      between persons, the inequalities in joy and pain. They wanted a 
      reasonable explanation.</P>
      <P>They decided that it did not make much sense to say that it was all a 
      matter of accident or chance, or that Brahman was responsible for the 
      inequalities. That would make Brahman unfair and arbitrary. It did not 
      satisfy the questioners to say that all the differences would be solved in 
      some eternity of &quot;heaven&quot; or &quot;hell,&quot; because people did not seem to fall 
      into two distinct groups of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad.&quot;</P>
      <P>Hindus found a satisfactory answer in a belief in reincarnation (or 
      transmigration). Each person has had many lives and will go on having many 
      lives -- enough to discover <I>who </I>he really is. Life is a school to a 
      man; in it he comes to know <I>Atman </I>and Brahman. \When he attains 
      this knowledge, he leaves the school of life. He does not need to enrol 
      again; he has &quot;passed the course.&quot;</P>
      <P>Life is described by the Hindus as being like a stream or river, which 
      flows ceaselessly, without beginning and without ending. All things are 
      part of this stream of existence: stones, plants, animals, men, and so on. 
      Everything exists in life after life until it has come to knowledge of the 
      unity of Atman and Brahman. Each will have as many opportunities for 
      coming to self-knowledge as he needs. This doctrine of reincarnation 
      offers hope to all. No one will be punished for an unlimited period 
      because of a limited number of mistakes.</P>
      <P>There is a universal law, which operates throughout all life. Whatever 
      is sown must be reaped sometime and somewhere. This is the law: every 
      action, every intention to act, every attitude bears its own fruit. &quot;A man 
      becomes good by good deeds and bad by bad deeds,&quot; says one of the Hindu 
      sacred writings. This means that each person is really responsible for his 
      own condition, whether he is confused and mixed-up and unhappy -- or 
      happy. We may want to put the blame on someone else, perhaps our parents. 
      Or we may wish to carry it back to our grandparents or even to Brahman. 
      But this is avoiding the real issue. You are what you are because of what 
      you have done in the past. To a Hindu the past, of course, would include 
      all previous lives or existences. Each person can break with that past 
      only by stretching his mind and gaining knowledge of his real self.</P>
      <P>The Indian writings emphasize that one must exert himself to know the 
      Atman if the influence of past unhappiness is to he outgrown or cast <I>
      off. </I>But a person very often does not make this his goal. He ignores 
      his real nature, and this is the chief evil from which he suffers. He is 
      blind to his real capacities. Many of us sink into the rut of habit and 
      let our past actions and attitudes govern the way we react to present 
      situations instead of aspiring to higher goals. This is like a mountain 
      climber who fails to reach his goal because in his fear of the heights he 
      forgets his real desire to climb the mountain.</P>
      <P>Many people live without thinking about it and simply react the way 
      they always have. Hindus describe them as &quot;rushing about like one 
      possessed by an evil spirit; bitten by the world like one bitten by a 
      great serpent.&quot; When a person finds himself running around in this 
      distracted way, he should stop and remind himself, &quot;This is not my true 
      nature.&quot; Sometimes people do things, which they themselves cannot 
      understand. &quot;Why did I do that?&quot; one asks himself later. Sometimes it is 
      as though a closet door in our insides had suddenly burst open and things 
      we had stuck inside came tumbling out before we could stop them. Sometimes 
      such internal explosions are accompanied by a great deal of emotional 
      expression: we get angry, we get sad, we become moody, and we have 
      tantrums. Such actions are not the result of intelligent choice, but of 
      the load of past attitudes and actions we carry with us. The way to 
      overcome both <I>maya</I> and the influence of the past is to stop and 
      ask, &quot;But what is the real me? What is the Atman?&quot;</P>
      <B>
      <P>CASTE AND DUTY </P>
      </B>
      <P>According to the Hindu teachings, every person has a specific place in 
      life and specific responsibilities. Each person is born where he is, and 
      with particular abilities that he has, because of past actions and 
      attitudes. This underlies the whole pattern of society in India, and it 
      includes what is known as caste. There are four main castes, mentioned in 
      some of the Hindu writings. These are: (1) the intellectual-priestly 
      group; (2) the nobility, including the warriors; (3) the administrative 
      group, including merchants and landowners; and (4) the great masses of 
      people who do the common work of a society. The class of so-called 
      &quot;untouchables&quot; or &quot;out-castes&quot; (recently abolished by Indian law) was 
      composed of people who had originally belonged to different sub-groups of 
      the fourth caste, the masses. Through various social and economic 
      conditions, they &quot;lost caste,&quot; or lost their place in society.</P>
      <P>Within the four castes, there are dozens of sub-divisions. Through the 
      years, more than a thousand levels of castes have appeared in Indian 
      social life; but all belong to one of the four main groups. In ordinary 
      social life, caste lines have frequently reflected real injustices and 
      strong prejudices. Many thoughtful Hindus today realize that abuses have 
      crept into the system. In the twentieth century, many efforts have been 
      made in the direction of straightening out some of the gross injustices. 
      Gandhi was one who gave freely of his energies in restoring the 
      &quot;untouchables&quot; to caste status.</P>
      <P>The caste system serves to afford each person a particular niche in 
      society, with certain duties to be performed in the best way he can. Just 
      as no person can be someone else, neither can he pull himself out of one 
      caste in this life and enter another. In successive rebirths, he can 
      better his position -- if he does his present task well. It is also taught 
      in India that even the lowest caste members may attain complete knowledge 
      of the <I>Atman, </I>if they try hard enough. They can in that way attain 
      the greatest fulfilment life has to offer.</P>
      <B>
      <P>4. WHAT SHALL MY LIFE GOALS BE?</P>
      </B>
      <P>OVER and OVER again, another question arose in the minds of the 
      Indians: &quot;What is my life for?&quot; or &quot;What should I do with my life?&quot; 
      Thoughtful Hindus came to believe that there are four basic goals, which 
      include all valuable parts of human activity and give purpose to every 
      life.</P>
      <P>The most important goal for each person to achieve is release from the 
      influence of past unhappiness. Each person has the fundamental aim all 
      through life of escaping from <I>maya</I> through union with <I>Brahman.
      </I>To help the person in the process of reaching this goal, there are 
      other lesser goals to be fulfilled along the way.</P>
      <P>One of these is the life of pleasure, fulfilment of all normal human 
      desires, including the very important desires rooted in sex. Hindus do not 
      reject the sensory experiences of life -- development of creative 
      relationships with other people, aesthetic appreciation, and sexual 
      expression. The Hindus value these experiences when used correctly and not 
      regarded as the only goals of life. The life of pleasure is included as 
      one of the four goals of men.</P>
      <P>Another human goal is participation in economic activity or public 
      welfare, which includes working in some worthwhile job or profession. Each 
      person has an obligation to himself and to society to do some useful work. 
      For this he receives the wherewithal for his daily needs, and through it 
      he contributes to the common welfare. A personâ€™s economic responsibility 
      to the community is not to be ignored as of any importance, for it is one 
      of the four life goals.</P>
      <P>The fourth important achievement for each Hindu is living the right 
      kind of moral or ethical life. One has a duty to him and to others to do 
      what is expected of him morally and ethically. The duty has been rather 
      specifically defined in India, for each caste has a code of actions and 
      attitudes, which are expected of its members. And to this code a person is 
      pledged through all his endeavors if he wishes to attain the good life.</P>
      <P>Large segments of Hindu teachings have been concerned with the idea of 
      moral duty. Since Hindus stress the unity of all existence, they believe 
      that one person is important to all other persons. This means that each 
      must learn to rise above his own selfish interests. When deciding what to 
      do, most people are tempted to say: &quot;What am I going to gain from this?&quot; 
      Hindus say that we find lasting happiness when we do a thing because for 
      us in our situation it is the right thing, regardless of the gain we 
      receive.</P>
      <P>&quot;To work and work alone are you entitled, not to its fruits. Desire for 
      the fruits of work must never be your motive in working... Wretched are 
      they who work for results.&quot; Thus reads a statement in one of their sacred 
      texts.</P>
      <P>We often say somewhat the same thing in noting that he who plays a game 
      because he loves to play it is happier than he who plays to win. The more 
      intent one is upon winning the game, the more he loses what the playing of 
      the game can offer him. On the other hand, if one plays the game for the 
      sake of the playing, the results take care of themselves. Win or lose, he 
      will have had the satisfaction of playing. The Hindus say that it is the 
      same with all of lifeâ€™s activities. The important thing is how we feel 
      about what we do and the way we do it -- not what we gain from it.</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE STAGES OF LIFE </P>
      </B>
      <P>The ancient Hindus knew that there were certain periods in a personâ€™s 
      life when one goal could be more easily sought than at other times. They 
      divided life into several stages, and then they tried to point out what 
      pleasures or actions were appropriate for each stage. Instruction in the 
      four goals was to be given according to the individualâ€™s readiness to 
      learn about them and his ability to achieve them at that time.</P>
      <P>For example, the child does not need to worry about his later economic 
      and ethical obligations to society. He will have time to learn about them 
      as he grows older. Neither is a child ready for an adult religious 
      experience. Therefore, it would be foolish to expect him to achieve those 
      adult goals. Persons whose duty to caste codes requires them to devote a 
      great deal of time and effort to economic activity are not expected to be 
      very concerned about that most important goal of union of <I>Atman </I>and 
      Brahman. This is true of the lowest caste group, the workers. However, 
      Indians have never claimed the members of the lowest caste cannot realize 
      such a union in their present lifetimes. It simply is not expected of 
      them, because they are required to be so busy with other responsibilities.</P>
      <P>All male members of the three higher castes are advised to follow the 
      suggested life plan, whereby they might attain all the goals. The ancient 
      teachers who developed the plan emphasized the importance of studying and 
      interpreting life. In following the plan, a man will become in successive 
      stages a student, a householder, a retired man, and a spiritual pilgrim.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>The Student Stage</B>.</I> The length of time spent in this stage 
      varies, depending upon the particular caste to which one belongs. Every 
      young man of the upper castes is expected to live for a time with his 
      religious tutor who teaches him the ancient wisdom of India and directs 
      his reading of the sacred books. Each student is personally helped to 
      learn the meaning of life and is encouraged to find his proper place in 
      it.</P>
      <P>According to tradition, no young man in the student phase of his life 
      is supposed to marry. In modem India, however, many of the old customs are 
      not followed as strictly as formerly. Today, some marriages do occur 
      before the young man has completed the usual student phase -- but they are 
      comparatively few in number. Many Indian parents still choose the wives 
      for their sons. Since the arrangements are made by the parents of the 
      couple, usually when they are both quite young, the young man is not 
      expected to take time from his studies to court his future wife.</P>
      <P>In general, there is no social custom comparable to the dating done in 
      the United States today. The adults do not pretend that young people are 
      not interested in the opposite sex. They simply arrange that the interest 
      will not be unduly aroused before the young people are ready for the 
      responsibilities of children. For the three higher castes, this usually 
      means after the young men have passed through the student phases of their 
      lives. Indian law now requires that a girl must be at least fifteen years 
      of age before she can marry; the boy may not be married before eighteen.</P>
      <P>There are reasons why the student stage is important enough to be 
      completed. Every person has a natural Capacity to wonder about life and to 
      raise questions about <B>it. </B>Many of those questions are so big that 
      no person has ever found more than a partial answer, but people seem 
      somehow driven to keep trying to find answers, to learn and continue to 
      learn. The student stage promotes this learning process.</P>
      <P>According to Hindus, it also gives one a chance to get what they call 
      his &quot;second birth.&quot; The first birth was an event over which one had no 
      control, but the second birth is in part an achievement resulting from 
      oneâ€™s own efforts. The Indians call it a spiritual rebirth: a young person 
      begins to see something of the meaning of life. It is essential that one 
      catch the meaning of life before he assumes family obligations.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>The Householder Stage</B>.</I> Although one should retain the studentâ€™s 
      desire to learn, he cannot remain forever with a teacher. Soon the former 
      student is expected to marry and undertake the responsibilities of 
      parenthood. In the householder stage, the Hindu can attain three of the 
      four goals of life. He can find the meaning of the life of pleasure, for 
      the marriage relationship should help to release all the basic human 
      energies and drives. Being a member of the family requires that the person 
      make his own contribution to the economic stability of society by 
      productive work. And certainly the householder has opportunities to do his 
      duty according to the ethical code of his caste. If India has changed 
      slowly through the years, it is because of the specific rights and duties 
      that were regarded as binding on each person in each caste.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>The Retired Stage.</B></I> The three goals that can be attained in the 
      householder stage of life are important. But they should contribute to a 
      larger goal -- the finding of the real self and the real nature of the 
      universe. Therefore, the Hindus provided for a third step, retirement from 
      public life, at which time a man (and his wife with him, if they so wish 
      it) might return to student interests. After oneâ€™s first grandchild is 
      born, one is permitted to withdraw from business or professional 
      activities, give up direct family responsibilities, and retire to a forest 
      hermitage for study. In a group of like-minded retired persons, the 
      middle-aged student now has the opportunity to push further than in his 
      student days the questions: What is the meaning of life? What am I? What 
      is God like?</P>
      <P>Not everyone in India can go on to this stage. Members of the upper 
      castes normally have a better chance to do so because of the more 
      favorable economic conditions, which are theirs. People in Indian live in 
      large family groups instead of in single-family units as Americans usually 
      do. If one man leaves the large family compound, he is not missed as badly 
      as he would be in a single-family plan. Even in America, some people 
      retire from business after the children are married. In India, a man who 
      retires does so not only from business but also from the usual daily 
      activities of the householder or family stage. He has outgrown the need 
      for the earlier kinds of amusement and activities. He wants to reflect, to 
      study, and to meditate.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>The Stage of Spiritual Pilgrim</B>. </I>There is a fourth stage that 
      can be undertaken -- but few enter into it. If he feels ready to do so, a 
      man may leave his hermitage, his village, and his group of congenial 
      friends. Taking his staff and begging bowl, he wanders from place to place 
      without cares or worries -- eating whatever comes his way through the 
      grace of those dwelling in the villages through which he travels, lie 
      helps the people by sharing his wisdom about the meaning of life or merely 
      by his presence. He may live for a while as the tutor of a young student; 
      but when he finishes the task, he wanders off again.</P>
      <P>Westerners have frequently scorned this ideal. Yet, as Indians who know 
      the story of Jesus point out, Jesus was demanding something like this of 
      his own immediate followers. They were to give up everything -- including 
      family obligations -- in order to follow him. To those who were ready for 
      the step, he gave the invitation: leave everything. The search for meaning 
      is more important than any institution -- even the family. The wandering 
      Hindu pilgrim is expressing this conviction dramatically when he leaves 
      every vestige of his former life, in full dedication to the attempt to 
      understand the real self. The attempt may result in physical hardship and 
      loneliness, but the Hindu pilgrim believes these to be unimportant, for 
      the Atman lies beyond comfort and companionship.</P>
      <P>Hinduism teaches us that we can find the real self-only if we search 
      honestly. The search starts during our student days. It goes on through 
      our family days and our retired days. The search does not involve giving 
      up anything that is natural. One should not try to repress or suppress 
      part of his life, his feelings, or his emotions. One should try to see all 
      the desires, urges, and feelings for what they are.</P>
      <P>Facing these honestly, a person discovers many things about himself. 
      When he discovers what he himself is, he discovers what he is most capable 
      of doing. Doing that with all of his heart just because he wants to do it, 
      and doing it with love, he discovers that he is worshiping. To worship God 
      is at the same time to find the real self and its meaning. These values 
      are to be found only by the person who, with the honest desire to learn 
      the answers to his basic questions, plans and lives his life for 
      fulfilment of his highest goals.</P>
      <B>
      <P>5. HOW SHALL I WORSHIP?</P>
      </B>
      <P>The<B> </B>simple folk of Hindu India have listened for many centuries 
      to the advice of their scholars and their wise men. They have heard the 
      answers these learned ones gave to the questions about life and its 
      meaning. And they have done their best to adopt the answers as their own. 
      But there are many people in India, as elsewhere, who cannot make religion 
      their main business. They must till the soil for food for their families 
      and for other people -- for even priests must eat. There are some who must 
      tend the shops, or else all commerce would cease. There are women, whom 
      many men still consider to be incapable of gaining the knowledge that the 
      wise philosophers considered essential.</P>
      <P>What are these people to do? They wish to have happy lives. They wish 
      to live at their best. Above all, they wish to free themselves of the 
      endless chain of reincarnations, which, they fear, will keep them living 
      life after life of work and worry. Is there some way that these people may 
      come to know the Great Power within the universe, without having to spend 
      all their days seeking? Is there some way they can live in accordance with 
      the universal laws, without having to spend the money and the time to 
      study with a wise teacher?</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE HELP OF GODS AND GODDESSES </P>
      </B>
      <P>To people like these, <I>Brahman </I>is difficult to understand. 
      Brahman seems vast and remote. To these people the world seems much more 
      friendly if they have a personal god &quot;on their side.&quot; They want some god 
      to pray to, to give gifts to, to honor in special ceremonies. They feel 
      that such a god will help them to success in their material undertakings 
      and in their spiritual lives. Because the wise men said that everything 
      reflects Brahman, the people consider their god or goddess to be divine. 
      And many of the people feel that a god like this is all of <I>Brahman </I>
      they need to know.</P>
      <P>And so over the centuries, some personal gods have come to be very 
      popular with the Hindu people. Of the Hindu trinity, Shiva (the 
      destroyer-restorer god) and Vishnu (the savior god) are especially 
      revered. (Vishnu is most often worshiped in one of his incarnated forms, 
      Rama or Krishna.) Worshipers seek the aid of the wives of the gods, too. 
      Some of the important goddesses are Durga, Lakshmi, Sita, and Radha. The 
      most famous is Kali, the Mother Goddess of India. Many temples are built 
      in her honor, and she is worshiped as the universal mother and feared as 
      the foe of all sinful people.</P>
      <P>There are many less-known deities to whom shrines are erected and to 
      whom prayers and offerings arc given. Among these are animal gods, nature 
      gods, and legendary heroes. A count of the gods worshiped in India would 
      yield a figure of several hundreds. Each family chooses one god or goddess 
      to worship in particular. While the members of the family may pray and 
      give offerings to other gods, they never forget to pay daily reverence to 
      the family god at the home shrine.</P>
      <P>Such gods and goddesses seem closer to men than Brahman, for they are 
      thought to understand human failings and human hopes. So a visitor to 
      India sees images of various gods being fed and dressed and taken for 
      walks. For all of these activities there are suitable rituals, hymns, and 
      prayers. There is somewhere in Hinduism a deity that the humblest of men 
      can comfortably worship.</P>
      <P>In this way the masses of Hindu believers answer their questions about 
      what the world is like and what the power behind it is. When they see a 
      storm, they believe it to be the work of one of their gods. When they 
      begin a new undertaking, they believe another of the gods will help them. 
      To some, the world has almost &quot;come alive&quot; with gods and goddesses who can 
      be loved or appeased.</P>
      <P>What the average Hindu wants most is aid in his lifeâ€™s pilgrimage. He 
      believes that he can expect to go on living in one body after another 
      until he learns enough about the true nature of himself and about life. 
      And since he knows he cannot spend as much time as the sages and priests 
      in meditation and study, he looks for short cuts to help him. He hopes to 
      find ways that will give him special merit with the gods -- especially 
      Kali, Vishnu, and Shiva. He believes that since the gods are reflections 
      of the Supreme Spirit, <I>Brahman, </I>the person who so worships is truly 
      helped.</P>
      <P>A great number of short cuts have been developed by Hindu devotees. 
      That is the reason travelers to India return with stories strange to our 
      ears. They tell of people thronging to bathe in the River Ganges, the 
      largest river there, and in other rivers and streams. Hindus come to the 
      water because they believe it to be especially purifying; it will wash 
      away some of their past sins and give them merit with the gods. Even the 
      riverbanks are considered sacred. Some Hindus hope to gain ease for their 
      consciences or a better position in their next lives by walking for great 
      distances along the banks of some of the rivers.</P>
      <P>The city of Benares is a sacred city to Hindus. They believe that a 
      person who dies within a ten-mile radius of the city will have the 
      mistakes of his previous lives forgotten by the gods. He may go for a stay 
      of many years in one of the heavens of which Hindus speak. But after this 
      &quot;rest&quot; from the plan of transmigration, he must return to earth to live 
      out the lives necessary for him to gain complete self-knowledge and 
      Brahman-knowledge.</P>
      <P>Through centuries of search for merit, the Hindu believers have added 
      other religious customs. The cow is treated as a holy animal, and prayers 
      are addressed to it. Monkeys must never be harmed, for they, too, are 
      sacred. Some plants are addressed with prayers. The wise men of India 
      explain this by saying that the <I>Atman </I>is present in every living 
      thing. Some nearby animal might be the present life of the Atman that used 
      to be housed by a relative of yours in an earlier life.</P>
      <P>Gandhi -- called by his compatriots the <I>Mahatma </I>or &quot;Great Soul&quot; 
      -- said that cow-worship was the distinctive contribution of Hinduism to 
      the worldâ€™s religious ideas. He explained that many religions teach love 
      of man, but that Hinduism is the only one to teach such love of animals. 
      Therefore, many devout Hindus never eat meat. Killing an animal for meat 
      is wrong, they feel, for the animal has as much right to live as a man.</P>
      <B>
      <P>THREE WAYS TO WORSHIP </P>
      </B>
      <P>Many thoughtful members of the Hindu faith do not believe that all the 
      worship of the common people is effective. They are as critical as many 
      travelers to India, who say that some of the religious practices are 
      absurd and unintelligent. These thoughtful Hindus regard some of the 
      popular religious practices as sheer superstition. They believe that there 
      are three ways to live a good life. One is the way of good deeds. One is 
      the very important way of knowledge about reality. The third is the way of 
      complete devotion.</P>
      <P>Good deeds can be performed by everyone. The poorest member of the 
      lowest caste can do as many good deeds as the well-kept priest in the 
      richest temple in the land. To Hindus, part of doing good deeds is to 
      perform your duty to the best of your ability. There is a place for 
      everyone in this life, and the place that is yours can be filled only by 
      you. Fill it well -- and on your way through this world stop often to help 
      the people and animals.</P>
      <P>The only happiness deserving the name comes from knowledge of reality 
      -- the supreme goal of every Hindu. To this end, men leave their families 
      and go to the forest to study and meditate. Some give up all earthly ties 
      -- even to having a funeral service for them -- to wander about the 
      countryside seeking truth. Some men study Yoga, a system of training for 
      meditation. These men practice breathing and posture exercises untiringly 
      (much more diligently than our football, basketball, or track stars in 
      training). When they have gained the ability to be totally unaware of 
      themselves as persons, they are ready to know the Atman.</P>
      <P>The easiest way to live the good life is to love all living things and 
      to love the gods. Living the life of unselfish love, one becomes 
      completely devoted to the gods. &quot;Love of men leads to love of God,&quot; Hindus 
      say. Some try to intensify their love by looking upon a chosen god in each 
      of these successive roles: parent, master, friend, child, mate, or 
      sweetheart. If such devotional activity brings the worshiper nearer his 
      own true nature, it brings him nearer <I>Brahman. </I>There are some 
      Hindus who feel that during their lives they attain the maturity to 
      worship <I>Brahman </I>directly. But usually the worship of love is 
      exercised on one of the personal gods.</P>
      <B>
      <P>RAMAKRISHNA </P>
      </B>
      <P>One of the most interesting Hindus of recent times was the man called 
      Ramakrishna. He worshiped after the manner of all three paths. Of himself 
      he declared, &quot;He who was Rama and Krishna is now Ramakrishna.&quot; He is 
      considered an incarnation of the supreme lord Vishnu, along with these 
      other two very popular divine descents. When he was just a young man, 
      Ramakrishna was admonished by his brother for not studying more diligently 
      in order to earn his living as a priest. Ramakrishna replied: &quot;And what 
      shall I do with a mere bread-winning education? I would rather acquire 
      that wisdom which will illumine my heart arid give me satisfaction 
      forever.&quot;</P>
      <P>When he was established in a temple supported by a sympathetic, rich 
      widow, Ramakrishna proceeded to live the most devoted kind of life he 
      knew. He became a devotee of Kali, the Divine Mother, represented in Hindu 
      folklore as the wife of the god Shiva. He went beyond all the usual 
      rituals and ceremonials, to make of his life a constant and intense 
      expression of his religious ardor.</P>
      <P>He began to think it important to reach the religious goals that all 
      the sects of Hinduism looked upon as important. He worshiped through the 
      methods of Yoga exercises of self-control, through finding the deepest 
      meanings in pleasure, through renunciation of all material and pleasing 
      things, and through intense and blissful love of Krishna. He took up each 
      method in turn and kept practicing it until he had successfully achieved 
      union of <I>Atman </I>with Brahman.</P>
      <P>When this was over, his zeal carried him on to attempts to reap the 
      spiritual values of other religions. He became in turn a Buddhist, a 
      Moslem, and a Christian. From that experience, he became convinced that 
      the goal of all religions was the same. An order of monks named .after 
      Ramakrishna is active in India and in other parts of the world, including 
      the United States. He is remembered for his belief in the unity of all 
      religions and for his stress on the importance of the spiritual search.</P>
      <B>
      <P>A HINDU WHO WORSHIPED THROUGH GOOD DEEDS </P>
      </B>
      <P>Recently the eyes of Hindus have turned increasingly toward the outer 
      world. India has begun to assert its rightful place as an important 
      nation. This movement was helped a great deal by the efforts and the life 
      of one very devoted Hindu, Gandhi. Before his assassination in 1948, a 
      large part of the world had begun to look to Mahatma Gandhi for guidance 
      in applying religious principles to political situations. For much of his 
      life, he had been engaged in a struggle to better the conditions of the 
      Indian people. He gained much for the nation through fasting, prayer, and 
      conference, rather than through propaganda, terrorism, and armed 
      rebellion. When his death came, it was at the hands of a radical Hindu, 
      who could not bear Gandhiâ€™s insistence that violence not be used against 
      the Moslems living in India.</P>
      <P>It was a religious motivation that made his life a compelling example 
      to millions of his fellow Hindus and the center of attention for masses of 
      people all over the world. Gandhi felt that for him the best kind of life 
      as the life of good deeds. \When he was thirty-four years old, he 
      undertook the vows of purity and poverty, lie dedicated himself to the 
      service of his fellow men. Henceforth no work was too lowly for him to do. 
      Although he had been a member of the merchant caste, he left all caste 
      distinctions behind.</P>
      <P>This saintly statesman had a dream toward which he tried to help the 
      world move. The ideal world, he thought, would be achieved by peaceful 
      means, not by war. All religions and all communities and all peoples would 
      have equal privileges. Gandhi insisted on truth and non-violence in every 
      sphere of life. In his insistence, he focused the white light of truth on 
      the inequalities of the caste system and upon untouchability, which he 
      considered to be blight upon the face of modern India.</P>
      <P>He came to feel that the Indian people were being deprived of their 
      rights to their unique culture, and so he initiated the movement, which 
      finally led to independence from British rule. The changes he effected 
      were nude through the medium of his ascetic habits: his fasts and penances 
      and his renunciation of material comforts. He indeed ceased to live for 
      himself and lived for truth and non-violence.</P>
      <P>Gandhi raised so effective a voice for his people that probably some of 
      his writings will someday be included among Indiaâ€™s sacred literature, he 
      is already being described by his followers as a savior of his people -- 
      an <I>avatar. </I>Of himself, he said simply, I am a man of peace.&quot;</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE INFLUENCE OF HINDUISM</P>
      </B>
      <P>For a time we have been looking at the Hinduism that people can see: 
      the gods and goddesses, the images and idols, the temples and sacred 
      places, the rituals and the offerings. We have paused to look at 
      Ramakrishna and Gandhi, two spiritual giants who helped to turn the 
      attention of others to the necessity of living religiously. Thereby the 
      two bettered their religion and their country. Wherever a religion makes a 
      real difference in the lives of people, it becomes a truly magnificent 
      force. Hinduism is such a force. One of the oldest religions in the world 
      -- some say the oldest -- Hinduism has for centuries helped people to find 
      answers to their deepest questions.</P>
      <P>What am I really? In your inner self, replies the Hindu, you are part 
      of God.</P>
      <P>What is my life? The Hindu answers that it is a search of whatever 
      length necessary to find God in yourself.</P>
      <P>How can I be happy? Only by coming to know God, replies the Hindu.</P>
      <P>How can I know God? &quot;He who knows himself will know God.&quot;</P>
      <P>Which way of worship is best? Hindus have said: &quot;Cattle are of 
      different colors, but all milk is alike; ... systems of faith are 
      different, but God is one.&quot;</P>
