      <P>TOWARD A RICHER FAITH</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P>Most of us tie our faith to a fixed set of beliefs. We tend to look 
      upon other religions as less pure or genuine. We forget that the Oriental 
      finds many of our beliefs incredible.</P>
      <P>Yet no religion should be measured by its lowest expression -- it 
      should be measured by its highest. And looking at the great prophets of 
      the great religions, we see how similar they were in many of their 
      attitudes. To honor one does not mean to dishonor another. </P>
      <FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#7f0000"><B>
      <P>FOREWORD</P>
      </B></FONT>
      <P>Prophets<B> </B>are people who live out on the fringe of their society. 
      They are not tied down to the manners and ways of their own people hut 
      walk out where their vision takes in wider horizons. They carve out new 
      paths. Their religion is open and outreaching.</P>
      <P>Priests are those who minister close to the altars of convention. They 
      are the salesmen of wares handed on to them and the distributors of 
      tradition. They do not so much create as conserve.</P>
      <P>All religions have their prophets and priests -- few of the former and 
      many of the latter. The institutions such as the shrine and the temple, 
      the church and the synagogue are the concern of the priests; reform, new 
      revelations, and fresh insights are the meat and drink of the prophets.</P>
      <P>Christianity (like all religions) has been a religion of many facets. 
      Down through the centuries it has had its full measure of both prophets 
      and priests -- the latter in the great majority. Most of us have been 
      taught our religion by means of some institution, and we easily come to 
      believe the institution’s interpretation of it. We tie our faith to the 
      faith of the church (our church), to a set of beliefs, to fixed forms and 
      patterns. We tend to look askance upon others not of our own household -- 
      regarding others as &quot;less pure&quot; or less genuine. Institutional religion is 
      by nature divisive: it sets people off from each other, sometimes 
      deliberately (with creeds and polity) and more often unconsciously (by the 
      nurture of pride that we are the possessors of religious truths). Priest 
      religions are like nationalisms: self-perpetuating and self-conscious.</P>
      <P>When we look across the borders to other religions, we tend to look 
      down from our self-assertive heights. We like to point out how naive and 
      superstitious are the beliefs of people in other geographical and cultural 
      areas, how immature their gods, how fantastic their practices. We forget 
      that if an Oriental looked at us from his heights he would find many of 
      our Christian practices and even our beliefs equally incredible and many 
      of our religious manners fantastic.</P>
      <P>It is unfair to measure any religion by its lowest expressions. All 
      religions have their heights as well as their lowlands, and the heights 
      are to be seen clearly in their creators, their founders, and their great 
      literature. The measure of a religion is its best ideals. We expect others 
      to estimate our religion by its best expression; and, in turn, as an 
      elemental courtesy, we should judge others by their best. A Christian 
      always prefers to have Jesus of Nazareth represent his religion when it is 
      judged; and those of the other faiths would choose their best prophets to 
      represent them when comparisons are made.</P>
      <P>If our approach is in this spirit, we come to see how much alike the 
      greater prophets in all the greater religions are as they have pointed the 
      direction for men, how similar they are in estimating virtues, and how, 
      presumably, their best gods show character not unlike some of the best 
      traits we know. The metaphors of religions differ greatly. All religions 
      thrive in metaphors appropriate to specific times, places, and cultures. 
      But metaphors are instruments and not ends. God is always more than any 
      metaphor.</P>
      <P>To believe in a worthy God is to believe in a God of all people, 
      whatever the race or clime; a God not far from consecrated human spirits 
      anywhere.</P>
      <P>There are many prophets of divinity, though the light may be 
      transmitted more brightly through some than through others. To honor one 
      of them in deepest reverence does not mean to dishonor others. We need to 
      know more about the prophets of other treat religions who presumably have 
      transmitted divine light, even as we ought to hunger to know more about 
      the unclouded message of the founder of our own religion. We can afford to 
      be charitable toward those who so haltingly understood their prophets and 
      who, as priests, have gotten lost in the coarse details of their religion.</P>
      <P>This book, it seems to me, is a prophetic hook. While it shows forth 
      priestly religions, it sets the sights toward the prophetic in all of 
      them. It is prophetic in its evident purpose: to stimulate a warmer 
      appreciation of great prophets and great prophetic literature. It is 
      prophetic in its evident desire: to promote the attitude that the sons of 
      men must cultivate in the days ahead, while cultures are impinging upon 
      cultures, while people are being drawn together in the interchange of 
      communication and in the awareness of a common destiny. The way the world 
      is going, we shall have to grow big in spirit, in tolerance and 
      fraternity. There is hardly any other choice for survival.</P>
      <P>It is my own belief that if the founders of the great faiths were with 
      us today they would cross the borders that their disciples have set up 
      between them; they would sit down at a table to express their agreements 
      and discern the truths behind their various metaphors. They would find 
      kinship in a common world of spirit, their common God.</P>
      <P>Many of us are finding out how alike people are in their deepest 
      aspirations. If you exchange ideas with a liberal of the Jewish faith. you 
      will find him close to your own (if your own has the breath of fresh air 
      that the prophet breathes). You will not be surprised if one of our 
      friends calls himself both Christian and Buddhist, if you know something 
      of the essentials of each faith. You will attend the simple service of a 
      Ramakrishna meetinghouse in New York City with the feeling that the 
      founder of your own religion is present in this house of God. And you will 
      appreciate the Hindu affirmation that truth shines more brilliantly when 
      it shines from many angles, like the diamond with its many facets. You 
      will be impressed by the counsel of the Hindu who urges you, not to give 
      up your own religious heritage, but to see it with the help of its 
      greatest prophet rather than the dogmas of its priests.</P>
      <P>Dr. Ross is eminently qualified to point the way to a larger faith.

      is the author of <I>The Meaning of Life in Hinduism and Buddhism </I>and
      <I>Addressed to Christians: Isolationism vs. World Community</I>, and 
      co-author of <I>Ethics and the Modern World</I>. He knows his own historic 
      religion intimately, and his studies have brought him closer to the 
      prophets and prophetic literature of other great religions.</P>

      religion at the University of Southern California, she went on to study 
      for her M.A. degree there.</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER">INTRODUCTION</P>
      </FONT>
      <P>1. WE LOOK AT LIFE </P>
      </B>
      <P>A story is told of three men who were shipwrecked on an island in the 
      South Seas. As the ship was pounded to pieces on the coral shoals, food, 
      clothing, and equipment were lost in the surf. The three exhausted 
      survivors pulled themselves up on the beach out of reach of the pounding 
      waves. Having caught their breath, they began to take stock of their 
      surroundings. Beyond the sandy stretch arose wooded hills and then rocky 
      ledges and steep precipices. There was no evidence of any human being 
      aside from themselves. The only sounds were the roaring of the ocean and 
      the noisy cries of the gulls.</P>
      <P>Not one of the men had a compass. Their radio had been lost in the 
      wreck. Their immediate urge was to find out whether the island was 
      inhabited. The food supply, they saw, would be no problem, for tropical 
      fruits abounded. But they desperately wanted to find out where they were. 
      They realized that this meant making a search for other persons who might 
      be able to give them a clue as to their whereabouts. It was decided that 
      one man would work along the beach in one direction, a second man going in 
      the opposite direction. The third man was to penetrate to the foothills. 
      Each sought some sign of human habitation -- a footprint, a cultivated 
      field, or smoke from some village in the distance.</P>
      <P>In the hours of search that followed, it was the third man who 
      discovered the first trace of human beings -- smoke rising from a small 
      hut high up on a mountainside. He reported back to his companions, and all 
      three set off for the village. The islanders proved to be quite friendly. 
      Before many weeks were past, the men found passage on a small boat, which 
      took them in the direction of their homeland. </P>
      <B>
      <P>OUR ISLAND UNIVERSE </P>
      </B>
      <P>You and I are in a similar situation. Without choice we have been cast 
      up on this &quot;island&quot; called Earth. Like shipwrecked men, we can either feel 
      terribly sorry for ourselves or start looking around to try to get our 
      bearings. To be sure, we do not have to search for people, for we are 
      usually surrounded by them. However, we sometimes find it difficult to 
      locate people who can help us find out exactly where we are or assist us 
      toward our destination.</P>
      <P>As children, we take for granted that our parents know all the answers. 
      As we get older we sometimes try to solve our problems in the same ways 
      our parents seem to have solved theirs. We sometimes forget that they 
      cannot know all the answers to all life’s problems. They live on the 
      island, too. And nobody asked them if they wanted to be here. Finding 
      themselves here, they set out to make the best of it. They have found some 
      answers through their living.</P>
      <P>We are guided in our early years by their learned wisdom, partial 
      though it is. But we cannot safely guide our lives solely by the ideas of 
      those who have happened to live ahead of us. Nor can we accept their 
      suggestions blindly. We must remember that an answer can be ours only when 
      we have made it a part of our experience. No parent or teacher can live 
      for us. There is much we can learn only through living and learning for 
      ourselves.</P>
      <B>
      <P>CAN WE BE HONEST WITH OURSELVES?</P>
      </B>
      <P>Some people appear to be living day by day without taking much time to 
      think about it. They never seem to wonder about the world in which they 
      live or their place in it. Their living is controlled by habit, and they 
      do not seem to look for any improvements. It is unfortunate when this 
      happens to anyone, for he is losing his opportunity to grow and progress. 
      The continuing search for better answers about the nature of life and the 
      universe adds zest to living. It is much more thrilling than having to 
      accept old answers and customs and habits just because they are old.</P>
      <P>A person may stop wondering and questioning because some adult 
      discouraged him. Sometimes teachers and parents are too tired, too busy, 
      or too impatient to give helpful attention to a younger person’s 
      questions. So lie just quits asking after a time. Others become so 
      interested in social activities or sports or work that they ignore their 
      deeper wonderings about the nature of things.</P>
      <P>Yet the questions are there inside us. What is life? How did we get 
      here? What is God like? What is the difference between right and wrong? 
      What is love? What happens to us when we die? These and many other 
      questions like them have been asked by people of all lands and all times.</P>
      <P>If we are honest with ourselves, we let such questions absorb some of 
      our attention and our efforts. Searching for answers is the way we learn. 
      We should never feel ashamed to raise questions. Nor should we feel that 
      someone else, no matter how famous he is, has found all the answers for us 
      already. In order to live fully, all of us must ask about the meaning of 
      life and try to find some satisfactory answers. Doubts and questions are 
      healthy signs of honesty with ourselves and are a measure of our effort to 
      increase self-understanding.</P>
      <B>
      <P>DOES RELIGIONS HAVE THE &quot;ANSWERS&quot;?</P>
      </B>
      <P>Some people talk about religion as though it had all the answers, but 
      the claim only raises more questions. What is &quot;religion&quot;? Is it going to 
      church, singing songs, listening to prayers, learning how to pray? When 
      people talk about God, what do they mean? Where do people get their ideas 
      of God? How do we know whether they are right or not? Why should we feel 
      that we have to believe in a certain way?</P>
      <P>No religion has all the answers, no matter what ministers or priests 
      may sometimes say. All religions try to raise the questions that matter 
      most. Religions also provide a record of how some people have answered 
      these basic questions. Many persons think that their own religion offers 
      the best answers to everyone’s questioning. But the wisest teachers of the 
      religions have not said so. Instead, they have encouraged others to 
      explore the meaning of life, as they themselves were doing.</P>
      <B>
      <P>WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM OTHERS? </P>
      </B>
      <P>As we look for the answers to our wonderings, it is often helpful to 
      look beyond ourselves. Many people of other cultures and religions have 
      found some important clues to the meaning of life. Their ideas may furnish 
      us with some valuable suggestions. A study of them will give us more help 
      than the study of one &quot;answer&quot; alone -- exclusively that of our own nation 
      or our own religion. It will offer us a shorter path towards the wisdom 
      that others have gathered.</P>
      <P>We must choose carefully the people to whom we go for help, for life 
      does not allow us time to quiz all of our ancestors and examine all the 
      religions of other generations. We must choose persons who have tried to 
      be honest in the quest. We do not want to waste our time with insincere or 
      self-important teachers, ancient or modern.</P>
      <P>Neither do we want to get lost on a slumming expedition among the 
      people whose religions we are going to study. If we want to discover 
      whether Beethoven wrote music that we might like, we need to listen to his 
      symphonies or sonatas. We should not worry over the fact that he often 
      went around with egg stains on his tie. In the same way, if we want to 
      find helpful suggestions from other people, we need to examine their ideas 
      about life. We should not become preoccupied with the ways in which their 
      clothing or customs differ from ours.</P>
      <P>Scientists, artists, engineers, teachers, philosophers, and theologians 
      -- all, regardless of race, language, or country, are trying to find new 
      meanings about life. Someday we may have a much more complete picture than 
      we now have. At the moment it is as though we are still trying to put 
      together a big jigsaw puzzle. Some people are working on one corner of the 
      puzzle, some on another, and so on. Many of us get so interested in the 
      tiny details that we forget the total picture. Only in our more 
      imaginative moments do we try to get a glimpse of the whole of life.</P>
      <P>Almost always people have looked to their religions for some sense of 
      the whole picture of life, even though countless pieces have not yet been 
      fitted into the puzzle. Perhaps we shall learn a few things from other 
      religions that may help us to understand more.</P>
      <B>
      <P>WHY SHOULD WE STUDY LIFE AT ALL?</P>
      </B>
      <P>As children we were very concerned with the immediate activities of 
      every day. But as young persons we begin to discover that, while separate 
      activities are important, they are but a part of our whole lives. And our 
      lives are part of something much bigger -- the life in which all beings 
      share. We become more concerned about what each life is and how it relates 
      to every other. We begin to explore the meaning of life. We are interested 
      in doing more independent thinking than we have done before.</P>
      <P>Our lives become increasingly a matter of our own making, and if we 
      think about it, we make our lives meaningful. Because men everywhere, have 
      found that the meaningful life was a goal of all people, they have 
      developed religions to help them decide what is really important. The 
      world’s religions have much to offer to us today in our personal quest for 
      meanings and answers. All men’s searches for right relationships to 
      themselves, to others, and to the world are parts of that common search in 
      which we too are involved.</P>
      <P>Let us take up the challenge of this quest for meaningful life, raising 
      our questions and searching constantly and gladly for answers we can 
      accept. As we do, we shall gain inspiration from those who have asked and 
      answered in other times and places. Let us see what they have to say to 
      us, and let US use what will help us to continue our search for better 
      ways to live.</P>
