      <P>JUDAISM</P>
      </FONT>
      <P>13. THE LORD IS ONE </P>
      </B>
      <P>The whole world<B> </B>knows the Jews. Their wanderings have carried 
      them over the earth. With them they have taken their religion, to which 
      most of them have remained intensely loyal. When the sun sets at the 
      beginning of the Sabbath, many millions of Jews start their day of rest 
      and worship. Their numbers are not large in comparison with the world’s 
      total population. But the mark that the Jews have made in the world is 
      large and significant indeed.</P>
      <P>Judaism is the &quot;mother religion&quot; of both Christianity and Islam. These 
      three have been the major religions of the Western parts of the world. 
      From Judaism, Christianity and Islam &quot;inherited&quot; many religious ideas, 
      morals, and practices. If a historian ignored the contribution of the Jews 
      to the development of Western civilization, he could not write its past or 
      understand its present.</P>
      <P>Jews do not belong to one race of people. Their wanderings over the 
      earth have made this impossible. Thousands of years ago, they were a group 
      of tribes, then called the Hebrews. Now the term ‘Jew’ applies correctly 
      to anyone who is a member of the Jewish faith. Nationally speaking, Jews 
      are Germans, Arabian, American, and almost everything else.</P>
      <P>Despite their widespread national homes, the Jews have retained 
      throughout the ages a sense of closeness to one another. They have done 
      this by following carefully their religious practices and laws. They have 
      done it through a single-minded insistence on the truth of what they call 
      the <I>Shema: </I>&quot;Hear, 0 Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One.&quot; 
      This is the heart of every Jewish religious service. More than this, it is 
      the heart of Judaism.</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE ONE GOD </P>
      </B>
      <P>The Hebrews of ancient times sought to understand the meaning and 
      purpose of life, just as did the ancient wise men of India and China. Out 
      of that wondering, some Hebrew of long ago came to feel a special 
      relationship to the heart of the universe. Jewish traditions say that this 
      man was Abraham. Abraham believed in a personal god who took a special 
      interest in his destiny and dreams. Jews still honor this legendary man as 
      the father of their people. Others took up his beliefs and found in them 
      answers to their own questions about the world.</P>
      <P>Eventually there appeared another great personality, Moses. He 
      sharpened and clarified the idea of a personal god. He believed that the 
      god had made a special agreement with Abraham and with all his 
      descendants. They had promised their loyalty and devotion. In turn, the 
      god would make them a mighty nation.</P>
      <P>Traditional Jews still believe that God revealed the laws of life to 
      Moses on Mount Sinai. They call Moses the founder of their religion. To 
      him they give the credit for their important collection of laws on 
      religious practice, behavior, and diet. He was the leader chosen by God to 
      deliver the Hebrews from slavery in a strange country into a land of their 
      own.</P>
      <P>Such beliefs are based on the old, old tales found in the books of <I>
      Genesis </I>and Exodus. As many Jewish scholars have always been ready to 
      point out, they cannot be taken as literal history. They are legends that 
      were finally put into writing after centuries of existence in the memories 
      of the Hebrew people, who had told them aloud generation after generation. 
      The legends show that the god was at first a tribal god, a protector and 
      benefactor of the Hebrews, the descendants of Abraham. He was known and 
      worshiped by Abraham, his son Isaac, and his grandson Jacob, who was later 
      called Israel.</P>
      <P>Gradually, the Hebrew-Jewish people became convinced that this tribal 
      god was actually the one and only God of all creation. Of course, this 
      process took time. It took century after century, through the periods of 
      the great Hebrew leaders -- the tribal fathers, Moses, David and the other 
      kings, Isaiah and the rest of the prophets. Slowly the people were gaining 
      a worldview that could not have been theirs at their beginning as 
      wandering nomad tribes.</P>
      <P>But now, for 2500 years, the great affirmation of Judaism has been: 
      &quot;... the Lord our God, the Lord is One.&quot; The development of the Jewish 
      worship of one God reflects the experiences and temperament unique to the 
      Jews. In their own way, they early arrived at a conclusion shared by all 
      major living religions today: underlying the endless variety we see in 
      life is a single purpose, a single reality.</P>
      <P>For a long time, Jews did not find it important to discuss the nature 
      of God. God exists, he is one, and he is reality. Even today, there is not 
      a creed describing the characteristics of God. The Shema is sufficient.</P>
      <P>However, some rabbis and philosophers did become interested in 
      describing God’s qualities, though no Jew is ever required to affirm the 
      ideas. God is righteous. He is the Creator. He is Spirit. God is a 
      sympathetic helper to man, providing the means whereby man may save 
      himself from the limitations of ignorance and sinfulness. God has made men 
      as his children; thus, they reflect his nature.</P>
      <B>
      <P>RIGHTEOUSNESS</P>
      </B>
      <P>No Jew can be said to love God, unless he is also in loving 
      relationship with his neighbor. ills neighbor includes the alien and 
      stranger in his land, whom he is asked to treat as he treats his own 
      people. Even more than this is a Jew asked to do: &quot;... thou shalt love 
      they neighbor as thyself.&quot;</P>
      <P>Long after this was written, someone offered a challenge to the famous 
      Rabbi Hillel, who lived and taught at about the same time as Jesus. The 
      challenger asked the rabbi to tell everything important about Judaism in 
      the space of time in which a man could stand on one foot. Rabbi Hillel 
      declared: &quot;That which is hurtful to thee do not to thy neighbor. This is 
      the whole doctrine. The rest is commentary. Now go forth and learn.&quot;</P>
      <P>Righteousness is so important to Jews that one might say there are twin 
      Jewish concerns -- the oneness of God and the righteousness of man. It is 
      not hard for men to follow the laws and will of God. Being made in God’s 
      image, we have a natural capacity for goodness. Failure to do the right, 
      say Jews, is a denial of our own nature.</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE LAW </P>
      </B>
      <P>Often Jews have known God as the Lawgiver for their people. The Law he 
      gave is called the Torah, which means &quot;Teaching.&quot; The Torah consists of 
      five books, sometimes called the Pentateuch. The books are Genesis, 
      Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. All Jews are encouraged to 
      study them. The complete <I>Torah is </I>regularly read each year in the 
      synagogues, a portion on each Sabbath.</P>
      <P>The <I>Torah </I>contains the legends of its own origin. According to 
      these legends, God gave the Law to Moses on Mount Sinai, while the Hebrews 
      were camping in the wilderness after escaping from Egypt. There the 
      Hebrews renewed their agreement with God, promising to abide by his laws. 
      Traditions further tell that their God spoke the Ten Commandments, which 
      are found in the twentieth chapter of <I>Exodus. </I>There were more 
      commandments than these, to be sure -- over six hundred in all. The 
      commandments deal with a wealth of subjects: diet, crime and punishment, 
      religious practices, holy days, and human relationships. Many Jews are 
      among the first to insist that all these laws could not have been made in 
      one time and one place. They are actually a collection of laws that the 
      Hebrew-Jewish people formulated over a period of years of living together.</P>
      <P>In the Jewish Bible, there is a second section known as &quot;The Prophets.&quot; 
      Many people believe that the height of Jewish thought and understanding 
      was reached in the teachings of the prophets. The prophets did not 
      foretell the future; they did &quot;tell for&quot; God. They were, first and 
      foremost, spokesmen for God, who warned of dire consequences if God’s will 
      were not followed.</P>
      <P>It was the prophets who tried to show the people that devotion to God 
      did not lie solely in following each law in smallest detail. Why should a 
      man concern himself with the detailed observance of over six hundred laws? 
      Devotion lay in keeping the spirit of the Law.</P>
      <P>According to Isaiah, these are attributes of the man who has pondered 
      the spirit of the law:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>He who walks uprightly, and speaks sincerely,<BR>
        Who scorns the gain that is won by oppression,<BR>
        Who keeps his hand free from the touch of a bribe,<BR>
        Who stops his cars against hearing of bloodshed,<BR>
        And closes his eyes against looking on evil.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The prophet Micah reduced the important rules to only three, in his 
      famous declaration of a man’s spiritual duty:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>You have been told, O man, what is good,<BR>
        And what the Lord requires of you:<BR>
        Only to do justice, and to love kindness,<BR>
        And to walk humbly with your God.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>For Amos, this was the spirit of the Law: &quot;Seek the Lord, that you may 
      live.&quot;</P>
      <P>Still a third section of the Jewish Bible is known as &quot;The Writings.&quot; 
      It includes books of history recounting the adventures of the 
      Hebrew-Jewish people and their growing understanding of their world. It 
      includes the <I>Psalms </I>and the other books of poetry. While these are 
      not considered to be the basic Law, as the first five books are, they are 
      still in the spirit of the Law.</P>
      <P>Modern Jews do not rely only on these three sections of their sacred 
      writing. There is another group of writings, not a part of their Bible, 
      but revered just second to it. This is the <I>Talmud. </I>The Talmud is, 
      in effect, an extension of the <I>Torah </I>down into the centuries, which 
      followed the completion of the other writings. The Talmud arose to meet 
      conditions that the Jews faced in later times. As their homes and 
      surroundings changed, their religious and cultural needs changed. 
      Additional laws grew out of the newer needs. These were passed from 
      generation to generation by word of mouth. From time to time, learned 
      rabbis commented on these oral laws and on the earlier, written ones, 
      seeking to reinterpret them for the changing times.</P>
      <P>Through such continued commentary on past traditions and laws in the 
      light of newer situations, the Law of Judaism has remained alive. Modern 
      Jews are able to adjust themselves creatively to demands never dreamed of 
      by Moses or other great teachers of long ago.</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE JEWISH TASK</P>
      </B>
      <P>The old tradition of the special agreement between God and the Hebrews 
      convinced many Jews that God had chosen them as his favorites above all 
      people on the earth. They felt that they were privileged, and some of them 
      looked upon other peoples as inferior. However, later teachers interpreted 
      the idea of &quot;chosenness&quot; in a different way. They said that the Jews had 
      been chosen to serve the Lord, teaching others about the one God of all 
      the world.</P>
      <P>Still some Jews persisted in thinking in terms of exclusiveness. This 
      caused the prophets much concern. Listen to an early prophet as he tries 
      to correct their mistaken ideas:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>&quot;Are you not like the Ethiopians in my sight,<BR>
        0 Israelites&quot;; is an oracle of the Lord.<BR>
        &quot;Did I not bring up Israel from the land of Egypt,<BR>
        Also the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?&quot;</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>An anonymous prophet shows that their God is the God of all people. He 
      quotes God as saying: &quot;Blessed be Egypt <I>my </I>people, and Assyria the 
      work of my hands, and Israel my heritage.&quot; The whole book of Jonah is 
      directed against narrow nationalism and the &quot;chosen people&quot; idea held by 
      many Jews of that time.</P>
      <P>There have always been many Jews who followed the emphasis of the 
      prophets. These Jews have never believed themselves to be divinely chosen 
      above all other peoples. Jews traditionally have been tolerant of 
      believers in other faiths. Their patience and forbearance in matters of 
      religion are close to the attitudes of sincere Hindus and Buddhists.</P>
      <P>In their ideas of God and in their Law, the Jews find their dearest 
      values. For these, they feel richly blessed. But most of them do not 
      believe that the blessing is available only to them. Other people find 
      values in their own ideas, too, and Jews accept such differences as 
      enriching. For their part, Jews do not wish to persuade others to their 
      religion. It is not a way of salvation. It is a way of life. And though 
      there are numbers of converts to Judaism, Jews never work actively for the 
      conversion of others.</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE KINGDOM OF GOD </P>
      </B>
      <P>Jews are always concerned about righteousness. They have never felt 
      that governments or societies, as people have known them, are as good as 
      they could be. So the Jews look for a future time when all men will be 
      righteous and when their families and societies will reflect that 
      righteousness. Traditionally the Jews have called this future time the 
      &quot;Kingdom of God.&quot; It would be a time when God’s righteous rule would 
      extend over the whole earth.</P>
      <P>Traditional and modem Jews disagree about how it will come and what it 
      will be. Traditional Jews still refer to a Messiah, a person selected by 
      God to bring in the Kingdom, since men have thus far been unable to do it 
      alone. Liberal Jews prefer to think of every man as a messiah, who does 
      whatever he can to advance the cause of righteousness. Gradually, then, 
      the Kingdom will arrive.</P>
      <P>The Jewish hope and the Christian hope for a righteous world order are 
      very similar -- even though they have been expressed in differing terms. 
      And Jews declare that it is to be universal, for they believe that the 
      righteous of all nations will have a share in the world to come.</P>
      <P>The Jews’ great interest in living rightly now and in improving the 
      world has lessened their concern about life beyond the grave. Jews do not 
      agree among themselves on this subject. Some traditional Jews have faith 
      in a life beyond the grave that includes punishment and reward, a bodily 
      resurrection, and eternity in Heaven or Hell. More liberal Jews consider 
      none of these beliefs important. Though they believe that the quality of 
      personality (or the soul) cannot die, they do not care to make theories 
      about it. This life, for them, is the life that is important. Doing the 
      right thing now is of more value than believing something. Many Jews feel 
      that repentance and good deeds for one hour in this world are better than 
      the whole life of the world to come.</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE PROMISED LAND </P>
      </B>
      <P>The Jews have been the world’s best-known displaced persons. More than 
      two thousand years ago, world events left them without a permanent home 
      and sent them forth to roam the earth. Wherever they settled, they kept 
      alive their traditions and their worship of God. Often they stayed 
      together in their own communities, in order that they might better keep 
      their holy days and their dietary laws.</P>
      <P>Other people found the Jewish ways different and sometimes difficult to 
      understand. The differences caused some people to complain, and even to 
      persecute the Jews. The Jews have suffered more severe treatment from 
      their neighbors than any other single religious group. Christians 
      particularly -- accusing the Jews of having killed Jesus -- have been 
      guilty of such persecution. Even today, unscrupulous leaders can find a 
      scapegoat in the Jews, inciting hatred against them, Why the Jews have 
      been so treated is a serious problem that still concerns students of 
      history, sociology, anthropology, and religion.</P>
      <P>The isolation forced upon them and the persecution by many neighbors 
      through many years made the Jews more dependent upon one another and upon 
      their traditions than they might otherwise have been. For over two 
      thousand years, they have recalled the ancient promise of God about a land 
      that would be theirs. This was the legendary promised land sought by the 
      Hebrews who left Egypt under the leadership of Moses. This land they had 
      for a time, but they were conquered by one nation after another, only to 
      be driven out in the end.</P>
      <P>Many Jews have kept alive the hope that once again the land of 
      Palestine would be theirs. To help bring peace to a laud troubled by 
      outbreaks of violence between the most ardent Jewish nationalists, called 
      Zionists, and their ancient enemies, the Arabs, the United Nations in 1948 
      agreed to a partition of Palestine -- Israel for the Jews and Jordan for 
      the Arabs. The arbitrary boundaries could not, of course, completely 
      resolve the age-old hostilities, which were complicated by the fact that 
      both states laid claim to Jerusalem, a city sacred to Islam as well is to 
      Judaism and Christianity. The United Nations adopted a resolution to 
      internationalize the city but could get support neither from Israel nor 
      from Jordan. The city, then, like the land, remains divided. A further 
      cause for bitterness is that many Jews had to leave their homes on the 
      Jordan side of the border, just as many Arabs had to move from the Israel 
      side when the country was partitioned. There is now between the states a 
      kind of hostile peace; but the tensions go very deep.</P>
      <P>Israel has opened its gates to Jews from all over the world. It is yet 
      too early to see what effect this will have on the religion of Judaism, 
      which for long centuries was without a country of its own. Many Jews do 
      not consider the new nation really important to their religion, for they 
      believe that their religious lives can be lived out wherever they now find 
      themselves. Jewish worship does not depend on a national home.</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE CONGRAGATIONS OF JUDAISM </P>
      </B>
      <P>There is no central religious leader in Judaism. Each congregation 
      governs itself. Rabbis are laymen -- not priests. They teach the people 
      and try to clarify the Law. They do not speak to God for the people. The 
      people are their own priests; they worship God for themselves.</P>
      <P>For a long time, all Jews were &quot;orthodox&quot; -- that is, they all followed 
      the laws as listed in their sacred books, to the best of their 
      understanding and ability. But the pressures and changes of modern life 
      made this increasingly difficult. Some came to believe that a modern 
      worldview required changes in their personal expression of religious 
      practices. So, in relatively modern times, many Jews have moved away from 
      a strict interpretation of the faith, morality, and practices of their 
      fathers.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Orthodox Judaism</B>. Those who still try to be faithful to the ancient 
      traditions interpreted very strictly are known as &quot;Orthodox&quot; Jews. They 
      consider the whole Torah to have been divinely inspired and revealed by 
      God to Moses. They keep all the Mosaic laws, including the dietary 
      restrictions and the strict Sabbath limitations. They use Hebrew in all 
      their synagogue services. Special schools, which they support, teach their 
      children Jewish history and the beginnings of the Hebrew language. Many 
      Orthodox Jews still look for the coming of the personal Messiah.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Conservative Judaism.</B> &quot;Conservative’ Jews are those who honor and 
      respect the Torah, but who believe in interpreting it through modern 
      Biblical scholarship in order to understand it better. They believe it is 
      important to continue in the traditional forms of worship, with Hebrew 
      used in their services. On the Sabbath they do only necessary work, and 
      they try to make it a day of prayer.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Reform Judaism.</B> A modern American movement has attracted many Jews 
      in this country. It is Reform Judaism and it is a result of an effort to 
      adapt Judaism to twentieth-century Western life. Reform Jews read the 
      Torah with an eye to its truth as determined by its agreement with reason 
      and experience. The whole tradition of their people is something they 
      regard with respect. The worship is somewhat similar to that of Protestant 
      Christian churches. Families sit together for services that include organ 
      music and choirs, with the liturgy in Hebrew, but the sermon in English. 
      Both boys and girls are confirmed.</P>
      <B>
      <P>LESSONS OF JUDAISM </P>
      </B>
      <P>The great teachers of Judaism have made a tremendous contribution to 
      the religious thought of all men. They taught that love of God and have 
      one s fellow man go hand in hand. Life is one, just as God is one. The 
      freedom, dignity, and responsibility of every human being are rooted in 
      the very nature of the universe. Thus it is inevitable, if my own life is 
      to be fulfilled, that I love my neighbor as myself. This follows from 
      loving God &quot;with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy 
      might.&quot;</P>
      <P>Jews agree that we cannot know the final answers to the mysteries of 
      life and God. But Jews declare that in the goodness of lives lived 
      righteously, the goodness of God is known:</P>
      <P>- 0 Lord, how can we know Thee? Where can we find Thee? Thou art as 
      close to us as breathing and yet art farther than the farthermost star. 
      Thou art as mysterious as the vast solitudes of the night and yet art as 
      familiar to us as the light of the sun. To the seer of old Thou didst say: 
      Thou canst not see my face, but I will make all my goodness pass before 
      thee. Even so does Thy goodness pass before us in the realm of nature and 
      in the varied experiences of our lives. When justice burns like a flaming 
      fire within us, when love evokes willing sacrifice from us, when, to the 
      last full measure of selfless devotion, we proclaim our belief in the 
      ultimate triumph of truth and righteousness, do we not bow before the 
      vision of Thy goodness? Thou livest within our hearts, as Thou dost 
      pervade the world, and we through righteousness behold Thy presence.</P>
      <B>
      <P>14. FESTIVALS AND HOLY DAYS</P>
      </B>
      <P>The Jews<B> </B>have always treasured their traditions. Many of their 
      most <I>meaningful </I>religious and family customs center about their 
      festivals and holy days.</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE SABBATH </B>- At sunset on Friday evening, candles are lighted in 
      millions of Jewish homes all over the world. This is a sign to the 
      assembled family that the Sabbath has begun, bringing twenty-four hours of 
      worship and rest. When the fathers and older sons return from the service 
      at the synagogue, there are special family rites of blessing and prayer. 
      Then all sit down to the best and happiest meal of the week, frequently 
      sharing it with sonic visitor invited home after the synagogue service.</P>
      <P>The next morning the whole family attends a worship service in the 
      synagogue, the men and boys sitting in the assembly hail, and the women 
      and girls going to the women’s gallery. The service itself varies with the 
      congregation. Usually it includes the chanting of portions of the Torah 
      and the <I>Psalms </I>led by the cantor, a Jewish layman who is skilled at 
      this work. There are times for many prayers and readings from the <I>
      Torah. </I>There may also be a sermon given by the rabbi.</P>
      <P>Upon returning home, Jews rest in the manner, which pleases each, 
      although Orthodox Jews have many restrictions upon work, play, and travel. 
      In the afternoon, some men and boys return to the synagogue for a period 
      of reading and discussion. Orthodox Jews have planned for the day so 
      carefully that the cooking and cleaning have been accomplished before the 
      Sabbath. Conservative Jews do only necessary work, and Reform Jews observe 
      the day as one of rest and worship, with no particular limitations on 
      their activities. At nightfall, the family gathers again to note the end 
      of the Sabbath and the beginning of a new week.</P>
      <P>For countless years, the Sabbath has been the distinctive center of 
      Jewish home lire. This age-old custom or observing one day out of seven 
      for rest and formal worship was a great contribution that the Jews made to 
      the world. It has for long been shared by Christians and Moslems -- though 
      different days have been chosen for the purpose.</P>
      <P>In the beginning, the Jewish Sabbath was a new ideal to masses of 
      people who toiled long hour’s day after day, with no weekends or 
      vacations. Jews are asked to &quot;observe the Sabbath and keep it holy,&quot; for 
      everyone needs such rest and change. It is probable that this regular 
      weekly plan of alternation between rest and activity, between work and 
      worship, contributed greatly to the success of Jews in many fields.</P>
      <P>In the Ten Commandments, Jews are reminded of God’s example: &quot;... in 
      six days the Lord made the heavens, the earth, and the sea, together with 
      all that is in them, but rested on the seventh day: that is how the Lord 
      came to bless the seventh day and to hallow it.&quot; This adds the emphasis of 
      religion to the need for rest. Wise rabbis have taught that the Sabbath 
      must minister to man’s need as well as to God. For the Jews, human life 
      has always been of greater concern than an abstract rule.</P>
      <B>
      <P>ROSH HASHONAH: THE NEW YEAR</B> - In the seventh month of the Jewish 
      calendar, Jews are called to a long period of thought and penitence. The 
      beginning of the New Year is observed solemnly in the synagogues with the 
      blowing of a ram’s horn, called the Shofar. This sound opens a ten-day 
      season for Jews to take stock of their lives and seek forgiveness for 
      their shortcomings.</P>
      <P>Since the Jewish calendar is based on the cycle of the moon rather than 
      the sun, the exact date varies from year to year. <I>Rosh Hashonah </I>may 
      come early in September or early in October.</P>
      <P>To most Jews, the ten-day period is a time of judgment. An ancient 
      tradition states that during this period God determines who shall live and 
      who shall die; who shall be at rest and who shall wander; who shall be 
      tranquil and who shall be harassed; who shall become poor and who shall 
      wax rich; who shall be brought low and who shall be exalted. The old 
      traditions further say that Rosh Hashonab is the day on which God writes 
      in the great Book of Judgment the record of everyone’s life.</P>
      <P>The ten days that follow allow time for a person to think through his 
      life and what he can do about it. They allow him time and opportunity to 
      see his mistakes and try to correct them. They are solemn, holy days. 
      Traditional Jews believe that a person may even have his record in the 
      Book of Judgment changed, if he is sincere, kind, and penitent enough. 
      They believe that the Book of Judgment is closed again at the end of the 
      ten days.</P>
      <P>The climax of the new year observance is <I>Yoni </I>Kippur, the tenth 
      day of the new year. It begins at sundown (as do all Jewish holy days) and 
      continues for twenty-four hours. Traditionally, adult Jews neither eat nor 
      drink during this day. They spend their time in thought and prayer. There 
      is a solemn service in the synagogue, which every Jew tries to attend. It 
      opens with a haunting melody, the <I>Kol Nidre </I>chant. This is a plea 
      for release from religious vows that could not be kept -- a reference to 
      the persecutions, which Jews have suffered again and again at the hands of 
      non-Jews. The close of the Yom Kippur service is again the sound of the 
      ram’s horn. It signifies the closing of the Book of Judgment until the 
      following year.</P>
      <P>The ideas of the Book of Judgment and God as the Great Judge are found 
      in other religions too. And Jews, like others, may interpret the 
      traditions literally. Or they may interpret them in a profoundly personal 
      and spiritual sense. These &quot;Days of Awe,&quot; as they are sometimes called, 
      are days for a Jew to ask important questions about life and to continue 
      his spiritual growth. Judaism does not offer believers easy answers to 
      their religious questions. Instead, it encourages them to search their 
      hearts and lives for better ways of living.</P>
      <P>Jews are not taught that mankind is basically sinful or that normal 
      needs and interests are wrong. There are no monks or nuns in Judaism. 
      Instead, Jews emphasize the great beauty of family life. During the new 
      year observance, Jews are encouraged to think about their relationships 
      with other people. Have they acted with true love and justice? Have they 
      been humble, remembering their limitations? Are they in need of 
      forgiveness for sins committed against their fellow men?</P>
      <P>Acts of loving-kindness are the best means of making amends. As the 
      rabbis have said: &quot;Whoever has a sin to confess and is ashamed to do so, 
      let him go and do a good deed and he will find forgiveness.&quot;</P>
      <P>During the Yom Kippur service, some verses are read from the book of <I>
      Isaiah. </I>They point out to the worshiping Jew that the heart of 
      religion is loving concern for others:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Is not this the fast that I have chosen?<BR>
        To loose the bands of wickedness,<BR>
        To undo the heavy burdens,<BR>
        And to let the oppressed go free ...<BR>
        Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry,<BR>
        And that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house?<BR>
        When thou seest the naked, that thou cover him;<BR>
        And that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?<BR>
        Then shall thy light break forth as the morning<BR>
        And thy righteousness shall go before thee.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <B>
      <P>SUCCOS: THE FEAST OF TABERNACLES</B> - One of the most joyful Jewish 
      holy days is the celebration of <I>Succos, </I>which comes at the time of 
      harvest, when the vines are heavy with grapes and the grain stands ripe in 
      the fields. It is a festival of thanksgiving, lasting for nine days. It 
      reminds Jews of the time of the Exodus of the Jewish people from Egypt, 
      when they were forced to live in small shelters (called <I>succos) </I>
      along the way. Jews often make replicas of these shelters, which are also 
      called tabernacles. They decorate them with flowers, fruits and branches 
      as reminders of the generosity of God.</P>
      <P>Modern Jews think of the often-sorrowful history of their fellow 
      believers, as well as about other people. 0n the Sabbath during <I>Succos,
      </I>this prayer is recited:</P>
      <P>We recall today with grateful hearts Thy loving providence, which 
      guided our fathers in their wanderings through the barren desert and the 
      trackless wilderness.</P>
      <P>We thank Thee that the same unfailing mercies have guided and sheltered 
      us, their children, in all the years of our pilgrimage... We pray Thee 
      that the enjoyment of Thy blessings may awaken within us a spirit of 
      contentment and fortitude that we may neither grow proud through success 
      nor become embittered by failure.</P>
      <P>May we sympathize with those whose hopes have been disappointed and 
      whose labors have been unfruitful. May our hands be outstretched to those 
      who suffer, and our hearts be open to those who are in need. Praised be 
      Thou, 0 Lord, Giver of all good. Amen.</P>
      <P>On the ninth day of the <I>Succos </I>celebration, there is a joyful 
      ceremony in the synagogue, when the scrolls of the Torah are carried about 
      in a gay procession. Sometimes there are dances and songs in which all 
      join. This is one more way in which Jews show their love for the Torah. On 
      this day, the last verses of the Torah (Deuteronomy 34) are read. Then the 
      rabbi turns back to the first verse of <I>Genesis: </I>&quot;In the beginning, 
      God ...&quot;This begins the annual reading of the whole <I>Torah </I>in each 
      synagogue.</P>
      <B>
      <P>HANUKKAH: FEAST OF DEDICATION</B> - The celebration of Hanukkah is a 
      feast of dedication that usually comes in December. Jews observe it for 
      eight days, during which there are special services in the synagogues, 
      special holiday foods, and gifts. Hanukkah recalls to modern Jews a 
      significant event in the past, when their ancestors fought for religious 
      freedom.</P>
      <P>In the second century B.C., the Syrians had gained control of 
      Palestine, and they were trying to force the Jews to discontinue their 
      religion. Some of the Jews did as they were commanded. Others refused, 
      despite Syrian reprisals. An elderly priest, Mattathias, began a revolt. 
      Later his son, Judah Maccabee, carried the revolt much farther and won 
      final victory over the Syrian army. In celebration of their regained 
      freedom, the Jews went to Jerusalem to cleanse the temple and renew Jewish 
      worship there. They found a single unopened container of the oil used in 
      their services. According to tradition it burned before the altar for 
      eight days.</P>
      <P>Now Jews burn eight candles during <I>Hanukkah, </I>often lighting one 
      the first evening, two the second, and so on. They often call Hanukkah the 
      Festival of Lights. Hanukkah is a time of great rejoicing and a time of 
      solemn reminder of how precious liberty is. Jews especially are thankful 
      at this time for the freedom to worship according to their own 
      consciences. The struggle for freedom of thought and worship is never 
      finished completely. It is an ongoing task. Jews recognize this as they 
      pray a special Sabbath prayer during <I>Hanukkah:</P>
      </I>
      <P>Bless, O God, the Chanukah (Hanukkah) lights, that they may shed their 
      radiance into our homes and our lives. May they kindle within us the flame 
      of faith and zeal that, like the Maccabecs of old, we battle bravely for 
      Thy cause. Make us ever worthy of Thy love and Thy blessing, our Shield 
      and Protector. Amen.</P>
      <B>
      <P>PURISM - </B>In the early spring -- usually in March -- Jews celebrate 
      a particularly joyful holy day. In the synagogues, the people assemble to 
      hear the reading of the <I>Megillah, </I>the <I>Book of Esther. </I>In 
      contrast to their usually serious attention in services, the Jews on this 
      day distribute noisemakers among the children, for use at certain places 
      in the reading. Later the children may dramatize the ancient story. 
      Friends and relatives often exchange gifts, and many Jews enjoy a special 
      cookie, called a Haman tart.</P>
      <P>The story that they hear in the synagogue concerns a beautiful Jewish 
      woman of long ago, Esther. the wife of the king of Persia. Esther’s uncle, 
      Mordecai happened to arouse the hatred of a high court official named 
      Haman. For revenge, Haman began a plan to exterminate all the Jews, 
      accusing them unjustly of disloyalty to the king. When Esther learned of 
      the plan, she risked death to expose Haman’s schemes, revealing her own 
      Jewish ness to the king. As a result, the king honored Mordecai -- and 
      Haman died on the gallows that he himself had prepared for Mordecai.</P>
      <P>Jews enjoy hearing the annual reading of the story. They enjoy the 
      carnival atmosphere that pervades the synagogue on this night, with the 
      children vigorously using the noisemakers whenever Haman’s name is 
      mentioned. They do not concern themselves very much with whether or not 
      the story is true as it is read. Many Jewish scholars claim that it is 
      simply an historical novel.</P>
      <P>However, the meaning of the story is real and true. It is a tale of 
      hatred directed at Jews simply because of their Jewishness. Haman’s chief 
      charge against the Jews was that their ways were &quot;different.’ This charge 
      and others like it have been hurled against the Jews countless times in 
      the past. It is no wonder that they have made an annual celebration of 
      this story of the downfall of one anti-Jewish oppressor.</P>
      <P>Jews celebrate <I>Purim </I>not only for this reason, but also in 
      recognition of common brotherhood. Many rabbis say that the basic idea to 
      this day is that differences among men do not need to cause dissension. 
      Deeper than all differences is our humanity. In the story, the king’s 
      acceptance of the people whose ways were different shows that he saw the 
      shared humanity under the outward diversity.</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE PASSOVER</B> - The Jews, like all people, have a celebration in the 
      springtime. Long ago, people celebrated the renewed fertility of the 
      earth, the newborn animals among their flocks, and the new growth of plant 
      life. For many hundreds of years, Jews have held a spring festival to 
      commemorate the legendary events described in the first chapters of the 
      book of <I>Exodus.</P>
      </I>
      <P>For many years the Jews had been held in what amounted to slavery in 
      Egypt. Moses became their spokesman, and he sought their release from the 
      Egyptian Pharaoh. But this ruler became quite stubborn, according to the 
      legends, despite the several plagues that God had sent against the 
      Egyptians. So God sent an angel of death to kill all the first-born in the 
      land of Egypt, both of men and flocks. The Israelites, however, were 
      spared. They had marked their houses with the blood of a lamb. So the 
      angel of death &quot;passed over&quot; them. The Pharaoh relented, and the 
      Israelites left in great haste. They did not even have time to leaven 
      their bread. It had to be baked unleavened.</P>
      <P>During the celebration of the Passover, all leaven is removed from the 
      traditional Jewish home for eight days. The Jews eat matzos, an unleavened 
      bread, to remind them of the sufferings of their ancestors. Sometimes they 
      call the <I>Passover </I>the &quot;Feast of Unleavened Bread.&quot; The special 
      bread, certain bitter herbs, and other symbolic foods help them to 
      celebrate the delivery of the Jewish people from bondage.</P>
      <P>Many Jews have never taken the story of the plagues and miracles in the 
      book of Exodus as being literally and historically true. This is a matter 
      for personal or critical interpretation of the texts of their scriptures. 
      Some of the rabbis have taught that the &quot;plague of darkness,&quot; for example, 
      was simply another name for superstition and spiritual blindness. 
      Therefore, some Jews celebrate the Passover not only as freedom from an 
      oppressive tyrant but also as freedom from bondage to evil habits or 
      intentions.</P>
      <P>Jewish holidays do not celebrate simply and solely things that are 
      supposed to have happened in the past. The holidays always have a 
      significant meaning for the present. This is because Jewish customs are 
      inwardly experienced by Jews -- not garments put on for occasions. Just 
      so, on the <I>Passover, </I>while Jews think about the bondage of long 
      ago, they also pray for enslaved people of today:</P>
      <P>God of freedom, Thy children still groan under the burden of cruel 
      taskmasters. Slavery debases their bodies and minds, and robs them of the 
      enjoyment of Thy bounties. The fear of cruelty and the peril of death 
      blight the souls of men. O break Thou the irons that bind them. Teach men 
      to understand that by forging chains for others they forge chains for 
      themselves, that as long as some are in fetters no one is truly free. Help 
      them to see that liberty is the very breath of life and that only in the 
      atmosphere of freedom can truth, prosperity and peace flourish.</P>
      <B>
      <P>SHAVUOS</B> - Ancient Jews celebrated this festival at the time of the 
      barley harvest in Palestine. Later, Jews held the festival of Shavuos to 
      commemorate God’s giving the <I>Torah </I>to Moses. Their keeping of this 
      festival stresses their underlying religious faith that the universe has 
      law, order, and purpose.</P>
      <P>In synagogue services, the Book of Ruth is read to the congregation. In 
      Reform and Conservative synagogues, this occasion includes the 
      confirmation of children. Children who have completed a course of study 
      under the rabbi’s instruction declare before the congregation their 
      loyalty to God and their intention of living by his laws.</P>
      <P>In these ways the Jews face life’s demands and mysteries, firm in their 
      belief in God and proud of their traditions. For thousands of years, no 
      matter what they have faced, Jews have gained assurance from the Law of 
      the Lord. They have gained strength from their simple declaration:</P>
      <P>&quot;The Lord is One.&quot;</P>
