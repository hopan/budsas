      <P>15. JESUS AND THE KINGDOM OF GOD </P>
      </B>
      <P>The place of Jesus in history is not solely that of an individual of 
      two thousand years ago. Jesus is a religious symbol. The facts of his life 
      have been embroidered with the hopes and dreams of generations of 
      Christians. For these reasons it is almost impossible to get a true 
      historical picture of the man who unintentionally became the founder of 
      the Christian religion, and even -- to many Christians -- God himself.</P>
      <P>We should approach the study of Jesus in the same way that we approach 
      the study of other religious prophets and leaders. We need respect, 
      frankness, and an open mind. It is well to remember that the tendency to 
      glorify or even deify a great religious leader has characterized the 
      growth of most religions. The history of Christian attitudes illustrates 
      this -- as do the histories of Taoism and Buddhism. Intent on exalting the 
      divine role that the Church has given to Jesus, many have missed finding 
      the wisdom of his teachings. They have worshiped him -- but failed to 
      follow him. Yet the Jesus whom some at least can see behind all the 
      adoration sought not to make men accept himself, but to accept his <I>way 
      of life. </I>And what was this way?</P>
      <B>
      <P>STORIES OF JESUS</P>
      </B>
      <P>We have no written records from the time when Jesus lived. The oldest 
      stories about him that we can find are included in the Christian New 
      Testament. The Gospel <I>According </I>to <I>Mark </I>is usually 
      considered to be the earliest of these. Yet it was written over forty 
      years after the death of Jesus. It is interesting to notice that it is the 
      simplest of the Gospels. Years later, other Gospels were written -- <I>
      Matthew, Luke, </I>and <I>John. </I>Each of them was written for a 
      purpose: to present Jesus and his work in a way that would appeal to a new 
      group of people.</P>
      <P>Some parts of these Gospels are similar, but there are a good many 
      differences. For example, the Gospel writers do not agree on the baptism 
      of Jesus or the religious experience that led to his baptism and to his 
      teaching. They do not agree as to the existence of signs from God to prove 
      to everyone that Jesus was his unique son.</P>
      <P>The writers disagree -- and so do Christian scholars today -- on Jesus’ 
      belief about the Kingdom of God. Some say that Jesus, like many of the 
      Jews in the Palestine of his day, expected it to come in dramatic, 
      world-shaking fashion. Others say that he thought of it solely as an inner 
      Kingdom, which would emerge slowly in the hearts of people. There are <I>
      New Testament </I>passages that support each interpretation. There are 
      passages that declare Jesus’ expectation of an important role in the 
      Kingdom, as a representative of God. And there are other passages that 
      present him more as a humble teacher like Amos, Hosea, or the other 
      prophets.</P>
      <P>Because of such interesting differences in interpretation of details, 
      scholars recognize that we can never know Jesus as be really was. We can 
      know him only as he was remembered by the children and grandchildren of 
      those who first heard and knew him. The historian knows that this is a 
      problem common to all religions, but Christians have made more attempts to 
      &quot;prove’ things by appealing to their scriptures than many other people 
      have. Such &quot;proof&quot; has not been of great concern to Buddhists and Hindus, 
      for example. They believe that truth is timeless. It is as available to 
      each person through his own experience as it is to important religious 
      leaders.</P>
      <P>Thus we should know at the beginning that there is little we can prove 
      about the way that Jesus lived and taught. Where honest scholars disagree, 
      it is important that we read the records for ourselves. In that way we may 
      become aware of the difficult problems involved in choosing any 
      interpretation. Each of us must remember that without real effort he will 
      find in the records only what he wishes to discover there. Too often what 
      we find tells more about our own personalities than it does about the 
      truth we seek.</P>
      <P>The story of Jesus is not ended with his death. It stretches into the 
      centuries of Christianity. Jesus committed himself to the will of God, as 
      he understood it, and to the urgent requirements of the Kingdom of God. 
      This commitment and the drama of his life have made Jesus a directing 
      factor in the lives of Christians. More than nineteen centuries have 
      passed since he spoke to disciples and followers. Let us strip back the 
      layers of years to discover, as best we can, how he taught and lived.</P>
      <B>
      <P>JOHN THE BAPTIZER</P>
      </B>
      <P>On an ordinary day in Palestine in about the year 26 AD<B>, </B>a man 
      called John the Baptizer was teaching close by the banks of the River 
      Jordan. His fame as a fiery, stern teacher had already spread about the 
      countryside. And on this day there were many people who had walked long 
      distances to hear him. Once there, they sat on the hard stones in the 
      parching heat.</P>
      <P>They were so held by the speaker that they did not notice the 
      discomforts of this arid section of Judea. John spoke to them urgently and 
      sternly. He preached of a new kind of life that they must live -- a life 
      marked by repentance for their past wrongdoings. They must repent now, for 
      the Kingdom of God was about to come, bringing with it peace and 
      satisfaction for the righteous, but dreadful suffering for sinners. The 
      comforts of life, offerings in the Temple, rituals and ceremonies of 
      worship -- these did not matter. What did matter was a radical change of 
      life, with one’s whole being cleansed and righted by repentance.</P>
      <P>Among those who listened most attentively to John’s insistent words 
      that afternoon was a young man named Jesus. Jesus had come all the way 
      from Nazareth to hear this new teacher, who lived as a hermit in the 
      wilderness but drew crowds even there through the force of his message. 
      Jesus was strangely stirred by the words he heard, by their boldness, 
      their sincerity, and their power. He watched as others accepted John’s 
      invitation to go down into the River Jordan to be baptized as a sign of 
      their repentance and their promises to live new lives. After a time of 
      listening, Jesus too went down to be baptized by John.</P>
      <B>
      <P>A NEW DECISION </P>
      </B>
      <P>Jesus was profoundly moved by this experience. He seemed to feel that 
      God took notice of his action and was pleased with it. Not long after 
      this, Jesus went away into the wilderness by himself to think through what 
      his life should be thereafter. In the time of his solitary thought, Jesus 
      became convinced that God wanted him to live his life in a special way, 
      teaching others and helping them.</P>
      <P>Yet Jesus felt that he did not want to be the same kind of teacher as 
      John, living away from people in the rough and lonely wilds. Instead, 
      Jesus would carry his message to the people in the towns and cities, as 
      well as those in the countryside. He was filled with a great desire to 
      teach those who faced the everyday problems of life and religion -- not 
      just those who were able to leave homes and daily comforts, as John’s 
      followers had. He went home to tell his family and friends what he had 
      decided to do.</P>
      <P>It was not easy to carry out his decision. Most people among his family 
      and friends could not understand or appreciate his intentions. To some of 
      them, Jesus had always seemed to be very serious, but they had never 
      expected to see him depart so radically from the usual kind of life. His 
      mother, his brothers, and his sisters had come to depend upon him for 
      their livelihood, since the death of his father, Joseph. How could they 
      get along without him?</P>
      <P>He had to face the objections and perhaps the ridicule of the people of 
      his village. Some of them would have approved of his leaving had he been 
      going to join one of the many anti-Roman underground movements. But how 
      was he going to help his people overcome their conquerors merely by 
      becoming a wandering preacher? Possibly, also, Jesus had to face lingering 
      doubts about whether he could actually live in the way he planned. There 
      would be no home, no income, and no friends upon whom he could depend. All 
      that he ever ate or wore would have to be provided by those who listened 
      to what he told them. Would what he taught them be worth what they gave?</P>
      <P>Despite all arguments, he went ahead. He had expected such 
      difficulties. What strength he needed to carry out his plans came from the 
      inspiration that had led to them. Alone and lacking the approval of 
      relatives and friends, he set off for Capernaum, to begin there the 
      ministry that led to his death and to the birth of the Christian religion.</P>
      <B>
      <P>GOD AND HIS KINGDOM </P>
      </B>
      <P>Jesus’ decision, like most such decisions, had deep roots. As a child, 
      Jesus had learned the Jewish history and scriptures from his father and 
      from synagogue leaders. He knew well the ever-present Jewish hope for a 
      brighter, better fu<I>ture, </I>when God would help the Jews to regain 
      their freedom and prestige among the nations. <I>This </I>hope flamed high 
      in their hearts as they lived under Roman conquerors.</P>
      <P>For some time Jesus had thought carefully about this national hope, and 
      he now knew that he could not fully agree with those who held it. Many of 
      the Jews had gotten into a hopeless feeling that what they as individuals 
      did were not important. They believed that sometime God was going to cause 
      a miracle, bringing into being a new age, when Palestine would be 
      powerful, independent, and respected among the nations. There would be no 
      occupying armies or foreign governors. The Jewish people would live in the 
      same prosperous way they had lived under King David of long ago. To 
      inaugurate this new age, God’s anointed one, the Messiah, would overcome 
      their enemies. Then he would rule in the Kingdom of God, for which 
      generations of Jews had hoped.</P>
      <P>This could not be the way in which God would bring a thing to pass, 
      Jesus had decided. God did not send his blessings to some and withhold 
      them from others. God’s blessings came to a person in the quiet, 
      transforming knowledge that his life was the best he could live. The 
      Kingdom of God was not a condition that waited in some undisclosed future. 
      No, the Kingdom of God was a present possibility of goodness that was 
      hidden, like a seed, inside every person. You have only to let it grow 
      naturally, aiding its development by loving attitudes and kind deeds. And 
      behold, it grows gradually until you yourself are part of the Kingdom of 
      God.</P>
      <P>Jesus’ ideas about the Kingdom stemmed very naturally from his beliefs 
      about God. Jesus had had the kind of religious training that all loyal 
      Jews tried to give their children. He had heard the stories of the 
      prophets. He knew many of the Psalms, which described God’s love and 
      mercy. Most important of all, Jesus had taken the time to develop a close 
      personal relationship with his God. Prayer and meditation had led him to 
      feel at home with God. Later, Jesus was to tell many parables describing 
      God as like a father, forgiving, concerned, and loving. Throughout his 
      life, he was to turn to God as to a guide, a source of strength and 
      inspiration, ever available to the call of meditation and prayer.</P>
      <P>Often Jesus was to refer to the will of God when he taught and 
      comforted his hearers. God expected something of men, to be sure. He 
      expected them to behave toward each other with loving concern, 
      forgiveness, and patience, just as he dealt with them. This was the 
      righteousness God’s Kingdom required, not a righteousness bound up with 
      many rules and practices. This righteousness went much deeper -- as deep 
      as the thoughts and intentions and desires. From these roots it flowed out 
      into righteous speech, righteous acts, and righteous efforts.</P>
      <B>
      <P>JESUS AND HIS TEACHINGS </P>
      </B>
      <P>In Capernaum and in most of the towns to which he later went, Jesus was 
      well received by the common people. He came to them with a special message 
      of hope. Many of them could not afford the special sacrifices that had to 
      be taken annually to the temple at Jerusalem. The priests had told them 
      that such sacrifices must be offered if they wished to be in God’s favor. 
      What were they to do? Jesus said that the offerings of a contrite heart 
      and a pure life were far more important to God than offerings of first 
      fruits or year-old kids.</P>
      <P>Some of the people who listened gladly to Jesus were those who felt 
      extremely guilty for rules they had not kept. There were countless Jewish 
      laws telling them what to eat and how it should be served and prescribing 
      the observance of many small religious customs. The poor people who spent 
      all their time eking out their meager existence had no opportunity and 
      often no information about such rules. Many of the Jewish priests and 
      teachers condemned them as sinners. Jesus told the people that they should 
      not be so concerned with the outward performance of the laws that they 
      forgot the spirit of the laws. The laws and the prophets of his people’s 
      religion had emphasized two things: love of God and love of neighbor.</P>
      <P>Some people had become ill because they were so filled with feelings of 
      sinfulness or so upset by their constant failure to do all that their 
      religion required. To people like these, Jesus’ message was like medicine. 
      They were sick at heart, and that had made some of them ill. His words and 
      his understanding made them feel better, and their health returned. 
      Through such situations, Jesus gained a reputation as a healer. Many 
      people were attracted to him for this reason. Sometimes he became 
      discouraged that there were so many people who wanted to be healed, but so 
      few who wanted to join him in living by the will of God.</P>
      <P>Not all of the people liked what they heard. There were many Jews who 
      felt that a man could not possibly live a good life unless he fulfilled 
      each Jewish law in the most exacting detail. They did not like to hear 
      anyone say that laws were not important. Some of the religious leaders 
      became very angry as Jesus’ reputation as a healer increased. They thought 
      that sinful people deserved to suffer. <I>What </I>right did Jesus have to 
      make them feel that they had been forgiven? God alone knew whether they 
      were forgiven.</P>
      <P>Other Jews were troubled because Jesus seemed to be too peaceful and 
      too loving. He did not even hate their enemies, the occupying Roman 
      soldiers. They knew the history of their race, with all its humiliating 
      defeats and invasions. This Roman occupation was only one of a long chain 
      of occupations by conquerors. Some of Jesus’ followers had hoped that he 
      might prove himself to be the forceful Messiah, who was to come to help 
      them attain a position of power and prosperity once again. When he 
      continued to teach love and patience, some of them gave up in disgust. 
      Some kept on following, still hoping that he would be such a Messiah in 
      the end.</P>
      <P>A good many followers could not understand what it was that Jesus was 
      saying when he described his ideas of the Kingdom of God. He emphasized 
      again and again that people did not have to wait until conditions were 
      ideal in order to live in the right way. A man is what he is inside 
      himself.</P>
      <P>This quality of the inner life is not determined by occupying armies, 
      by exact following of laws, or by large offerings at the Temple. The 
      thought you have before you speak is more important than what you say. The 
      attitude you have underneath your act is more important than what you do.</P>
      <P>Jesus told beautiful stories to make the Kingdom seem real to his 
      listeners. The Kingdom of God is like a mustard seed, smallest of all the 
      seeds. But when it is grown, the mustard plant is very large. Just so, the 
      Kingdom within is at first so tiny that one may not even be aware of it. 
      But when it is fully developed, it overshadows everything else in a 
      person’s life. The Kingdom of God is like a treasure hidden in a field. 
      When a man discovered it, he rushed out and sold everything he had in 
      order to buy that field. In the same way, when a man discovers the 
      inestimable value of the Kingdom, he gives up everything for it.</P>
      <P>To Jesus, the Kingdom of God was the ultimate goal of all human effort. 
      There was really nothing else worth seeking. Men were designed to live in 
      such a Kingdom. It did not depend upon a certain time or a certain place. 
      The Kingdom of God required only righteous people as its citizens, only 
      mercy, kindness, and love as its laws. Wherever there were righteous 
      people using mercy, kindness ness, and love as their way of life, there 
      was the Kingdom of God.</P>
      <P>When Jesus spoke of the Kingdom of God, he was filled with a sense of 
      urgency. People must not fold their hands and wait for God to bring in the 
      Kingdom. The time was now. People must discover their capacity for 
      goodness and begin to live in the right way. Jesus told people that this 
      required repentance. They must leave their old ways of living behind and 
      henceforth choose and live righteously, by the will of God. Then the 
      Kingdom of God would come. God was ready. Men must be, too.</P>
      <P>Since he felt so strongly that every person must meet the conditions of 
      the Kingdom, Jesus took his message to many so-called sinful people. Those 
      who criticized him found it easy to point to occasions when he had talked 
      with the hated tax collectors or visited with persons of questionable 
      reputation. How could a man be a good religious teacher if he kept such 
      poor company? Jesus answered, &quot;I came not to call the righteous, but 
      sinners to repentance.&quot;</P>
      <P>Over and over Jesus repeated that God did not blame sinners half so 
      much as some people did. God is ready with forgiveness the moment a person 
      sincerely asks for it. God is like a father who sees his son leave home, 
      bent upon wasting his money and his time in a foolish search for pleasure. 
      The moment the son returns, sadder and wiser, and determined to live 
      rightly, the father welcomes him eagerly, forgetting his blame for the joy 
      of having him again. Even so, the Father in Heaven welcomes those who are 
      so sorry for past foolishness that they are sincerely ready to try to live 
      by His will.</P>
      <P>At the end of a year or so of teaching, Jesus had collected a number of 
      followers. Twelve of them, later known as the disciples, had been so 
      impressed with their master’s message that they, too, had given up homes 
      and families and occupations. Like Jesus, they felt that the demands of 
      the Kingdom blotted out all lesser considerations. Everything else was 
      secondary to life’s spiritual search.</P>
      <P>Jesus became increasingly aware that his activities were meeting with 
      disapproval from many sources. The officials of the Jewish religion, who 
      had never been enthusiastic about his mission, became more hostile. The 
      Romans, who wished mainly for peace and order, suspected any radical 
      movement of having revolutionary plans. They began to fear Jesus’ talk of 
      the coming Kingdom, even though to Jesus it was completely spiritual.</P>
      <P>For a long time, there had been warnings that the way of life he had 
      chosen might lead to his death. There would have been time to change his 
      teachings so that he would not incur the wrath of the powerful priests. 
      There would have been time to reassure the Romans by speaking less 
      emphatically of the Kingdom of God. Such compromises were impossible for 
      Jesus, in the light of his central concern with the will of God. He might 
      have stayed away from Jerusalem, but this was the center of Judaism. He 
      felt he had a message to give and a part to take in the Passover 
      celebration. He had always joined in the religious feasts of his people. 
      So, at the height of the holiday excitement, Jesus and his disciples 
      entered Jerusalem.</P>
      <B>
      <P>HIS MINISTRY ENDS</P>
      </B>
      <P>During this visit, Jesus was put to death on the cross, at the hands of 
      the Romans. Probably some of the priests or some of the zealous Jewish 
      patriots had helped to convince them that this man was a rabble-rouser who 
      worked against the welfare of the state. Some of the patriots were 
      disappointed that Jesus still refused to lead revolt against Rome. The 
      priests could feel more secure in their positions after he was gone. There 
      were no masses of people to cry out in Jesus’ behalf. The large numbers of 
      followers had left him before that, discouraged with the fruitless waiting 
      for him to declare himself to be the Messiah. It seemed to some of his 
      disciples that the whole religious adventure had begun to demand too much. 
      They abandoned Jesus in fear for their own safety.</P>
      <P>Jesus must have had many moments of discouragement in his last days. He 
      had seen people who wished him to do things his convictions would not let 
      him do. He had seen his disciples acting in ways that showed they still 
      did not fully understand what he had tried so long to teach them about the 
      will of God. He had known for some time that he might be killed. Was his 
      death to come before he accomplished all he had set out to do? Was he to 
      leave his people still unprepared to be the avenues through which God 
      would work to bring in the Kingdom? How hard it must have been to see his 
      efforts ended before he had reached his goals.</P>
      <B>
      <P>CHRISTIANITY BEGINS </P>
      </B>
      <P>But the end had come. The bewildered disciples went into hiding. Later, 
      when they felt safe, they met together and talked in hushed tones of the 
      tragic thing that had happened. Their sorrow led them into deeper 
      fellowship, and they recalled together the experiences they had shared 
      with Jesus. From this early fellowship, Christianity began.</P>
      <P>In many ways, Christianity differs greatly from the simple religion of 
      Jesus. But for the chief ideas of its faith, it looks back to the humble, 
      dedicated young man from Galilee, who said that a man must commit himself 
      wholly to God, and then to his neighbor. Jesus’ death, as a consequence of 
      his beliefs, was the next logical step in his own life of consecration to 
      the task of bringing the Kingdom of God on earth.</P>

      <P>It is easy<B> </B>to understand the bewilderment and fear of those 
      early followers of Jesus who witnessed his arrest and his crucifixion. He 
      was killed as a criminal, and they, having shared in his work, feared that 
      they must surely share in his punishment. With great haste they hid, and 
      for a time the movement seemed no longer to exist.</P>
      <P>When the danger had passed and the disciples of Jesus had begun to see 
      each other again, they recalled the joys and sorrows of their days spent 
      with the Master. Together they looked for comfort for their grief in 
      telling and retelling stories of Jesus. So constantly did they live with 
      his memory that Jesus seemed still with them. Some began to believe that 
      he was not dead. True, he had died upon the cross and had been buried. But 
      now he lived again. He had left them only briefly, to prepare for ushering 
      in the new age, the Kingdom of God.</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE FIRST CHRISTIANS</P>
      </B>
      <P>These convictions came easily to the first-century Christians. They 
      were men of their time, whose ignorance often held them to superstitious 
      beliefs. Sometimes they believed literally in their dreams and visions. 
      They believed in demons and angels. They believed that dead bodies could 
      sometimes come out of graves. Now they believed that Jesus would return.</P>
      <P>To nourish their hope, they recalled statements they thought Jesus had 
      made. Had he not announced that the Kingdom was coming almost immediately? 
      Had he not called them from their ordinary lives to work with him for its 
      coming? Had he not promised that they could share in it? Surely it was so. 
      He would come again, and the Kingdom of God would come with him. He was, 
      after all, the Messiah!</P>
      <P>A fire with the urgency of their message, the disciples rushed to tell 
      others. Jesus would be back soon to bring in the Kingdom of God. This 
      would happen within their generation! Numbers of Jews heard and heeded the 
      warning to prepare themselves. Later, when year after year passed and 
      nothing happened, the urgency of the message began to be spent.</P>
      <B>
      <P>CHIRISTIANITY LEAVES JUDAISM </P>
      </B>
      <P>Jesus’ teachings were never to become a part of his native Jewish 
      religion. Jesus had directed his message to those who had not found 
      comfort in strict Judaism. Many followers were drawn from the fringes of 
      Jewish life, both in religion and in politics. Strengthened by the 
      influence of Jesus, these people moved farther than ever from the more 
      orthodox Jesus. Even so, it was a long time before the Jewish-Christians 
      would admit Gentiles (non-Jews) into their fellowship.</P>
      <P>The disciple Peter was among those who insisted upon keeping the 
      movement exclusively Jewish. But later, when Paul became a Christian, he 
      persuaded Peter and others to admit Gentiles into the group. After that, 
      it was not long before non-Jews outnumbered Jews in the Christian 
      movement.</P>
      <B>
      <P>JESUS AS THE CHRIST OF CHRISTIANITY</P>
      </B>
      <P>Of all the people associated with the beginnings of Christianity, Paul 
      was most responsible for the turn its beliefs took. He added a new note 
      that determined its future course. The new idea came from the popular 
      &quot;mystery cult&quot; religions that abounded in the Mediterranean lands. The 
      &quot;mystery&quot; applied to a mystical, symbolic union with a god who lived in 
      human form, died, but came to life again. Through a secret ceremony that 
      symbolically united him with his god, the believer was assured that he 
      could change his human nature to divine nature and thus gain a happy 
      afterlife. There were a number of mystery cults, with different gods. But 
      all of them emphasized the salvation resulting from dedication to a 
      dying-rising Lord.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that the word <I>Kyrios </I>(Lord), which the Greeks 
      applied to the dying-rising god, was used by Paul to apply to Jesus. It 
      was natural that those who heard Jesus called Kyrios should interpret him 
      in a mystery-cult sense. For many converts to Christianity, Jesus was from 
      the first a savior-god in a human body.</P>
      <P>One of the greatest debates in Christian history was about whether 
      Jesus was a god, like God, or the God. After a great deal of angry 
      oratory, it was finally decided that Jesus was &quot;very God of very God.&quot; 
      This debate was only one of many theological wrangles, most of which would 
      not have developed had Jesus lived lone enough to help organize a new and 
      growing religion. As <B>it </B>was, Jesus probably would not have been 
      interested anyway. Life, to him, was not something to be argued and 
      debated. Neither was religion. A man must live religion, not debate it.</P>
      <P>Christians have said that Jesus is a personal savior. Usually, they 
      call him the Christ, which means Deliverer or Messiah. They say that Jesus 
      Christ is the Son of God. Most Christians have believed that he shares in 
      God’s divinity, that he is God himself. He lived and died as a man and for 
      men. But he arose from the grave and ascended into heaven to &quot;sit at the 
      right hand of God,&quot; as one famous creed declares.</P>
      <P>These definitions developed from the mystery-cult ideas, which are so 
      ancient that most modern Christians do not know of their origin or the 
      reasons for their existence. The ideas have lived long beyond their 
      sources, because they have been included in the creeds of the orthodox 
      Christian churches. There is an old Christian story, which tells about the 
      ancient ideas. It is called by many the &quot;story of salvation.&quot; It describes 
      men as having been steeped in sinfulness, from the time of the very first 
      people. Men were so filled with wickedness that they no longer knew about 
      goodness. Only God could do anything to redeem them from the situation. So 
      God chose the Hebrew-Jewish people to teach men to rise above their 
      continuing sinfulness.</P>
      <P>The Jews did not play their proper part in the plan. So God sent Jesus 
      Christ, his only Son, to bring men back into harmony with himself. Through 
      his life, death, resurrection, and subsequent ascension into Heaven, Jesus 
      did everything that was needed. Through this one divine sacrifice, men 
      could obtain cancellation or forgiveness for their vast sins against God.</P>
      <P>Practically all Christians accept the central items in the great 
      dramatic tale as being true, although some do not look upon the words as 
      telling what actually happened. Some feel that it is a way of picturing 
      something that is true. They have said that the story means that people 
      were originally intended to be complete and in right relationship to God.</P>
      <P>However, person after person, in generation after generation, made 
      improper choices. They lost the right relationship, and thus they lost the 
      ability to live perfectly. Each person must go through the difficult but 
      rewarding process of finding it again. At the same time that a man is 
      honestly trying, God is interested in his welfare. God has made it 
      possible for a man to find himself again.</P>
      <P>By far the majority of Christians have said that Jesus was an essential 
      part of God’s way of making salvation possible. This has led Christians to 
      pray to the Christ and to worship him, just as they worship God. In Jesus 
      Christ, many Christians have found all the god they know.</P>
      <P>All Christians claim that their beliefs stem from something that Jesus 
      said or did, even though Christians of all sects believe many things of 
      which Jesus himself never heard or spoke. Throughout the development of 
      Christianity, Christians have faced the same universal questions of the 
      nature of man and the nature of God. Most Christians have found answers to 
      these questions that differ greatly from Jesus’ own answers. Answers 
      depend upon personal experience. So Christian answers have varied with 
      times and places. But the questions about which people have wondered, in 
      Jesus’ day and in our own, are very similar, because men are basically 
      alike.</P>
      <B>
      <P>WHAT AM I? </P>
      </B>
      <P>Christians generally would say that a man is more than what he appears 
      to be. That which is visible, the body, actually is the house of an 
      invisible self. Traditionally, Christians have called this inner self the 
      &quot;soul.&quot; A human body is a temporary thing, which finally dies. Its 
      elements blend once more with the elements of the earth. But a human soul 
      is eternal, surviving the death of the body, say most Christians.</P>
      <P>The human soul is akin to God in this sense. God is the eternal spirit, 
      existing from before creation. Human souls are created by God, and once 
      created, they also are eternal. Christians believe that each soul is 
      individual, having been united with an individual body since before the 
      person’s birth. Through the union of soul and body, a person is brought 
      into being.</P>
      <P>Christians have tried to describe the soul in various ways. Some have 
      thought it might be connected with the intelligence, or with the life 
      force, or with something else. But Christians as a whole have never been 
      able to agree on another word for it. They say &quot;soul,&quot; and they mean that 
      it is &quot;that eternal something&quot; which is not some <I>thing. </I>It is not 
      affected by death or other destructive forces. It is that which underlies 
      a man’s whole conscious life. It cannot be seen. It occupies no space. It 
      is timeless and changeless. Its existence cannot be proved. It is taken 
      &quot;on faith.&quot;</P>
      <B>
      <P>WHAT IS GOD?</P>
      </B>
      <P>A newborn baby does not know himself to be a person. He must gradually 
      experience the fact that he is someone different from his mother, and then 
      from all those other people he comes to know. He must learn to be 
      conscious of himself. Then he becomes conscious of more and more people 
      with whom he comes into contact.</P>
      <P>As he grows and matures in his relationships with himself and with 
      others, he becomes ready for larger experiences. The orderly and 
      changeless laws of nature, which he has observed since childhood; the 
      hopes and needs he shares with his fellows; the dependable cycle of growth 
      and decay, in which he sees all things and beings participate -- these are 
      gradually making him conscious of something beyond himself and those like 
      himself. There seems to be a meaning and a plan to life. What is it? What 
      is back of it all?</P>
      <P>Such questions have been among the most universal of human wonderings. 
      They have led most people to suggest that something or someone they call 
      God is back of it all. Christians have offered many descriptions of God, 
      even though they admit that God is beyond human understanding and 
      description. He is unlimited in power, in wisdom, <I>in </I>mercy, and in 
      love. He is boundless, invisible, and gracious. He is Judge, Lord, Father.</P>
      <P>What these descriptions mean to a person depends entirely on his own 
      experience. Any one of the terms cannot be equally valuable to all. Such 
      descriptions have been like sign posts or pointers along the way. But they 
      have not been as final as some theologians have claimed. It is helpful to 
      remember that when Jesus wanted to pass on something of his own faith and 
      philosophy, he used parables, stories, and poetic figures of speech.</P>
      <P>The pages of Christian history reveal many leaders who did not know as 
      much about people as Jesus did. He knew that there is no real 
      understanding apart from experience, either direct or indirect. A person 
      must know and define God for himself. But Christian history contains tales 
      of compulsory beliefs. There have been times when the faith was defined 
      and all who could not accept it were forced to leave the church. There 
      were arguments and wars and persecution, in the name of one creed or 
      another.</P>
      <P>Yet always, even at the height of persecution and compulsion, there 
      were some thoughtful people who knew that faith is personal. Creeds cannot 
      really be enforced. One’s idea of God is as individual as one’s response 
      to a symphony. I cannot possibly hear the symphony for you, nor can I 
      experience God for you. Then why must we describe them in the same terms?</P>
      <B>
      <P>WHAT IS THE HOLY SPIRIT </P>
      </B>
      <P>The Christian story of salvation tells that God revealed his great love 
      when he sent his son among men to be a guide and savior. But Jesus is no 
      longer here to lead people into better ways of living. In his place, says 
      the old story, God sent the Holy Spirit. For many years, great arguments 
      were held in orthodox circles as to the place and function of the Holy 
      Spirit. Most modern Christians are no longer concerned with such debates. 
      The Holy Spirit is looked upon as God is another form. It is the power of 
      God working in and through the life of the believer to sustain him and to 
      keep him in right relationship to God and to his neighbor.</P>
      <P>Christianity, then, has three gods or it has one -- depending upon the 
      opinions of the person who is doing the explaining. Christians are usually 
      indignant when someone says that Christianity is not monotheistic. 
      However, people in non-Christian lands find it very difficult to 
      understand how God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit can be 
      one God. Christians often answer that God can appear in many roles, just 
      as one man may be a son, a husband, and a father.</P>
      <B>
      <P>WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP TO GOD?</P>
      </B>
      <P>The orthodox Christian is one who affirms the doctrines expressed in 
      the great church creeds. Often the creeds have answered a Christian’s 
      questions before he ever had a real chance to ask them. Yet millions of 
      orthodox Christians are still claiming to be satisfied by the answers of 
      the creeds.</P>
      <P>According to the orthodox teachings, God created the world and 
      everything in it because of his love for goodness. He decided to embody 
      goodness in the universe, in all living things, in everything that exists. 
      This is a difficult doctrine to understand, as are all attempts to explain 
      the very beginnings of creation.</P>
      <P>Orthodox Christians say that once God had created men and put them on 
      this earth to live, he would not leave them without knowledge of his will. 
      He would give them a continuing revelation of their responsibilities. He 
      would make it possible for them to live good and satisfying lives. This is 
      because of an important quality God has -- grace.</P>
      <P>The grace of God makes it possible for men to know God, and his will 
      for them in their daily lives. It makes it possible for people to shed 
      their old errors and strive again after perfection, or at least 
      betterment. God’s grace has led to a possibility of &quot;eternal life,&quot; or an 
      eternal quality of life, that is not destroyed by the death of a person.</P>
      <P>Most Christians insist that there is some kind of heaven to which 
      faithful believers may look forward with confidence. They view this 
      &quot;paradise&quot; in different ways, though churches have long cautioned their 
      members not to wish for material rewards for what should be a spiritual 
      endeavor. Many orthodox Christians have also believed in a personal devil, 
      called Satan, and in some kind of hell or eternal torment for those who 
      are not &quot;saved.&quot;</P>
      <P>The underlying causes of the belief in heavens and hells, devils and 
      angels, and the like are only partially understood even now. None of these 
      things may have any actual existence. Yet they all say something about 
      human needs. They tell of the torment brought by feelings of guilt and of 
      &quot;lost ness.&quot; They tell also of moments of inner peace that seem 
      &quot;heavenly.&quot;</P>
      <P>Persons who do not find freedom and joy in the present tend to worry 
      unduly about the past or the future. Often their disappointment and 
      disillusion leads them to hope for a tomorrow that will solve the 
      problems, which<I> </I>presently trouble them. The intense concern about 
      the &quot;afterlife,&quot; which so many religious folk have felt, is not a sign of 
      inner health and genuine faith in life’s possibilities. Rather, it reveals 
      a lack of real faith and confidence in life.</P>
      <P>Some Christians have always insisted that heaven and hell are not 
      places to be inhabited in some remote future. They are conditions of the 
      mind and soul. People were intended to live at peace with God. Because 
      they are so designed, doing God’s will brings them serenity. This is 
      heaven. It is not necessary to die to find it. In the same way, one who 
      violates the requirements for peace with God is living now in hell.</P>
      <B>
      <P>WHAT IS THE GOOD LIFE?</P>
      </B>
      <P>To live at one’s best is not easy. It requires effort and sometimes 
      pain. It is not enough to be kind and helpful to others, to follow rituals 
      of private devotion to God, and to be sorry for past shortcomings. Details 
      fall into proper place for Christians who recall that Jesus said men must 
      first love God and then their neighbors. The good life requires a whole 
      recentering around a Spirit of love. Only in this way can good acts and 
      sincere devotion have meaning and purpose. Then life is complete.</P>
      <P>Most Christians believe that a person may still make mistakes in his 
      day-to-day living, even when he has recentered his life around an attitude 
      of love. They call such mistakes &quot;sins.&quot; Sins can vary in their 
      seriousness from sins against men to sins against God. Most of the 
      organized Christian churches have catalogued sins and the extent of their 
      wickedness. Members are warned against committing sins and instructed in 
      ways of obtaining forgiveness once they have been committed.</P>
      <P>Living by warnings, guilt, and regret is very different from the 
      creative living that some Christians have achieved. They have discovered 
      that a good life does not come from memorizing lists of things to do and 
      things not to do. It comes from facing each experience with confidence and 
      concern. Then all contacts and experiences are religious. All life is 
      religious. And we are true to the best we can be.</P>
      <P>All of present-day manners and morals appear to be built upon 
      foundations of self-restraint and respect <I>for </I>others. Through wise 
      and temperate living, a person builds good habits. Good habits are an aid 
      to a good life. But thoughtful Christians remember that every new act 
      demands a new decision. The good life is attained by choosing wisely, 
      weighing what may be temporary values against enduring ones.</P>
      <P>For centuries, Christians have believed that they could find a deep, 
      lasting happiness by living a life of devotion to God and to others. A 
      person’s greatest opportunity is to seek this end. But Christians admit 
      that there are many people around us whose lives do not seem to reveal 
      this quality. Still, each person is offered the opportunity. God does not 
      choose for him. Devoted Christians have chosen for themselves, saying, as 
      Jesus said: &quot;Thy will be done.&quot;</P>
      <B>
      <P>17. PATH TO SALVATION </P>
      </B>
      <P>It was<B> </B>from Jesus that Christianity got its start and its name. 
      Jesus, however, would probably feel himself a stranger in discussions of 
      Christian beliefs. As Jesus had found, to his sorrow, people are often 
      more eager to pay respect to a trusted teacher than to follow his example 
      of courageous seeking. From the first century, Christians forgot or 
      ignored most of what Jesus taught. Instead they clung to Jesus. They saw 
      in him many things, which he apparently never dreamed of claiming for 
      himself. Christianity is not the religion of Jesus. It is the religion 
      about Jesus.</P>
      <P>The chief reason for the differences Christianity has shown lies in a 
      simple fact: the world is not the same as it was in Jesus’ time. Because 
      the world changes, religions change. No religion stands still. Every 
      religion goes through a process of growth and alteration so long as it<B>
      </B>is a living force among people. It takes into itself ideas, hopes, 
      fears, and customs. As a religion changes people, it too is changed.</P>
      <P>So Christians have been changed by their beliefs, and gradually the 
      beliefs have been altered. Often the different beliefs have formed the 
      basis for a new fellowship or congregation of people, who see in it a 
      stronger hope for a better life. Thus Christianity is represented by many 
      different groups, each considering its own way to be an important, and 
      perhaps better, path to salvation.</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH </P>
      </B>
      <P>Roman Catholics trace their beginnings back to a conversation between 
      Jesus and Peter, as reported in <I>Matthew </I>16:17 -- 19. In this 
      passage, Jesus tells Peter that he is the foundation of the Church. Peter 
      is God’s deputy on earth, with power to decide between right and wrong and 
      to forgive sins or withhold forgiveness. Roman Catholics say that this 
      statement proved that Jesus established their Church.</P>
      <P>They say that God made Peter the first Pope, with full authority over 
      all Christians. The line of Popes has extended down to the present day, 
      with each Pope receiving the authority that was once Peter’s. Each Pope is 
      the visible head of the Church. Christ is the invisible ruler.</P>
      <P>To Roman Catholics, the Church is an essential part of God’s plan for 
      the salvation of men. God, out of His love and grace, established the 
      Church to make clear and definite the means of man’s redemption. This is 
      the only reason that the Church exists. Remembering this, Catholic 
      leaders, from the Pope down to the priests, have constantly sought to make 
      the Church effective in even the smallest details of man’s salvation.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>Faith.</B> </I>The Catholic is not asked to understand the plan of 
      salvation. He is not asked to understand God -- indeed he cannot. He is 
      asked to believe and obey. His belief and his obedience rest on one basic 
      doctrine: that if God were an infinitely loving God, he would set up some 
      definite channel for saving mankind. The Roman Catholic Church insists 
      that this is exactly what God did when he sent Jesus, his son, into the 
      world. Jesus, in turn, gave to Peter the &quot;keys of the kingdom.&quot;</P>
      <P>All men need to be saved because of their share in the original sin 
      that mankind committed in rebelling against God. Catholics believe the old 
      story of how God provided a way of salvation from the burden of sins. By 
      suffering as he did for men, Jesus paid the debt men could never hope to 
      satisfy. Jesus made it possible for all people to receive salvation.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>The Beatific Vision</B>.</I> Salvation brings a person the highest 
      happiness he can know, the Beatific Vision. This does not mean simply 
      &quot;heaven.&quot; While it takes place in heaven, it is actually experience of 
      coming face to face with God. Only after death is this possible. While one 
      lives, there are only suggestions of it.</P>
      <P>Here in the world, our knowledge is limited. We can see only parts of 
      truth. But we are made to know God and to know wholeness, and only through 
      this knowledge can we find deep happiness. The Beatific Vision brings full 
      knowledge of Truth, through the vision of God. It is beyond understanding 
      and interpretation, but the Church assures Catholics that it is the 
      greatest blessing.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>The Bible</B>. </I>The scriptures, like the ritual, of Roman 
      Catholicism are usually in Latin. In recent years, translations into other 
      languages have been allowed. The Roman Catholic <I>Bible </I>includes the 
      familiar books of the <I>Old </I>and <I>New Testaments </I>and an 
      additional section known as the <I>Apocrypha.</P>
      </I>
      <P>Catholics revere the <I>Bible </I>chiefly because it contains the story 
      of salvation. They believe that there are no errors or uncertainties in 
      the <I>Bible. </I>However, most Catholics do not study the Bible 
      personally. They are not expected to interpret it for themselves, since 
      the Church teaches a meaning for most of its passages. It is far more 
      important that a Catholic study the teachings of the Church than that he 
      read the Bible.</P>
      <P>The Sacraments. A Roman Catholic comes into contact with his Church 
      most frequently through his use of the seven sacraments, which give him 
      guidance and strength on the path to salvation. He thinks of them as 
      symbols of God’s grace, which is channeled through the Church. Roman 
      Catholics do not claim that the sacraments are the only way to salvation. 
      But they offer a safe and sure escape from eternal unhappiness and 
      punishment to those who use them.</P>
      <P>Usually a Roman Catholic receives the sacrament of <I>Baptism </I>in 
      his infancy. It removes the guilt of original sin and any sins committed 
      up to that time. The sacrament of <I>Confirmation </I>is given when he is 
      old enough to understand. It bestows the blessings of the Holy Spirit, 
      which help the person to renew his intention and courage to follow God’s 
      will, as interpreted by the Church.</P>
      <P>When a Catholic marries, the sacrament of Matrimony confers God’s 
      blessing and approval upon the marriage and upon the children who may be 
      born to the couple. The Church considers this to be so important that it 
      refuses to consider as a marriage any ceremony other than its own. Roman 
      Catholics are taught that marriage is the eternal and holy union of a man 
      and woman for the purpose of continuing the human race.</P>
      <P>The sacrament of <I>Ordination </I>is given to purify and dedicate men 
      and women for service in the holy orders of monks and nuns and for the 
      priesthood. The ordained person puts aside his daily concerns, including 
      marriage and family life. This is the supreme task of a Christian. For 
      those who are able to undertake its demands, it offers more opportunities 
      for salvation than any other way of life.</P>
      <P>Persons about to die receive the sacrament of Extreme Unction from the 
      priest. It grants forgiveness of their last sins.</P>
      <P>There are two other sacraments, the <I>Eucharist </I>and <I>Pen</I>ance, 
      which make available more frequent spiritual blessing. Each Sunday and on 
      certain other days. Catholics are expected to attend a service called the 
      Mass, which celebrates the <I>Eucharist. </I>It is an age-old rite of 
      remembrance of Jesus’ last meal with his disciples and of his death upon 
      the cross as a sacrifice for men’s sins. In it, the priest performs a 
      twofold miracle on wine and bread, turning them into the blood and body of 
      Christ, without changing their appearance.</P>
      <P>Catholics believe that this miracle of transubstantiation takes place 
      when the priest offers the elements to God, in re-enactment of the death 
      of Christ. The priest then partakes of both the transformed bread and 
      wine. Unless illness prevents, Catholics are required to participate in 
      the <I>Eucharist </I>through receiving the consecrated bread from the 
      priest at the altar rail at least once annually, during Easter season. 
      Through the repetition of this religious drama, a Catholic believes that 
      he is aided in his progress toward salvation.</P>
      <P>Since none of the sacraments remove a human being’s tendency to sin, a 
      Catholic frequently needs to seek forgiveness of his recent sins. This is 
      possible through the sacrament of <I>Penance. </I>Penance includes 
      regretting the sin, confessing to a priest, accomplishing penalties 
      assigned by the priest, and obtaining forgiveness from the priest.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>Saints</B>.</I> The saints honored by Roman Catholics include the early 
      disciples, some members of holy orders, and others whose faith and actions 
      showed their full dedication to the search for salvation. Catholics 
      believe that these saintly persons lived the life that leads to salvation 
      so successfully that they can help others. Through prayer to the saint, 
      through burning candles before his image, and through other acts of 
      honoring his spirit, the Roman Catholic believes that he may obtain some 
      of the saint’s merit for himself.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>Mary.</B> </I>Roman Catholics revere the mother of Jesus as &quot;Holy Mary, 
      Mother of God.&quot; They believe that God extraordinarily honored her when he 
      chose her to be the virgin mother of his miraculously conceived son. To 
      many Catholics, Mary seems nearer and more concerned with their daily 
      problems than either Christ or God, who inspire worshipers with awe. They 
      sometimes call her &quot;Queen of Heaven,&quot; and they ask her to pray for them, 
      now and at the time of their deaths.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>The Church and History.</B></I> The word catholic means universal or 
      general in its effects on men. Certainly the Roman Catholic Church has 
      affected a large part of mankind. It has spoken to millions of people 
      whose chief desire was a sense of comfort and certainty in a life ridden 
      with distress and doubt. To these it has been a beacon of hope and 
      security for the life they live now and the life they expect to come.</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE EASTERN ORTHODOX CHRISTIAN CHURCH </P>
      </B>
      <P>Students of cultures have long noted that great differences exist 
      between peoples of the Eastern and Western hemispheres. From its infancy, 
      the Christian religion was jarred by the differences. There were conflicts 
      and disagreements that were partly political, partly racial, and partly 
      religious. Finally, in the eleventh century the conflicts resulted in a 
      break that has never been mended. The Eastern and Western churches 
      excommunicated each other, each claiming to be the one orthodox Christian 
      Church.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Church.</B> The Eastern churches have no pope. Each church is part of 
      an area known as a patriarchate, which belongs to a federation of 
      patriarchates. Eastern Christians believe that they are members of the 
      only authentic Church stemming directly from the work of the first 
      Christians. They call it the &quot;Holy Orthodox Catholic Apostolic Church.&quot;</P>
      <B>
      <P>Creed.</B> The Eastern churches have not changed the creeds, but they 
      do not interpret them literally. Roman Catholics have concentrated upon 
      the salvation available through the death of Jesus. But Eastern Catholics 
      have been far more interested in his divine-human nature. Roman Catholics 
      have tried harder to obey the teachings of the Church. But Eastern 
      Christians have tried harder to feel at one with God. Other Christians 
      have been occupied with winning salvation for the next life. But Eastern 
      Christians have sought a spiritual rebirth in this life.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Sacraments.</B><I> </I>The Eastern Orthodox Christians observe seven 
      sacraments. Like Roman Catholics, they consider the mass their most 
      important act of worship but both the cup and the bread are offered to the 
      congregation.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Priesthood.</B><I> </I>Priests are looked upon as necessary agents 
      between God and man. A priest may be married, if the marriage takes place 
      before his ordination. Monks, of course, take the usual vows of devotion, 
      chastity, obedience, and poverty. From among the monks, bishops are chosen 
      for each patriarchate. They are known as patriarchs or metropolitans. They 
      are equal in rank, though one may be designated as honorary leader.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Worship.</B> The formal and impressive services of worship are dear to 
      the Eastern Christians. Their priests intone the words of the ritual in 
      Greek, or in Old Church Slavonic. Churches are decorated with special 
      religious paintings called icons -- never with statues.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Scriptures.</B> The scriptures are substantially the same as the <I>
      Bible </I>familiar to all Christians. Priests encourage their people to 
      read the <I>Bible, </I>and all may interpret what they read.</P>
      <B>
      <P>Practice.</B> The Eastern Orthodox Christian has usually felt that his 
      religion demanded a change in his inner life. He has not felt that it 
      asked great changes in society or governments. For this reason, Eastern 
      churches have sometimes accepted governmental and social activities that 
      Westerners have condemned.</P>
      <P>Most of the Eastern Orthodox Christians are found in eastern Europe, in 
      Asia, and in Egypt. Since they have not usually been interested in 
      recruiting new converts, their religion has spread to the United States 
      and other lands almost solely through emigration.</P>
      <P>Wherever sincere Eastern Christians have gone, they have taken the 
      quiet beauty and rich symbolism of their worship service and their 
      churches. They have impressed others with their quiet, unhurried search 
      for an inner life that surpasses the human and links them with the divine.</P>
      <B>
      <P>PROTESTANT CHRISTIAN CHURCHES </P>
      </B>
      <P>The Christian Church was to split again. A young German named Martin 
      Luther drove the opening wedge. Little did he realize that his actions on 
      that day in 1517 would lead to the far-reaching Protestant Reformation. 
      All he did was announce his wish to debate his reasons for condemning a 
      highly publicized sale of &quot;indulgences,&quot; which guaranteed forgiveness of 
      sins.</P>
      <P>It happened that the sale he condemned was offered by an official of 
      the Roman Catholic Church and approved by the Pope. And Luther himself was 
      a priest. His announcement nailed to a church door was a startling 
      challenge to the authority of the Pope and the Church, in a day when the 
      whole of society was governed by their dictates. Faced with the demand 
      that he retract his statements, Luther found that he could not do so 
      honestly. His countrymen rallied around him, and the Protestant 
      Reformation had begun.</P>
      <P>Later leaders made other extensive &quot;protests&quot; against the authority of 
      the Church. Their motives varied, but all of them had one belief in 
      common. The way to salvation was not exclusively linked with the Roman 
      Catholic Church and the Pope. Most of the protests were against the church 
      system, not against the doctrine. For most Protestants, there are still no 
      radical doctrinal disagreements.</P>
      <P>There are now scores of different sects in Protestantism, with no 
      single authority over them all. Most Protestants believe in the rights of 
      others to choose their own religious beliefs and their own religious 
      fellowships. Freedom of belief and choice of church have led to many 
      variations on the Protestant theme. Despite this, Protestants are finding 
      increasing areas of agreement, in their creeds and in their social-service 
      efforts.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>Salvation by Faith</B>. </I>Most Protestants claim that no person, 
      regardless of what he does, can earn salvation for himself or anyone else. 
      Salvation is a gift of God. One must believe that Jesus’ life and death 
      enabled people to regain a harmonious relationship with God. God’s 
      greatest blessing lies in this plan of salvation, which is open to all. 
      All that is required is faith.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>Dedicated Living</B>. </I>The religious life does not require that a 
      person leave marriage, family, and daily human interests. Protestants have 
      almost no monks or nuns, and their ministers are usually men with 
      families. Faith, not works, constitutes the path to salvation. Faith does 
      not depend on one’s occupation, but God does call a person to give of his 
      best efforts wherever he is. Religion is not a matter of church-going and 
      pious meditation. It is the way you live each day.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>The Priesthood of All Believers</B>. </I>Each person can go directly to 
      God for himself. The task of the Church and its ministers is to teach men, 
      not to act for them or command them. This is the real core of 
      Protestantism. There are different reasons for the existence of the 
      Church: to interpret God’s will, to foster a fellowship of mutually 
      helpful members who seek the same goals. Church governments vary, some 
      being directed by ministers, some by ministers and designated members, and 
      some by the entire membership.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>The Bible.</B> </I>Most Protestants believe that the Bible contains the 
      rules for faith and practice of religion. Protestants therefore study 
      their <I>Bibles </I>seriously, reading them in their own language. 
      Although many Protestants are now interpreting the <I>Bible </I>much less 
      rigidly, there are still some who claim for it full authority, to the 
      smallest word, without regard for its historical meaning.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>Worship.</B> </I>Protestants are encouraged to pray sincerely and 
      frequently. To some, prayer is a method of asking God for things. Or it is 
      a way of helping friends from a predicament or &quot;converting’ someone. To 
      the most thoughtful, it is an attempt to see things for what they really 
      are, to come into a right relationship with oneself, with one’s God, and 
      with one’s world.</P>
      <P>Most Protestants observe two sacraments, baptism and communion. They do 
      not believe the doctrine of transubstantiation. To Protestants, a person’s 
      feelings and intentions when he takes a sacrament are more important than 
      the rites of the sacrament. This is also true of other religious duties, 
      which include an offering to support the church, attendance at services, 
      and participation in the Christian fellowship.</P>
      <P>A Protestant is free to live the best and most dedicated life he can, 
      choosing the fellowship in which he feels most able to do it. For help in 
      living this way, some Protestants lean in faith on Jesus as their personal 
      Savior and the Savior of all who believe. Others gain inspiration for the 
      religious life from the noble example of Jesus’ life.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>Evangelical Protestants.</B> </I>The majority of Protestant churches 
      are known as Evangelical Protestant churches. These groups have stressed 
      their separation from the Roman Catholic Church, contending that such 
      authority is a perversion of religion. The original protests were sincere 
      and effective, but later each denomination developed an authority of its 
      own not vastly different from what it had condemned.</P>
      <P>Evangelical churches claim to support the orthodox doctrines. Chief 
      among these are man’s need for salvation and God’s plan for man’s 
      salvation. In the first half of the twentieth century there has been a 
      renewed emphasis upon the old doctrines, in what is known as the 
      neo-orthodox movement.</P>
      <P>Some Protestant sects have claimed that certain teachings are 
      fundamental to Christianity. Especially do they stress the complete truth 
      of the <I>Bible </I>and all the miracles it reports. These Christians are 
      called Fundamentalists. They are known for their strong emotional attempts 
      to convert others to their faith.</P>
      <I><B>
      <P>Liberal Protestants.</B></I> From the very beginning of Christianity, 
      there were some thoughtful persons who saw that not everyone could be 
      satisfied with the same words and the same experiences. Modern Christians 
      who insist on freedom of belief have a well-founded tradition in the past 
      of their religion. They are called the Liberals -- a minority group in 
      Protestantism. Slowly but steadily their number grows. Perhaps even more 
      significant is the fact that their influence helps, little by little, to 
      liberalize the more orthodox groups.</P>
      <P>The true Liberal believes that each person must have an opportunity to 
      grow in religious experience and understanding and to experiment with 
      better ways of living. He believes that religion is for the whole person, 
      both his feelings and his reason. He supports a church as an institution 
      that helps people mature as individuals and as members of a democratic 
      fellowship. The salvation the Liberal Protestant seeks comes through 
      living life in its wholeness.</P>
      <P>Christianity is not any one path or church or group. Christianity is 
      what Christians make it. It is like a river continually flowing toward an 
      unseen sea. The streams that flow into it are sometimes brackish. The 
      eddies that form along its edges may sometimes stagnate. But, like all the 
      other major religions of the world, Christianity continues toward a future 
      no one can fully predict. With it go the hopes and aspirations, as well as 
      the fears and anxieties<B>, </B>of the many millions who call themselves 
      Christians.</P>
      <B>
      <P>18. A RELIGION TO LIVE BY</P>
      </B>
      <P>Religion<B> </B>at its best fills basic human needs. In the final 
      analysis, all of us seem to need the same things. We need to feel that we 
      are important to those around us. We need to feel that we have a place 
      among our fellow men. We need to feel a purpose and a sense of direction 
      in our lives. And we need to feel that we are moving toward our highest 
      goals.</P>
      <P>In every year since Jesus spoke and walked in the paths of Palestine, 
      some people have found answers to their deepest needs in what he said and 
      did. It matters very little that their disagreements in what to believe 
      have often outnumbered their agreements. The important thing is that they 
      have lived more richly because of Jesus’ life.</P>
      <P>Christians say that Jesus’ message is timeless, because he drew 
      teachings directly from the experiences of people he knew. To them, many 
      of his statements are as true today as when he uttered them. His Sermon on 
      the Mount has inspired numbers of devoted Christians to thoughtful living 
      by his parables or by his Sermon on the Mount. Studied carefully and used 
      thoughtfully, such teachings still bring peace of mind to present-day 
      Christians.</P>
      <B>
      <P>RESPECT YOURSELF</P>
      </B>
      <P>Many of the people whom Jesus knew had lost a sense of their own true 
      worth. They felt that they were not important to God or to men. The 
      priests and religious teachers had only added to their problems by 
      labeling them &quot;sinners&quot; and &quot;unclean.&quot; To such troubled people, Jesus 
      preached a message of confidence. &quot;You are the salt of the earth!&quot; &quot;You 
      are the light of the world!&quot;</P>
      <P>Sometimes loss of self-respect causes a person to cringe before someone 
      else who seems to be important. There have been many over-humble 
      Christians who have followed the dictates and directives of leaders in 
      their churches. They have not dared to doubt, to question, or to 
      investigate, for fear they would make further mistakes. But nowhere in 
      Jesus’ message is there a reference to the right of some to dictate 
      beliefs to others. Jesus issued an open invitation to people to join him 
      in the search for the abundant life. In this search, all are equal.</P>
      <P>We live today in a world filled with anxiety. Human beings produce this 
      condition, and it could be eliminated by intelligent human efforts. We 
      worry about countless things -- losing something we have, wanting 
      something we lack. We are anxious about big things and little things, and 
      our worries penetrate every part of our lives. We become increasingly 
      unable to do the things we should and could do, because we are worrying so 
      about the things we cannot do. Jesus tried to still such fears by pointing 
      out real values.</P>
      <P>Do not worry about life, wondering what you will have to eat or drink, 
      or about your body, wondering what you will have to wear. Is not life more 
      important than food, and the body than clothes? Look at the wild birds. 
      They do not sow or reap, or store their food in barns, and yet your 
      heavenly Father feeds them.</P>
      <P>Now, as in Jesus’ time, people can become emotionally and physically 
      sick when they no longer respect themselves. Sometimes the sickness takes 
      the form of contempt for personal desires, or feelings, or appearance. 
      Jesus never ceased to encourage a person to respect himself. He knew that 
      a person does not reach maturity unless he is able to accept himself as he 
      is.</P>
      <P>If one of us hates very much the way he acts or the way he looks, he 
      will see only what he dislikes about himself. Is this a true picture of 
      what he is? Indeed not. In the same way, some persons fail to get 
      satisfaction from contacts with other people. They are thinking about 
      appearances and manners of their friends, instead of really knowing them.</P>
      <P>Jesus taught people that they should love their neighbors in the same 
      way that they love themselves. If we are to love other people, we must 
      first love ourselves. We have often been told to love ourselves last. But 
      if this were the case, we would never love anyone. Loving oneself wisely 
      is the basis of loving others well.</P>
      <B>
      <P>LOVE OTHER PEOPLE </P>
      </B>
      <P>Too many people mistake possessiveness for love. They attempt to 
      persuade the loved one, to make decisions for him, or even to act for him. 
      Real love, said Jesus, consists simply of granting the person the right to 
      be himself.</P>
      <P>Now and then we try to make someone over or reform him. We usually 
      learn that this destroys friendship. The more we try to force people into 
      our pattern, the less influence we have with them. Force defeats itself. 
      Love and acceptance are the greatest powers. They draw love and acceptance 
      in return.</P>
      <P>This is the hardest lesson of parenthood. Of course, babies must be 
      protected from the possible danger their immature decisions might bring. 
      However, as the years go by, parents must learn to let their children 
      assume increasing responsibilities for their own lives. No one can become 
      mature unless he is allowed to be himself.</P>
      <P>There is a well-known saying, &quot;I will forgive but I won’t forget.&quot; A 
      person &quot;makes up&quot; with the friend with whom he has quarreled, but he still 
      cherishes secret resentments. These hurt feelings buried under the outward 
      forgiveness have a chance to grow and fester. They prevent richer 
      relationships with others.</P>
      <P>Jesus was apparently well aware of the fact that if one does not truly 
      forgive, be himself cannot be happy:</P>
      <P>If you forgive others when they offend you, your heavenly Father will 
      forgive you too. But if you do not forgive others when they offend you, 
      your heavenly Father will not forgive you for your offenses.</P>
      <P>And in the familiar prayer based on Jesus’ suggestions to his 
      followers, there is this request: &quot;Forgive us our trespasses, as we 
      forgive those who trespass against us.&quot;</P>
      <P>Jesus was always reminding people that forgiveness was just as 
      important to the wronged person as to the person who had committed the 
      wrong. Forgiveness must be given as often as it is needed. There must be 
      no limit to it. Otherwise, resentments will creep in and gradually prevent 
      the unforgiving person from living happily.</P>
      <P>Jesus taught that love was the law for all areas of human life, between 
      friend and friend, between members of a family, and between groups of 
      people. Christians have disagreed radically among themselves as to the 
      application of this teaching. Some say that it cannot be applied to the 
      relationships between groups of people and nations. They have even said 
      that it is a &quot;counsel of perfection,&quot; not intended to be followed by 
      anyone on this earth. Some Christians have been able to bless wars, 
      torture, and executions in the name of their faith. Others have insisted 
      that love is to be applied in all phases of one’s life, to the greatest 
      possible extent.</P>
      <B>
      <P>BE HONEST </P>
      </B>
      <P>Only when we have learned to love can we be honest with ourselves and 
      with others. To Jesus, inner honesty was of first importance in living the 
      good life. He called for people to be good, not just to practice goodness. 
      He was distressed by pretenders who stood up to pray in the synagogues or 
      on the street corners so that people would think them pious. Jesus said 
      that the prayer said in the privacy of one’s own heart and home was far, 
      far better than a prayer for its public effect.</P>
      <P>He told his followers that they would get nowhere in the spiritual 
      search by repeating &quot;empty phrases.&quot; How distressing it is sometimes that 
      many Christians of today think that religion consists of repeating creeds 
      and prayers, which mean nothing to them. The real danger is that this 
      dishonesty blinds us to our need for something more, and we go along 
      trying to pretend that we are satisfied.</P>
      <P>We are dishonest in other ways. We do good deeds to impress people 
      favorably, without feeling the goodness. We learn polite words to say, 
      without feeling the politeness. We join organizations and social groups, 
      but we do not learn to love people more. We wear these fine false faces in 
      public, and often we fool even ourselves. But the feeling inside is much 
      more important than what we show on the surface. It is only when our inner 
      intentions match our outward acts that we live abundantly. This is being 
      honest.</P>
      <B>
      <P>BE TEACHABLE </P>
      </B>
      <P>The person living at his best is one who is still searching for better 
      ways to live. Such a person has kept his ability to wonder about life. He 
      expects every day to teach him something new and better. He is open-minded 
      and openhearted, like a little child filled with wonder and delight at 
      every new experience.</P>
      <P>Jesus found that many &quot;religious&quot; people, like the Pharisees and the 
      Sadducees, were not teachable. They felt that they already knew all the 
      answers. So there was no need to raise the questions. Everything was 
      settled according to the &quot;Law&quot; or the &quot;Book.&quot; Life could teach them 
      nothing new. It only made them certain that their answers were the only 
      answers.</P>
      <P>Countless Christians have learned the values of being eager to learn 
      more. They have gone on examining their lives steadily and with concern. 
      They have refused to accept the answers of someone else without trying 
      them out. They have tried to follow this suggestion made by Jesus:</P>
      <P>Ask, and what you ask will be given you. Search, and you will find what 
      you search for. Knock, and the door will be open to you. For it is always 
      the one who asks who receives, and the one who searches who finds, and the 
      one who knocks to whom the door opens.</P>
      <P>&quot;Blessed are those who are hungry and thirsty for uprightness, for they 
      will be satisfied!&quot; This is a prescription for religious living that has 
      been applied and recommended by Christians as far apart in time as Francis 
      of Assisi, Meister Eckhart, and Rufus Jones.</P>
      <P>Because of petty problems and unimportant concerns, we often fail to 
      see how generous life has been with us. It is a marvelous world in which 
      we live. No one can take from us the basic, simple joys of living -- the 
      taste of food, the scent of pine trees in the rain, the beauty of a 
      moonlit night, the sound of a waterfall, the colors of a sunset, the joy 
      of loving and being loved. That is to say, no one can really take them 
      away from us, except ourselves. Life’s tragedy is not simply the 
      inhumanity of man to man, in the form of concentration camps, 
      exploitation, and wars. Life’s tragedy is also the torture that we impose 
      upon ourselves because of our failure to accept what is ours.</P>
      <P>Life is a gift. &quot;Freely you have received,&quot; said Jesus; &quot;freely give.&quot; 
      All of the fundamental joys of life are gifts that come to us without our 
      having earned them. Most of us remain unaware of this too much of the 
      time. Jesus often emphasized the wonderful gifts that life offers.</P>
      <P>There is real significance in his parable of the prodigal son, the 
      young man who wasted everything life had given to him, until he was 
      &quot;living on husks.&quot; To many Christians, this parable has said: You may have 
      wasted everything life has offered you so far. You may be living on the 
      husks -- fear, anxiety, guilt, and resentment. Even so, the gracious 
      life-giving forces are still at work in the universe, and in you, to 
      restore you to your true self. The climax of Jesus parable is when the 
      harassed young man &quot;came to himself.&quot; </P>
      <P>Any one of us can come to himself, for each moment renews our 
      opportunity. As long as we live, we face the challenge of continuing to 
      grow mentally and emotionally. There for us all the while, said Jesus, are 
      the richness of life and its resources for our deepest happiness. The 
      Christian who meets his opportunity finds for himself the truth that Jesus 
      spoke. &quot;Behold, the Kingdom of God is within you.&quot;</P>
