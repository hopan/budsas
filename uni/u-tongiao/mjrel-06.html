      <P>22. TOWARD RICHER LIVING </P>
      </B>
      <P>Having<B> </B>started an acquaintance with these different great 
      religions of the world in the preceding chapters, you may be asking: &quot;Out 
      of all these religions, must I individually choose my religion? Must I 
      decide whether to be a Buddhist, or a Hindu, or a Moslem, or a Confucian, 
      or a follower of Judaism, or a Christian?&quot; Perhaps, on the one hand, you 
      have been happily surprised to find these other religions much finer than 
      you had supposed. You may even have felt that you have discovered a few 
      new and deep insights, which your own religion seems to have missed. On 
      the other hand, you may have been worried over the possibility of 
      accepting a belief that others would call &quot;Buddhist&quot; or &quot;Confucian&quot; lest 
      you become a kind of outcast in your church or community. It’s a 
      comfortable feeling to believe that one’s own culturally given religion is 
      the best of all religions -- at least for oneself.</P>
      <P>After all, you say, there are certain things that life gives us without 
      our choosing. By accident of birth, each of us is white or brown, a blonde 
      or a brunette, an American or a Frenchman, a male or a female. Other 
      &quot;givens&quot; are sociologically determined for us -- our country’s mores and 
      our family or national religion. By accident of birth, each of us is born 
      into a culture that calls itself by some special name, such as Hindu, 
      Buddhist, Jewish, or Christian. Long before we have reached what is called 
      the &quot;age of discretion,&quot; when presumably we can make our own choices on 
      the basis of reason and nationally interpreted experience, most of us have 
      become so thoroughly saturated with culturally engendered values that few 
      of us ever make a radical decision to break with our upbringing.</P>
      <P>Most of us, however, have a deeper need in addition to our readiness to 
      follow the past or to be like the people around us. Beneath our apparent 
      activities and interests lies the seed of desire to discover for ourselves 
      who we really are and what in life is important. No matter how many 
      millions have asked these questions before us, and no matter how sure they 
      have been of their answers, each one still has a private yearning to go 
      exploring for himself. This is true of the infant who has just learned to 
      crawl and who applies the &quot;mouth test&quot; to everything he touches. It is 
      true of the young person who is trying to discover the meaning of life, 
      love, and work. It is true of the older person who has not lost his 
      capacity for sustained wonder.</P>
      <P>It is important that we keep alive within us this desire to search and 
      question. There is more faith in honest doubt than in all the unexamined 
      creeds of past and present. In this sense each of us must articulate his 
      own religion -- that is, his own concept of what is of supreme worth in 
      living, his own mode of expressing that concept, his own commitment in 
      daily life to the values he believes to be basic. (The particular words he 
      uses to describe these processes are relatively unimportant, as all 
      liberal spirits in religion have everywhere recognized -- to the 
      consternation of the cautious conservative or reactionary priest.)</P>
      <P>Strange as it may seem, it is only when we discover the depths of 
      personal experience that lie beneath the differences that we are able to 
      appreciate why there are these differences. And what we find at the deeper 
      levels shows us the universal elements. We discover that in deep ways all 
      people are much alike -- even though each one is an original.</P>
      <B>
      <P>SPACE FOR LIVING CREATIVELY</P>
      </B>
      <P>One of the perpetual wonders in life is that there is always room for 
      another person, another idea, and another explanation. Each of us has a 
      chance to fill a place in our universe. We build a &quot;life space&quot; for 
      ourselves first through our attitudes and then through our efforts and 
      actions, with our neighbors and in our total world.</P>
      <P>On the one hand, we may try to wrest a &quot;life pace&quot; for ourselves by 
      taking an attitude of hostility toward others and by moving aggressively 
      against those we think stand in our way. Or, on the other hand, we may shy 
      away from the opportunities life offers and retreat into a private world 
      bounded by fear and suspicion. In both cases we shall have settled for a 
      small, restricting place in life.</P>
      <P>But we have a third choice. We may greet each person and situation we 
      face with confident, friendly, inquiring attitudes. In this way we absorb 
      more and more of what people and situations offer. Thus we construct a 
      constantly enlarging &quot;life space.&quot; Life seems to offer its richest rewards 
      to those who have developed the capacity to &quot;stretch&quot; their &quot;life spaces&quot; 
      continuously. It<B> </B>is true that no person can wholly make his 
      surroundings, but each person does build a personal environment of 
      attitudes and feelings, which may significantly modify his surroundings.</P>
      <B>
      <P>WE CAN HELP EACH OTHER</P>
      </B>
      <P>Each of us to a degree constructs his own &quot;life space.&quot; Yet like the 
      warp and woof in a woven rug, our &quot;life spaces&quot; overlap or interpenetrate. 
      As the English poet, John Donne, expressed it long ago: &quot;No man is an 
      island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the Continent, a part of 
      the Maine.&quot; In improving the quality of our own &quot;life spaces,&quot; then, we 
      cannot help improving the quality of others’.</P>
      <P>Each of us can learn most from the other by following the principle of 
      &quot;the mote and the beam.&quot; By becoming aware of &quot;the beam&quot; in our own 
      religious or irreligious eyes, we are less inclined to concentrate on 
      seeing &quot;the mote&quot; in the other fellow’s eye. But to look for the worst in 
      the other person’s faith while concentrating on the best in one’s own is 
      fatal to human fellowship and larger community. Rather, we must look for 
      the best while not ignoring the worst. From Hinduism and Buddhism, for 
      example, many Westerners can come (and have come) to a new understanding 
      of the importance of the search for the real self. To do this one need not 
      forget the shortcomings of Hinduism as pointed out by a Hindu like Gandhi. 
      Nor does one need to learn how to sit cross-legged and eat rice off banana 
      palms while wearing a dhoti or a saree. Nor does one need to repudiate 
      what one enjoys in his own tradition. This open-mindedness probably will 
      not involve a change in one’s religious affiliation, institutionally 
      speaking, if one is fortunate enough to belong to a group that believes in 
      permitting the widest measure of honest seeking to every member.</P>
      <P>Indeed, it is quite possible that a person could learn just as much 
      about the importance of self-knowledge through a deeper study of the 
      ignored aspects of his own religious tradition as through the study of 
      another religion. But in a world filled with people who have so little 
      appreciation of the best that other cultures have to offer and so great a 
      tendency to defend their own cultures or religions, there is a practical 
      argument for trying to enter into the mood or spirit of other philosophies 
      or religions. In this process many people have discovered that for the 
      first time in their lives they have really experienced a widening of 
      horizons and an extension of self-knowledge. They have also gained a 
      deeper appreciation for their own religious tradition.</P>
      <P>In this sense, any religion or any culture, thoughtfully studied, can 
      become a kind of multiple mirror through which each of us learns to see 
      himself more fully. Each of us is an individual, and yet each is a part of 
      a larger community. In so far as we are individuals, we must go into the 
      depths of our own experiences to find the meaning of life. No parent or 
      teacher or great religious leader can do that for us, though the community 
      may furnish us with clues and guides. Each of us has this inalienable 
      right to a direct relationship to the universe. But each must attain it 
      for himself.</P>
      <P>The tragedy is that too many of us remain content, even in our adult 
      years, with the answers or descriptions offered by someone else. We limit 
      ourselves to what others say instead of re-exploring the basic questions 
      for ourselves. Many of us cling to the values emphasized by some past 
      leader without exploring their meanings in the present. Almost all of us 
      have closed off certain areas of thought somewhere along the line.</P>
      <P>There are doors to be opened, and each of us can help himself and 
      others in this door-opening process. What other people are, what they say, 
      and how they say it can all be helpful in the opening of doors. Knowledge 
      of the past is worthwhile to the extent that it helps us open doors in the 
      present.</P>
      <B>
      <P>TOWARD THE DISCOVERY OF ONE ONENESS</P>
      </B>
      <P>In the light of the approach to life, which we have been discussing in 
      these chapters, certain types of attitudes, beliefs, and actions are ruled 
      out. What attitudes are ruled out? Those reflecting an uncritical reliance 
      on other peoples’ experiences or words, whether from Orient or Occident; 
      attitudes of fear and submissiveness, as well as attitudes of cocksureness 
      or a &quot;know-it-all&quot; approach; attitudes of coercion or the feeling that 
      there is &quot;an only way&quot; of going about the important experiment of finding 
      life’s meanings.</P>
      <P>What types of beliefs are excluded? Beliefs that build walls around 
      oneself or around one’s tribe, shutting out an honest concern about why 
      other people believe what they do; beliefs that persist because our 
      underlying guilt feelings or anxieties are stirred thereby; beliefs that 
      stress one’s shortcomings at the expense of one’s virtues or 
      potentialities; beliefs that cramp one’s spirit, stifle one’s courage or 
      morale.</P>
      <P>Similarly, certain types of actions are ruled out. To use an 
      &quot;Inquisition&quot; or to persecute in the name of religion is the very denial 
      of man’s humanity as well as proof of how stunted one’s own faith is. In 
      every religion childish attitudes and ceremonies can be found. But like 
      childish attitudes held by young people or adults, they cannot be 
      legislated or forced out of existence; they must be outgrown. Most people 
      need sympathetic help in learning how to outgrow their blind spots, or in 
      evaluating childish religious actions and attitudes.</P>
      <P>There is a practical corollary to this that should affect the work of 
      every society with a &quot;missionary&quot; dream. Attempts at conversion too often 
      become forms of coercion. It is well to try to see the best in the other 
      person’s religion even while <I>by </I>example one is seeking to share his 
      own faith. By example alone is one’s personal religious faith given 
      eloquent testimony in a way that respects the integrity of the other 
      person’s worth.</P>
      <P>To permit each of us to grow to his fullest stature, we must move out 
      of that kind of competitive atmosphere, which sees the diversity of 
      religions as &quot;a battle unto the death.&quot; Most Orientals have learned to 
      resent &quot;Occidentalization&quot; in matters of religion; similarly most 
      Occidentals would resent &quot;Orientalization.&quot; All of us must become 
      teachable citizens of One World. Our primary allegiance must be to that 
      pattern of divinity as it emerges in all things human; our secondary 
      allegiance can then safely be given to that culture, society, 
      family-system or nation that has been as a friendly guide to us on the 
      road to an affirmation of humanity’s true oneness. &quot;Divinity is round us 
      -- never gone&quot; -- this is the lesson we must be constantly learning.</P>
