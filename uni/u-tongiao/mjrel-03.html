      <P>10. TAOISM: THE WAY OF NATURALNESS AND NONCOERCION </P>
      </B>
      <P>For as long<B> </B>as we can remember, the news about China has been 
      news about changes in the way of life of the people. Civil wars, 
      international wars, revolutions, new political developments. Always 
      changes such as these take their toll in the whole life of all the people 
      affected. In China, as elsewhere, religions have been forced to change. 
      Many of the old traditions and ceremonies and ideas are no longer 
      respected or observed or understood by today’s Chinese.</P>
      <P>The ancient country of China was relatively untouched by modern 
      scientific and educational advancements until the beginning of the 
      twentieth century. Yet, centuries ago, there lived a Chinese sage named 
      Lao-tse, who believed and taught that the world moved according to a 
      divine pattern, which is reflected in the rhythmic and orderly movements 
      of nature. The sum of wisdom and of happiness for man, said Lao-tse, is 
      that he adjusts himself to this order and himself reflect the way the 
      world moves.</P>
      <P>Lao-tse’s life and thought have added depth to Chinese life and 
      thought. The world would be the poorer without him. His teachings, 
      together with those of later followers who believed as he did, make up the 
      thoughtful basis of Taoism. Yet, when we look back carefully into the past 
      of China -- to about 600 B.C. -- we see only a faint, shadowy outline of 
      this sage, humorist, philosopher, and prophet. The figure of Lao-tse comes 
      close to being legendary. However, many scholars claim that such a person 
      did live. Stories tell us that he was visited by Confucius and that the 
      two philosophers conversed together. Lao-tse is mentioned in books written 
      in the generation just after his own. According to tradition, Lao-tse 
      himself is supposed to have written the <I>Tao-Teh-Ching, </I>the 
      fascinating little book on which much of Taoism is based.</P>
      <P>Lao-tse was first moved to speak because he saw around him many people 
      who were perplexed by unanswered questions about their lives. The 
      questions were not very different from the ones you and I ask even today. 
      Like all basic human questions, they have been repeated by generations. 
      &quot;What am I? What is my life? Am I living the best life I can? What could I 
      be? How can I do better? What are the results of trying to do better?&quot;</P>
      <P>The Chinese looked upon their world in an optimistic way, and when they 
      asked, they asked hopefully and confidently. The world, they observed, was 
      a good place for a man. It could be depended upon. All their experience in 
      daily contacts with the world had shown them that it was orderly and 
      dependable. Nature did not operate by whim. The Chinese seemed to sense 
      that they ‘belonged&quot; to nature.</P>
      <P>Yet Lao-tse looked at the people around him and saw some of them 
      struggling for happiness without remembering what their traditions taught 
      them. He saw people trying to change what life offered, instead of 
      accepting it. And he said: &quot;You seek wisdom, goodness, and contentment. In 
      the ways you arc trying to attain them, you are blind and foolish. Can you 
      not see that wisdom is trust, goodness is acceptance, and contentment is 
      simplicity? This is the way of the world.&quot;</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE WAY OF THE WORLD </P>
      </B>
      <P>In days earlier even than Lao-tse’s, the way of the world had been 
      given a name, the Tao (pronounced Dow), which means simply &quot;way&quot; or &quot;way 
      to go.&quot; It has been translated as &quot;nature&quot; or &quot;the way of nature.&quot; It is 
      the way the universe moves and has its being. Man is a part of the 
      universe. When men are most natural, they move according to the laws of 
      interdependence and interaction of all parts of the world. If Tao were 
      allowed freely to operate within men, then everything would be at its 
      best, for the Tao is the way of perfection: perfect balance, perfect 
      harmony. It is <I>the </I>way -- there is no other.</P>
      <P>The Tao is the source of all created things. It is responsible for 
      bringing all things into existence, even the Chinese gods. The <I>Tao </I>
      itself has never been considered as a god. The <I>Tao </I>is reality. It 
      existed before there was any universe. It created all existence and 
      continues to keep it in operation through the release of its energy. Rise 
      and fall, flow and ebb<B>, </B>existence and decay -- through such an 
      alternation of the <I>Tao’s </I>energy, existence began and will continue. 
      Even so, the Tao never forces a person to act in a certain way. The Tao 
      simply operates. That is all.</P>
      <P>Taoism was so named because Lao-tse and his followers were insistent 
      upon the Tao as the way of life. &quot;Getting back to nature&quot; was their goal 
      -- &quot;nature’ being understood to mean the natural and proper way of all 
      things. So completely did the early Taoists follow this line of belief 
      that they went about China calling for the end of human ceremonies and 
      customs and even civilization itself, because these were the result of 
      interfering with nature.</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE WAY OF MEN </P>
      </B>
      <P>The early Taoists frequently referred to a past &quot;Golden Age,&quot; when men 
      had lived in peace and harmony because they were natural, free from 
      artificiality, simple -- in short, men of Tao. The good things that all 
      men seek had been lost when that age had passed. Men would find them only 
      when they returned to the simplicity and utter naturalness that had 
      characterized the Golden Age.</P>
      <P>&quot;Nature&quot; is the key to all the Taoists’ answers to the questions life 
      makes us ask. A person’s highest good and his sincere happiness is to be 
      found through conforming to the way of all nature, the <I>Tao. </I>When 
      one is natural, he is relaxed within and able to accept what life offers. 
      When one is ambitious or aggressive, he contradicts his true nature. In 
      the ensuing civil war within himself, he strikes his possible happiness a 
      fatal blow.</P>
      <P>While Lao-tse was calmly suggesting that men must relax and accept the 
      world as it is, instead of trying to change it, there were many others who 
      loudly voiced their disagreement. Reformers and philosophers, Confucius 
      among them, walked the land, telling all who would listen that the only 
      way to regain happiness and prosperity was for all people to become 
      virtuous. When every person learned to do his duty and to fulfill all of 
      his responsibilities, then the land and all its people would be blessed. 
      They, too, spoke of a past golden age, when happiness was the rule rather 
      than the exception. But, they said, its values could be realized again 
      when the people learned how to behave toward each other.</P>
      <P>&quot;Not so, not so!&quot; cried the early Taoists. Virtue, duty -- these are 
      achieved by those who let themselves go and do what comes naturally. Why 
      should a man strive for goodness? Goodness comes of itself when all rules 
      are forgotten and effort ceases. Virtue is never gained by seeking it. 
      Duty is performed only when you are <I>not </I>trying to perform it.</P>
      <P>Lao-tse had little sympathy for the typical reformer who wished to add 
      rule after rule for proper living. It is after people have lost their way, 
      said he, that the reformer cries, ‘be good, be righteous! <I>I </I>will 
      tell you how.&quot; When a family is no longer getting along very well, the 
      parents start telling the children to be respectful and obedient. This 
      applies to nations, too, for only in times of national confusion are 
      people anxious about patriotism.</P>
      <P>Nature never argues the way persons do. Nature just goes on being 
      natural. And what argument can change the way of the world? Gravity does 
      not debate with us or insist; <B>it </B>just operates. In such ways, 
      nature shows us the <I>Tao. </I>Lao-tse pointed out that the <I>Tao </I>is 
      never forceful, yet there is nothing that it does not accomplish. 
      Precisely because of its unceasing, unstriving, uncoercing operation, the
      <I>Tao </I>is the only power.</P>
      <P>The man who lives by <I>Tao </I>will not use force, for force defeats 
      his higher aims. The man who tries to shape the world into what he wants 
      it to be damages himself and others in the attempt. He who insists or 
      strives for something gets involved in his own efforts and merely loses 
      the value of the thing he seeks. Thus he damages his ideal, defeats his 
      purpose, and fails miserably.</P>
      <P>Men should learn from a pond of muddy water. No amount of stirring can 
      clear it. But when it is left alone, it becomes clear by itself. So it is 
      with men and with nations. Rulers particularly must understand this. 
      Lao-tse once said that one should govern people as he would cook a small 
      fish -- gently. Too much cooking, too much handling makes it fall to 
      pieces or destroy its flavor. As for the people who presume to teach 
      others, they must also grasp this idea. He who thinks he knows a lot about 
      others may think he is wise. But only he who knows himself has hold upon 
      the true and the important.</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE MAN OF TAO </P>
      </B>
      <P>Lao-tse and Chuang-tse, the best-known later Taoist (around 350-275 
      B.C.), must have spoken reluctantly, for the real <I>Tao </I>is not the <I>
      Tao </I>that can be expressed in words. It is impossible to describe 
      literally the man of <I>Tao. </I>Yet these two men were pressed for 
      definitions. And so Lao-tse drew a word picture:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>He is cautious, like one who crosses a stream in winter;<BR>
        He is hesitating, like one who fears his neighbors;<BR>
        He is modest, like one who is a guest;<BR>
        He is yielding, like ice that is going to melt.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Taoists feel that such descriptions of the poised and serene person are 
      true, not because Lao-tse or anyone else has said them -- but because they 
      reflect the nature of things, the <I>Tao.</P>
      </I>
      <P>Chuang-tse was fishing one day when some high officials of the 
      government of his province came to visit him. As he continued to fish, 
      they flattered him, by speaking of his wisdom and offered him a high 
      governmental post, which would bring him recognition and respect from many 
      people. Without interrupting his fishing, Chuang-tse asked the gentlemen 
      if they knew of the sacred tortoise, dead over three thousand years, which 
      the prince kept safely enclosed in a chest on the altar of his ancestors. 
      Then he asked them, &quot;Do you think this tortoise would rather be dead and 
      have its remains revered, or be alive and wagging its tail in the mud of 
      its pond?&quot;</P>
      <P>&quot;It would rather be alive,&quot; they replied, &quot;wagging its tail in the 
      mud.&quot;</P>
      <P>&quot;You may be on your way,&quot; said Chuang-tse. &quot;I too prefer to wag my tail 
      in the mud in my own pond.&quot;</P>
      <B>
      <P>WHAT IS WORTHWHILE? THE THREE TREASURES </P>
      </B>
      <P>Then what is of value? And for what should a person spend his efforts? 
      A person cannot simply sit and fold his hands and wait. Since he lives in 
      a group of people, he has to think of others. The early Taoists faced the 
      problem of living in an everyday world. They knew that they must live 
      their philosophy, as well as think it. They decided that there were three 
      things -- three treasures, they called them -- that is the supreme guide 
      of the man to Tao. These three are love, moderation, and humility. How do 
      these three qualities help the man of Tao to live in the world? &quot;Being 
      loving, one can be brave; being moderate, one can be ample; not venturing 
      to go ahead of the world, one can be the chief of all officials.&quot;</P>
      <P>One who sees the <I>Tao </I>within himself sees the <I>Tao </I>in 
      others and in the entire world. It is this person who sees that his true 
      welfare is good for all men. The good for all men is his rood, too. This 
      is what- Lao-tse meant by being loving. The man of Tao will act with 
      goodness toward all men, to the so-called good people as well as to the 
      so-called bad, even returning love for great hatred. If this is not done, 
      regardless of bow justly one deals with the hatred, some of the hatred or 
      its results will remain. &quot;Being loving, one can be brave.&quot; The man of Tao 
      trusts the world, and the world can be entrusted to him.</P>
      <P>In all his thoughts and actions, the man of Tao is moderate. Excesses 
      in any direction are blocks to contentment. The man of Tao would not 
      decide in advance exactly what course of action he would take in a given 
      situation. Neither would he decide in advance that lie would not conduct 
      himself in a certain way. He would remember always that whatever presents 
      itself as the simplest and most natural way to act or to think is the way 
      to follow. In this way, his actions are always sufficient and always 
      right. &quot;Being moderate, one can be ample.&quot;</P>
      <P>Lao-tse and his followers never sought high places in governmental 
      offices, for this was against their convictions. One cannot help people by 
      trying to direct their actions. And they pointed out how one could better 
      achieve his purposes by holding himself in a humble place. In our world 
      there is no place for sonic to be ahead of others. There is room only for 
      all to live naturally and in mutually helpful ways. Let no one seek 
      private gain or personal success.</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Heaven is eternal, the Earth everlasting.<BR>
        How come they to be so? It is because they do not foster their own 
        lives;<BR>
        That is why they live so long.<BR>
        Therefore the Sage<BR>
        Puts himself in the background; but is always to the fore.<BR>
        Remains outside; but is always there.<BR>
        Is it not just because he does not strive for any personal end<BR>
        That all his personal ends are fulfilled?</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>These qualities are treasures that do not lie buried somewhere so 
      deeply that a teacher or friend or philosopher is needed to dig them out 
      for us. They are found when we become aware of those things, which we 
      ordinarily ignore, in our deepest nature. Simply by peeling back through 
      the layers of our fears and habits and superficial aspirations, we find 
      such treasures. A lack of these qualities shows us a person who is forced, 
      unnatural, and unhappy.</P>
      <B>
      <P>WHAT MUST I DO?</P>
      </B>
      <P>Duty is to be performed, not because a man feels obligated to do it, 
      but more because he does not feel that he must not do it. The man of <I>
      Tao </I>would conform to the world to the extent required to cause him 
      least difficulty in living in harmony with the <I>Tao. </I>It is clear 
      that he could not live harmoniously if he were constantly plotting to get 
      out of responsibility and to overthrow governments and institutions. It is 
      clear also that he would not live harmoniously if he were constantly 
      planning to take over larger shares of responsibility and to reform or 
      strengthen the things about him. The world is like a broth that too many 
      cooks are about to spoil. The wise man will not refuse to add any 
      ingredients, nor will he stir. He prefers to wait for a proper and natural 
      blend.</P>
      <P>But how can we just sit back and let things happen without doing 
      anything to help or hinder. It is difficult to do, but it is simple. It is 
      as simple and as difficult as relaxing. Chuang-tse gave this advice:</P>
      <P>A man feels a pleasurable sensation before he smiles, and smiles before 
      he thinks how he ought to smile. Resign yourself to the proper sequence of 
      things.</P>
      <P>The world is not ours to take by the horns and steer. The world is ours 
      to live in and to understand. Harmony is not born of aggressive notes, 
      striking out on their own. It is born of humble notes, yielding 
      confidently and quietly in accord.</P>
      <P>Chuang-tse once told a story about a man who struck out on his own, 
      instead of yielding in confidence to the <I>Tao. </I>This man was so 
      afraid of his shadow and he so disliked his own footsteps that he 
      determined to get away from them. However, the more he moved, the more 
      footsteps he made. And despite his fast running, he never left his shadow 
      far behind. So lie decided that he was going too slowly. He ran his 
      fastest, without pausing for rest. As a result, he weakened and finally 
      died. He did not know that he could have lost his shadow in the shade and 
      put an end to his footsteps by keeping still. Foolish indeed was he. Woe 
      to the reformers and the moralists who come preaching of purity and 
      goodness, says Chuang-tse -- they run from their own shadows.</P>
      <B>
      <P>WHAT IS RIGHT? WHAT IS TRUE? </P>
      </B>
      <P>When one really stops to analyze it, says the Taoist, how can one claim 
      to offer rules for good living? How can one ever feel confident enough in 
      his own knowledge to do such a thing? The cocksure person who pretends to 
      know so much is probably pretending just for the sake of his own ego. The 
      person who is truly wise is the one who does not know that he is wise. 
      Thinking that we know, when actually we do not, is a special sickness to 
      which all men are prone. Only when we become sick of such conceit and 
      fraud can we cure ourselves of the sickness.</P>
      <P>In his desire to help people do this, Chuang-tse often used the light 
      touch of humor. He tells the story of how he once dreamed that he was a 
      butterfly, fluttering around gaily here and there. He was completely 
      unaware of being a man any longer. Then suddenly, he awoke and found 
      himself lying in bed, still a human being. However, Chuang-tse then had to 
      ask himself: &quot;Was I then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or am I now a 
      butterfly dreaming I am a man?&quot;</P>
      <P>What is truth? How do I know that I know? These are questions which 
      cannot he answered definitely by the true wise man, though many 
      self-styled sages offer answers. All answers depend upon a time and a 
      place and a situation. The man of Tao forgets lists of answers; he ignores 
      codes of behavior; he rises above morals and ethics. The man of Tao does 
      not submit to external authorities of any sort. He merely listens keenly 
      to his own deepest nature. In doing so, he not only finds truth but also 
      lives truth. For in his deepest nature, there is the Tao, operating 
      clearly and strongly; without going out of his door, the man of Tao can 
      know the whole world.</P>
      <P>Such were the words of the pioneers of Taoism, who would have preferred 
      not to talk at all. They knew that their impressions of life could not 
      best be conveyed in words. Their impressions would be fully understood 
      only by those who shared them as a result of their own experiences. Each 
      of us has at some time failed in the attempt to put his deepest feelings 
      or intuitions into words. In such moments, we may express ourselves in 
      poetry, or music, or some other art form. It is just so with the Taoists. 
      If we are to understand them, we must realize that we arc dealing with the 
      poetry of their impressions. Words are not meant to be taken literally, 
      since words cannot convey impressions adequately. But the words of Taoism 
      are meant to be taken seriously.</P>
      <B>
      <P>TAOISM IS A RELIGIOUS CULT </P>
      </B>
      <P>The Taoists’ reluctance to use words as a vehicle for their feelings 
      was not misplaced. Hardly were the words uttered or the symbols drawn on 
      the paper. when the weakness of words betrayed the speakers and the 
      writers. People took the words literally, and they followed them to the 
      letter, like the codes that the earlier Taoists so ridiculed. In clinging 
      to the descriptions of the man of <I>Tao, </I>people forgot the inward 
      harmony that had first been described. In memorizing the &quot;three 
      treasures,&quot; people neglected to find them buried within themselves. In 
      trying to follow Lao-tse and Chuang-tse exactly, people lost their way to 
      understanding the Tao.</P>
      <P>This is not at all surprising. The people of Lao-tse’s time were never 
      really lifted from their superstitious ways by his utterances, or those of 
      any other teacher. Their worlds were filled with daily concerns for work 
      and friends and families. It was easy and reassuring to placate the 
      ever-present &quot;spirits&quot; who were everywhere about them. These people did 
      not have the time, the education, or the desire to think searchingly about 
      their lives. Most people, everywhere, and in every age, live their lives 
      without thinking deeply about them.</P>
      <P>Even so, most people have a high respect for those who do think deeply, 
      and especially for those few famous thinkers whose ideas appeal to them as 
      being an important part of what is universally true. Often, out of their 
      respect, they turn to veneration and then, almost imperceptibly, to 
      worship. Thus it was with Lao-tse. Later generations regarded him as a 
      god. They forgot that the happiness of which he spoke had to be reached by 
      the process he had followed -- conforming to the way of all things -- the
      <I>Tao. </I>They seemed to think that there were short cuts to the 
      contentment that Lao-tse had experienced.</P>
      <P>Gradually through the years, the self-knowledge and life-knowledge that 
      had been the goals of Taoism got left behind. Newer Taoists sprang up, 
      whose major concerns lay in the banishing of cares and sorrows. True, the 
      earlier Taoists had wanted this, too, but as a by-product of harmony with 
      the nature of things. Now the Taoists wished to make happiness an easier 
      thing. And they began to offer pills and potions and magical rituals to 
      help in achieving it.</P>
      <P>Taoism became a search for the magical elixir, a cure for all ills, and 
      a prolonged of carefree life. The early Taoists had at first retreated 
      from the artificial and unnatural in order to know reality. They were 
      followed, centuries later, by Taoists who retreated from reality in order 
      to follow superstitious customs they hoped would bring escape from 
      unhappiness. The earlier Taoists had prize the knowledge and understanding 
      of the Tao, seeking to fit in with the nature of things. The later Taoists 
      tried to interfere with natural processes, in order to gain immortality 
      and freedom from care.</P>
      <P>Other Taoists, despairing of this life, have become hermits and live 
      merely for death, following what they believe to be the correct 
      interpretation of Lao-tse’s teaching to &quot;do nothing.&quot; They are few in 
      number, for the masses of the people cling to the more popular expression 
      of Taoism -- the superstitious and magical. The Taoists accept their 
      religion for the comfort they receive now and for the hope it gives them 
      for their future after death.</P>
      <P>Lao-tse taught that men should neither worry about nor serve the 
      spirits, which many thought to be all about them. Instead, they should 
      study to learn the ways of the world. Nothing could come from their 
      ignorant and fearful worship of such spirits. The man of Tao was not 
      troubled by spirits, either good or bad. Those who worked magic tried to 
      force nature to do their wills. And force was never successful. Nature 
      could teach them this.</P>
      <P>Lao-tse, looking on the present scene, would doubtless be distressed 
      that this had come to pass from what he had taught. He would be filled 
      with the sense of futility that would come to any prophet who could look 
      upon what had developed out of his labors. The religion, which to Lao-tse 
      as founder, is full of all the things he considered least worthwhile.</P>
      <P>This new Taoism could not survive as an effective religion, even as the 
      old Taoism had not lasted. Gradually, the people who had been attracted to 
      the thoughtfulness of Taoism became discouraged. The people who had sought 
      the betterment of human society turned to Confucianism, which offered more 
      direct and practical help in that problem. Those who had liked the 
      meditative aspects of Taoism began to investigate Buddhism. And classical 
      Taoism, as Lao-tse taught it, practically ceased to exist.</P>
      <P>The religion of the average Chinese person today is a blend of 
      different religious traditions. Taoism’s role in that blend has been a 
      light-hearted and playful facet in the national life. Most of the 
      religious holidays, with their gay ceremonies, had their origin in the 
      past of Taoism. These include ceremonies for certain significant birthdays 
      -- especially those of boys -- ceremonies for marriage, for the birth of 
      children, and for sonic seasons of the year. There is now a group of 
      trained priests who minister to those who call themselves Taoists.</P>
      <P>Lao-tse’s and Chuang-tse’s Taoism lives on mostly in the things it 
      offered to other stronger and longer-lived religions. Confucianism added 
      the Taoist belief in the basic goodness of people. Buddhism in China, with 
      its already strong emphasis on the importance of knowing the inner self, 
      was strengthened and changed somewhat by this native religion. As a 
      religious philosophy, Taoism faded, but it did send many away with the 
      understanding that the inner life of the self was the life that was 
      important.</P>
      <B>
      <P>11. CONFUCIANISM: THE WAY OF HARMONY AND PROPRIETY</P>
      </B>
      <P>Legends<B> </B>say that when Lao-tse was very old he was visited by a 
      scholarly young man from a nearby province. The young man, who spent most 
      of his days in study, had come to ask some questions. Like Lao-tse, he was 
      concerned with the quality of life in China. He, too, believed that back 
      in the ‘good old days&quot; of the Golden Age people had lived better lives and 
      the country as a whole was more prosperous.</P>
      <P>This young man was Confucius, and he had arrived at those beliefs via 
      the route of much study and research into the ancient literature of China. 
      As he collected and translated the literary Classics, he found what he 
      considered to be clues to the happier life of the earlier days. For a real 
      understanding of Confucian philosophy, we still turn to his comments upon 
      those Classics. The Analects, stories about Confucius and his comments 
      upon life situations, also tell of his proposals for the good of his 
      countrymen.</P>
      <P>Both Lao-tse and Confucius were concerned with the social and moral 
      weaknesses of their generation. Lao-tse met the challenge of life with the 
      radical view that the institutions and customs of his day were unnatural 
      and thus to be avoided. Confucius, a true conservative, taught that the 
      best from the past should be kept and properly improved. In the past lay 
      the key to the present and the future. He did not seek to start either a 
      new religion or a new system of ethics.</P>
      <P>Confucius was facing the same basic questions that concerned Lao-tse. 
      &quot;What is life all about? How can I get along best in the world? How can I 
      live a happy life? What am I?&quot; For part of the answer, Confucius turned to 
      nature and the Tao, as Lao-tse had done. All parts of nature, he observed, 
      operate in harmony with one another. He decided that men might learn from 
      nature. By following the way of nature and harmony, men would do the best 
      thing they could in the world.</P>
      <P>Harmony, then, was Confucius’ ideal, just as it was Lao-tse’s. Wherein 
      lay the difference between the two men? For one thing, their personalities 
      were very different. In all the problems they faced, the dissimilarity of 
      their outlooks determined the differences in the solutions they gave. 
      While Lao-tse tended to be an &quot;individualist,&quot; Confucius believed that 
      man’s entire responsibility was social. Man was not man apart from his 
      fellows. Harmony for man, therefore, meant harmony with other men. Lao-tse 
      believed that man’s responsibility was to understand himself and to get 
      himself directly in harmony with the <I>Tao. </I>But Confucius believed 
      that man’s responsibility was to cooperate with others and to perform the 
      duties society expected of him. Such co-operation was rooted, of course, 
      in the Tao, but the human level of experience was the medium through which 
      human beings expressed their belonging to the universe. When a person 
      developed his capacity for harmony with his fellow human beings, then he 
      could understand universal harmony.</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE NEED FOR RULES FOR LIVING </P>
      </B>
      <P>Confucius saw that not all men were conducting themselves in such 
      co-operative, mutually helpful ways. This, to Confucius’ practical mind, 
      meant simply that they needed some definite standards. In his writings, 
      Confucius emphasized such standards, repeating and interpreting the 
      ancient, traditional rules of Chinese society. He saw no need to add new 
      rules. His duty as he saw it was to compile and transmit to posterity the 
      literature describing the old customs and manners of Chinese society. He 
      wrote no <I>new </I>things, for he believed and loved the ancients.</P>
      <P>Why was it that rules were needed? All the rules arose originally out 
      of human needs. This is the way all good laws come about. There are 
      problems in living together, and rules are designed to solve the problems. 
      Wherever there are many people living together, there are more problems 
      than where there are few. The government of a large city is much more 
      complex than the government of a tiny village. China already had many 
      people. And thanks mainly to Confucius, she has accumulated many rules. 
      All these rules are attempts to make life go more smoothly. They are not 
      to be enforced like traffic regulations. They are more like rules of 
      etiquette.</P>
      <P>Rules have more meaning when they are specific. People who like to live 
      in an ordered society feel more comfortable when the rules for society are 
      available in definite order and when they designate times and places. So 
      it was that, through the years, Confucianists placed great value on 
      numerous lists of specific rules covering everything from passing the time 
      of day with a friend to worshiping the ancestors. Dress and conversation 
      were prescribed. Even posture and steps were listed, so that no one who 
      was sincere in his efforts could fail to do the right thing. Following the 
      rules showed a person’s real desire to cooperate with his fellow men.</P>
      <B>
      <P>HOW TO GET ALONG WITH OTHER PEOPLE: THE SUPERIOR MAN </P>
      </B>
      <P>In order that people might know how they. ought to live, Confucius 
      describe a &quot;Superior Man,&quot; or a noble or princely man. Confucius called 
      him a &quot;princely&quot; or superior man because of his belief that the rulers 
      were teachers. However, anyone at any time can live as a Superior Man.</P>
      <P>The Superior Man has developed within his personality Five Constant 
      Virtues, which he has practiced until they are as natural as breathing. 
      Doing the right thing is an inseparable part of him. When Confucius said 
      of himself that not until he was seventy years of age could he follow the 
      promptings of his heart without overstepping the boundaries of right, 
      perhaps he was being overly modest or very humble. Nevertheless, a good 
      Confucianist spends as long as it takes to make the right way of living so 
      habitual that he will not have to stop to think about doing the right 
      thing.</P>
      <B>
      <P>(1) Right Attitude</B>. The first of the Five Constant Virtues concerns 
      attitude. The Superior Man desires to be in harmony with other men. He 
      knows that he cannot fulfill his role in life unless he is co-operative 
      and accommodating. The right attitude is revealed through conduct. People 
      have the seed of such an attitude within them, but it must be helped to 
      develop. This virtuous attitude is sometimes thought of as an inner law of 
      self-control.</P>
      <B>
      <P>(2) Right Procedure</B>. The second Constant Virtue is proper 
      procedure. The man of noble mind has made a study of the rules of conduct. 
      He has learned how to apply them to every incident he faces. He knows all 
      the rules for etiquette, which set forth what each social situation 
      requires of the completely humanized person. He knows all the ceremonies 
      and rituals centering around ancestor reverence. He knows how to sit, how 
      to stand, bow to converse, how to walk, and how to control his facial 
      expressions on all occasions. Yet all these rituals and procedures are 
      without value if a man does not have the proper attitude. &quot;A man without 
      charity in his heart, what has he to do with ceremonies?&quot;</P>
      <P>(<B>3) Right Knowledge</B>.<I> </I>The third Constant Virtue is 
      knowledge. The Superior Man is a knowing man, for a person must be 
      educated in order to respond in the exact way. The Confucianists’ goal is 
      to grow gradually from memorized rules to habits. The subjects that teach 
      a person correct moral habits are the history, literature, and civics that 
      make up the Chinese Classics. The Superior Man plans his education to 
      include all such essentials. For centuries, the Classics were the bases of 
      education in China. Modern times have substituted other subjects, but the 
      Confucianist still holds the Classics in respect.</P>
      <P>When Confucius stressed the importance of education, he was not 
      suggesting a new idea. He was repeating and emphasizing what the ancients 
      had said. The social order depends upon fundamental morality -- the 
      morality of proper words and actions. Also like the ancients, Confucius 
      believed that morality was to be applied in all levels of life, but in a 
      very significant way to the ruling level. For the rulers were the teachers 
      of all. They taught the needed morality most effectively when they set a 
      good moral example and when they governed kindly. Only through such a 
      process would the new Golden Age finally arrive, when all men would deal 
      with each other in kindness and consideration.</P>
      <B>
      <P>(4) Right Moral Courage</B>. According to the fourth Constant Virtue, 
      the Superior Man should develop the moral courage necessary to remain 
      loyal to himself and charitable toward his neighbors. His character is 
      such that everything he does makes a worthwhile contribution to society. 
      Through his every deed, human relationships are improved.</P>
      <B>
      <P>(5) Right Persistence</B>. The last of the Five Constant Virtues was an 
      emphasis of their title -- constancy. The Superior Man has achieved the 
      other four virtues, and he persists in his achievement. He is unfailingly 
      kind and helpful. He knows what his duty is on each occasion, and he 
      always knows how to do that duty. Because he has developed the seeds of 
      virtue within his nature, he is in harmony with everything in the 
      universe. Because he has harmony within himself, he is part of cosmic 
      harmony. That is why he is able to do the right thing at the right time 
      always.</P>
      <B>
      <P>PERFECT HUMANITY </P>
      </B>
      <P>Confucianists often speak of &quot;perfect humanity.&quot; It can be achieved by 
      a person because of something the Confucianists believe to be present 
      within each person, even at birth. This is a native goodness or kindly 
      love that can be developed through feelings of helpfulness toward others. 
      It was Mencius, the best-known Confucianist of a later period, who 
      emphasized the native goodness of men. When he and Confucius spoke of man 
      s goodness, they meant that he was fit to live with other people -- in the 
      long run. There was quite a course of preparation first, as we have seen. 
      Behavior, habits, thought patterns, and judgments had to be improved.</P>
      <P>When a man has educated himself to be a Superior Man, he can be kind, 
      helpful, and good. The &quot;seed&quot; of goodness within him makes these qualities 
      possible. So many good acts are possible that the Chinese despaired of 
      ever listing them all one by one. Their &quot;Golden Rule&quot; is stated in 
      negative terms. Nevertheless, it is full of concern for others. &quot;Do not 
      unto others what you would not they should do unto you.&quot;</P>
      <B>
      <P>RIGHT RELATIONSHIPS </P>
      </B>
      <P>As part of their effort to make right living easy for everyone, 
      Confucianists have stressed five important personal relationships that 
      require kindness and tact. These were once taught to every schoolboy. but 
      that system of education was discontinued early in this century. Still, 
      many Confucianists think that if everyone used the Five Constant Virtues 
      in these five relationships, a true golden age would begin. If happiness 
      or harmony is to exist, the ten people involved in these contacts must use 
      virtuous attitudes and conduct toward each other:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>(a) Husband and wife<BR>
        (b) Father and son<BR>
        (c) Elder brother and younger brother<BR>
        (d) Ruler and subject<BR>
        (e) Friend and friend</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Notice that something is expected of both parties to the relationship. 
      Each is responsible for acting and speaking and thinking in kind and 
      helpful ways.</P>
      <P>Some may say that this does not go far enough. What about other people 
      of their own and other lands? Confucianists do hold to the ideal of 
      charity and kindness to all one’s neighbors and to all other persons on 
      earth. But one individual does not come in contact with <I>all </I>other 
      persons. His circle of acquaintances is limited. It is for this reason 
      that the five personal relationships are listed. It is much better for a 
      person to act with kindness and regard for the few persons he contacts 
      frequently than to mouth words about &quot;loving&quot; all men. </P>
      <P>He will never know all men. A good life consists of acting properly 
      toward the persons one meets daily in everyday experiences.</P>
      <B>
      <P>FAMILY LOVE AND DEVOTION </P>
      </B>
      <P>Long before the point where history books begin, the Chinese believed 
      that one of the first duties a person has is to his parents. In the large 
      families of the Chinese custom, parents, grandparents, and 
      great-grandparents are looked upon as very wise, much beloved, and greatly 
      revered. Their deaths do not lessen the respect that is paid to them. 
      Reverence for ancestors is a way of extending the &quot;family feeling&quot; beyond 
      death. Confucius and Confucianists have played a major part in keeping 
      loyal devotion to parents uppermost in the ideals of China.</P>
      <P>Children in China have never been allowed the freedom of choice and 
      behavior that we know in the West. They are disciplined kindly but firmly 
      from the start, in order that their attitudes and behavior may be proper. 
      Disobedience has been very rare, and disrespect even rarer. Children carry 
      their devotion to parents to the point of accepting parents’ decisions for 
      them, including the choice of a husband or a wife. The Chinese believe 
      that in such matters the parents are far wiser than their children.</P>
      <P>Naturally, family loyalty has changed rapidly with the other changes of 
      the twentieth century. New political developments have already caused some 
      breakdowns of the old family traditions and may cause greater changes yet. 
      However, filial piety has been a part of Chinese life for so long a time 
      that it is still an influence in China.</P>
      <P>Confucius encouraged ancestor reverence or worship because he believed 
      that it helped a person to develop proper attitudes and conduct. When a 
      person offers gifts before a plaque in memory of a departed ancestor, he 
      remembers his origin and his love. This experience draws from him feelings 
      of respect and loyalty. For a person to carry filial piety beyond death 
      shows an even greater degree of devotion than simply to honor living 
      parents.</P>
      <P>Many Confucianists offered gifts and sacrifices in honor of the dead 
      without ever believing that the spirits of the dead were present. 
      Confucianists found it worthwhile because it helped them to build good 
      habits of respect for others. At the same time, this adds strength to 
      society. For these two reasons, Confucianism includes ancestor reverence 
      among the important aspects of human behavior.</P>
      <B>
      <P>WAYS OF WORSHIP </P>
      </B>
      <P>Confucius did not seek to change or even to say much about the 
      religious beliefs and practices of his day. He simply accepted them as 
      they were -- in so <I>far </I>as they served society. He was not in the 
      least interested in popular religious ideas or customs that ignored common 
      experiences and knowledge. He did not like to speak of the spirits that so 
      many people worshiped out of superstition and fear. Once Confucius said to 
      a student who asked about spirits, while you are not able to serve men, 
      how can you serve their spirits?&quot; To him, it was a waste of time to 
      concern yourself with anything you could not definitely know. Life after 
      death was another example. &quot;While you do not know life, how can you know 
      about death?&quot; One had no time for things he could not know, since knowing 
      even his neighbors required a lifetime.</P>
      <P>Confucius was not concerned with ideas about God and other problems in 
      theology. But he had a real devotion to the ancient religious ceremonies, 
      because he believed that they helped to build the habits and attitudes 
      necessary to proper conduct. His personal religion was limited to 
      reverence of ancestors, the moral life of the Five Constant Virtues, and 
      recognition and reverence of a just Heaven above. For the most part, 
      Confucius passed on the ancient Chinese religion, which was a blend of 
      reverence for nature gods and ancestors.</P>
      <P>Large numbers of the Chinese people worship Heaven as a supreme god or 
      as one of many gods, with interpretations as varied as those given to any 
      other god. The worship of the Heaven-god has been an imperial worship, 
      administered throughout Chinese history by the Emperor with seasonal 
      ceremonies. Very few Confucianists, along with other educated Chinese, 
      actively joined in worshiping Heaven. However, they tended to support the 
      imperial ceremonies as being worthwhile because they might help people to 
      remember their origin.</P>
      <P>Many people have asked: Is Confucianism a religion? Confucius himself 
      did not claim that what he was teaching was religion. He did not expect a 
      revelation from Heaven as authority for what he taught. He told his 
      followers that it was good to be in awe of Heaven because it was an 
      intelligent, creating force that moved in a perfectly natural way, through 
      the Tao. Heaven was impartial and just. Later Confucianists added the 
      belief that Heaven was a personal god, but one who exerted no influence on 
      men or on the world he created. Still the major focus of Confucianism has 
      always been on humanity. Mencius described the will of Heaven in terms of 
      what it means to men by saying that being true to its nature is Heaven’s 
      way. Trying to be true to his nature should also be the way of men.</P>
      <P>Confucius considered himself to be a social reformer, rather than a 
      religious leader. He dreamed of and worked for a society in which men 
      would live in perfect harmony. If what he taught was not religion, it was 
      at least religious. Confucius taught his beliefs because he believed they 
      were backed by the nature of things. His teaching was an attempt to get 
      man in line with reality.</P>
      <B>
      <P>THE PLACE OF CONFUCIUS IN CHINESE HISTORY </P>
      </B>
      <P>In his lifetime, Confucius was a respected teacher, but he was one 
      teacher among many. While he lived, his fame and popularity were never 
      sufficient to result in the adoption of his teachings in government. On 
      the contrary, he spent long years in trying to persuade one ruler after 
      another to adopt his ideas, all in vain. He had some loyal students who 
      were convinced of the superiority of his ideas, but other people did not 
      wholly agree in this opinion. It was not until several hundred years after 
      his death that Confucius’ teachings on morality began to gain an important 
      place in the life of the Chinese.</P>
      <P>The Chinese <I>Classics, </I>in which he had invested so much time and 
      thought, were made the basis of civil-service examinations for 
      governmental positions. This marked the time when the whole pattern of 
      Chinese life began to be Confucian. For over two thousand years, Confucian 
      thought dominated education, government, and culture. This officially was 
      brought to an end shortly after the beginning of this century, but people 
      move more slowly than institutions. All the people have not abruptly 
      forgotten the old traditions.</P>
      <P>Confucius’ personal ideals never reached fullest flowering, even though 
      they helped to shape the course of Chinese civilization. Sometimes rulers 
      and politicians seemed to be more sincere than they actually were in 
      following his teachings of morality, hoping that their apparent loyalty to 
      Confucius would gain favor from the people. Sometimes they heaped titles 
      and honors upon him posthumously or upon his descendants.</P>
      <P>Immediately following his death, Confucius was worshiped as an ancestor 
      by members of his family. Others joined in the reverence, because in China 
      a great teacher is given the same respect as a parent. It was always his 
      teachings that interested his admirers, never any magical deeds or 
      superhuman qualities. Confucius has been worshiped as a god, but this was 
      the worship of the unschooled people, who believe that the important thing 
      is to worship plentifully, not thoughtfully. Perhaps this kind of worship 
      could be described as a special hero worship. In general, Confucius has 
      been to China -- and to a lesser extent to Japan -- the great teacher. He 
      has been honored far above any other man in the whole of his country’s 
      history.</P>
      <B>
      <P>CONFUCIANISM AS A RELIGIOUS CULT </P>

      <P>At times strong attempts have been made to establish Confucianism as a 
      state religion, with Confucius as a sort of savior. These efforts have 
      failed for several reasons. First of all, the Chinese have always been 
      accustomed to religious freedom, and the idea of a single state religion 
      offended them. Secondly, they seemed unwilling to turn Confucianism into a 
      religion like Taoism and Buddhism. Perhaps it had been with them too long 
      as the broad base of their lives for them to limit it to an organized 
      religion.</P>
      <P>New political movements in China have sometimes blamed Confucianism and 
      Confucius for many of the ills of Chinese society. This is partly due to 
      their attempt to discredit old traditions and beliefs, in order to bring 
      in new ideas of government and education. Today, Confucius does not hold 
      the same respected place in the memories and the history of his people.</P>

      <P>WHAT DOES LIFE REQUIRE OF MEN?</P>
      </B>
      <P>Though his teachings were never to achieve the success Confucius wished 
      for them, some of his important ideas survived his death and the 
      intervening centuries. These ideas have made a distinctive contribution to 
      China and to its neighbor nation, Japan, which has so often found China’s 
      thoughts and art worth borrowing. In fact, the life and thought of the 
      kindly philosopher have contributed to the knowledge of the whole world.</P>
      <P>Above all, Confucianism calls for an intense concern for humanity. 
      Confucianists’ main argument with both Buddhists and Taoists has been that 
      they turned their backs on their fellow men to go seeking after what was 
      best for them personally. Never, never, should self come before society. A 
      person finds his fulfillment in the very act of helping and knowing 
      others.</P>
      <P>Confucianism demands of rulers and leaders a special accounting to the 
      people they rule. The only reason rulers exist is to help people to be 
      better. If this idea could ever be accepted seriously by the leaders of 
      nations, statesmanship would attain new heights, and life for all would be 
      improved. Finally, say Confucianists, even world peace would he achieved.</P>
      <P>Who can say all the good that might result if families would accept the 
      charge Confucius gave them? Confucianism places before the family the 
      importance of the family’s job in moral education. It points out how 
      natural and cheerful the moral approach to life is.</P>
      <P>&quot;What does life ask of mc?&quot; China has traditionally said: &quot;It asks kind 
      attitudes and conduct. It asks that you live with the interests of your 
      fellow men uppermost in your concerns. In so living with others, you will 
      gain the greatest good -- you will find your place in the world. You will 
      find yourself.&quot;</P>
