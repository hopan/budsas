      <P><I>Monks: a monk should meet his end mindful and clearly comprehending. 
      That is our instruction to you.</I></P>

      <P ALIGN="center"><B><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#800000">OUR DEATH SHOULD BE 
      SERENE</FONT></B></P>
      <P>All of us have to die one day. Our death should be serene and peaceful. 
      Therefore when someone is about to die we should make it as serene and 
      beautiful for him or her as possible. Yes, are you surprised that death 
      can be beautiful? If you are, it is because we normally have dosa or 
      aversion towards death. There is fear of pain and the uncertainty of what 
      is to come after death. Then there is attachment to our loved ones which 
      gives rise to much pain in our heart in having to part with them.</P>
      <P>We should however realize that our wrong understanding and attitude is 
      the cause of our suffering. We have not understood the Dhamma deeply 
      enough. We have not understood and penetrated the nature of mind and body 
      as impermanence, suffering and no-self. We have not learned how to let go 
      gracefully, how to submit to the inevitable.</P>
      <P>When the Buddha&#39;s stepmother Maha Pajapati Gotami was about to die at 
      the ripe old age of 120, Ananda and the nuns cried. Maha Pajapati Gotami 
      gently reproached them: &quot;But why should you cry, my son and daughters. 
      Don&#39;t you see this body of mine has become old and decrepit? It is like a 
      haunt of snakes, a seat of diseases, a resort of old age and death, a 
      house of suffering. Weary have I grown with this corpse of a body. It has 
      been nothing but a great burden to me. Long have I aspired for the 
      liberation of Nibbana. And today my wish is about to be realized. Truly my 
      death is a happy thing. It is the time for me to beat the drum of 
      satisfaction and joy. Why then should you cry?&quot;</P>
      <P>The Buddha, as he was dying amidst natural surroundings under two sal 
      trees in the forest, also told Ananda not to cry at his death. He said one 
      must with wisdom and equanimity accept the fact that death and separation 
      from all that we love is inevitable. The Buddha reminded that we must 
      practise mindfulness meditation to attain the wisdom that can enable us to 
      face death with serenity. He told the monks: &quot;Thus must you train 
      yourselves: We must meet our death mindful and composed.&quot; And the Buddha&#39;s 
      last words were: &quot;All conditioned things are subject to dissolution. You 
      should strive on with diligence.&quot;</P>
      <P>People who have lived beautiful lives can die beautifully. The other 
      day I came across a very touching In Memoriam in the newspaper: &quot;As she 
      breathed her last and entered into eternal life, her face lit up and her 
      lips broke into a lovely smile. Sister F., on seeing this, exclaimed: 
      &quot;Look, she&#39;s seeing God...&quot; It so happened I know this lady, a Christian, 
      who had died such a beautiful death. She had a very gentle and kind nature 
      and was always concerned for the welfare of others. I was told that as a 
      school teacher she used to seek out the especially weak students and gave 
      them special coaching and encouragement. She was deeply loved and 
      cherished by her family and by all those whose lives had been touched by 
      hers. I am told that she had always been such a gentle and loving person 
      to everybody that verily her life was just like that of a saint.</P>
      <P>Having lived such a beautiful life, it is no wonder that she died a 
      beautiful death. Our religions may vary but as the Dalai Lama, winner of 
      the Nobel Peace Prize, puts it: &quot;Compassion is the essence of all 
      religions.&quot; It is my firm belief that if we have lived a good life, then 
      when we die we will die a beautiful death whether we are Buddhists, 
      Christians, Hindus, Muslims or of whatever views or beliefs. As the Buddha 
      says, it is deeds that maketh a person. In this context I used to tell 
      Buddhists that it is better to be a good Christian or good Muslim than to 
      be a bad Buddhist. Thus, good Christians when they die may see their God 
      or the light. Buddhists too may see mental images of the Buddha, arahants, 
      devas or heavenly realms and radiant light.</P>
      <P>Jack Kornfield, the American Vipassana meditation teacher, once related 
      in the Inquiring Mind journal how he visited Howard Nudleman, a very kind 
      surgeon and meditator a day before the latter died of cancer. He 
      recollected how walking into Howard&#39;s room was like walking into a temple. 
      And when he looked at Howard, Howard gave him a smile, a smile of such 
      incredible sweetness, that he (Kornfield) would never be able to forget it 
      for the rest of his life.</P>
      <P>Yes, I am sure touching stories about beautiful deaths of beautiful 
      people abound. Therefore, death too can be a beautiful experience. When we 
      have lived a good life and this body has become frail and broken down, we 
      can face death gracefully, knowing that we have lived a good life and that 
      it is time for us to move on.</P>
      <P>So when a loved one is about to die, we should understand and allow him 
      (or her) to go peacefully. We should make it as serene and beautiful for 
      him as possible. Obviously, we shouldn&#39;t be crying or wailing. That would 
      only make it more difficult for the dying person. Of course if he is an 
      understanding Buddhist and there is still strength in him to speak, he 
      might, just like the Buddha, gently chide you: &quot;But my dear why should you 
      cry? Has not the Buddha taught us in many a way that separation is 
      inevitable in life? How can it be that what is subject to dissolution 
      should not dissolve? That is not possible. Therefore we should contemplate 
      deeply on the Dhamma. This body, my dear, is not ours. This mind too is 
      not ours. They arise and pass away according to conditions. We must 
      practise mindfulness deeply to see this, so that, clinging no more, we can 
      be liberated from birth and death. My dear, be strong. Even as I take my 
      leave of you I will like to remind you of the Buddha&#39;s last words to us 
      all: &quot;All conditioned phenomena are subject to dissolution. Therefore, I 
      exhort you, strive on with diligence.&quot;</P>
      <P>Yes, all Buddhists should remember that the Buddha&#39;s last reminder to 
      us was to strive on untiringly to attain the wisdom that can liberate us 
      from birth and death. A meditator should meditate to the very end. He can 
      observe his in-breath or out-breath or the rising and falling of the 
      abdomen as he breathes in and out. If he experiences any difficulties he 
      can be aware of them, noting them as they are, without any fear or 
      anxiety, but with calmness and steadiness of mind. He can observe painful 
      sensations and bear them even if they are intense. He can remind himself 
      that they are merely sensations, albeit difficult ones. He can see too 
      that they are impermanent, that they continually arise and pass away. He 
      can understand and not cling or be attached to the body. He knows that 
      both the body and mind arise and pass away according to conditions. He can 
      reflect: &quot;This mind and body are not mine. They have never belonged to me. 
      They arise because of conditions and, according to conditions, they will 
      pass away. Accordingly, this eye is not mine, this ear is not mine, this 
      nose is not mine.....This body is made up of the four elements of earth, 
      fire, water and air which represent the qualities of matter, the qualities 
      of hardness, softness, pressure, tension, heat, cold and so on. As long as 
      there is kammic energy to sustain my lifespan for this life, this body 
      will survive. When the kammic energy for this life expires, then this body 
      dies, and a new mind conditioned by the old mind at the moment of death, 
      arises in a new body. If I had attained arahatship, there is no need for 
      anymore rebirth. If I have not but have, nevertheless, lived a good life, 
      I am not afraid of a new rebirth. I can take on a new existence as a 
      well-endowed and intelligent human or a heavenly being and from there 
      continue my path of development until I attain the ultimate Nibbana, the 
      end of birth and death.&quot; Reflecting in this way, a meditator can become 
      very calm and steady. He can become very peaceful. He can even smile at 
      his pain and at the people that may be gathered around him. With his mind 
      being so peaceful, painful bodily sensations too can cease. He can die in 
      serenity and peace, gently breathing his last.</P>

      <P><B>Tears of joy</B></P>
      <P>When Anathapindika, the philanthropist and great benefactor of the 
      Sangha, was dying, Sariputta, the Buddha&#39;s chief disciple, preached a 
      discourse on non-attachment to him. Sariputta reminded Anathapindika that 
      life was merely a process dependent on conditions, and that in this 
      transient mind and body there is nothing which is worth clinging to. 
      Sariputta went through a whole list of what life constitutes, showing that 
      they are all ephemeral conditions which cannot be clung to. Therefore 
      Anathapindika should not grasp after visual forms and the eye, sound and 
      the ear, scent and the nose, taste and the tongue, touch and the body, and 
      the consciousness that is dependent on all of these. Anathapindika should 
      not grasp after seeing consciousness, hearing consciousness, smelling 
      consciousness, tasting consciousness, touching consciousness and thinking 
      consciousness. He should understand their impermanent nature and observe 
      their arising and passing away, without clinging to or being averse to 
      them.</P>
      <P>Similarly Anathapindika should not grasp after the contact dependent on 
      eye and form, ear and sound and so on. He should not grasp after the 
      feeling, whether pleasant or unpleasant, that arose dependent on the 
      contact. He was to treat them all with equanimity, understanding their 
      true nature of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and no-self. The body is 
      made up of the four elements of extension, oscillation, cohesion and 
      temperature. The mind is made of feeling, perception, mental activities 
      and consciousness. They are all impermanent and changing all the time. 
      Anathapindika, Sariputta exhorted, should not be attached to any of these. 
      There is nothing in the world which can be called a permanent self. There 
      is, in the ultimate sense, no self in this mind and body. And therefore 
      there is nothing for Anathapindika to cling to.</P>
      <P>On hearing this profound Dhamma, a great peace and joy came over 
      Anathapindika. And he cried. The Buddha&#39;s attendant monk, Ananda, who was 
      present was taken aback and asked Anathapindika why he cried. &quot;Was it 
      because he was not able to bear up with his pain?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; Anathapindika 
      replied. It was not that. But rather it was because the discourse was so 
      beautiful that it had touched him very deeply. &quot;I have never felt so 
      touched in my life. That is why I cried,&quot; he told Ananda and Sariputta. 
      His tears were not tears of sorrow, but tears of joy - joy at hearing and 
      understanding such profound Dhamma.</P>
      <P>Anathapindika asked why such Dhamma was not often preached to the 
      lay-people. Sariputta replied it was because the lay-people normally found 
      it difficult to appreciate such deep Dhamma, being attached, as they were, 
      to the very many sensual pleasures available in life. Anathapindika 
      protested that there were those who would understand and appreciate the 
      deep Dhamma and who, for not hearing it, would be lost. He urged Sariputta 
      to preach often to others the discourse on non-attachment which Sariputta 
      had just preached to him.</P>
      <P>Shortly after Anathapindika died. As his end was peaceful and he had 
      lived a good life, he was said by the Buddha to have been reborn in the 
      Tusita heaven. As one who has attained the first stage of sainthood 
      (sotapatti) it is believed that Anathapindika would, within seven lives, 
      attain full enlightenment and thereby be liberated from rebirth.</P>
      <P>There are stories too of how monks in the old days attained arahatship 
      (full enlightenment) on their deathbed. So too yogis of today can meditate 
      to the very end, so that for all they know they might realize insight 
      knowledges, deepening their understanding of impermanence, suffering and 
      no-self, and even attaining sainthood at the moment of death.</P>
      <P>A yogi too can radiate metta, loving-kindness. Even as he is dying, he 
      can radiate thoughts of loving-kindness to all beings. &quot;May all beings be 
      happy. May they be free from harm and danger. May they be free from mental 
      suffering ..... physical suffering ..... may they take care of themselves 
      happily.&quot; Dying with such noble thoughts of love for all beings is a noble 
      way of dying. In the Visuddhimagga, a classic Buddhist meditation manual, 
      it is stated that a person who is in the habit of radiating metta, will 
      die very peacefully, as if falling into a pleasant sleep. And if he has 
      not attained arahatship and has thus to be reborn, he may be reborn in a 
      heavenly realm.</P>
      <P>Yes, a yogi need not fear death. He can gracefully give up the body and 
      mind knowing that life and death are just two sides of the same coin, 
      understanding that while we are alive we are already dying from moment to 
      moment, dying to each passing moment and being reborn into each new 
      moment. Mental and physical phenomena are constantly arising and passing 
      away. Nothing stays the same even for a second. This has been proven too 
      in quantum physics where it was found that subatomic particles vanish at a 
      rate of 10 to the power of 22 times in just one second. The Buddha too 
      said that mental and physical phenomena are constantly arising and 
      dissolving. As long as we have not eliminated the kammic-rebirth energy by 
      uprooting the mental defilements of greed, anger and delusion, so long 
      will we continue to take new birth. Dying in this life just means the end 
      of the lifespan for the body and mind in this life. But immediately on 
      expiry of the death-moment mind, without any interval, a new mind arises 
      taking on a new body according to the kamma or deeds of the being in his 
      previous life. So a yogi understanding that the death-moment mind is 
      basically no different from that of any other mind-moment would have no 
      fear. He can meet his end mindful and composed in line with the 
      instruction of the Buddha.</P>
      <CENTER>
      <P>** **</P>
      </CENTER>
      <P><B>Making the atmosphere serene</B></P>
      <P>In making the atmosphere serene for a dying person, we should know his 
      preferences, his likes and dislikes. For example, he may like flowers. 
      Then we should have flowers in the room by his bedside. He would probably 
      like to pass away in his own cosy room, in surroundings that are familiar 
      and peaceful to him. So if it is possible, he should have his end at home 
      rather than in a hospital. But if that is not possible and hospital care 
      is required, we should try to make his surroundings in the hospital as 
      private and peaceful as possible. A private room is best but not all 
      people may be able to afford it. Whatever the place may be, we should try 
      to make the atmosphere as peaceful as possible.</P>
      <P>He might have a small Buddha image which he likes to gaze at. If so we 
      can place the image beside the flowers at his bedside. The serene 
      countenance of a Buddha image can be very reassuring. By looking at the 
      image, one is reminded of the Buddha&#39;s wisdom and teaching. And that can 
      give much comfort and peace, especially in times of need. The room too 
      should be clean and cosy. The dying person might like his bed to be placed 
      facing the window so he can see trees and plants which can be soothing to 
      the heart. (The Buddha, for example, chose to pass away in natural 
      surroundings, under two sal trees which were in bloom in Kusinara forest.)</P>
      <P>If perchance the dying person should lose his steadiness and show signs 
      of fear, anxiety or pain, relatives should reassure him. For example, a 
      loved one can hold his hand or gently stroke his forehead, speaking in 
      soothing and reassuring terms. She can remind him gently of the Dhamma, 
      the need to keep the mind calm and to meditate. She can assure him not to 
      worry about her or the children, that she has the teachings of the Buddha 
      and that she will live by the teachings. She will know how to take care of 
      herself and the children. She can remind him that property, loved ones and 
      mind-and-body are ultimately not ours. Only our deeds are our true 
      property that will follow us. She can remind him of the good life he had 
      led, of the good care he had taken of the family, and of the many good 
      deeds he had done. Recollecting thus, and understanding the Dhamma, he can 
      become strong. He can smile and be at peace. Death is no more frightening 
      to him.</P>
      <P>Of course, what we have stated is just an example of one possible 
      scenario. When the time comes there can be no prepared script. But if one 
      understands the Dhamma one can respond intuitively and, according to the 
      prevailing conditions, say and do just the right thing to help a loved one 
      die peacefully.</P>
      <P>During the Buddha&#39;s time, Nakulamata, the wife of Nakulapita, did just 
      that: she reassured her husband when he was at one time close to dying. 
      She told him: &quot;My dear, do not die with any regret or attachment to 
      anything. Our Lord, the Buddha, had said that it is unwise to die in such 
      manner.&quot; Understanding her husband&#39;s nature, she continued: &quot;My dear, you 
      might think that when you are gone, I will not be able to support the 
      children or keep the family together. But think not so; for I am deft at 
      spinning cotton and carding wool. I can support the children and keep the 
      family together. Therefore be at peace.&quot;</P>
      <P>And she reassured her husband that she would remain virtuous and 
      practise the Dhamma until she attained enlightenment. And if anyone should 
      doubt this, let them go and ask the Buddha, who she was certain would 
      express confidence in her. Hearing all these assurances, Nakulapita 
      instead of dying felt very much better and recovered from his illness! 
      Later, when the loving couple went to see the Buddha, the Lord told 
      Nakulapita that he was very lucky to have a wife like Nakulamata. &quot;You are 
      very fortunate to have Nakulamata who had such love and compassion for 
      you, who desire your happiness and who can counsel you in times of 
      crisis.&quot;</P>
      <P>Relatives too should give all the support they can to the dying. As has 
      been said earlier, they should not cry as that would make it difficult for 
      the dying person. But if they have difficulty in controlling themselves, 
      then they too should contemplate on the Dhamma. They can contemplate that 
      death is inseparable from life. When there is life there must be death. It 
      is something we must accept gracefully. Besides when the body is decrepit 
      or terminally ill, it is quite a relief to be &quot;freed&quot; from it. Taking on a 
      new life, the person will be better off. Thinking in a wise way too, 
      relatives can regain their composure and help give the dying person a 
      dignified and serene departure.</P>
      <P><B>The last thought-moment</B></P>
      <P>The last thought-moment or the death moment is said to be very vital. 
      If one dies with fear, anger, craving or any other unwholesome mental 
      state, then a bad rebirth will come about. But if one dies with peace and 
      understanding, with mindfulness and equanimity, a good rebirth will come 
      about. Usually if one has led a good life the last thought-moment will 
      quite naturally be a wholesome one. The good deeds one has done may appear 
      to the mind&#39;s eye. Or one may have visions of the destiny one is going to, 
      such as the seeing of breathtaking heavenly scenery and beautiful people. 
      Conversely, if one has led an evil life, then the evil deeds one has done 
      may appear before one&#39;s eye, or visions of hell-fire and other bad omens 
      may be seen. In life though, we are not all good or all bad; there is a 
      mixture of bad and good in us. But if on the whole we have been good, then 
      we can be confident of getting a good rebirth.</P>
      <P>If we have a good understanding of life and death, we can meet death 
      with steadiness and equanimity. We can, as we have said, meditate to the 
      very end, maintaining our mindfulness and composure. Having lived a 
      generally good life and furthermore, being able to maintain mindfulness in 
      the face of death, we can certainly be assured of a good rebirth - as a 
      good human being again or as a deva, a heavenly being. Hopefully too we 
      can quickly, in whatever rebirth we have taken, make an end of samsara, 
      the round of birth and death, so that subject no more to rebirth, we will 
      attain the peace of Nibbana.</P>
      <P>Sometimes the question may be asked: What if a person is unable to 
      maintain mindfulness, especially if he has not undergone any meditation 
      training? What if, let us say, he dies in a coma? Or what if he dies 
      suddenly in an accident? From my understanding of the scriptures as taught 
      by the Buddha, I would say that if one has led a good life, then chances 
      are some good thought-moment will surface at the moment of death and a 
      good rebirth can come about. Our kamma is our true refuge 
      (kamma-patisarana), so accordingly the sum-weight of the good deeds we 
      have done should lead us to a good rebirth. That is why we should lead a 
      good life while we are alive, and not wait until we are near death, for it 
      would be much too late then. But as in life we have done both some bad and 
      good, there is the possibility that we might unskillfully recollect the 
      bad deeds instead of the good ones at the moment of death. Therefore 
      maintaining mindfulness is all important; it is very helpful. With 
      mindfulness, unwholesome thoughts will not be able to enter our mind and 
      we can pass away calmly, peacefully. Mindfulness being such a wonderful 
      quality - being able to help us in both life and death - why then should 
      we not cultivate and thoroughly develop it while we are alive?</P>

        <P><I>A monk devoted to mindfulness of death is constantly diligent. He 
        acquires perception of disenchantment with all kinds of becoming 
        (existence). He conquers attachment to life. He condemns evil. He avoids 
        much storing. He has no stain of avarice about requisites. Perception of 
        impermanence grows in him, following upon which there appear the 
        perception of pain and not-self. But while beings who have not developed 
        mindfulness of death fall victims to fear, horror and confusion at the 
        time of death as though suddenly seized by wild beasts, spirits, snakes, 
        robbers, or murderers, he dies undeluded and fearless without falling 
        into any such state. And if he does not attain the deathless here and 
        now, he is at least headed for a happy destiny on the break-up of the 
        body.</I></P>

      <P ALIGN="center"><B><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#800000">CONTEMPLATION ON DEATH</FONT></B></P>
      <P>While we are alive it is good to contemplate on death now and then. In 
      fact it is good to do it daily. The Buddha recommends frequent 
      contemplation on death because there are many benefits to be gained from 
      such contemplation. Let&#39;s look at how we can benefit in contemplating on 
      death.</P>
      <P>First we must make it clear that by contemplating on death, we do not 
      mean that you must become morose, frightened, morbid or depressed, and 
      feel like killing yourself. No, far from all these, we mean that you 
      should, in contemplating wisely on death, be able to live even more wisely 
      and compassionately.</P>
      <P>For example, whenever I should get annoyed or frustrated I would (if I 
      am not too unmindful) contemplate along these lines: Life is short, soon 
      we will all be dead. So what&#39;s the use of quarrelling or arguing with 
      anyone? What&#39;s the use of getting all heated up? No point at all. It is 
      better that I keep my peace. Arguing or getting heated up would not solve 
      the problem. It causes only more animosity and vexation. Thinking in this 
      way I can cool down, check myself from being carried away by strong 
      feelings, and relate more gently and skillfully with others. Of course, it 
      is not always easy and sometimes (perhaps many times) I do forget and get 
      carried away with rhetorics and emotions, but whenever I remind myself 
      about the brevity of life and the pointlessness of getting all fired up, I 
      can cool down somewhat and speak with more gentleness and restraint.</P>
      <P>Similarly, when I should be agitated or worried about something, I 
      would think what&#39;s the use of all these worrying and anxiety. Life will 
      take its natural course and death awaits each and everyone of us. No-one 
      in the world can escape death. Death is the great equalizer, the great 
      leveller. Therefore, while I am alive, it is better for me to live as best 
      I could, and that means living in accordance with the Dhamma, living 
      mindfully, from moment to moment, day to day, just doing the best I can, 
      one day at a time. Thinking in such wise too, I can check worries and live 
      more lightly and happily.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, we can consider that with or without worries, all of us 
      still have to grow old and die. So we might as well grow old without the 
      worries! That will be the smarter thing to do. Nobody will disagree that 
      we&#39;ll surely be better off without the worries. On the other hand, all the 
      worrying might even shorten our life, cause us to develop a premature 
      illness and die. Thinking in this way too, we can check our worries and 
      live happier lives. Thus, thinking about death in a skilful way can cause 
      us to be more tolerant and patient, kinder and gentler, both with 
      ourselves and others.</P>
      <P>Then we can also become less attached to our material possessions, less 
      greedy. Yes, when we can perceive deeply the brevity of life, and how no 
      matter how much we may have acquired we cannot take even one cent along 
      with us when we die, we can become less tight-fisted. We can loosen a 
      little and start to enjoy sharing and giving, loving and caring. We will 
      realize then that there is more to life than just accumulating and 
      hoarding wealth. We will like to be more generous, to share and to bring 
      joy and happiness into the lives of others. Bringing joy and happiness to 
      others is what makes life meaningful and beautiful. That is what counts. 
      Love and compassion can grow and flower in us like the beautiful blooms of 
      a tree. We can become truly beautiful people that are steeped in 
      compassion, responding from the heart without any discrimination of race, 
      sect, religion, social status, etc. Our life will take on a new shine and 
      we can then say we are truly happy and human. And when death comes we 
      shall have no regrets. We can die happily and peacefully, with a smile.</P>

      <P><B>When four mountains come a-rolling</B></P>
      <P>The Buddha once told a simile with regard to death to impress upon us 
      the need to live a meaningful life. He posed this question to King 
      Pasenadi: &quot;What would you do, O King, if you are told that four huge 
      mountains, one each from the north, south, east and west, are heading in 
      the direction of your kingdom, crushing every living thing in sight, and 
      there is no escape?&quot;</P>
      <P>King Pasenadi replied: &quot;Lord, in such a mighty disaster, the 
      destruction of human life so great, and rebirth as a human being so hard 
      to obtain, what else can I do save to live a righteous life and do good 
      deeds.&quot; The Buddha then drove home his point: &quot;I tell you, O King, I make 
      it known to you - old age and death are rolling in upon you. Since old age 
      and death are rolling in upon you, what are you going to do?&quot; The King 
      replied that under such circumstances, it was all the more urgent for him 
      to live a righteous life and do good deeds. He also acknowledged that all 
      the power, prestige, wealth and sensual pleasures which he was enjoying as 
      a king would, in the face of death, come to nought.</P>
      <P>So when we reflect wisely on death we will realize that wealth, power, 
      prestige and sensual pleasures are not everything. They cannot guarantee 
      us happiness. Many people have had them and still lived tempestuous and 
      unhappy lives. Some regretted the way they had ill-treated, down-trodden 
      or ruined others in the frenzied pursuit of their worldly ambitions. 
      Having reached the top, they found that the achievement was, after all, 
      not all that satisfying, even hollow and meaningless. Sometimes they 
      wished they had spent more time with their loved ones and friends, that 
      they had shown more care and tenderness. They regretted having neglected 
      their loved ones. Some people having attained a good degree of success, 
      changed their attitude in mid-course. They devoted more time to their 
      loved ones, friends and society and are prepared, for the greater good, to 
      forego their highest ambitions, to settle for less.</P>
      <P>If we were to read about how some rich and successful people made a 
      mess of their lives, we might learn a lesson from their mistakes. The 
      other day I read a book entitled, &quot;The World&#39;s Wealthiest Losers&quot;. I found 
      it quite an educational book. It was quite aptly titled. They were losers 
      in life despite their wealth. Yes, I learned quite a lot of Dhamma from 
      it, about how money and success do not guarantee their owners happiness. 
      Instead they were unhappy despite or because of their wealth and success. 
      Reading about how the rich and famous, such as Howard Hughes, Mario Lanza, 
      Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe and Aristotle Onassis, lived and died I do 
      not envy them.</P>
      <P>Glamorous personalities like Elvis and Monroe, died from an overdose of 
      drugs, living out the old adage: &quot;From rags to riches, and from riches to 
      emptiness.&quot; All their wealth and success could not bring them the 
      happiness they sought. Happiness still eluded them. They seemed quite 
      pathetic, consumed by tantrums, grief, fear and emptiness. Take the case 
      of one heiress, who inherited an astronomical fortune, married seven times 
      but could not find happiness. She told her biographer: &quot;I inherited 
      everything but love. I&#39;ve always been seeking for it, because I didn&#39;t 
      know what it was.&quot; Her first six marriages ended in divorce and her last 
      in separation. In the end, despite her massive wealth she was said to be 
      &quot;just a vulnerable sick woman riddled with loneliness.&quot; She died at age 66 
      with some friends by her bedside, but no husband. Such tragic tales, I&#39;m 
      sure, can be found in the East too.</P>
      <P>Of course, in making references to others, we do not mean to be 
      disparaging in a self-righteous way. But we just wanted to emphasize the 
      importance of having the proper values in life, to understand the nature 
      of true love and compassion. We also do not mean to denounce riches and 
      success, or to say that you should not strive for them. No, we are not 
      saying that. We do understand that we have to be practical and realistic. 
      We understand that if you are working in the world it is only natural you 
      will try your best to acquire as much wealth as possible. After all, if 
      you want to do good and help others, such as building charitable 
      institutions, hospitals and meditation centres and offering almsfood to 
      monks and the needy, you would need money. So we are not saying you should 
      not try as laypeople to enrich yourselves. But of course in acquiring 
      wealth, you should do so through honest means, without harming others.</P>
      <P>In other words, what we are emphasizing is the moral balance. We need 
      to have spiritual values, the appreciation that happiness is not in 
      self-indulgence but in sharing and caring. When we have the right values 
      we can live meaningfully and bring joy and happiness to all those who come 
      within the ambience of our lives. When we have understood the Dhamma, 
      especially the truths of impermanence, suffering and no-self, we will not 
      cling to fame or gain. We can live with humility and compassion, share our 
      wealth and success, and find joy in making others happy. But when we do 
      not have a deep understanding of what constitutes happiness - that true 
      happiness comes from a mind that is liberated from greed, anger and 
      delusion - then because we do not understand we can do the wrong things, 
      be sunk in a sensual mire and come to a miserable end. So it is important 
      that we contemplate well on life and death, and steer in the right 
      direction, the proper course.</P>

      <P><B>A sense of urgency</B></P>
      <P>Contemplating on death can also bring about what is called samvega in 
      Pali - a sense of urgency which can charge us with the energy to do all 
      the good we can before we die and, in particular, to practise meditation 
      to experience the deeper truths and understanding. The Buddha said most 
      people are running up and down the nearer shore; they are not seeking to 
      cross over to the other shore. The Buddha meant that we are all very much 
      entangled in sensual pursuits, in the mundane pleasures of life. We are 
      not seeking to go beyond to the supramundane - to go beyond life and 
      death, to taste the ambrosial nectar of immortal bliss, immortal Nibbana.</P>
      <P>What is this Nibbana? The Buddha said it cannot be described but must 
      be experienced by each one for himself or herself. But the Buddha did try 
      to give us some idea of what Nibbana is like. For example, he described it 
      as the unborn, unoriginated, unformed, unconditioned, the deathless, the 
      highest happiness, the greatest peace. Nibbana represents a state of no 
      arising and passing away, no birth or death. It is also described as a 
      blowing out of the fires of greed, hatred and delusion, the cessation of 
      mind and matter, the extinction of suffering [*9].</P>
      <P>A person who has attained the state of Nibbana, which can be realised 
      in the course of meditation, is said to be enlightened. An enlightened 
      person may be an arahant or a Buddha. The difference between an arahant 
      and a Buddha is that the former gains enlightenment by listening to 
      another enlightened person while a Buddha gains enlightenment by himself.</P>
      <P>An enlightened being is a person who can face the vicissitudes of life 
      with an even mind. Through the ups and downs, such as loss and gain, 
      success and failure, praise and blame, pain or pleasure, fame or 
      disrepute, he remains serene and unshakable. He remains this way not 
      because he is deluded or unfeeling, but because he is enlightened and 
      wise; he understands the true nature of existence, the nature of physical 
      and mental phenomena, the nature of their impermanence, insecurity and 
      absence of any core or essence that can be called a self in the ultimate 
      sense. If he does not crave for pleasure or is unaverse to pain, it is not 
      that he does not feel them. He feels them but understanding their true 
      nature he cannot be overwhelmed by them. He can take both pain and 
      pleasure as they come along with wisdom and equanimity.</P>
      <P>So too with the other worldly conditions such as praise and blame, and 
      loss and gain. If he is praised he does not get swollen-headed or 
      conceited. He is not elated. If he is blamed he is not upset or depressed. 
      It doesn&#39;t matter to him. He is steady and unperturbed because he knows he 
      has acted truly - without the subtlest taints of greed, anger and 
      delusion. He is motivated only by loving-kindness and compassion. He has 
      no desire even to harm an ant or a mosquito. His conscience is clear, his 
      mind is light and free. An arahant lives out his last life on this earth 
      and when he dies he undergoes no more rebirth. He goes out like a lamp. He 
      attains nirodha - cessation. He has parinibbana-ed - ie. he has attained 
      final Nibbana, the cessation of all existence, the attainment of the 
      Nibbanic element of supreme peace. Thus arahants during the time of the 
      Buddha had this saying:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><I>I delight not in life<BR>
        I delight not in death<BR>
        But I await my time<BR>
        mindful and composed.</I></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Another verse goes like this:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><I>Impermanent are all conditioned things<BR>
        Of a nature to arise and pass away<BR>
        Having arisen they then pass away<BR>
        Their (complete) calming and cessation is true bliss.</I></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Comtemplating on death can release us from the grip of the sensual 
      lure. We will not be deluded by material wealth but will channel our 
      resources towards a more fulfilling and rewarding life, with due regard 
      for the development of wisdom and compassion. We can be spurred to take up 
      meditation or, if we have already done so, to double our efforts to attain 
      the supreme goal of liberation from all suffering.</P>
      <CENTER>
      <P>** **</P>
      </CENTER>
      <P><B>Contemplation leads to understanding and acceptance</B></P>
      <P>Frequent contemplation on death - on how it is inevitable and that our 
      true property are our deeds - can spur us to live a good life such that 
      when we die we will have no fear of death. Furthermore when somebody dear 
      to us die, as inevitably all of us must, grief will not assail us as we 
      have understanding and acceptance. This is not because we are unfeeling or 
      have no heart. No, we have a heart, and a soft one too. We can feel deeply 
      but we also understand the nature of existence, and can accept that death 
      is very much woven into life.</P>
      <P>Explaining how the wise can accept death, the Buddha said: &quot;Seeing the 
      nature of the world, the wise do not grieve. Weeping and wailing will only 
      lead to more suffering and pain. It cannot bring back the dead. The 
      mourner becomes pale and thin. He is doing violence to himself and his 
      mourning is pointless.&quot; The Buddha said that the wise man who had truly 
      comprehended the nature of existence has &quot;pulled out the dart of grief and 
      despair.&quot; &quot;He has no clinging. Having obtained peace of mind, he has 
      passed beyond all grief. He is freed.&quot;</P>
      <P>So we should contemplate on the deeper aspects of the Buddha&#39;s 
      teachings so that we can face death without grief but with understanding. 
      The departed too would not want us to lose our self-control. They would 
      not want us to suffer a broken heart but to accept their departure 
      gracefully. Having taken a new rebirth, they are also no more present to 
      see us weeping. Our weeping and sorrow cannot help them in any way. So it 
      is futile. If we were to consider more deeply, we may see that our grief 
      is because of our attachment. We cannot bear the parting. But if we can 
      contemplate deeply and become wiser, we can accept the inevitable. Instead 
      of grieving, we can be brave. We can respond meaningfully, say by 
      resolving to live a noble and exemplary life in honour or in memory of a 
      loved one. A wise person would surely not want us to mourn for him. 
      Instead he or she would say: &quot;If you really want to do me honour or to 
      remember me by, then live a good life, do good deeds, be kind to your 
      fellowman......That&#39;s all I ask.&quot;</P>
      <P>When the Buddha was about to pass away, it was said that heavenly 
      flowers and sandalwood powder fell from the sky and sprinkled all over his 
      body in honour of him. And heavenly music too was heard. But the Buddha 
      indicated that such kind of honour was not what he wanted. &quot;It is not thus 
      that the Tathagatha is honoured in the highest degree,&quot; he said. &quot;But, 
      Ananda, whoever abides by the Dhamma, lives uprightly in the Dhamma, walks 
      in the way of the Dhamma, it is by such a one that the Tathagatha is 
      honoured in the highest degree. Therefore, Ananda, thus should you train 
      yourselves: We shall abide by the Dhamma, live uprightly in the Dhamma, 
      walk in the way of the Dhamma.&quot; And though we have said it before, we 
      would like to say it yet again: The Buddha&#39;s last admonition was: <I>
      Vayadhamma sankhara. Appamadena sampadetha</I>. All conditioned things are 
      subject to dissolution. Strive on with diligence (for liberation).</P>
      <P><B>No lamenting can touch the ashes of the dead</B></P>
      <P>In his previous lives, the Buddha as a bodhisatta (a Buddha-to-be), 
      also displayed no grief at the death of dear ones. The Buddha was able 
      with his psychic powers to recollect his past lives, and it was said that 
      in one life when he was a farmer, he did not grieve when he lost his only 
      son. Instead, he contemplated: &quot;What is subject to dissolution is 
      dissolved and what is subject to death is dead. All life is transitory and 
      subject to death.&quot; When he was asked by a Brahmin why he did not cry - was 
      he a hard-hearted man, has he no feeling for his son? - the bodhisatta 
      replied that his son was very dear to him, but grieving would not bring 
      him back. &quot;No lamenting can touch the ashes of the dead. Why should I 
      grieve? He fares the way he had to tread.&quot;</P>
      <P>In another life when he did not cry over his brother&#39;s death and was 
      accused by people of being hard-hearted, he replied that they had not 
      understood the eight worldly conditions that all beings faced, to wit, 
      loss and gain, happiness and unhappiness, praise and blame, fame and 
      disrepute. &quot;Because you do not understand the eight worldly conditions you 
      weep and cry. All existent things are transient and must eventually pass 
      away. If you do not understand this, and because of your ignorance you cry 
      and lament, why should I also join you and cry?&quot;</P>
      <P>In yet another life, the Bodhisatta shed no tear at the death of his 
      young and beautiful wife. Instead he reflected: &quot;That which has the nature 
      of dissolution is dissolved. All existences are impermanent,&quot; and taking a 
      seat nearby, he ate his food as usual, showing an exceptional ability to 
      live mindfully from moment to moment. The people who gathered around him 
      were amazed and asked how he could at such a time remain so calm. Did he 
      not love his wife who was so beautiful that even those who did not know 
      her could not help but brush away a tear? The Bodhisatta replied in verse:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><I>Why should I shed tears for thee<BR>
        Fair Sammillabhasini?<BR>
        Passed to death&#39;s majority<BR>

      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Such amazing accounts of the Bodhisatta&#39;s self-control is 
      awe-inspiring. It teaches us too to contemplate well and deeply on the 
      teachings, to understand the truth of impermanence and to accept the fact 
      of death. Perhaps then when we suffer the loss of loved ones, we too can 
      reflect as the Bodhisatta did and maintain our composure.</P>

      </CENTER>
      <P><B>Death is no stranger to us</B></P>
      <P>Another way to contemplate on death so as to overcome fear of it, is to 
      consider that it is no stranger to us. In this, our long wandering in 
      samsara, the never-ending round of birth and death, the Buddha said we 
      have died and been reborn innumerable times - so many are they that if we 
      were to collect all our bones together and had the bones not rotted, each 
      of the piles of our bones would rise up higher than the highest mountain! 
      So too, the Buddha said, the tears we have shed in samsara over the loss 
      of our loved ones was more than the waters in the four oceans.</P>
      <P>Truly, the Buddha said, we have suffered enough to be utterly wearied 
      of life, and to seriously seek the way out of this maze of suffering, the 
      way to the deathless Nibbana. But unfortunately, we have short memories 
      and cannot remember any of our many past lives. How could we when we 
      sometimes could not even remember what we did yesterday! And so we 
      continue to live complacently, without the sense of urgency to cultivate 
      the wisdom that can liberate us from all suffering. However, during the 
      Buddha&#39;s time, there were many monks, including of course the Buddha, who 
      could recollect their past lives. In our present age too, there have been 
      accounts of people who had an uncanny ability to recollect their past 
      lives. Francis Story and Dr Ian Stevenson had written books, documenting 
      quite a number of these cases.</P>
      <P>When we contemplate on rebirth we can benefit in two ways: </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>1. We can consider that death is, after all, no stranger to us. We 
        have met it many times before. So we need not face it with fear. We can 
        consider it as just another transition, a change from one life to 
        another.</P>
        <P>2. We can be motivated to find a way out of samsara, the round of 
        birth and death. We may study more deeply the teachings of the Buddha. 
        And we may strive harder to put them into practice, to develop dana, 
        sila and bhavana - generosity, morality and meditation.</P>

      <P><B>Momentary death</B></P>
      <P>In another way of looking at it, death is something we are experiencing 
      from moment to moment. For in the absolute sense, we are dying every 
      moment and being reborn the next. According to the Buddha, consciousness 
      is arising and passing away all the time. On the dissolution of one 
      consciousness, another immediately arises and this goes on and on, ad 
      infinitum, until and unless we realize ultimate Nibbana. Bodily phenomena 
      too are continuously arising and passing away. So what we have is just the 
      continuous arising and dissolution of mental and physical phenomena. This 
      is, in a way, a kind of death and rebirth which is occurring from moment 
      to moment. In Pali, it is called <I>khanika-maranam</I> - momentary death. 
      In the Path of Purification (Visuddhimagga), it is stated thus:</P>
      <P>&quot;In the absolute sense, beings have only a very short moment to live, 
      life lasting as long as a single moment of consciousness lasts. Just as a 
      cart-wheel, whether rolling or whether at a standstill, at all times only 
      rests on a single point of its periphery: even so the life of a living 
      being lasts only for the duration of a single moment of consciousness. As 
      soon as that moment ceases, the being also ceases. For it is said: `The 
      being of the past moment of consciousness has lived, but does not live 
      now, nor will it live in future. The being of the future moment has not 
      yet lived, nor does it live now, but it will live in the future. The being 
      of the present moment has not lived, it does live just now, but it will 
      not live in the future.&quot; (Translated by Nyanatiloka in Buddhist 
      Dictionary.)</P>
      <P>In this context, a being is but a conventional term. In the ultimate 
      analysis, it is just a series of consciousness arising and passing away. 
      One consciousness dies, another arises - that&#39;s all. And we call this 
      continuity or process a being. But in the ultimate sense, there is no 
      being - no unchanging soul or mind, but just this series of consciousness 
      arising and passing away, one consciousness conditioning the arising of 
      another.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the conventional death that we experience at the end of 
      one life-span is also not ultimate death. Another consciousness 
      immediately arises but in a new body or realm according to the rebirth one 
      has taken. Only when one has eliminated the mental taints of greed, hatred 
      and delusion will no rebirth come about. Contemplating thus, we can also 
      appreciate the nature of impermanence, suffering and no-self. And we can 
      take life and death in our stride.</P>

      <P><B>Food for thought</B></P>
      <P>Everytime you look at the newspapers and come across obituaries or 
      death announcements, do you give a thought to death? Do you pause and 
      contemplate the fact of your own mortality? Whenever death comes to 
      others, we don&#39;t feel much about it. The deceased may be a stranger to us. 
      The suffering is not ours and, besides, we have become quite numbed to 
      stories of death - they are reported everyday in the newspapers. Reading 
      about how people are killed, especially in a war, life seems so cheap. 
      There seems to be no respect for life. But when death strikes those close 
      to us, how do we take it? And when we face our very own death, are we 
      petrified with fear? Yes, although we know that death and tragedies are 
      occurring all around us, yet we are thunderstruck and are unable to accept 
      it when it actually happens to us.</P>
      <P>When we read the in memoriams in the newspapers, we can see that though 
      a person may have passed away for some years already, yet the pain of 
      separation suffered by the living ones is still very much there, as if it 
      had been inflicted only yesterday. Sometimes in their messages, spouses or 
      relatives openly expressed the sorrow they still felt and the tears they 
      still shed for their loved ones. We understand it is very human to feel 
      this way. But the Buddha also teaches us that, as human beings, we can 
      imbibe ourselves with the wisdom and strength to accept our loss and to 
      bear it stoically. It is not that the Buddha wants us to be unfeeling but 
      that he wants us to have the wisdom to accept the loss and to understand 
      the futility of our grief. Definitely he doesn&#39;t want us to pine away with 
      grief, to grow thin and frail, to lose all interest in life. Buddhists in 
      particular should understand this and thereby accept their loss stoically.</P>
      <P>If Buddhists need to put a message to go with an orbituary or in 
      memoriam in the newspapers, why not Buddhistic ones such as: &quot;Impermanent 
      are all conditioned things. Strive untiringly for the unconditioned 
      Nibbana&quot;; or meaningful contemplation on death such as: &quot;Just as the 
      dew-drop at the point of the grass-blade at sunrise very soon vanishes and 
      does not remain for long: just so is the dew-drop-like life of men very 
      short and fleeting. One should wisely understand this, do good deeds and 
      lead a virtuous life; for no mortal ever escapes death.&quot;</P>
      <P>Or if one wishes to be more personal, how about a message that goes 
      something like this: &quot;My dear, if you could know, you will be pleased to 
      know that the children are growing up beautifully. I have taught them the 
      Dhamma well, to treasure the precious values of love and kindness, wisdom 
      and understanding. I have taught them well not to ape the violence and 
      greed that often come across in mediums such as the TV and movies. As a 
      consequence, they are very gentle and loving to everybody. As for me, I 
      have been keeping my precepts and meditating. I am practising mindfulness 
      in everyday life and I go for retreats once or twice a year. I am quite 
      peaceful, and growing in the Dhamma. I try not to grieve for you; for you 
      and I have understood somewhat the Buddha&#39;s teachings - that it is futile 
      to grieve: it serves no purpose. And I know you wouldn&#39;t want me to grieve 
      either, but to live a good and exemplary life.</P>
      <P>&quot;Nevertheless there were times, I must admit, when I felt the pain, 
      when I missed you terribly, especially when I thought about the good times 
      we had, the happiness we shared together, your sweet smile and bright 
      eyes, the way you laughed and teased. Yes, when I got lost in such 
      nostalgia, I must admit I do feel like bursting into tears. But dear, I 
      can get a hold of myself. I can be mindful. I can watch the pain and 
      accept it. I can watch my thoughts and mood. I can reflect on the Buddha&#39;s 
      teachings and understand the futility of grieving. I can be happy and 
      count my blessings - at least we have had happy times together and there 
      are now the children to live for. I know my pain comes from my attachment 
      and lack of deep understanding of the nature of all existence. Thank 
      Buddha for teaching us mindfulness, for teaching us to live in the 
      present, to be happy from moment to moment, to count our blessings, to 
      bask in the happiness of a life well-lived.</P>
      <P>&quot;Well, I know this message is getting rather long. I realize too that 
      you will not be around to read it. But it does make me feel good to 
      express myself this way. I thank you for the happiness you have given me, 
      and I dedicate all the good deeds that I have done, and the good life I 
      now try to live, all that I dedicate to your sweet and loving memory. I 
      wish that you too, in whatever good rebirth you may have taken, may 
      continue to practise the Dhamma until you attain Nibbana, the cessation of 
      all suffering,&quot; and so on and so forth.</P>
      <P>Admittedly this is a rather long message and I have got somewhat 
      carried away. But what I would like to underscore here is the theme of the 
      message, one of understanding and acceptance. It is just to give an idea 
      of a Buddhistic message or expression. It can be shortened and put more 
      simply. Or, except for its pedagogic (ie. its teaching) purpose, a message 
      may not be needed at all. Such feelings are quite personal and can be kept 
      private. When one has understood the Dhamma well, one can just carry on 
      living a good life and be content.</P>

      <P ALIGN="center"><B><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#800000">A WORLD OF ANOMALIES</FONT></B></P>
      <P>Reading the newspapers and newsmagazines can give us much food for 
      reflection. Besides the orbituaries, there are grim reminders of suffering 
      all over the world, though we may have become quite numbed to it. There 
      are murders, robberies, rapes and wars, religious, ethnic, social and 
      political conflicts, pollution, diseases, starvation, poverty, tortures, 
      oppression, terrorisms, accidents, suicides and natural calamities such as 
      earthquakes, fires, floods and hurricanes. It is a long and depressing 
      list which can go on and on.</P>
      <P>At the same time, side by side with these news stories there are 
      pictures and advertisements showing happy people enjoying themselves, as 
      if without a care in the world. They are laughing and posing behind posh 
      cars, grand mansions, luxury hotel suites, bottles of alcohol, cigarettes, 
      perfumes, cosmetics, glamourous designer outfits and exquisite jewellery. 
      They are gorging themselves at food fests, beauty contests and fashion 
      shows with beautiful and sophisticated looking models parading on the 
      catwalk. The contrast is especially ironic when, say, you happen to see a 
      high fashion parade next to a heart-rending picture story of piteous 
      African children all skin and bones dying from sheer starvation.</P>
      <P>We are said to be a civilised people who abhor violence and the 
      inflicting of senseless pain on one another. Yet we have boxing 
      championships at which two brawny men would, for a sum of money, try their 
      utmost to bash out each other&#39;s brains to the roars of approval from the 
      crowd, not unlike the barbarous days of the Romans when gladiators fought 
      lions and each other for the entertainment of blood-thirsty spectators. We 
      have matadors that would infuriate, torture and kill a bull just for the 
      fun of it. And everybody, or at least the stadium-filled spectators, seems 
      to think it is fun too.</P>
      <P>Smoking and drinking have taken great tolls on the health of the 
      people, yet cigarettes and alcohol companies still insist on purveying in 
      every possible way, even through the sports arena, their products of 
      death. Smoking is ludicrously described as &quot;an encounter with tenderness&quot;! 
      and drinking is equated with success and prestige among many other things. 
      So-called developed countries are dumping their cigarettes and other 
      harmful products on Third World nations while curbing the consumption of 
      those products among their own people. In their inordinate greed for 
      wealth, companies would go to great lengths, not seeming to have any 
      qualms at all about what they say or do in the purveyance of their 
      products. The mass media such as newspapers and newsmagazines, which 
      accept and publish these advertisements because of greed for the huge sums 
      of money they bring in, cannot absolve themselves too from responsibility. 
      They have a basic human right to exercise a social conscience by declining 
      harmful advertisements but they choose not to do so.</P>
      <P>Looking at a glossy airline magazine, the picture of an elderly brewery 
      company chairman in Thailand caught my attention. Dressed in suit and tie 
      and with greying hair, he was proudly displaying, in his posh conference 
      room, a row of bottles of beer brewed by his factory. Just behind him was 
      an altar on which sat a gleaming Buddha image. One can see that the altar 
      was impressively and centrally located in the room. Now, the Buddha, as we 
      all know, had taught abstinence, and the fifth precept to which all 
      Buddhists subscribe, states: &quot;I take the precept to abstain from alcohol 
      and drugs which are a cause for heedlessness.&quot; It is hard, therefore, for 
      an observer to reconcile the mass production and distribution of alcohol, 
      which is considered a wrong kind of livelihood in Buddhism, with the image 
      of a Buddha, displayed as it were, so proudly in the room.</P>
      <P>Sulak Sivaraksa, a Thai social critic and activist, wrote in his book, 
      Seeds of Peace, &quot;It is a sorry fact that Siam has about 250,000 monks and 
      more than twice that many prostitutes. This speaks for a system that is 
      dysfunctional and has to be reexamined from the ground up. If we can 
      return to the beautiful roots of our Asian traditions, we will help create 
      a sane and functional model for living.&quot; In citing the latter two 
      examples, it is not our intention to pick on Thailand, but just to point 
      out anomalies. In point of fact, anomalies exist everywhere. Just as in 
      Thailand, they can be equally found in Buddhist Burma, Buddhist Sri Lanka, 
      our own or any other country. Nobody has a monopoly.</P>
      <P>Yes, we can go on and on with the list of contradictions that abound in 
      the world we live, but this much, we believe, would suffice to make our 
      point. Yes, are we not a kind of society with a split or schizophrenic 
      mentality? - like a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. We know what is unwholesome, 
      yet we condone and even encourage its proliferation. Apparently, we are 
      all willy-nilly caught in it, and we are hurled along with the tide. 
      Programmed and conditioned by the moguls of the advertising media, we 
      respond to their commands and messages. Buy this, buy that. Eat this, eat 
      that. Wear this, wear that. Do this, don&#39;t do that. This is rugged and 
      that is feminine. This is the in-thing and that is out. This is the great 
      way to live; it is the jet-set high society, the world of great fun and 
      entertainment.</P>
      <P>Forgive me if I may sound like a critical person, a bad sport, or a mad 
      monk standing on a soapbox declaring at the top of his voice that the end 
      of the world is nigh and threatening a decadent society with hellfire and 
      brimstones. But you might agree with me that it might not be a bad idea 
      if, now and then, we were to step back a little and look at the state of 
      the world and the state of our mind and the state of our life. Some wisdom 
      may yet arise from such contemplation. We can re-assess our position and 
      the direction we will like to go. Do we follow the crowd or do we break 
      ranks? If I may &quot;borrow&quot; a verse from Robert Frost: <I>&quot;Two roads diverged 
      in a wood and I - I took the one less travelled by. And that has made all 
      the difference.&quot;</I> Yes, when two roads diverge in your journey of life, 
      which one will you take? The one less travelled by - the path of 
      mindfulness and wisdom, of love and compassion? Please do think about it, 
      for it might well make all the difference.</P>

      <P>As we come to the end of our treatise on Loving and Dying, I should 
      make it clear that I do not at all claim to be an authority on living, 
      loving or dying. But I have tried to share some thoughts on the subject 
      with you, thoughts about how to live and die with love and understanding 
      all along the way. It is a subject which I have given, and shall continue 
      to give, much thought to. It is a subject which, I believe, should be of 
      interest to all of us - this question of life, love and death. Of course I 
      am not claiming to be wise and I know I have many shortcomings too. Just 
      like people who may mean well but still bungle along the way, I too am 
      bungling and falling as I go along the way. But each time I do pick myself 
      up, brush the dirt away, try not to lament or cry, set my sights once 
      again on that mountain peak that rises up into the sky, and carry on with 
      the journey of life.</P>
      <P>I do hope though that some of the thoughts I have shared here may have 
      been of some help to you, that they may have lighted up a little of your 
      way. If they should have given you a little inspiration and determination 
      to live and die with more love and understanding, I would be very very 
      happy. And if perchance parts of my writing should have offended you in 
      any way, I ask too for your forgiveness. As human beings we can only try - 
      to serve and to share. We mean well, and what little we, despite our 
      limitations, managed to contribute to a better society, it is a happy 
      thing. Whenever I look back, it will give me some joy and solace to know 
      that at least I have managed to do this much, even though it may only have 
      been a little.</P>
      <P>And when I die, perhaps I could say to Death: &quot;O Death, you may do your 
      worst now, for I have lived and loved, and I have done what little I could 
      for my fellow-beings.&quot; And before I slip quietly into the night, perhaps 
      you might yet see that faintest trace of a smile on my lips.</P>
