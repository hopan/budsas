      <P>I have written this book to share some thoughts on death with anybody 
      who may care to read it. Thoughts about how we can go about facing death - 
      with courage and equanimity. With dignity. And if you like with a smile. 
      Thoughts about how to cope with suffering, to live with wisdom and 
      compassion, or with as much of it as we can muster, until we die.</P>
      <P>But people generally do not like to talk about death. Whenever the 
      subject is broached, they might start to feel uncomfortable. It is 
      especially considered taboo on auspicious occasions such as a birthday or 
      a New Year to talk about death. It is as if mentioning the word, <I>death</I>, 
      on an auspicious occasion would mar that occasion and bring about bad luck 
      or an earlier death! Of course, I do not agree with such notions. To me, 
      it is just a superstition. I can understand, though, if people were to 
      consider it bad taste to talk about death on auspicious occasions. But I 
      think it is good and wise to reflect often on death and even on occasions 
      such as a birthday or New Year, perhaps even more so on such occasions. 
      Why? Because we can consider that we are not growing any younger but 
      older, that each year brings us but one year closer to the grave. During 
      such reflections we can take stock of our life, reassess our position and 
      see whether we are going in the right direction - the direction of wisdom 
      and compassion.</P>
      <P>As a monk, I constantly meditate on death. It reminds me to lead a more 
      meaningful life, not to waste my days away, though I must confess I still 
      fritter away precious time from time to time; for the mind, as you know, 
      can be very stubborn and lazy at times. Nevertheless by frequent 
      contemplation on death, I am reminded that I must find more time to 
      practise insight meditation so I can clean my mind of the defilements of 
      greed, hatred and delusion.</P>
      <P>The Buddha advised us to contemplate often on death, as often as daily 
      or every now and then. It will arouse in us <I>samvega</I> - the sense of 
      urgency to strive harder to eradicate the suffering that comes from a 
      defiled mind and deluded mind. I like to talk about death. It&#39;s my 
      favourite subject. (Am I morbid? It&#39;s all right. Go ahead. You can say I&#39;m 
      morbid and whatever you like. It&#39;s fine with me. I don&#39;t mind. People i.e. 
      not only me but also you, must be allowed their basic human right to 
      express their views and feelings as long as they do so in a legitimate, 
      sensitive, non-imposing and non-violent way. No one should get angry with 
      a person on account of his expressing his views in such manner, though 
      unfortunately, sometimes we forget and get all heated up.) But coming back 
      to the subject, I have always pondered, I have always wondered and am 
      still wondering: &quot;Why do we live? Why do we die? What is it all about? 
      What is it all for? To what purpose? For what end?&quot;</P>
      <P>Many answers have been proffered, no doubt. And I&#39;m sure there are many 
      people who would be happy to offer me answers to these questions that have 
      been asked ever since man began to think and ponder. But I cannot say I 
      have been satisfied with all the answers that have been given. I am still 
      seeking. These days I have become a Buddhist monk and taken up meditation. 
      I subscribe to the Buddha&#39;s five precepts of not killing or harming, not 
      stealing or cheating, not committing sexual misconduct such as adultery, 
      not lying, and not taking alcohol and drugs. As a monk though I observe, 
      in addition, celibacy and other rules for monks.</P>
      <P>I cannot say I have as yet found all the answers to my questions, but I 
      have found some solace, some comfort in the Buddha&#39;s dispensation. I can 
      relate to the Buddha&#39;s teaching of mindfulness and loving-kindness. And 
      I&#39;m still meditating. Perhaps I might find all the answers one day. It 
      will be nice if I can. But if I could not, it also doesn&#39;t matter. What 
      matters is that I have tried. I will be glad even if I were to die trying. 
      For at least I have tried. That way my life would still be meaningful, at 
      least to a certain extent. And along the way, of course, I will try to 
      spread as much good cheer and happiness according to my disposition and 
      ability.</P>
      <P>I have tried in this book to share my limited understanding of life and 
      death. I feel that we need to discuss the question of death frankly. We 
      should not be afraid to bring up the subject. Otherwise, how can we 
      discuss and learn? When we can openly discuss and learn and understand, 
      then it is good; for we can come to terms with death. We can know better 
      how to deal with it. This is important; for the simple reason that all of 
      us must die. There is no escape. And if we cannot relate to death now, how 
      can we relate to it when we are lying on our deathbed, about to breathe 
      our last? Might we not be overcome with fear and confusion then? So it&#39;s 
      better to learn all about death now. It will surely stand us in good 
      stead. Then we need not fear anymore. We&#39;ll have confidence, and when 
      death comes we can go with a smile. We can say: &quot;Death, do your worst. I 
      know you and I can smile.&quot;</P>
      <P>I have written this book in a forthright and engaging a manner as 
      possible. I have tried not to be too academic or stilted. I wanted you to 
      enjoy reading this book, to chuckle over those parts that might elicit a 
      chuckle, and to pick up a thing or two which you might find helpful in 
      living, loving and dying. Also I have written not so much as from a monk 
      to a layperson but as from one human being to another human being. So I 
      have written quite freely with the purpose of communicating, of reaching 
      out to the heart. Though I cannot say how far I have succeeded or flopped! 
      Only you will be the best judge of that.</P>
      <P>As I&#39;m a Buddhist monk, readers will find that the contents contain a 
      lot of Buddhist values and concepts. Of course, some values, such as that 
      of love and compassion, are universal. They belong to no one religion but 
      to all. All religions teach love and compassion. They are all good 
      religions. But it&#39;s we, the followers, who do not follow. So we kill and 
      maim and hurt in the name of religion. Who&#39;s to be blamed but ourselves! 
      Not the religions or their founders who always preached love, wisdom, 
      mercy, forgiveness and compassion. If we can awaken to our ignorance, then 
      we can love truly. We can live as brothers and sisters with tolerance, 
      patience and understanding, with love and compassion.</P>
      <P>I wrote this book mainly for Buddhists. But non-Buddhists too might 
      read and find some benefit, some common areas of agreement, appreciation 
      and understanding. At the very least, they would know the Buddhist point 
      of view, the Buddhist approach and understanding. It&#39;s good to know each 
      other&#39;s viewpoints; it leads to more tolerance, understanding and 
      appreciation of each other&#39;s approaches and beliefs. There is no desire on 
      my part at all to convert anybody. That should be very clear. Let 
      everybody practise their own religion and let them do so well; for as has 
      been well put by Nobel peace laureate, the Dalai Lama, compassion is, 
      after all, the essence of all religions.</P>
      <P>I have tried to share my understanding to the best of my ability. But I 
      have no doubt that there will be some shortcomings here and there. Or some 
      areas where there may be differences of interpretation or understanding. 
      You may not like or agree with certain things I say. Or you may not like 
      the way I put it. You might think it is improper, flippant, insensitive, 
      sentimental, abrasive, distorted, absurd, or whatever. It is all right. 
      This is natural. As long as there are even two persons, there will be some 
      disagreements. You can just reject those things you do not agree with, 
      throw them out, so to speak. You need not have to accept everything I say. 
      Why should you? Of course you have a good mind of your own, and you can 
      (and must) think and decide for yourself. We can agree to disagree, 
      without getting upset or angry. We can agree to disagree and still remain 
      good friends. Can we not? That is the most wonderful thing, the 
      quintessence of mental maturity. It is for each of us to decide sincerely 
      and honestly for ourselves what we can relate to and what we cannot. We 
      need not believe everything or anything.</P>
      <P>The Buddha himself said it&#39;s better that we carefully consider, 
      investigate and verify for ourselves before accepting anything. Even the 
      Buddha&#39;s own words too should come under the same intensity of scrutiny. 
      After all, the Buddha made no exception whatsoever. He never believed in 
      blind faith. He never told us to simply believe what he said and to simply 
      reject what others said. But he told us to investigate, practise and 
      verify for ourselves. If we find that a certain teaching is good, that it 
      is wholesome and leads to the eradication of greed, hatred and delusion, 
      then we can accept it. If not, we should reject it. It&#39;s excellent advice. 
      And, therefore, taking a cue from the Buddha, I always like to say: 
      Believe nothing. But I think, practise and verify for yourself. That&#39;s to 
      me the best and safest approach. But as for any mistakes on my part in the 
      writing of this book, I do apologise and ask for forgiveness.</P>
      <P>May all beings be happy. May we all find the wisdom and happiness that 
      we seek, each in our own way. And happy reading!</P>

      <P>One day when I die, as I must, I&#39;d like to die with a smile on my lips. 
      I&#39;d like to go peacefully, to greet death like a friend, to be able to say 
      quite cheerfully: &quot;Hello Death, Goodbye Life.&quot;</P>
      <P>I can imagine myself having a conversation with death. Perhaps it might 
      go this way: &quot;Hello Death! How are you? I have been waiting for you a long 
      time. All my life I have been anticipating you. Are you coming for me at 
      long last? Is it time for me to go already?</P>
      <P>&quot;Yes, yes, Death I am coming. Be patient. I&#39;m ready. Can&#39;t you see I am 
      smiling? Since a long time ago I have been planning to welcome you with a 
      smile. Yes, Death, I understand. You don&#39;t have to apologise. I know 
      you&#39;ve got a job to do. I hold nothing against you. No hard feelings. It&#39;s 
      nothing personal, I understand.</P>
      <P>&quot;As I have said, Death, all my life I have been waiting for this 
      moment. To see whether I can meet you with a smile. To see whether I 
      could, at least, inspire in death, if not in life. You are now giving me 
      this opportunity and I thank you for it.</P>
      <P>&quot;Yes, I have heard a lot about you. That you wait for no man. That you 
      come like a thief in the night. That you&#39;ll bargain with nobody. That 
      you&#39;ll not take no for an answer.</P>
      <P>&quot;Death, it&#39;s all right. I&#39;ll come with you gladly. I&#39;m tired. This body 
      is like a broken shell. It had seen better days. It has outlived its use 
      and time. As you can see I&#39;m already almost dead. And I have been enduring 
      all this pain, trying to smile at all these many visitors calling on me. 
      Death, to tell you the truth, you should have come earlier. After all the 
      pain, you are a welcome respite, like a godsend. But enough of this talk. 
      Death, let&#39;s not dally. Let&#39;s go. Come, hold my hand.&quot;</P>
      <P>And I&#39;d go, as I have always dreamt, with a smile on my lips. What a 
      beautiful way to die! All the people who have gathered around me need not 
      cry. They can be happy because they can see I&#39;m smiling. They&#39;ll know that 
      I&#39;m all right. Death is nothing to be afraid of. Treat death like a 
      friend. Be ever ready to say hello to death and goodbye to life.</P>
      <CENTER>
      <P>** **</P>
      </CENTER>
      <P>Of course no one is spared from death. All of us have to die. As the 
      Buddha said: &quot;Life is uncertain but death is certain&quot;. While we live we 
      suffer the separation that comes with the death of a loved one. Both my 
      grandparents have died. I do not remember my grandfather. He died when I 
      was very young. But I do remember my grandmother. She was very kind to me. 
      She was also very poor. She preferred to live in the countryside while my 
      parents resided in town. I remember once when she visited us, I asked her 
      for five cents. She immediately took out her purse, dug out five cents and 
      gave it to me. In those days, there was purchasing power even in five 
      cents: you could get an ice-ball or a glass of iced drink with five cents. 
      If you drink the coconut water served by the Indian man you could even 
      have two glasses for five cents! And for five cents too you could get five 
      sweets.</P>
      <P>My father died when I was 10. I remember visiting him for the last time 
      one night at the General Hospital as he lay there dying from tuberculosis 
      and other complications. I remember my mother telling him: &quot;Ah Beh, this 
      is your son Johnny come to see you.&quot; My father couldn&#39;t speak. He had an 
      oxygen tube inserted in his nose. He seemed to look at me weakly. I was 
      young. I didn&#39;t know what death was about then, though I know better now. 
      My poor mother suffered the most. She had seen so many deaths and had a 
      most difficult life from young. Definitely, life was no bed of roses for 
      her.</P>
      <P>One of my brothers died while still a baby. Another died at 23 together 
      with his fiancee. It was tragic. They drowned. I can still remember seeing 
      their bodies in the mortuary. My mother was wailing her heart out. It was 
      very painful for her to lose a beloved son in such a tragic way. I was 
      quite stunned and just didn&#39;t know what to make out of it all. I was 16 
      then. I tried to appear nonchalant, casual. I kept away the tears. I spoke 
      and behaved as if nothing had happened, as if death was to me an everyday 
      affair, and there was no need to grieve. I made light of it, trying to put 
      on a cool exterior.</P>
      <P>But in private I cried. I cried bitterly. And after the funeral I went 
      back to the cemetery. I cycled there with a cangkul. I dug the ground and 
      planted flowers around the grave of my brother and his beloved&#39;s. I carved 
      on his wooden cross the words: &quot;Greater love than this no man hath that he 
      should lay down his life for his friend&quot;, as he had died while trying to 
      save his fiancee. And I spoke to God. I asked Him: &quot;Lord, why do you do 
      this to me? Why do you take away my brother? Is it your will, your desire? 
      Then if it is, let your will be done. I accept it.&quot; For you see, I was a 
      good Christian then. And God&#39;s will must precede all others. It must not 
      be questioned. Though as a Buddhist now, I believe I understand a little 
      better. Yes, no God took away my brother. If we accept life we must accept 
      death. Death is part and parcel of life. As the Buddha said, it is 
      ignorance that makes the world of suffering go round, and we fare on from 
      life to life according to our deeds. Good begets good and bad begets bad. 
      I must confess I can relate better to the Buddha&#39;s way of looking at 
      things.</P>
      <P>Later in life I saw more deaths. As a journalist, I had seen bodies - 
      people who died from accidents, gang-fights, suicides, samsu poisoning, 
      etc. I wrote dramatic, touching or tragic stories about how people died. 
      There was the man who kissed his little daughter goodbye and then shot 
      himself in the head. Then there was a young couple who was found in a 
      suicide pact on a hotel bed. The girl died from the poison they took; her 
      boyfriend survived. And there was the notorious robber gunned down by 
      police on a New Year&#39;s day. He was a marked man, who could not live to see 
      the end of the first day of a new year. But for me it was just another 
      story. I never thought very deeply about death then. I was quite numbed by 
      it all. All I wanted was to get the best story for the front page of the 
      newspaper. There was little feeling or compassion in me for the poor 
      victims. I was quite a hard-hearted and selfish person then, just 
      interested in my own well-being.</P>
      <P>Still much later on, as a monk, I encountered deaths - this time with 
      more feeling and compassion. When I visited the sick, I could feel 
      sympathy for them. I tried as best as I could to console. To the 
      Buddhists, I recited the suttas, the Buddhist scriptures. I told them what 
      the Buddha said: &quot;The body may be sick but let not the mind be sick.&quot; We 
      may not be able to do much for the body but we can do something about the 
      mind. We can keep it steady even when we are sick. We can be mindful. We 
      can watch the rise and fall of the pain, how it comes and goes in waves. 
      We can understand the nature of suffering. We can meet it and learn from 
      it. It is there as a test - of how well we have understood the nature of 
      life, how well we have understood that there is no permanent self here but 
      only constant change of arising and passing away, like the ceaseless 
      flowing of a river; how well we have understood that it is our ignorance, 
      craving, attachment, anger, fear, etc, that are the cause of our 
      suffering.</P>
      <P>In that understanding, we can rise up to meet the pain. We can take it 
      in our stride. We can remain calm and cool. Without even the slightest bit 
      of depression. Yes, we can smile, even at our pain. We can say: &quot;Hey pain, 
      you are really trying to do me in. Are you not? Another person might 
      succumb to you but not me. I have been training and steeling myself for 
      you. The Buddha teaches that I should respond without anger or aversion. 
      So I&#39;m trying to respond to you now without anger or aversion. I 
      understand that with mindfulness and peace in my heart, I can rise above 
      you. I can smile at you. You teach me that life is suffering. But you also 
      teach me that I can rise above you.&quot; And you can smile at the pain. You 
      will feel immediately better.</P>

      <P>As I&#39;m writing now, I recall that just yesterday a fellow monk died. He 
      had been suffering from terminal cancer for eight months. When I was by 
      his side at the hospital a few days before his death, he was in pain. I 
      tried to feed him some broth but he could not eat. He looked quite gaunt 
      and grim. He could hardly speak. The cancer had ravaged his body and it 
      was no easy task for his mind to bear up. I urged him to note or observe 
      the pain as he would do in normal meditation, to remain as calm and 
      equanimous as possible. He was a staunch meditator and I am sure he 
      meditated to the very end.</P>
      <P>I remember another occasion when I visited a kind old man who had 
      leukemia. He too was in pain. It showed on his face. There were beads of 
      sweat on his forehead and face. I took a towel and gently wiped away his 
      sweat. I whispered into his ear and tried to soothe him. This man too was 
      a meditator and again I reminded him to maintain mindfulness, to observe 
      the pain as calmly as possible. I was happy when the look of pain 
      disappeared from his face. Shortly after, his relatives came and I left 
      him. A few hours later he died. I was glad I was able to help him a little 
      before he expired.</P>
      <P>Although there is happiness in life, there is also suffering. The 
      happiness seems so fleeting - gone in no time only to be replaced by 
      sorrow and discontent. Life itself, because it ends in death, is a 
      tragedy. Someone once said life is like an onion: you peel it crying. The 
      Buddha says birth is suffering because it leads inevitably to decay and 
      death. We should understand this well. If we accept life we must accept 
      death. If we want to cry when somebody dies, then we should also cry at 
      his birth. For the moment a baby is born the seed of death is in him. But 
      we are happy when a child is born. We laugh and we congratulate the 
      parents. If we understand birth - that it must lead to death - then when 
      death comes we should be able to face it with a smile.</P>
      <P>Seeing how people die in pain, their body wracked by disease, and 
      seeing how all life must end in death (a fact that is driven home to me 
      every time I went for funeral chanting), two resolutions arose in my mind: 
      First, when the time comes for me to die, I want to die with a smile on my 
      lips. I want to be able to be very mindful and serene. In other words I 
      want to keep my wits about me. I want to be able to smile at my pain no 
      matter how excruciating it may be. I want to be able to smile at all the 
      visitors that may call on me. I want to be able to smile at all the kind 
      doctors and nurses who attend upon me. I want to be able to smile at my 
      fellow patients and to help in whatever way I can in the hospital, whether 
      to inspire or to console.</P>
      <P>Instead of the doctors and nurses asking me how I am, I want to ask 
      them: &quot;How are you doc? How are you Sister? How is your day today? You 
      know, you are doing a great job. We are very lucky to have you. Please 
      keep up the good work. Thank you very much!&quot; And to my Buddhist visitors, 
      I will speak Dhamma [*1]. I&#39;ll say: Look at me. I&#39;m half-dead. Finished! 
      You know, it&#39;s not easy to meditate when you are half-dead. So while you 
      are still healthy, make the most of it. Meditate! Practise the Dhamma! 
      Have no regrets later. Don&#39;t wait until you become fatally ill. It will be 
      too late then. But if you have been doing your meditation practice now, 
      then when you fall sick it won&#39;t be so difficult to face the pain. You can 
      observe and even transcend it.</P>
      <P>You know, the Buddha tells us that everything is impermanent. If we 
      meditate hard enough, we can understand the fact of impermanence more 
      deeply, such that we will not be so attached to this mind and body. We 
      will know for certain that this body is not ours; this mind too is not 
      ours. Understanding, we will be able to let go. We will not be so attached 
      to the gross sensual pleasures of life. We can live more wisely. We can 
      grow old gracefully. And we need not fear death.</P>
      <P>The Buddha says suffering is inherent in life. And we must learn how to 
      live with it and to transcend it. Only by applying mindfulness in our 
      daily life and by meditating can we penetrate the truth of suffering. When 
      we have understood suffering deeply, we will strive to remove the cause of 
      it, which is our craving, our attachment to life, to the sensual lure of 
      pleasant sights, pleasant sounds, pleasant smell, pleasant tastes and 
      pleasant touch. We will try to purify our mind and heart of all 
      defilements.</P>
      <P>According to the Buddha, when our mind is purified of greed, hatred and 
      delusion, we will overcome all suffering. We will never again respond with 
      attachment or aversion to anything. Instead there will be only wisdom and 
      compassion in us. Just this is the end of suffering. Clinging no more we 
      can never suffer. Even physical pain brings no mental suffering as the 
      mind does not respond with aversion or anger. The mind can be calm and 
      peaceful. There is acceptance and understanding. And when we die with this 
      kind of wisdom and peace, the Buddha says that will be the end of 
      suffering. No more rebirth, no more coming back to this cycle of birth and 
      death. If we do not take on any new birth, there will be no decay and 
      death together with its attendant suffering. Finished! The curtain falls! 
      This mass of suffering is extinguished. And we can then say, just as the 
      saints of old had said, &quot;Done is what is to be done. Lived is the holy 
      life.&quot;</P>
      <P>Of course, right now we may still be far from the goal. But as they 
      say, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. So I&#39;m an 
      optimist. Yes, I&#39;m a Buddhist and an optimist. (Who says a Buddhist is a 
      pessimist?) And I believe that every step we take on the path of 
      mindfulness shall bring us one step closer to the goal - the goal of 
      Nibbana, the end of all suffering. And being an optimist, I like to think 
      that we will reach it sooner rather than later.</P>
      <P><B>Saying it with flowers too</B></P>
      <P>And so as I&#39;m lying on my hospital bed, I&#39;d like to speak Dhamma to all 
      those who call on me, or to anybody who cares to listen. And furthermore, 
      I can send flowers to all my friends out there. I might include a card 
      with a message that can go something like this: &quot;Hello there! How are you? 
      Do you like these flowers? Are they not beautiful? Do you have time to 
      pause and appreciate the beauty of a flower and breathe in its fragrance? 
      And when you look at a flower, do you also see the shining eyes of your 
      loved one or your child? And do you feel and understand their hopes and 
      their fears? Or are you too busy, too preoccupied with your own worldly 
      plans and ambitions, your pursuit of fame and wealth?</P>
      <P>&quot;Have you considered well the nature of impermanence, my friend - how 
      all must fade and die? And how, while we are alive, we ought to live 
      meaningfully so as to have no regrets later. By the way, like the flower 
      that is fading, I too am dying. But I&#39;m sending you good wishes. May you 
      be well and happy! I hope you do find time for your loved ones and for the 
      practice of meditation. You know, making money, acquiring luxuries, 
      enjoying sensual pleasures is not everything. They may feel good for a 
      while, but actually being kind and loving is more important: it will give 
      you more satisfaction and happiness. Forgive me for preaching such 
      platitudes but do give some heed to the words of a dying person. Allow him 
      to say his piece. Yes, while you are alive, you should try to spread as 
      much good cheer and happiness as possible. Forgive everybody. Do not 
      harbour any grudges or consider anybody your enemies. Always remember, 
      life is short and soon we will all be dead. And love is giving, not 
      taking. Love gives without attaching any conditions. Love expects no 
      return. Try to cultivate this beautiful kind of love. Be happy!&quot; And I&#39;ll 
      end with a PS - &quot;Take good care. You need not visit me. But you can be 
      happy for me. For I&#39;m smiling and I&#39;m happy that I can die with a smile on 
      my lips. Cheerio and good luck!&quot;</P>
      <P>And if I could not speak because I was too ill, then still I could 
      smile to show that everything was fine, that the disease was only getting 
      my body and not my mind. In that way one can inspire even when one is ill. 
      People might then appreciate the Dhamma more and practise even harder. Of 
      course, if I am addressing my non-Buddhist friends, I must not impose my 
      religious views upon them. I can express my views but in no way must I 
      impose it upon them. Just as I would not want them to impose their views 
      on me, so too must I not impose my views on them. We must give due respect 
      to each other&#39;s religious views and have loving-kindness for each other. 
      In this way, there will be peaceful co-existence.</P>

      <P ALIGN="center"><B><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#800000">COPING WITH DISEASE - THE RIGHT ATTITUDE</FONT></B></P>
      <P>We should not look on disease and suffering as something which will 
      destroy us completely, and thereby giving in to despair and despondency. 
      On the contrary, we (i.e. in the case of Buddhists) can look upon it as a 
      test of how well we have understood the Buddha&#39;s teachings, how well we 
      can apply the understanding we have supposedly learnt. If we cannot cope 
      mentally, if we break down, it shows our understanding of the Dhamma, our 
      practice, is still weak. So, in this way, it is a test and an opportunity 
      for us to see how well we have mastered our practice.</P>
      <P>Then also, disease is an opportunity for us to further enhance our 
      practice of patience and tolerance. How can we practise and develop 
      paramis [*2] (perfections) such as patience if we are not tested, if we 
      are not put under difficult and severe conditions? So, in this way, we can 
      look at the disease as an opportunity for us to cultivate more patience.</P>
      <P>We can also look at health as not just the mere absence of disease but 
      the capacity to experience a disease, and to learn and grow from it. Yes, 
      such a novel definition of health comes from certain medical experts, such 
      as Dr Paul Pearsall, of the Sinai Hospital, Detroit, USA. Seeing how 
      disease can never be completely eradicated and how we have eventually to 
      succumb in one way or another, these doctors have come up with a 
      definition of health that can help us to adjust to disease when it comes. 
      It is true, isn&#39;t it? - that no matter how many sophisticated machines, 
      procedures and drugs we may come up with, people still succumb to cancer, 
      AIDS, heart disease and a host of other ailments. Ultimately there is no 
      escape. We have to understand and accept the fact, so that when it comes 
      and we have to go down, we can go down gracefully. No doubt, we will treat 
      the disease as best we can, but when despite our best efforts, we fail and 
      the disease continues to progress, we have to accept and reconcile with 
      the inevitable.</P>
      <P>In the final analysis, it is not how long we live but how well we live 
      that counts, and that includes how well we can accept our disease, and 
      finally how well we can die. In this regard, Dr Bernie S. Siegel, in his 
      book, Peace, Love &amp; Healing, wrote:</P>
      <P>&quot;Exceptional patients don&#39;t try not to die. They try to live until they 
      die. Then they are successes, no matter what the outcome of their disease, 
      because they have healed their lives, even if they have not cured their 
      diseases.&quot;</P>
      <P>And he also said:</P>
      <P>&quot;A successful life is not about dying. It is about living well. I have 
      known two-year-olds and nine-year-olds who have changed people and even 
      entire communities by their ability to love, and their lives were 
      successful though short. On the other hand, I have known many who lived 
      much longer and left behind nothing but emptiness.&quot;</P>
      <P>So it can be quite wonderful after all that our life can be healed even 
      though our diseases may not be cured. How? Because suffering is a teacher 
      and if we learn our lesson well, we can become surprisingly better 
      persons. Have we not heard accounts of how people after having gone 
      through great suffering, emerged changed and better persons? If they had 
      been impatient, selfish, arrogant and thoughtless before, they might 
      become more patient, kind, gentle and humble. Sometimes they remarked that 
      the disease was a good thing for them - it gave them an opportunity to 
      reconsider their lifestyle and the more important values in life. They 
      come to appreciate their family and friends more, and they now value the 
      time they spend with their loved ones. And if they were to recover, they 
      would find more time for their loved ones, and to do the things that are 
      really more important and meaningful.</P>
      <P>But even if we were to succumb to the disease we can still learn and 
      grow from it. We could understand the precariousness of life and how true 
      the Buddha&#39;s teaching was - that there is an essential flaw in life. We 
      could become kinder and more appreciative of the kindness we have received 
      from people. We could forgive those who had hurt us. We could love more 
      richly, more deeply. And when death comes, we can die with acceptance and 
      peace. In this way, we can say that our life is healed because we are 
      reconciled with the world and we are at peace.</P>

      <P>** **</P>
      </CENTER>
      <P><B>We can meditate</B></P>
      <P>When we are sick and bedridden, we need not despair. We can meditate 
      even when we are in bed. We can observe our mind and body. We can obtain 
      calmness and strength by doing breathing meditation. We can observe our 
      in-breath and out-breath, knowing as we breathe in and out. This can give 
      us a calming effect. Or we can observe the rising and falling of the 
      abdomen as we breath in and out. Our mind can follow the rising and 
      falling, and become, as it were, one with it. This too can give us 
      calmness. And from such calmness, understanding can arise. We might see 
      the transient and dissolutary nature of all phenomena, and be able to 
      reconcile with the fact of impermanence, unsatisfactori-ness and no-self. 
      If we have learnt mindfulness or Vipassana [*3] meditation, we can pass 
      our time quite easily. There are many objects we can observe in any 
      posture, whether lying down, sitting, walking or standing. We can know our 
      posture as it is, and feel the sensations that arise in our body. We can 
      observe them with a steady and calm mind. And, of course, the mind is also 
      a subject for observation. So we can also observe the states of our mind. 
      All can be observed - sadness, depression, restlessness, worry, thoughts - 
      and they would all pass, giving way to equanimity, peace and wisdom. 
      Wholesome and unwholesome states will come and go. We will be able to 
      watch them all with understanding and equanimity.</P>
      <P>Sometimes we can radiate <I>metta</I> (loving-kindness). Again and 
      again we can wish for all beings:</P>
      <P><I>May all beings be well and happy.<BR>
      May they be free from harm and danger.<BR>
      May they be free from mental suffering.<BR>
      May they be free from physical suffering.<BR>
      May they take care of themselves happily.</I> [*4]</P>
      <P>In this way too, we can pass our time quite happily even if we are 
      bedridden. We can radiate metta to the doctors, nurses and 
      fellow-patients. We can also send our metta to our loved ones, relatives 
      and friends. Moreover, we can reflect on the Dhamma from time to time, 
      recollect what we have read, heard or understood. Reflecting thus, we can 
      respond to our suffering with wisdom and equanimity.</P>
      <P>The instruction of the Buddha was to cultivate the mind, to meditate, 
      and to do so even when we are sick. In fact, it is at such times that we 
      need to make even more effort to summon up our mindfulness. Who knows, 
      Nibbana or the highest wisdom, may be attained even as we breathe our 
      last! In the scriptures, the Buddha cited the case of a person who was 
      sick - afflicted with painful bodily feelings, grievous, sharp, racking, 
      distracting, discomforting that drained the life away. But that person was 
      not disheartened. He felt <I>samvega</I> - a sense of urgency to strive 
      even in his last hours. &quot;He makes effort accordingly,&quot; the Buddha said. 
      &quot;His mind being intent on Nibbana, he realizes with his own person the 
      supreme truth, he sees it by penetrating it with wisdom.&quot;</P>

      <P>I&#39;d like to tell you about a brave yogi who died peacefully from lung 
      cancer with the word, Nibbana, on her lips. Her name is Kuai Chan and she 
      passed away on December 18, 1992 at her home in Kuala Lumpur. She was 43. 
      Her husband, Billy, told me how she coped with the disease. Finding the 
      account most inspiring, especially for yogis (meditators), I asked him for 
      permission to relate it in this book, and I thank him for agreeing to it.</P>
      <P>Kuai Chan was first diagnosed with breast cancer in April 1989. At that 
      time she had already practised Vipassana meditation for about a year. She 
      took the diagnosis calmly. &quot;My wife accepted that it was her kamma [*5],&quot; 
      said Billy. &quot;She did not blame anybody or anything. She was not bitter nor 
      did she fall into any depression. She was remarkably steady and remained 
      quite so till her death.&quot; Kuai Chan underwent an operation to remove the 
      affected breast. Then after three months she had to be operated upon again 
      when the cancer cells were found to be still growing in the area. After 
      that she underwent radio- and chemo-therapy with minimal side-effects. 
      Throughout her treatment for her breast cancer, and in the last six months 
      of her life after she was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, she 
      declined to take any pain medication. &quot;She didn&#39;t want any painkillers,&quot; 
      said Billy. &quot;Even when the pain was excruciating, she refused to take any 
      paindrugs, not even a panadol. She was a very determined person, very 
      strong and admirable.&quot;</P>
      <P>Her decision to go without the pain medication was because she wanted 
      to keep her mind as clear and alert as possible. She was a yogi, and all 
      yogis value their mindfulness. They wouldn&#39;t want any drugs that can dull 
      their mind and impair their meditation. So if they can take on the pain 
      they would do so. Kuai Chan was prepared to face the pain, so she declined 
      the painkillers. She only agreed to the radio- and chemo-therapy for her 
      breast cancer because they might have led to a cure. But later when she 
      had lung cancer and was told that it was terminal, she declined the radio- 
      and chemo-therapy recommended by a hospital for alleviating her 
      suffocation. And when a doctor offered to administer pain medication, such 
      as morphine, she rejected it too.</P>
      <P>Billy said that in her first bout with the breast cancer, Kuai Chan had 
      little problem with the pain she felt after the operation. As a yogi, she 
      was able to note the pain quite well and it would disappear. But the lung 
      cancer was a real ordeal for her. The pain was terribly acute at times but 
      still she refused drugs. There were times she just collapsed and lay 
      prostrate on the floor when the pain struck. But still she held on. She 
      also had a wracking cough which persisted for many days and nights. Billy 
      was by her side and when she could not sleep night after night, he tried 
      to soothe her pain and cough by rubbing ointment, massaging and other 
      traditional remedies. He took her to see Chinese physicians and obtained 
      many kinds of herbs and brewed them for her to drink.</P>
      <P>Billy said it was Kuai Chan&#39;s faith and meditation that enabled her to 
      face her suffering with a remarkable degree of serenity and composure. 
      Both of them had meditated with Venerable Sujiva at a Retreat in Taiping 
      in 1988. Subsequently Kuai Chan continued to attend regular Retreats at 
      the Venerable&#39;s Santisukharama hermitage at Kota Tinggi, Johor.</P>
      <P>When she was diagnosed with lung cancer after a coughing spell in July 
      1992, the doctor gave her one month to live. Showing Kuai Chan and Billy 
      the x-ray, he pointed out how the cancer had spread all over the lungs. He 
      even expressed surprise that Kuai Chan could still be walking around and 
      looking quite healthy, given the condition of her cancer-ravaged lungs. 
      But the doctor didn&#39;t know that Kuai Chan had a mind of steel. She 
      survived for six months. For her then it was not so much a battle to stay 
      alive as to die with dignity. When she and Billy saw me at the Wisdom 
      Centre in Petaling Jaya where I was visiting in July, they asked what 
      could they do. I told them: What could a yogi do but meditate! If I were 
      her I would meditate to the very end, I said. They were encouraged and 
      Kuai Chai was determined then to spend the rest of her days meditating in 
      her home. Billy said he would support her all the way.</P>
      <P>But she didn&#39;t reckon the pain could be so terrible. She told Billy she 
      never knew there could be such pain. It was especially severe in her lower 
      back, burning and cutting into her. She summoned all her mental strength 
      to note the pain but still she would lose out. It was too much. There were 
      times when she could only lay there helpless without being able to note 
      the pain anymore. She was sheerly enduring. But she would not take any 
      paindrugs. She consulted her meditation teacher Ven Sujiva who advised her 
      to do metta (loving-kindness) and in-breath out-breath meditation to 
      soothe the pain when she could not tolerate it anymore. This gave her some 
      relief. Coming out from such relief, she could continue her vipassana 
      meditation. One day after three weeks of battling with persistent pain, 
      she had a unique experience. She told Billy that while noting the sharp 
      pain, she observed it becoming finer and finer until it vividly 
      disappeared. She said she felt as if all her senses were cut off, as if 
      there was no nama-rupa (mind and body) at that moment, that her mind and 
      body had disappeared together with the pain. She told Billy she felt that 
      this was like a Nibbanic experience, and she felt a great joy came over 
      her. After that experience, she never encountered that kind of 
      excruciating pain anymore.</P>
      <P>Ten days before her end, Billy admitted her to a private hospital as 
      she was having difficulty breathing. The doctors put her on oxygen. X-rays 
      showed that the cancer cells had spread further, aggravating the 
      suffocation. That was when radio- and chemo-therapy was suggested, not as 
      a possible cure but merely to alleviate the condition. But Kuai Chan 
      didn&#39;t want her mind to lose its clarity, and so rejected the suggestion. 
      After five days she asked Billy to take her home as she felt there was no 
      longer any reason for her to stay in the hospital. Billy installed an 
      oxygen tank in their home, took her back and put her on the oxygen to 
      alleviate her breathing difficulty. For the next five days from December 
      13 to her death on Dec. 18, she seemed to be in some kind of sleep, waking 
      up only now and then. Two days before her death, she could still remember 
      her daughter&#39;s 17th birthday which fell on Dec. 17. She reminded Billy to 
      boil two eggs for their daughter and to give her a red packet, which he 
      did.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 18 she woke up at about 9am with a smile. She asked: &quot;Have I 
      been sleeping?&quot; Billy replied: &quot;Yes, it&#39;s been five days already. Don&#39;t 
      you know?&quot; She was surprised. She appeared happy and was smiling. She said 
      she didn&#39;t need to take herbal medicines anymore. She again remembered her 
      daughter&#39;s birthday, and although Billy told her he had already given 
      their daughter a red packet as instructed, she told him again: &quot;Give her 
      another ang-pow on my behalf.&quot;</P>
      <P>At about 2pm, Billy said, Kuai Chan tried to say something to him but 
      was too weak to speak. Billy reminded her to maintain a detached frame of 
      mind, not to worry about him and the children, and to feel free to go 
      peacefully. He said they had discussed this many times before, that if she 
      should be cured it is good; but if that is not possible, it is all right 
      also: she should be able to go gracefully, understanding the law of kamma, 
      that all of us must separate one day.</P>
      <P>At 3pm when her son, aged 15, returned from school and announced to 
      her: &quot;Mother, I am back,&quot; she understood although she could not speak. She 
      nodded her head to indicate that she knew.</P>
      <P>At about 3.30pm, Billy said, Kuai Chan managed with some effort to say 
      very distinctly in Cantonese, &quot;Woh yap niphoon&quot;, which literally means &quot;I 
      have entered Nibbana,&quot; which means to say she believed she had realized or 
      experienced Nibbana. And she pointed to her abdomen. That was her last 
      words, and she passed away peacefully about 45 minutes later. Billy said 
      Kuai Chan, in her meditation, usually observed the rising and falling 
      motion of the abdomen that occurred with every in- and out-breath. She 
      found the abdominal rising and falling a good object to place her mind 
      upon, and she used to encourage other yogis to stick to that object too. 
      Whatever phenomena in the body or mind one applies one&#39;s mindfulness and 
      concentration upon, one would eventually see the arising and dissolution 
      of the phenomena and come to understand their impermanence, unsatisfactory 
      and no-self nature. Such understanding can climax in the attainment of 
      Nibbana, a state of cessation of sufferng. Defilements of greed, hatred 
      and delusion are totally eradicated when Nibbana is experienced at the 
      arahant level. [*6]</P>
      <P>Billy said that as her end approached, Kuai Chan&#39;s face took on a kind 
      of radiance, and when she spoke, her eyes were bright and clear. At about 
      4.15pm, Billy noticed that she had stopped breathing. &quot;She looked very 
      peaceful, very serene. She passed away very peacefully,&quot; said Billy.</P>
      <P>At about 4pm that day, a Dhamma friend, Lily, who was staying about 25 
      km away in Petaling Jaya, had a sudden desire to radiate metta 
      (loving-kindness) to Kuai Chan. Lily sat down to meditate, sending out 
      thoughts of metta to Kuai Chan. And she said she had a &quot;crystal-clear&quot; 
      vision of Kuai Chan, who looked serene. When she stopped her meditation, 
      she looked at the clock. It was 4.15pm, at about the same time Kuai Chan 
      had passed away.</P>
      <P>Dying the way she did, it is clear that Kuai Chan had a good death. 
      What better way to go than this - with her mind intent on Nibbana. Who can 
      say what unique experience she might have undergone? Only she can know. 
      But one thing is certain, her mind was even, to the last, inclined to 
      Nibbana. I would like to think that she had attained her Nibbana. If she 
      had not done so in this life, I would think that with her mind, being so 
      firm and resolute, she would have undergone a good rebirth as a human 
      being or deva (a celestial being) and would attain her cherished goal in 
      that life.</P>
      <P>As a Buddhist, she had instructed Billy to give her a very simple 
      funeral, devoid of superfluous rites and rituals. According to her desire, 
      Billy arranged for her cremation the following day. Several Buddhist 
      monks, yogis and friends recited Buddhist suttas. It was all very simple, 
      as she had requested. Billy collected her ashes and had them strewn at the 
      bodhi tree at their teacher&#39;s meditation hermitage in Johor.</P>
      <P>Recollecting their life together, Billy said Kuai Chan was the best 
      wife he could ask for: &quot;We were married for 22 years and she stood by me 
      through thick and thin, through my many trials and tribulations. She had a 
      cheerful and bright disposition. She was always loving and caring. Even 
      when she was ill she was marvellous. She never complained. She was not 
      depressed. There was no anger or bitterness in her. She remained calm and 
      steady. She could still smile and laugh. She accepted all her suffering 
      with grace. She would say that it was only her body that was sick but not 
      her mind. Her mind was still fine and healthy. Her concern too was not for 
      herself but for others. She said that if she could live ten years longer, 
      she would do more Dhamma work. She was concerned too about me and the 
      children.</P>
      <P>&quot;In fact, she took her suffering better than I did. I could not bear to 
      see her in so much pain. I tried to get her all the best herbs in the hope 
      of a cure or some respite. Sometimes I asked why all this should happen to 
      her. And I thought: Let her live 10 years more and I 10 years less. Let me 
      give her 10 years of my life. But of course that&#39;s not for us to say. It&#39;s 
      kamma that has the last say.</P>
      <P>&quot;She used to tell me: &quot;It&#39;s my kamma, Billy. It&#39;s all right. I do not 
      know what I might have done in my past lives. I must accept my kamma.&quot; 
      Sometimes she would say: &quot;I&#39;m so sorry I give you all this trouble, Billy, 
      all this suffering. You know, Billy, I owe you a lot in this life.&quot; I 
      would tell her not to say like that. She doesn&#39;t owe me anything, I said. 
      We are husband and wife, are we not? - and she has been a great wife to 
      me. We have gone through thick and thin together, and now in her hour of 
      need, I shall be by her side. We shall sink or swim together, I told her, 
      I assured her.</P>
      <P>&quot;At other times she would tell me: &#39;Billy, this is the true teaching, 
      the true path, I am very convinced of that,&#39; and she reminded me not to 
      neglect my practice of meditation, not to be complacent but to practise 
      hard. We had been searching for some time for a teaching that we could 
      relate to. And when we came across Buddhism and Vipassana meditation in 
      1988, we took to it. You know, we used to discuss the Dhamma together 
      every night over a cup of tea. We had a great relationship.&quot;</P>
      <P>Kuai Chan&#39;s cousin, Sati, once asked her whether she had any fear of 
      the cancer, and she said no, she was not afraid of the disease. She was 
      prepared to take on the pain without drugs. She was truly a heroic yogi, 
      one who in the face of great odds, still persevered in her practice of the 
      Dhamma. She made me wonder if I, as a monk, were to be in her condition, 
      to have cancer, would I be able to bear up that much, to have that much 
      courage and endurance? She is truly an inspiring example, a teacher by 
      example to us all. I must thank Billy for foregoing his privacy to share 
      with us this inspiring account so that we too can be encouraged in our 
      practice and be more determined to strive harder.</P>
      <P>Billy asked me to put on record his gratitude to Ven Sujiva and other 
      monks and yogis for all the kind assistance they have given him and Kuai 
      Chan. Fellow yogis from the Buddhist Wisdom Centre, PJ, had especially 
      given much moral support and encouragement to Kuai Chan throughout her 
      sickness. &quot;I do not know how to express my gratitude to all the people who 
      had helped us. Please tell them I wish to thank them all, to say: &quot;Thank 
      you. Thank you very much for everything you all have done for Kuai Chan.&quot;</P>
      <HR>
      <P><B>Notes:</B></P>
      <P>[*1] Dhamma is what is. It is seeing things as they are. It is the 
      teaching of the Buddha. The Buddha, in effect, taught: <I>&quot;Life is 
      suffering but I have found the way out of this suffering, and I will show 
      it to you.&quot;</I> And the Buddha exhorted the people to practise generosity, 
      morality and meditation.</P>
      <P>[*2] The ten paramis are giving, morality, renunciation, wisdom, 
      energy, patience, truthfulness, resolution, loving-kindness and 
      equanimity. All bodhisattas (ie. those aspiring to be Buddhas) have to 
      cultivate these paramis. All Buddhists have to cultivate these paramis to 
      a certain degree too before they can gain enligtenment under the 
      dispensation of a Buddha.</P>
      <P>[*3] Vipassana is Insight or Mindfulness meditation. In Vipassana, 
      meditators employ mindfulness to observe the nature of mental and physical 
      phenomena, perceiving eventually their characteristics of impermanence, 
      unsatisfactoriness and no-self. For a simple introduction to Vipassana, 
      and the practice of another kind of meditation, called metta or 
      loving-kindness meditation, see &quot;Invitation to Vipassana&quot; and &quot;Curbing 
      Anger Spreading Love&quot; both written by the same writer.</P>
      <P>[*4] Details on the practice of metta meditation can be found in the 
      book, &quot;Curbing Anger Spreading Love&quot;.</P>
      <P>[*5] Kamma is the natural law of cause and effect, or action and 
      result. It works on the principle that good begets good and bad begets 
      bad. So if we have done something bad in a previous life, the result of 
      the evil deed may take place in this life. For example, one who kills a 
      lot, will, if reborn as a human, have a short life. For a good explanation 
      of kamma see &quot;The Buddha and his Teachings by Narada&quot;, Buddhist Missionary 
      Society (BMS), Malaysia; page 333ff.</P>
      <P>[*6] As an experience of the cessation of conditioned phenomena during 
      meditation, Nibbana can be experienced at four stages of sainthood. 
      Although the experience of Nibbana as cessation of conditioned phenomena 
      is the same at all four stages, Nibbana having only one &quot;taste,&quot; that is 
      the &quot;taste&quot; of peace, the results in terms of eradication of mental 
      defilements are, however, different at each of the four stages.</P>
      <P>At the first stage of a sotapanna (stream-winner), greed and hatred are 
      dramatically weakened but not totally eliminated. These two defilements 
      have been weakened to the extent that the sotapanna could no more break 
      the five precepts of not killing (even an insect), not stealing or 
      cheating, not committing sexual misconduct such as adultery, not lying, 
      and not taking alcohol and drugs. At the second stage of a sakadagami 
      (once-returner), the defilements are further weakened. At the third stage 
      of an anagami (non-returner), sensual desire and hatred/anger are 
      completely eliminated. But there is still a subtle trace of ignorance and 
      desire of a non-sensual nature, ie. desire for rebirth in the non-sensual 
      brahma heavenly realm. At the fourth stage of an arahant (a full saint), 
      all desire/greed and ignorance are eliminated. The arahant lives his last 
      life, there being no more rebirth for him.</P>
