      <P>Earlier I said that when I saw the sick, the dying and the dead, two 
      resolutions arose in my mind. One is to be able to take pain and death 
      with a smile, to be able to remain mindful and composed to the very end. 
      Now I wish to touch on my second resolution. Yes, seeing how we human 
      beings and in fact all living things, are subject to so much suffering, I 
      feel that the least we can do while we are alive is to contribute to the 
      alleviation of the suffering around us.</P>
      <P>Many people are serving humanity in wondrous ways. Mother Theresa, for 
      example, has devoted her whole life to the caring of the needy and 
      destitute. Many people and organisations are involved in providing social 
      services to the sick, the handicapped, the starving, the old folks, the 
      dying and others. All great religious teachers exhort their disciples to 
      be charitable. Jesus Christ said: &quot;Love your neighbour as yourself.&quot; And 
      he praised those who fed the hungry, gave drink to the thirsty, clothed 
      the naked, gave shelter to the destitute, visited the sick and the 
      imprisoned, saying that &quot;Inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the 
      least of these my brothers, you have done it unto me.&quot; There is a similar 
      saying in the Koran where Prophet Muhammad said God might say to a person 
      on Judgment Day: &quot;I was hungry but you did not feed me. I was sick and you 
      did not visit me.&quot; And when asked by the bewildered person how could that 
      be, God would reply: &quot;Such a one asked for bread and you did not give it 
      to him. Such a one was sick and you did not visit him.&quot;</P>
      <P>In Buddhism although we do not believe in a Creator God, we believe in 
      goodness and we are exhorted not to harm or kill even an animal or an 
      insect. We believe in the law of kamma - that good begets good and bad 
      begets bad. And so we are enjoined to always adhere to the good: to 
      abstain from killing, stealing, cheating, sexual misconduct, lying and 
      taking alcohol and drugs. We are to train ourselves to reach a stage where 
      we will do good just for the sake of doing good, and not because of the 
      fear of hell or the anticipation of rewards. We will then do good because 
      we delight in doing good and are naturally inclined to good. In other 
      words, we can&#39;t help but be good. Goodness and us are one.</P>
      <P>The Buddha enjoined on his followers to be charitable and caring. In 
      giving, he said every little effort counts. Even throwing some crumbs into 
      the water to feed fishes is praised by the Buddha. Once, when some monks 
      failed to attend on a sick monk, the Buddha personally bathed the sick 
      monk and admonished the others, saying: &quot;Whoever attends on the sick 
      attends on me.&quot; The Buddha urged kings to rule with compassion. He advised 
      them to weed out poverty which is one of the contributory factors to theft 
      and other crimes. A man of peace, the Buddha once intervened when two 
      countries wanted to go to war over a stretch of river water. The Buddha 
      asked them: Which is more important - the water or the blood of human 
      beings that will flow as a result of a war. The warring parties saw the 
      folly of their quarrel and withdrew without a fight.</P>
      <P>One of the most benevolent of kings who came under the influence of the 
      Buddha&#39;s teachings was Asoka, who reigned in India during the 3rd century 
      B.C., about 200 years after the death of the Buddha. Renowned for his 
      humanitarianism, Asoka&#39;s generosity and kindness extended even to animals. 
      He was reputed to have provided doctors for the treatment of both man and 
      beast. He built public parks, resthouses for travellers and hospices for 
      the poor and sick. Although a staunch Buddhist, Asoka gave his people full 
      freedom of worship and even supported other religious sects. In one of his 
      famous edicts engraved on rocks, he said he &quot;wishes members of all faiths 
      to live everywhere in his kingdom...(He) honours men of all faiths, 
      members of religious orders and laymen alike, with gifts and various marks 
      of esteem.&quot; He desired all faiths to be honoured because &quot;by honouring 
      them, one exalts one&#39;s own faith and at the same time performs a service 
      to the faith of others...Therefore concord alone is desirable...(and he, 
      Asoka) desires men of all faiths to know each other&#39;s doctrines and to 
      acquire sound doctrines...&quot;</P>
      <P>Asoka saw his role as a benevolent father and he regarded his people 
      like his children, saying that he desired for them &quot;every kind of 
      prosperity and happiness.&quot; The Buddha, could he have witnessed Asoka&#39;s 
      reign, would have been filled with joy at seeing his teachings being 
      adhered to so diligently by the great king. H.G. Wells, in his Outline of 
      History, said that among all the kings that had come and gone in the 
      world, &quot;the name of Asoka shines, and shines almost alone, a star.&quot; 
      Surely, all governments will do well to study and apply Asoka&#39;s humane 
      approach in governing.</P>
      <P>And if we too are to follow the Buddha&#39;s teachings, then we would, like 
      Asoka, work in our own way to alleviate suffering and spread peace and 
      happiness. The Buddha himself had set us the finest example, having 
      dedicated his whole life to showing people the way out of suffering. Yes, 
      the Buddha was concerned not only with alleviating suffering but also with 
      eradicating it completely. And so after attaining enlightenment he spent 
      the whole of his 45 remaining years teaching people the way to the 
      complete eradication of suffering. He taught the path of mindfulness.</P>
      <P>The Buddha saw that only through a radical approach can one eliminate 
      suffering. Although taking care of the sick, healing diseases, providing 
      food and material aid to the needy are part and parcel of the treatment of 
      suffering, the Buddha wanted to attend to more than just the symptoms: he 
      sought for a total cure from the disease of suffering. So he meditated on 
      the whole question of life and death. And he saw that to solve the problem 
      at the very root level, we need to do a complete overhaul of the mind. 
      Suffering is essentially mental. When there is physical pain, a person 
      normally reacts to it with grief, fear and depression. But a meditator, 
      the Buddha said, can tolerate the physical pain in such a way that there 
      is no mental suffering. In other words he does not react to the pain with 
      grief, worry, depression, aversion, anger and so on. Instead, he can 
      respond with calmness and equanimity. He can be cheerful, and even comfort 
      and encourage others!</P>
      <P>So the Buddha saw the problem as essentially mental. If we can rid our 
      mind of greed, anger and ignorance (of the nature of life), the Buddha 
      said we can totally overcome and eradicate mental suffering, such as worry 
      and anxiety, sorrow and lamentation. As for physical suffering, we have to 
      concede that it is unavoidable as long as we have this body. All of us 
      know as a fact that nobody can escape from old age, disease and death. But 
      the Buddha said once the mind is purified of all defilements of greed, 
      anger and so on, then physical suffering does not frighten us anymore. One 
      becomes unshakable. Nothing can upset one anymore, not even the most 
      excruciating pain that diseases such as cancer can bring. One&#39;s mind can 
      remain cool throughout. Thus, when the Buddha&#39;s disciple Anuruddha, was 
      once asked how he could remain cool when he was grievously ill, he replied 
      that it was because he had well mastered his mind through his practice of 
      mindfulness as taught by the Buddha.</P>
      <P>Finally too, the Buddha taught that for such an accomplished person who 
      had eliminated greed, anger and ignorance, there is no more rebirth. When 
      he dies that is his last life. He has attained the state of Nibbana - 
      perfect peace. Not undergoing rebirth he can never undergo old age, 
      disease and death. Just that, the Buddha said, is the end of suffering.</P>
      <P ALIGN="center">** **</P>
      <P><B>Alleviating suffering</B></P>
      <P>While we are striving to make a complete end of suffering, we should, 
      along the way, help to alleviate suffering in whatever way we can. Yes, it 
      is obvious that there is no shortage of suffering in the world. Many 
      people are suffering in various ways. If we read the newspapers we can 
      find suffering all over the place. People quarrel, fight, kill, rob, lie, 
      cheat, and inflict pain in various ways on each other. Out of ignorance we 
      hurt each other. Furthermore, calamities, accidents, mishaps, starvation, 
      disease abound. And always disease, old age, and death are dogging our 
      every step.</P>
      <P>Yes, the world is laden with suffering. Why should we add to it? 
      Shouldn&#39;t we instead try to alleviate the suffering? Even if we cannot do 
      much we can do a little. Every little effort counts. As somebody puts it: 
      Nobody made a greater mistake than to do nothing because he could do only 
      a little. Each one of us can do something, according to our inclination 
      and ability. For a start we could start being nicer. For instance, we can 
      check our anger. Everytime we are angry we cause pain to ourselves and 
      others. But if we can just check our anger and cultivate tolerance and 
      patience, love and compassion we can be nicer people, and that can go 
      quite a long way to help spread good cheer and happiness.</P>
      <P>In other words, we must start by cleaning up our own minds of 
      unwholesome and negative contents of greed, hatred and delusion. 
      Corresponding to our ability to check these unwholesome states, love and 
      compassion will develop in us. We can be kinder in our relationship with 
      the people close to us and around us. We can try to speak more lovingly 
      and gently, and avoid all harsh and rough speech. We can become more 
      considerate and caring. If we are only concerned with our own well-being, 
      then we will not be able to love very well. To love well we have to 
      consider not so much our own well-being but that of others. So we have to 
      ask ourselves. Do we love enough? Do we care enough? If we do not, then we 
      cannot act to alleviate suffering. For it is out of real love and 
      compassion that we can act.</P>
      <P>A Meditation Master once said if you want to know whether you have 
      loved well, you should approach your loved one one day and gently take her 
      hand in yours. Look deeply into her eyes and ask her: &quot;My dear, have I 
      been loving you properly? Do I love you enough? Am I making you happy? If 
      I am not, can you please tell me what is lacking so that I can change and 
      love you better?&quot; If you ask her gently with true love and care, then she 
      might cry. And that, the Master said, is a good sign. For it meant you 
      have touched a chord in her heart. And there can be communication between 
      you.</P>
      <P>And so she might tell you between sobs how thoughtless you had been at 
      times. For example, she might say: &quot;You don&#39;t open the car door for me 
      anymore. You used to do that when you first courted me and even during the 
      first year of our marriage. You would see to it that I was properly seated 
      and then you would very gently close the door for me. Nowadays you don&#39;t 
      do that anymore. You just get into the car first and start the engine. I 
      have to open the door myself and get in quickly. Otherwise you would start 
      moving off even before I had closed the door! I felt like crying when you 
      behaved this way. What had happened to the gentle and thoughtful person 
      that I married?&quot;</P>
      <P>And she might continue: &quot;You don&#39;t hold my hand anymore when we cross 
      the road. You just walk ahead and expect me to follow you. So too when you 
      walk into the restaurant. You don&#39;t open the door and invite me to go in 
      first. You don&#39;t pull out the chair for me to sit on. You don&#39;t ask me 
      what I&#39;d like to eat but you just order what you like to eat. You don&#39;t 
      buy me any more pretty dresses. You don&#39;t buy any presents for my parents, 
      not even on festive occasions. And although you may remember to give me 
      presents on my birthday, you don&#39;t include one of those lovely birthday 
      cards with beautiful and heartfelt messages. In short, you don&#39;t do all 
      the nice little things you used to do when you first courted and married 
      me. If I knew you were going to change like this, I would have second 
      thoughts about marrying you. I have been wondering whether you really love 
      or care for me anymore!&quot; And she may go on in this vein, citing a list of 
      her unhappiness. She might even sob louder and you may be taken aback, for 
      you hadn&#39;t known she was taking all these things to heart, that she was 
      missing all the nice little things you used to do for her, that she missed 
      your little but important demonstrations of care and affection.</P>
      <P>Of course, it is also possible that you too might have some legitimate 
      grievances. So this might be a good time to have it out, but in a very 
      gentle way. You might say: &quot;Oh, I am so sorry for the heartless and 
      thoughtless way that I have behaved, my dearest. Believe me, I truly am. 
      Please forgive me. I will make it up to you from now on. I promise I will 
      not be so careless in future. I will take good care of you. I will resume 
      to do all the little things which I have neglected to do for you. I didn&#39;t 
      realise you miss them so much.</P>
      <P>&quot;But dear, please do not get angry at what I&#39;m about to say. As much as 
      I am at fault, you should also know that there were some things you used 
      to do for me that you never do now. For example, you know that I love the 
      kangkung fried in sambal belacan that you used to cook for me. But 
      nowadays you never cook that anymore, not to mention the spicy tomyam soup 
      and several other dishes. You know, the old saying about the way to a 
      man&#39;s heart is through his stomach is still quite pertinent.</P>
      <P>&quot;In the old days you used to wake me up with a smile and a gentle peck 
      on the cheek but you never do that anymore. Sometimes you wake up rather 
      late and I have to prepare my own breakfast or eat at the office. You used 
      to be waiting at the door for me when I returned from work and asked me 
      how my day was. You were really interested to know then and you were very 
      sympathetic and comforting whenever I had a bad day. But nowadays, you 
      don&#39;t seem to care about how I am faring anymore, whether I have been 
      having a good day or a hard time. You would be watching the TV, yelling at 
      the kids, or be at the beauty parlour or doing something or other. When I 
      called out: &quot;Hello dear, I&#39;m back,&quot; you sometimes snapped at me and said 
      things which are not very endearing.&quot; And so on and so forth.</P>
      <P>And so both of you can have a heart-to-heart exchange. Communication is 
      very important in a relationship. Is it not? Relationships break down when 
      there is no communication, and both parties keep their grievances to 
      themselves, privately nursing them in their heart. But when there is 
      communication there can be understanding. A pouring out of the heart 
      between two parties can lead to understanding and love. If two persons 
      care enough and value their relationship, then they can communicate and 
      take corrective measures whenever necessary. In that way, the relationship 
      can become more strong and beautiful with each passing day.</P>
      <CENTER>
      <P>** **</P>
      </CENTER>
      <P>Each one of us needs to contribute in our own way, in whatever way we 
      know how. In my case, for example, I, as a monk, can contribute by sharing 
      what little Dhamma knowledge I know, what little understanding I may have. 
      I can encourage people to practise meditation and guide them a little 
      along the way. I can urge people to be loving and caring, considerate and 
      patient, and so on. Of course we are not perfect and there are times when 
      we ourselves fail to deliver. The saying that it is easy to preach but 
      most difficult to practise what one preaches is very true. So I should be 
      the first to acknowledge my own shortcomings and to accept corrections. I 
      ask though that people, in judging me or others, would consider mitigating 
      factors such as good intention. We mean well and we do not mean to hurt. 
      But because of our own defects, unskilfulness, impatience, intolerance, 
      conceit, etc, we may hurt others even as we mean well. But if a person is 
      magnanimous, he or she can understand and be forgiving. The ability to 
      forgive is a very wonderful quality, which is why the saying To err is 
      human; to forgive divine has been coined.</P>
      <P>Avail yourself to giving and you yourself will know best how you can 
      contribute. All of us have different skills, talents and aptitudes. Our 
      conditions and circumstances may differ. So each of us can only contribute 
      in our own way, according to our conditions and inclinations. The 
      important thing is that we try; we do something according to our ability. 
      As we have said, every little bit counts and as time goes on, we may find 
      that actually we have done quite a fair bit. And that is cause for us to 
      rejoice. Of course it doesn&#39;t mean that we should rest on our laurels. 
      There is still more work to be done. So we keep trying; we keep forging 
      ahead.</P>

      <P>To die well we must live well. If we have lived well we can die well. 
      There will be no regrets. We can go peacefully, content that we have done 
      what we could, that along the way we have spread understanding and 
      happiness, that we have lived according to our principles and commitment 
      to the ideals of love and compassion.</P>
      <P>Love is understanding. Love does not judge or condemn. Love listens and 
      understands. Love cares and sympathises. Love accepts and forgives. Love 
      knows no barriers. It does not segregate and say: I am a Theravadin and 
      you are a Mahayanese or Tibetan. It does not say: I am a Buddhist and you 
      are a Christian, a Muslim, a Hindu. Or I am a Chinese; you&#39;re a Malay, an 
      Indian, a Eurasian. Or I&#39;m an Easterner and you are a Westerner; or I&#39;m 
      Malaysian, you&#39;re Japanese, an American, a Burmese, a Thai and so on.</P>
      <P>Love transcends all barriers. Love sees and feels that we are all of 
      one race, the human race. Our tears are all the same; they are salty, and 
      our blood is all red. When there is this kind of love and compassion, we 
      can empathise with another human being. We can see that we are all 
      travelling in the same boat upon the stormy sea of life. We are 
      fellow-sufferers in samsara, the endless faring-on in the round of birth 
      and death. We are brothers and sisters.</P>
      <P>When we can see and feel this, then all barriers of race, religion, 
      ideology and so on will fall away. We can reach out with a heart of pure 
      love. We can understand and feel another&#39;s suffering. Compassion will 
      swell and fill our breast. And in whatever we say or do, this love and 
      compassion will come across. It will soothe and heal. It will contribute 
      to peace and understanding.</P>
      <P><B>The man and the scorpion</B></P>
      <P>Love goes hand-in-hand with compassion. When we have a loving heart, 
      compassion arises easily in us. Whenever we see somebody suffering, we 
      feel an urge to reach out to ease that person&#39;s suffering. Compassion has 
      this quality of desiring to eliminate suffering. It can be especially felt 
      when we act spontaneously to remove or ease another&#39;s suffering. A story 
      here will help to clarify the point: A man saw a scorpion drowning in a 
      puddle of water. A spontaneous desire to save arose in his heart, and 
      without hesitating he stretched out his hand, lifted out the scorpion from 
      the puddle, and put it on dry ground. The scorpion stung him. And wanting 
      to cross the road, the scorpion resumed its walk and headed straight again 
      into the puddle! Seeing it floundering and drowning again, the man picked 
      it up a second time and was again stung. Someone who came along and saw 
      all that had happened, said to the man: &quot;Why are you so stupid? Now you 
      see you have been stung not once but twice! It&#39;s a silly thing to do to 
      try to save a scorpion.&quot; The man replied: &quot;Sir, I can&#39;t help it. You see, 
      it is the nature of the scorpion to sting. But it is my nature to save. I 
      can&#39;t help but try to save that scorpion.&quot;</P>
      <P>True, the man could have exercised some wisdom and used a stick or 
      something to lift out the scorpion. But then he might have thought that he 
      could have lifted the scorpion with his hand in such a way as not to be 
      stung. Or he might have thought that a scorpion in such a dire strait 
      would not sting him. Whatever it may be, the moral of the story is in the 
      spontaneous response of the man in wanting to save another living being, 
      even though it may be an insect. It also shows that the compassionate man 
      is such that even though he may receive ingratitude from a person he had 
      helped, it does not matter. It is just his nature to help, and if he could 
      help again, he would. He doesn&#39;t know how to harbour any bitterness or 
      grudges!</P>
      <P>Compassion then is the language of the heart. At the time when we are 
      motivated by love and compassion, we reach out to help without 
      discrimination as to the race, creed or nationality of another. In the 
      light of compassion, identification to race, creed, etc becomes secondary; 
      they become insignificant. Further, such compassion is not confined to 
      human beings but is also extended to all living things including animals 
      and insects. In line with the above theme of compassion as the language of 
      the heart, I will like to offer you a poem:</P>

      <P>I feel that if we have tried to cultivate this kind of love and 
      compassion, then when the time comes for us to die, we will go peacefully. 
      Even if we have not succeeded 100 per cent in loving perfectly, we can 
      still be happy and content that we have tried. And surely we would have 
      succeeded to a certain extent.</P>
      <P><B>The Five Precepts</B></P>
      <P>If we have been trying to cultivate this kind of love, then keeping the 
      five basic precepts will not be that difficult. The first precept, as we 
      know, is not to kill, not to take any life, even that of an animal or 
      insect. This is a beautiful precept. It means that we respect life. Nay, 
      not only do we respect life, we also cherish it. Life is precious to all. 
      When we give life, we are giving a most precious gift. When we keep this 
      precept we become kinder. Not only do we refrain from killing, we also 
      refrain from harming any living being.</P>
      <P>True, in this imperfect world where the strong prey on the weak, 
      killing is rampant. We can see this in the animal world, how a tiger would 
      feed on a deer, a snake on a frog, a frog on a fly, a bird on a worm, and 
      a big fish on a small fish. And we humans too kill the animals and fish 
      and even each other. But we are not here to judge or condemn. We 
      understand our human imperfections and the imperfect nature of existence. 
      The Buddha understood too. He says that when we can purify our mind and 
      attain Nibbana, then we can opt out of this imperfect existence, this 
      cycle of birth and death. It is for us to verify whether this can be done. 
      When we have cleansed our minds of all greed, hatred and ignorance, we 
      will know with the certainty of direct experience whether the Buddha spoke 
      true or not. Until then, I have faith that I can do no better than to 
      follow the path of the Buddha, the path of purifying the mind.</P>
      <P>Each of us has to follow our path of development. Let each one of us 
      try to keep the first precept to the best of our ability: We should not 
      kill; we should spare life, give life.</P>
      <P>The second precept is not to steal or cheat, not to take anything with 
      dishonest intent. We are honest and we shall earn our living the honest 
      way. There are some people who say that an honest man cannot succeed or 
      become rich. I do not agree with this. I&#39;m sure there are many honest men 
      who stuck to their principles and succeed. And furthermore they enjoy the 
      happiness of a clear conscience and peaceful mind. On the other hand those 
      who cheated are often exposed and punished in the end. Even if they do 
      manage to escape detection, they still suffer from fear of detection and 
      the pangs of a guilty conscience; and when they die, the suffering of a 
      woeful rebirth awaits them. As such, honesty has always been and will 
      always be the best policy. Do not listen to those who say otherwise. The 
      honest can be more successful. Even if we should face greater obstacles, 
      we would not cheat to succeed. We would rather be honest and poor, than to 
      be rich but crooked. There is nothing so blissful as a clear conscience, 
      especially at the time when we face death.</P>
      <P>The third precept is to be responsible in sexual matters. If two 
      partners take their relationship seriously, are considerate, loving and 
      faithful to each other, then their love is sealed. No third party can come 
      in between them. Sexual responsibility is very important. Because of 
      irresponsibility, victimisation occurs. Pimps destroy the lives of young 
      girls; and men who succumb to their lust are abettors to the ill-deed. But 
      we are not here to judge but to plead for true love and compassion. Truly, 
      if we can purify our mind and check our lust, there will be less suffering 
      and exploitation in this world. And the dreaded AIDS disease which has 
      become a world-wide scourge can also be contained.</P>
      <P>The fourth precept is not to lie but to speak the truth. Again do not 
      listen to those who say that one cannot succeed without lying or making 
      false representations. Truth is one of the ten paramis (perfections) held 
      fast to by a bodhisatta (a person aspiring for Buddhahood). All Buddhists 
      have to develop their paramis to a considerable extent too if they want to 
      attain arahathood - liberation from the round of birth and death. The 
      Buddha wanted us to be so perfectly truthful that he exhorted us not to 
      lie even in jest. So we should try our best to uphold this noble precept 
      of non-lying. Furthermore, though we may not seek it, the reputation of an 
      honest man will nevertheless spread far and wide. Even his detractors will 
      have to concede and give him due respect.</P>
      <P>The fifth precept is not to take alcohol and drugs because they 
      befuddle the mind. And they are also bad for the body. Some people think 
      that this precept may allow a little social drinking but I do not think 
      so. The Buddha would not want us to compromise our mindfulness which could 
      in turn cause us to compromise our other precepts. Besides, alcohol is 
      harmful to our health. As for drugs we are all agreed that hard drugs such 
      as heroin are out. But cigarette smoking may be thought by some people to 
      be not included in this precept. (During the Buddha&#39;s time, tobacco had 
      apparently not been discovered.) However, in the light of present day 
      overwhelming medical evidence on the harmfulness of tobacco and the 
      efforts of governments all over the world to ban or curtail its usage, we 
      can confidently say that if the Buddha were here today, he too would 
      strongly discourage us from smoking; for he would not want us to 
      compromise our physical health nor would he want us to be addicted to a 
      mild but proven hazardous drug.</P>
      <P>More could be said on the great damage alcohol and tobacco had wreaked 
      and are still wreaking on society, but it is not within the scope of this 
      work to go into a long discussion of the subject. Suffice to say that it 
      is our view that even a little so-called social drinking and smoking too 
      would infringe somewhat on the spirit of the fifth precept. It is better 
      to abstain completely, especially in the case of alcohol, having given due 
      consideration to these very words of the Buddha: &quot;Monks, taking of 
      intoxicants when practised, developed, and repeatedly performed, causes 
      one to arise in hell, in the world of animals, and in the world of hungry 
      ghosts; the very least result is that even should one be reborn as a human 
      being one will be inflicted with insanity.&quot;</P>
      <P>When we keep these five precepts, we give happiness and security to 
      others. How? Why, nobody need to worry about us. They need not fear us. 
      They can feel very secure and comfortable with us. For they can be assured 
      that we will not harm them, steal from them or cheat them. We will not 
      have any affair with their spouses. We will not lie to them. And what 
      more, if we do not drink or smoke, they do not have to worry about their 
      children aping our drinking or smoking habit, or the hazard they face by 
      breathing in our side-stream smoke. They will feel they can trust us, for 
      we don&#39;t even drink. We are religious and keeping to the straight and 
      narrow path. We are harmless. Those who strongly crave for sensual 
      pleasures may think that we are living a very dull life and that we are 
      foolish. But it doesn&#39;t matter. We are happy for what we are. We are happy 
      as we are. And truth to say, we will be praised by the wise.</P>
      <P>So it is good when we can keep the basic five precepts. Furthermore we 
      practise generosity and kindness. We care and we share whatever we can 
      afford. We also cultivate mindfulness as advised by the Buddha. We try to 
      live a mindful life. We meditate to gain more understanding of the nature 
      of our existence, its characteristics of impermanence, suffering and 
      no-self. Thus when we have done all these, when we have lived a good life, 
      what do we have to fear when we die? What regrets can we have?</P>
      <P>That is why we say that to die well we must live well. And that when we 
      have lived well, we can die well. We can go peacefully, content that we 
      have done all that we could. True, we may make some mistakes along the 
      way. But then who hasn&#39;t? Jesus Christ once said: &quot;Let him who has not 
      sinned cast the first stone.&quot; So before we had learnt and mellowed, we may 
      have done some bad deeds. That is understandable, because we are all not 
      perfect. But the thing is that once we realise our mistakes, we begin to 
      cultivate love and compassion, we begin to keep the precepts and purify 
      our mind. We can be happy because we had time to change to the right 
      track. As they say it is better late than never. We may arrive a little 
      late after the others, but at least we still arrive.</P>

      <P>Sometimes as a monk I&#39;m asked to go for funeral chanting. I do feel 
      sorry for the bereaved ones but sometimes I also feel quite helpless 
      because there is so much confusion as regards the role of a monk in 
      funeral chanting.</P>
      <P>The other day a young lady approached me. Her father had died that 
      morning. He was only 42. She pleaded with me in Hokkien: &quot;Tolong lai liam 
      keng, khuih lor hor wah-eh-pah.&quot; It means: &quot;Please come and chant prayers. 
      Please open the way for my father.&quot; I look at her with as much compassion 
      as I can muster. I can feel her confusion and suffering. She must be about 
      20 I thought, and she is a filial daughter. In my heart I told myself: &quot;O 
      dear, how on earth am I going to open the way for anybody. What imaginary 
      path am I going to draw in the air for his equally imaginary spirit to 
      tread upon? How can I tell this poor young lady in her present state of 
      grief and confusion that there is no such way as she may have conceived it 
      to be.&quot;</P>
      <P>The Buddha was put in such a position once and how did he respond to 
      it? Well, one day a young man approached and asked the Buddha: &quot;O lord, my 
      father has died. Please come and say some prayers for him. Raise up his 
      soul so that he can go to heaven. The Brahmins perform such rites but you 
      Buddha are so much more powerful than them. If you were to do it, my 
      father&#39;s soul is sure to fly straight to heaven.&quot;</P>
      <P>The Buddha replied: &quot;Very well. Please go to the market and fetch me 
      two earthen pots and some butter.&quot; The young man was happy that the Buddha 
      had condescended to perform some powerful magic to save his father&#39;s soul. 
      He hurried to town and got what was required. Then the Buddha instructed 
      him: &quot;Put the butter in one pot and stones in the other pot. Then throw 
      both pots into the pond.&quot; The man did so, and both pots sank to the bottom 
      of the pond. Then the Buddha continued: &quot;Now take a staff and strike the 
      pots at the bottom of the pond.&quot; The man did so. The pots broke and the 
      butter, being light, floated up while the stones, being heavy, remained 
      where they were at the bottom.</P>
      <P>Then the Buddha said: &quot;Now quick, go and summon all the priests. Tell 
      them to come and chant so that the butter can go down and the stones can 
      come up.&quot; The young man looked at the Buddha, flabbergasted. &quot;Lord,&quot; he 
      said, &quot;You can&#39;t be serious. Surely you can&#39;t expect the butter being 
      light to sink and the stones being heavy to rise up. That would be against 
      the law of nature.&quot;</P>
      <P>The Buddha smiled and said: &quot;Even so, my son, don&#39;t you see that if 
      your father had led a good life, then his deeds would be as light as the 
      butter, so that no matter what he will rise up to heaven. Nobody can 
      prevent that, not even me. For nobody can go against the natural law of 
      kamma. But if your father had led a bad life, then just like the stones 
      that are heavy, he would sink to hell. No amount of prayers by all the 
      powerful priests in the world can cause it to happen otherwise.&quot;</P>
      <P>The young man understood. He corrected his wrong concept and stopped 
      going around asking for the impossible. The Buddha&#39;s simile had driven 
      home the point: Nobody can save us, least of all after we are dead. 
      According to the law of kamma, we are owners of our deeds, heirs of our 
      deeds. Our deeds are our true property. They are our true refuge, our true 
      relatives. They are the womb from which we spring. When we die we cannot 
      take even one cent with us or any of our personal belongings. Neither can 
      even one of our loved ones accompany us. Just as we came alone according 
      to our kamma, we must go alone. If we have understood the law of kamma 
      well, then we will appreciate how important it is to lead a good life 
      while we are alive. For to wait until we are dead will be too late. There 
      is little that can be done then.</P>

      <P><B>Rebirth is instantaneous</B></P>
      <P>Nevertheless, there is a role which a monk can play in funeral 
      chanting. And that is the Buddhist way of sharing merits. How is the 
      sharing or transference of merits effected? Before we can explain this we 
      must first understand what happens at death. According to the Buddha, 
      rebirth takes place instantaneously after death, consciousness having the 
      nature of arising and passing away unceasingly. There is no interval 
      between death and the next birth [*7]. One moment we are dead and the next 
      moment rebirth takes place, either in the human plane, the animal plane, 
      the suffering spirit or ghost (peta) plane, the demon (asura) plane, the 
      hell plane, or the celestial (deva) plane.</P>
      <P>One takes rebirth according to one&#39;s kamma. If one has led a good life 
      one will generally get a good rebirth. The mind is likely to be in a 
      wholesome state at the death moment enabling a good rebirth to come about. 
      One may be reborn as a human being or as a god in one of the many heavenly 
      realms. The Buddha was able to see with his psychic powers the various 
      realms of existence, and also how beings died and were reborn immediately 
      according to their deeds. The Buddha and many of the monks during his time 
      too were able to recollect their innumerable past lives.</P>
      <P>If one has led a generally evil life, then a bad rebirth is more than 
      likely to come about - in one of the four woeful states as a hell-being, a 
      hungry ghost (peta), an animal or a demon (asura). But wherever one may be 
      reborn, one will not be there forever. On the expiry of one&#39;s lifespan, 
      one dies and undergoes new rebirth. So existence as a hell-being or a 
      ghost too is not forever. There is hope: one has a chance to come up 
      again, though it might take an incalculably long time to do so. So it is 
      better not to drop into the woeful states at all, for once there you&#39;ll 
      never know how long you&#39;ll have to stay there. It might seem like an 
      eternity!</P>
      <P>Similarly, existence in the heavenly realms is not permanent. On expiry 
      of one&#39;s lifespan there, one is liable to drop down to a lower plane. Only 
      an arahant who has given up all desire for rebirth, having eradicated the 
      mental defilements of greed, hatred and delusion, will undergo no new 
      rebirth. On dying he arises no more in any of the 31 planes of existence. 
      He is subject no more to samsara, the round of birth and death. He attains 
      parinibbana which is the extinction (nirodha) of mind and body, the 
      extinguishing of the whole mass of suffering. But until one becomes an 
      arahant one will still be subject to rebirth.</P>
      <P><B>How sharing of merits is effected</B></P>
      <P>Now, for transference of merits to be effected, it is essential for the 
      being who is to receive the merits to know what is going on. He must be 
      present and be able to approve of the good deeds done in his name or on 
      his behalf. If he approves, then that approving or rejoicing state of mind 
      is a wholesome state of mind. In other words he made his own merits by 
      rejoicing over the good deed which had been done on account of him. Thus 
      it is not that we transfer our merits to him. That is not literally 
      possible. What happens is that he rejoices and that rejoicing is a 
      meritorious deed by which his suffering may be alleviated and his 
      happiness increased.</P>
      <P>If after death, rebirth takes place in the human or animal plane, the 
      being will be in no position to know what is going on, - for instance he 
      may still be a foetus in the womb of his mother. Under such circumstances, 
      he would not be able to rejoice and partake in the merit-making.</P>
      <P>If a person has been reborn as a hell-being, he too cannot know what is 
      going on in this world because he would be suffering in hell, which is 
      another plane of existence in which he would have no knowledge of what is 
      transpiring here on earth. If he is reborn as a deva (heavenly being), it 
      is unlikely that he would keep in touch with this world. It is said that 
      he would be too happy and busy exploring the wonders of his new existence 
      to be immediately concerned about what is happening on earth. Time is 
      relative and a day, say in the Tavatimsa heaven, is said to be the 
      equivalent of 100 years on earth! So by the time a deva should, so to 
      speak, take a look down here, we&#39;ll all be dead and gone! Moreover, we 
      cannot say for certain that a deva will automatically have the psychic 
      powers to recollect his previous life, though the scriptures do record 
      instances of devas remembering what they had done in their previous life 
      to earn them a celestial rebirth.</P>
      <P>So in the Tirokutta sutta, the Buddha told a brahmin that only a peta 
      (an unfortunate spirit) would be able to partake in the sharing of merits. 
      These spirits, though in their own realm, are able to perceive with their 
      own eyes the human plane. If they are aware of the meritorious deeds done 
      on account of them, and rejoice thereupon, then they would gain merits as 
      a result of their rejoicing. Of course no-one would like their loved one 
      to be reborn as a peta. One would like to think that he (or she) has 
      undergone rebirth as a human being or a deva.</P>
      <P>So the brahmin asked the Buddha what would happen if the deceased had 
      already obtained a good rebirth. The Buddha replied that it was still good 
      to share merits, for in our beginningless wandering in samsara, it was 
      certain that some of our relatives in previous lives have had unfortunate 
      rebirths as petas. And as the lifespan of a peta can be very very long, 
      they are liable to be still around. So we share the merits with departed 
      relatives and also with all sentient beings. Besides, the Buddha pointed 
      out, the person who did the good deed on account of the departed will 
      himself get the merits too.</P>
      <P>Sharing of merits is a Buddhist tradition. The Buddhist does good deeds 
      such as offering almsfood and requisites to monks, sponsoring the printing 
      of Dhamma books and donating to charitable causes, such as homes for the 
      aged, charity hospitals and institutions for the handicapped. Then he 
      invites the departed and all sentient beings to rejoice and share in the 
      merits. This itself is a good deed, the doer of which does not &quot;lose&quot; any 
      merits but gains even more by sharing, as the act of sharing is another 
      meritorious deed. So the living make double merits - first by doing a good 
      deed and second by sharing the merits.</P>
      <P>The presence of monks to recite Buddhist suttas and to give Dhamma 
      talks to the bereaved relatives at the time of their grief is also a great 
      moral support. The monks can remind the living relatives of the Buddha&#39;s 
      teaching of impermanence, suffering and no-self. They can urge the 
      relatives to accept the suffering with wisdom, and to strive more 
      diligently to attain Nibbana, the cessation of all suffering.</P>
      <P>If we understand and accept the Buddhist concept of rebirth as being 
      instantaneous, then we will understand that what is important is that we 
      must do good deeds while we are alive. By doing good deeds, we gain good 
      kamma. Kamma is our true inheritance, for only those good deeds or kamma 
      can follow us. After death, the burning of paper money, houses, cars, etc. 
      cannot benefit the deceased. It would be against the logic of kamma. 
      Moreover, we can think for ourselves - how can something that is burnt 
      here materialise in another world or anywhere for that matter. What is 
      burnt is just burnt; it stays burnt. In the context of the law of kamma 
      too, offering of food to the deceased is also pointless. On being reborn, 
      the new being will survive on the kind of food that is appropriate for its 
      plane of existence. Thus we find that the Buddha did not at all ask us to 
      offer food to the deceased or burn paper money, etc.</P>
      <P>Apparently, these funeral rites and rituals have been handed down from 
      generation to generation without any thought as to their basis and 
      significance. What the Buddha taught is, as explained earlier, to do some 
      good deeds on account or in memory of the deceased and then share the 
      merits, by reciting the Pali or stating in the language we can understand: 
      &quot;May these merits go to the departed. May the departed rejoice and share 
      in the merits done.&quot;</P>
      <P><B>A Buddhist funeral is a simple funeral</B></P>
      <P>The Buddhist way is meaningful and simple. If we can understand and 
      appreciate the Buddhist way, then a Buddhist funeral can be a very simple 
      one devoid of superstitious rites and rituals, devoid of fear, anxiety or 
      confusion. One need not burn this or that, perform all kinds of strange 
      rites and observe all kinds of taboos, all of which are quite meaningless 
      and confusing to the living who usually go along with it more out of fear, 
      social pressure or ignorance than anything else. One need not invite 
      professionals to chant and perform rituals for a hefty fee amounting to 
      thousands of dollars! or engage a band to strike up music, even though it 
      may well be solemn music.</P>
      <P>As a Buddhist, one need only to invite Buddhist monks to recite 
      Buddhist suttas which need not be lengthy. It would be good if the suttas 
      can be translated into English or Chinese so that all present can 
      understand, appreciate and reflect on what had been recited, on what the 
      Buddha had taught us about the nature of life and death. Of special 
      importance is the upholding of the five precepts by the lay-people - done 
      by reciting the Pali, preferably with translation, after the monk. The 
      taking and observance of five precepts is basic practice for lay 
      Buddhists. After the taking of precepts, the monk can give a dhamma talk 
      aimed at providing consolation, comfort and strength to the bereaved.</P>
      <P>In the Theravadin tradition, monks do not levy any fee at all for their 
      service. The service is done by them out of compassion, to give moral 
      support to the lay-devotees in their hour of need. Thus, the monks would 
      not seek monetary compensation as that would be at odds with the spirit of 
      the Dhamma. Nevertheless, lay-devotees sometimes offer a red packet as a 
      donation to the monks for the purchase of allowable requisites, such as 
      robes or medicines. This sum, if offered, need only be a token. In fact, 
      the monks are not to expect a red packet, and if it should be offered, 
      then it is something which is offered solely on the initiative of the 
      offerer. This packet being a token sum is not a fee but a donation. A fee, 
      in the case of a funeral, is usually a substantial (or exorbitant) sum 
      that would be fixed by the undertaker before he would agree to conduct 
      elaborate services. And that, as we have said, is not the practice for a 
      monk.</P>
      <P>The relatives, of course, can offer food (dana) to the monks at the 
      temple. Those who are more affluent can make donations for the printing of 
      Dhamma books for free distribution. They can also make donations to 
      charitable institutions, to the poor and needy, and other worthy causes. 
      In lieu of wreaths, relatives and friends can be encouraged to donate 
      towards specified charities. All the merits thus gained can then be shared 
      with the deceased. All these will make the funeral meaningful - minus the 
      unskillful practices which involve much confusion and waste of funds.</P>
      <P><B>We can learn from others</B></P>
      <P>The deceased can be cremated or buried promptly - on the same day or 
      the following day. In this regard I think Chinese families can learn 
      something from a Muslim funeral, which I&#39;m told, is simple, practical and 
      inexpensive. A Muslim friend of mine says that the Muslim way is to bury 
      the deceased on the very day of death or, at the latest, the following 
      day. So if a Muslim dies at 2pm, he can be buried before sunset on the 
      same day. If he dies in the late evening or at night, he is buried the 
      following day.</P>
      <P>The funeral is an inexpensive, easily affordable one because, as my 
      friend says, Islam discourages extravagance and encourages simplicity and 
      frugality. A Muslim funeral, inclusive of the casket, he tells me, can 
      cost as little as $500 - a far cry from a Chinese funeral which can cost 
      up to $30,000 or even more! The funeral procedures for the Muslim too are, 
      in the Muslim context, relatively simple and meaningful. A Christian 
      funeral too is simple, inexpensive and meaningful for the Christian, and 
      burial is carried out within 48 hours.</P>
      <P>I believe that in life we can never stop learning. There are always 
      better and more meaningful ways of doing things. If we keep an open and 
      unbiased mind we can learn from others. The Buddha advised us in the 
      Kalama sutta that we should always think and investigate for ourselves. If 
      we find that a practice is good and meaningful then we should follow it; 
      if we find that it is bad or unskillful, then we should not follow it, or 
      if we had already been following it, we should be bold and wise enough to 
      discard it. Nothing, the Buddha said, should be followed blindly without 
      understanding or question. The Buddha encouraged us to question and 
      investigate. Even his words are to be investigated and only when found 
      true to be followed. The Buddha does not want us to have blind faith but 
      faith that is based on direct experiential knowledge.</P>
      <P>Therefore, if we find simple and good practices in other religions and 
      traditions, we can adapt and follow them as long as they are not in 
      conflict with our religious beliefs. In this regard, we can learn from 
      others in the way they hold a prompt and inexpensive funeral. We should 
      also discard the superstitious and un-Buddhistic practices of ours. As for 
      superstitions, I understand there are many in a traditional Chinese 
      funeral, and I have seen some of these practices for myself while chanting 
      at funerals. I feel quite helpless as I can only witness these practices 
      in silence. There is little one can do. Traditions are most difficult to 
      change; and any effort to make changes will usually meet with strong 
      resistance and even condemnation.</P>
      <P>There were times when I hesitated to go for funeral chanting because I 
      wondered what purpose would my presence there serve. But more often than 
      not, I responded and tried to do what I could by giving a Dhamma talk and 
      clarifying as skillfully as possible the Buddhist position. I think it is 
      high time that Chinese Buddhists re-examine the traditional Chinese 
      funeral practices and make simplifications in line with Buddhist wisdom. I 
      may be criticised for my views but I feel that if we do not speak up, we 
      will be doing a disservice to the Buddhist community.</P>
      <P>If I may suggest a simple Buddhist funeral, I will propose that 
      cremation be done on the same day if possible, and if not, the following 
      day. However, some people may wish to keep the body for a few days to 
      enable faraway relatives and friends to come and pay their last respects, 
      or for various other personal reasons. So the decision would be a personal 
      one to be made by the family concerned. I have proposed cremation rather 
      than burial because of various practical considerations, such as the 
      shortage of land, increase in human population, and savings in funeral 
      costs which can then be channeled towards more meaningful needs such as 
      charity.</P>
      <P>The deceased should be bathed, cleaned and dressed by the family 
      members, rather than by strangers. This would be meaningful because the 
      body is that of our loved one, and the very least we can do is to handle 
      it gently with love and respect. The body can be dressed in clothes which 
      need not be grand or formal, but which the deceased had liked to wear when 
      he was alive. A male body can be bathed and dressed by male family 
      members, and a female body by female members. We should not feel any fear 
      for a dead body, especially as it is the body of our loved one.</P>
      <P>There is also no point in putting any jewellery on the body. Once, 
      while on funeral chanting, I noticed undertakers adorning the deceased&#39;s 
      body with special made-for-the-dead rings and earrings. This is even more 
      ironical and meaningless, considering that in whatever rebirth the 
      deceased may take, he (or she) is not going to take anything at all along 
      with him except the sum of his good and bad deeds.</P>
      <P>When handling the body, such as removing it from the bed and arranging 
      it in the casket, it can again be done by family members. And as always 
      the body should be respectfully and gently handled. The practice of 
      turning one&#39;s back towards the deceased as he is lowered into the casket, 
      or as his casket is taken into the hearse, is to me an odd thing. The 
      deceased is our loved one and we ourselves should, in the first place, be 
      placing his body gently into the casket, or to look on with respect as it 
      is being done so by others. To turn away and show one&#39;s back to the 
      deceased is to me a mark of disrespect! I can&#39;t help thinking that if I 
      were the deceased I would be offended to be treated in such a manner.</P>
      <P>This practice of turning away is just another superstition. Why should 
      we fear any ill-luck befalling us if we do not conform to such taboos? As 
      Buddhists we should have confidence in kamma which is our true refuge and 
      support. Good begets good and bad begets bad. We should fear bad deeds, 
      such as breaking of our precepts, as such bad deeds will bring about 
      suffering. The last thing we need to fear are superstitions and unfounded 
      taboos.</P>
      <P>The casket too need not be an expensive one. It should be placed in the 
      hall of the house with some flowers nicely arranged around it and a 
      photograph of the deceased. Some meaningful Dhamma words, passage or 
      saying can be put up for reflection. No wreaths need be sent. Instead, in 
      lieu of wreaths, donations should be sent to charities which can be 
      specified by the family members of the deceased. Whatever expense that is 
      saved by holding a simple and meaningful funeral can also be channeled to 
      charity.</P>
      <P>Food need not be offered before the deceased&#39;s casket, for as we have 
      explained, the deceased will not be able to partake of it. Burning of 
      paper money, joss paper, etc, is also meaningless and should not be done 
      at all. Lighting of candles and joss-sticks are also unnecessary. In fact, 
      the very many superstitious practices and taboos that normally accompany a 
      traditional Chinese ceremony should all be discarded, bearing in mind the 
      Buddha&#39;s words that a true lay-follower of his has five qualities: &quot;He has 
      faith; he is morally disciplined; he does not believe in superstitious 
      omens; he relies on kamma, not on omens; he does not seek spiritually 
      worthy persons outside of here (ie. outside of the Buddha&#39;s dispensation) 
      and he shows honour here first (ie. he has respect for the Buddha&#39;s 
      dispensation and should not subject himself to un-Buddhistic practices).&quot;</P>
      <P>Wearing of mourning clothes is unnecessary. The Buddha does not want us 
      to mourn or grieve but to accept the fact of separation and death with 
      wisdom and equanimity. Soka or grief is an unwholesome state of mind and 
      it is to be overcome through mindfulness and wise reflection. Thus, the 
      anagami and arahant (who have attained the third and fourth stages of 
      sainthood respectively) are incapable of mourning and grieving. When the 
      Buddha died, the monks who had attained anagamihood or arahathood, shed 
      not a tear. Understanding the nature of impermanence, they did not grieve 
      even though the Buddha was passing away before their eyes.</P>
      <P>Neither did the Buddha grieve when his two chief disciples, Sariputta 
      and Moggallana, died within two weeks of each other, about six months 
      before him. The Buddha himself remarked: &quot;Marvellous it is, most wonderful 
      it is, monks, concerning the Perfect Ones that when such a pair of 
      disciples have passed away there is no grief, no lamentation on the part 
      of the Perfect One.&quot; And the Buddha added: &quot;For of that which is born, 
      come to being, put together, and so is subject to dissolution, how should 
      it be said that it should not depart? That, indeed, is not possible. 
      Therefore, monks, be ye an island unto yourselves, a refuge unto 
      yourselves seeking no external refuge; with the Teaching as your island, 
      the Teaching your refuge, seeking no other refuge.&quot;</P>
      <P>Grief is not suppressed, but acknowledged and dispersed through 
      mindfulness and understanding.</P>
      <P>So if we can bear in mind the Buddha&#39;s teaching, we can remain calm in 
      the face of grief. Here we should emphasize that we are not saying that 
      you should suppress your grief by force, ignore or deny its existence. No, 
      that too would be an unskillful approach.</P>
      <P>Our approach then is to acknowledge and observe our sorrowful state of 
      mind. Through mindfulness and wise reflection, we can contain our grief 
      and become calm. Mindfulness and understanding is the middle and best way 
      - it involves neither suppression nor giving vent to negative and 
      destructive emotions. Mindfulness is acknowledgment and observation, out 
      of which understanding, acceptance, reconciliation and wisdom can arise. 
      We do not deny or suppress our emotions. We acknowledge and observe them.</P>
      <P>In that acknowledgment and observation, we can better cope with the 
      turmoil and conflict that may be going on in our mind. We can exercise 
      wise reflection on the nature of impermanence, suffering and no-self. We 
      can draw from the wisdom of the ancients, and thereby come to terms with 
      our grief. In other words, wisdom can arise. We can understand and accept 
      our sorrow. And it will not take control over our mind or overwhelm us. 
      This is what we mean when we say the gentle application of mindfulness 
      leads to understanding and self-composure.</P>
      <P>In this way, we will not be wailing our heart out. We can observe the 
      emotion of grief in us, and it can be contained quite naturally, without 
      us having to give gross outward expression to it. There will be calmness, 
      acceptance and understanding. Even if we should lose our control and cry, 
      we can do so in a somewhat restrained manner. We will eventually regain 
      our control and calm down. Mindfulness will come to our aid, and help us 
      to reconcile with our grief. We will understand the fact of suffering, the 
      truth of what the Buddha and other wise teachers had taught, and we can 
      smile again.</P>
      <P>Coming back to the subject of mourning, we can see that in the context 
      of wisdom and non-grieving, the wearing of mourning clothes is 
      unnecessary. It doesn&#39;t mean that we are not filial, or that we love our 
      loved ones less, if we do not wear mourning clothes. No, we still have 
      great respect for our loved ones but we do not see any merits in making a 
      public and superfluous show of our grief. Respect and grief are here a 
      very private matter. They are felt in our hearts and we are not bound to 
      make a public show of them.</P>
      <P>Rather than emphasizing on outward and superfluous forms of mourning, 
      filial piety should be associated with actions towards elders while they 
      are alive. Deeds speak for themselves. It would be most unfortunate if 
      some people think that elaborate funeral rites and rituals and the wearing 
      of mourning clothes, can serve as a redemption for deeds of love and care 
      not showered upon the deceased when he or she was living.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, in line with the decorum for a solemn occasion, &quot;solemn&quot; 
      clothes can be worn. One can select some appropriate dark, white or 
      plain-coloured clothing from one&#39;s wardrobe. That to my mind should 
      suffice, though the deceased person, if he had been a joyful and 
      understanding Buddhist, might not even want us to wear &quot;mournful&quot; 
      clothings but to rejoice that he had led a good life and had gone on to a 
      better rebirth. So a person could, before his death, stipulate that he 
      does not want any mourning and superstitious practices but just a simple 
      funeral. He can delegate a responsible person to see that all his wishes 
      are carried out. He can have it all written down on paper and signed in 
      the presence of witnesses so that all concerned would know and abide by 
      his wishes.</P>
      <P>The general atmosphere in the house and throughout the funeral should 
      be one of serenity and understanding. Unbecoming activities such as 
      drinking and gambling should definitely not be allowed. All should be 
      respectful and conduct themselves with due decorum. Meaningful passages 
      from the Buddhist scriptures can be read from time to time and reflected 
      upon by the family members and all those present. One person can lead in 
      the reflection. If all concerned have a good understanding of the Dhamma, 
      they would be able to contain their grief. The more stoical can comfort 
      those who are grieving. In this way a peaceful and understanding 
      atmosphere can come about during the whole proceedings. And those present 
      can also feel further resolved and motivated to strive harder in their 
      spiritual quest, and to live with more love and compassion.</P>
      <P>A service for the deceased can be conducted in the house. Senior family 
      members can lead in the service, during which the life and good deeds of 
      the deceased can be recounted. Children can recount the great kindness and 
      love of their parents [*8] and resolve to lead an exemplary life in their 
      memory.</P>
      <P>A monk too can be invited to give a pertinent Dhamma talk. Meditation 
      sessions can also be held in the hall. It would be both a meritorious deed 
      and a mark of respect for the deceased. The deceased, if he had been a 
      staunch meditator, would surely be very happy if he could know that 
      everybody was sitting around his casket, meditating. If he has been reborn 
      in heaven and could see what was going on, I am sure he would be 
      delighted. I, for one, will be very delighted if I were to look down and 
      see people all meditating around my casket. I will be pleased to no end. 
      And if possible I will come down and sit happily in meditation with 
      everybody but, of course, you must pardon me: I know I&#39;m giving free rein 
      to my imagination.</P>
      <P>On the day of the cremation, all the merits that have been made can 
      again be shared. A list of the charities that have benefited from the 
      donations received can also be read out. A meaningful service can be 
      conducted at the crematorium just before the casket is pushed into the 
      incinerator. Meaningful passages can be recited from the scriptures. They 
      can be about the impermanence of life, the inevitability of death and the 
      need to live a good life, to meditate and to serve our fellowmen. It might 
      be even more edifying if the service be specially composed and read out 
      for the occasion. It would be good if a monk can lead the whole service 
      but if that is not possible, then a senior member of the family, relative 
      or friend can take the initiative.</P>
      <P>After the cremation, what should we do with the ashes? In Buddhist 
      Burma I am told that usually a body is cremated to ashes, which is then 
      left to be disposed of by the crematorium attendants. The relatives do not 
      collect the ashes as it is believed that the deceased had immediately on 
      death taken a new rebirth, and the body left behind is just an empty 
      shell. The Chinese practice in Malaysia, however, is to keep urns 
      containing the ashes in temples or columbariums at substantial cost. My 
      personal feeling is that there is no point to keep the ashes as it doesn&#39;t 
      serve much purpose, there being no need at all to make any offerings or 
      perform any services before the ashes. For, as we know from the Dhamma, 
      the ashes is merely elements of inanimate matter while the consciousness 
      has taken on a new rebirth, a new body in some new existence. So I would 
      concur with the Burmese Buddhist way of leaving the ashes behind. If we 
      want to remember and honour the deceased, we should live a good life and 
      do good deeds in his memory. On anniversary of his death too, we can offer 
      dana (food and gifts) at the temples, or make donations to charities.</P>
      <P>All the proposals with regard to funerals that I have made above are, I 
      believe, more meaningful and significant than present practices. But of 
      course it is up to the reader to decide for himself or herself. These are 
      just my feelings, the way I look at it. I understand that others may feel 
      differently. They may disagree with me and they have every right to do so. 
      For it has always been my firm belief that no-one should impose his or her 
      views on another. We all have a mind of our own and must be allowed to 
      think and decide for ourselves.</P>
      <P>Therefore I must make it very clear here that I am not imposing my 
      views on anybody. Instead I am just expressing and sharing them. And I 
      leave it to each person to decide for himself or herself what he or she 
      would like to believe or follow. Each person must feel free to do as he or 
      she deems fit. Furthermore, in deciding on a funeral after a person has 
      died, there should be discussion and concensus among the family members. 
      It is best therefore that a person, before he dies, makes clear the type 
      of funeral he desires. And it should preferably be done in writing, signed 
      and witnessed. Then there would be no quibble after his death. Family 
      members should respect and follow his wishes.</P>
      <P>Of course, the suggestions I have given are not all-comprehensive. They 
      have not covered all the details and aspects of a funeral. They are just a 
      rough framework, just some food for thought. There can be other variations 
      too. It will therefore be good if a team of like-minded and respected 
      Buddhists can sit down and formulate a simple Buddhist funeral covering 
      all aspects and details, and answering all the questions that may be 
      raised. Firstly, what should be looked at are our present practices. What 
      are they? What are their significance? Do we know and understand what we 
      are doing? Why do we practise them? Do they make sense? Are they in line 
      with the Dhamma? Or are they superstitious practices or practices which 
      cannot be reconciled with our understanding of the Dhamma as preached by 
      the Buddha?</P>
      <P>From what I can see, many of the present practices in a Chinese family, 
      which professes the Buddhist way of life, cannot be reconciled with the 
      Dhamma. It would appear that many people just follow funeral rites without 
      any idea of what they are all about. They just follow instructions without 
      question or understanding. They are, at the time of the funeral, really 
      quite confused and distraught. They just follow what they are told to do 
      because it is the tradition and they can&#39;t possibly go against it without 
      being criticised and accused of being unfilial and so on. So there is 
      really no meaningful participation. To me, it all seems quite pathetic. 
      Ignorance and resignation to whatever is being conducted seems to be the 
      order of the day.</P>
      <P>So a team of respected Buddhists looking into all these practices can 
      come up with meaningful alternatives in line with the Buddha Dhamma. 
      Details of the proposed funeral service with various options can be drawn 
      up after having conducted a thorough study of the local situation. A 
      comprehensive book providing all the various funeral options and necessary 
      information can then be compiled and published. Such a project will be a 
      great service to the Buddhist community who are often confused as to what 
      constitutes a proper Buddhist funeral.</P>
      <CENTER>
      <P>** **</P>
      </CENTER>
      <P><B>As for me</B></P>
      <P>As for my own funeral, I have given due thought as to how I would like 
      my own body to be disposed after death. The body is actually nothing more 
      than a corpse after death. It will just return to the earth. So I might as 
      well do one last good deed with it - ie. donate it to the hospital. 
      Doctors can remove the cornea from my eyes and give the wonderful gift of 
      sight to a blind person. Imagine what joy it is for one who is blind to be 
      able to see again, and how precious such a gift would be to him. And 
      imagine how happy I would be too, to know that I have given him this gift 
      of sight. This gift too is no sacrifice on my part at all, as the body is 
      of no more use to me after death. So I might as well do one last good deed 
      with it before it decomposed.</P>
      <P>If possible, the doctors should also remove my heart, kidneys, lungs, 
      liver and whatever organs that could after my death be transplanted to 
      others. And whatever is left may be of benefit to medical students in 
      their studies. They could do dissection practice on it. Later, they could 
      dispose what remains of the body as they wish. Perhaps it could become 
      fertilizer for the soil and some plant can grow into a strong tree that 
      provides shade and pretty flowers. In this way too, nobody need to worry 
      about giving me a so-called proper funeral. Everybody can just leave it to 
      the hospital to dispose of everything as they deem fit. It will make it so 
      much easier for everybody. It will, so to speak, take a load off their 
      mind. No-one need to be unnecessarily inconvenienced on my account.</P>
      <P>And if anybody speaks about a proper funeral for me and the paying of 
      last respects, I will say: Please do not bother about all that. A funeral 
      is not for me. But if you really wish to remember me, then do a good deed. 
      Do any good deed you like in my memory. Live a good life. Be caring and 
      sharing. Be forgiving and loving. Be generous and big-hearted. Be kind and 
      gentle. That is all that I ask. That will make me very happy - to know 
      that I have been able to spread some good message and be of some good 
      influence.</P>

      <P><B>Notes:</B></P>
      <P>[*7] The Tibetan belief that there is an intermediate stage or an 
      interval of up to 49 days between death and rebirth runs contrary to 
      Theravada Buddhism, which states that rebirth takes place immediately 
      after death. For more details on rebirth in the Theravadin Buddhist 
      perspective, see Narada&#39;s &quot;The Buddha and His Teachings&quot;, chapter 28.</P>
      <P>[*8] In this regard, parents may well take to heart the reality that 
      deeds outlive the physical life. A life well-lived will be the best legacy 
      they can leave behind for their children. A legacy that will both inspire 
      and provide dignity to their inheritors. The fragrance of their exemplary 
      deeds and life will remain long after they are gone.</P>
