      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">This booklet, which aims to 
      present some Teachings of Lord Buddha on Peace and Human Dignity, is 
      divided into 4 chapters.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Chapter One contains 
      quotations on the gist of His Preaching, His purpose in disseminating the 
      Dharma, His attitude toward other religions and antagonistic doctrines and 
      His love and compassion for the world.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Chapter Two refers to 
      quotations on his Dhamma, his Teachings on five fundamental topics: 1. 
      Dispute and harmony. 2. Anger and gentleness. 3. Harmfulness and 
      harmlessness. 4. Hatred and friendliness. 5. Killing and respect for life.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Chapter Three deals with His 
      community of monks and nuns (Sangha), His preoccupation in laying a code 
      of conduct so as to assure a perfect harmony among its religious members, 
      His advice to His religious disciples to live together in perfect harmony 
      and His rebuke when His monks did not live up to His Teachings.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Chapter Four introduces two 
      categories of people, those who are prone to disputes, to quarrels, to 
      war, and those who are inclined to a life of perfect harmony and peace.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The first ones are those who 
      commit evil actions, those who are foolish and ignorant, and those who are 
      heedless, leading an untamed life. The second ones are those who perform 
      meritorious bodily vocal and mental activities, those who are wise and 
      sage, those who know how to control themselves.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">For the sake of contrast, 
      each category of people and their counterpart will be dealt with side by 
      side. Thus, Section 1 deals with evil people and good people. Section 2 
      refers to foolish people and wise people. Section 3 contrasts untamed 
      people with those who know how to control themselves.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Furthermore, in each chapter 
      and section, first come some general comments of the editor, then the 
      quotations themselves in 3 languages: Pali for those who are interested in 
      the original text and Paali language, English for the English public and 
      Vietnamese for the Vietnamese people.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">As mentioned earlier, the 
      quotations are far from exhaustive and many valuable techings may be 
      missing. The editor deems it necessary to state that his booklet is 
      nothing but a humble dedication to the Teachings of Lord Buddha and a 
      modest contribution to the Dhamma propagation in our world today.</font></p>

      TEACHINGS ON PEACE</font></p>
      </b></font>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In summing up His 45 years of 
      preaching the Dhamma, Lord Buddha declared explicitly that He did preach 
      only suffering, the end of suffering, and nothing else. War brings up 
      suffering. Peace means the end of suffering. That is why He is called 
      &quot;A Messenger for Peace&quot;.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">He exhorted His disciples to 
      go forth to preach the Dhamma and to explain the Brahmacariya (the holy 
      life) for the welfare of the many, for the happiness of the many, out of 
      compassion for the world, for the advantage, for the happiness of the 
      deities and human beings.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Lord Buddha made it very 
      clear that His purpose in preaching the Dhamma was not to quarrel with 
      other religious leaders and to compete with antagonistic doctrines. There 
      is no quarrel in His preaching. He just shows the way to enlightenment and 
      liberation from all Dukkha.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Lord Buddha is always filled 
      with love and compassion for all living beings. Even when He takes rest, 
      He never foregoes His compassion, and His preaching is performed out of 
      compassion for the world.</font></p>

      <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">QUOTATIONS ON HIS TEACHINGS</font></p>
      </b></font><b>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">SECTION 2.1: DISPUTE AND 
      HARMONY</font></p>
      </b>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Lord Buddha has pointed out 
      to us that sense desires are the root-causes of quarrels, contentions, 
      disputes and wars.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Another root cause of 
      quarrels and disputes is this distinction between oneself and others, 
      considering them to be equal, or superior or inferior to oneself.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">One way to appease all 
      quarrels is the knowledge that &quot;here in this quarrel, we 
      perish&quot;.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">There is this truly awkward 
      position, pointed out by Lord Buddha in the case of a person who has come 
      to abuse those who do not abuse, who has come to revile those who do not 
      revile, who has come to scold those who do not scold. All these abuses 
      will naturally return to the owner who has proffered them, just as food 
      offered but not accepted will come back to the owner.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Lord Buddha's attitude toward 
      quarrels and disputes is very clear. He has no quarrel with the world. His 
      preaching of the Dhamma has the only purpose to show the way to put an end 
      to suffering. He never claims that his Dhamma is the only truth, 
      everything else is false. He just makes it clear to every one to come, to 
      see and to judge by oneself&quot;.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The best way to avoid 
      quarrels and disputes, Lord Buddha advises, is not to uphold any fancy 
      perceptions or false views likely to arouse disputes. Even in case that 
      these fancy perceptions or wrong views do arise, the best way to deal with 
      them is not to take delight in them, not to welcome them, not to take hold 
      of them. Such an attitude will put an end to quarrels, disputes, wars and 
      all demeritorious dhammaa (actions).</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Any war, if breaking out, 
      will bring in its trails, untold suffering. Victory engenders hatred and 
      defeat brings up suffering. So the best way is not to resort to wars to 
      solve disputes, but to explore all peaceful means to settle differences 
      and conflicts.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">So the Sages who are homeless 
      will not make new ties everywhere they go. They cut off any quarrel likely 
      to happen to anybody.</font></p>

      </b>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Lord Buddha has a respect for 
      life, any life, even the life of an insect and of a plant. He sets Himself 
      as example, not to throw remaining food on green vegetation or in the 
      water where there are small insects. He advises His disciples not to kill 
      living beings to offer food to Him and to His disciples, because in doing 
      so, they store up much demerit.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">He makes it very clear that, 
      killing living beings will lead to hell, to the animal kingdom and to the 
      world of the petas. And the lightest evil result to be obtained is to be 
      born as human being, but with very short life. Moreover, killing living 
      beings will bring up fear and hatred in the present, in the future, and 
      pain and suffering in mind.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">So Lord Buddha advises us not 
      to kill, because all sentient beings tremble at the stick, to all life is 
      dear. The first precept to be undertaken by a layman is this respect for 
      life, this refrain from killing living beings. And a braahmana worthy of 
      his name, a sage should be one that practises this respect for life,

      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">When Lord Buddha sets up his 
      Sangha for the first time, His first preoccupation is to lay down such a 
      code of conduct so as to assure a perfect harmony among His religious 
      members. So He teaches six Dhammas to be remembered or the six Harmonies. 
      He advises His religious disciple to live together in perfect harmony, 
      mixing with each other like water and milk, looking at each other with 
      sympathetic eyes. When the monks of Kosambi quarelled with each other, His 
      upbraidings were severe and straight forward.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Sakka, king of the deities, 
      has great respect for the Sangha, because the Sangha personify those who 
      are not fighters among the fighters, those who are peaceful when others 
      are self-armed. He considers them a double winner, a victor over 
      themselves and a victor over others, those who, being scolded, do not 
      scold back.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Lord Buddha advises the monks 
      to make this well-expounded Dhamma-Vinaya (Law and Discipline) shine with 
      their forbearance and gentleness, and lead a life serene and calm, a life 
      of happiness when their mind has attained peace over themselves and over

      love towards his religious companions, in public as well as in private. 
      This Dhamma should be remembered, building up mutual love, mutual respect,

      his mental activities imbued with love towards his religious companions in

      according to Dhamma, lawfully, even offerings deposited in the begging 
      bowl, the monk should not be the one who does not share them, he should 
      share them with his virtuous religious companions. This Dhamma should be 
      remembered... (as above)... to common aspiration. Again O Bhikkhus, as to 
      monastic rules, which are unbroken, unspoilt, unsullied, which have no 
      impurities, leading to emancipation, praised by the wise, which are not to 
      be grasped at, leading to concentration, the monk should live in keeping 
      with these rules along with his religious companions, in public as well as 
      in private. This Dhamma should be remembered... (as above)... to common 
      aspiration. Again O Bhikkhus, as to the views which belong to the Noble 
      Ones, leading upwards, helping those who practise them, putting an end to 
      suffering, the monk should uphold these views along with his religious 
      companions, in public as well as in private. This Dhamma should be 
      remembered, building up mutual love, mutual respect, leading to harmony, 
      to no quarrel, to mutual understanding, to common aspiration. O Bhikkhus, 
      these six Dhamma should be remembered, building up mutual love, mutual 
      respect, leading to harmony, to no quarrel, to mutual understanding, to

      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">SECTION 4.1: WICKED PEOPLE 
      AND GOOD PEOPLE</font></p>
      </b>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In general, there are two 
      classes of people in the world, those who are inclined to quarrel, 
      addicted to dispute, prone to war, and those who are bent to living in 
      harmony, happy in friendliness, and prone to peace.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In the first class , can be 
      classified wicked folk, ignorant people, and heedless ones. In the second 
      class of people, are ranged those who are good folk, wise people and 
      heedful ones.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Lord Buddha has made a clear 
      distinction between wickedness and goodness and advises all his disciples 
      not to do evil actions, to perform good ones and to purify their own 
      heart. He knows that it is easy to do evil actions. To perform meritorious 
      ones is far more difficult. But His disciples should know how to select 
      between evil and good, because wicked people will go to Hell and undergo 
      untold suffering, while good ones will go to Heaven and enjoy peaceful 
      bliss. Moreover good ones even from afar shine like the mountain of snow 
      with their meritorious actions, while bad ones are enveloped in darkness 
      like an arrow shot in the night.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">So Lord Buddha advises us not 
      to make friends with wicked ones, but to associate only with good friends. 
      He points out very clearly that if we yearn for life, we should avoid 
      wickedness like we shun poison, because a hand free from wound can handle 
      poison with impunity. The dhammas of the good ones do not decay, but go 
      along with the good ones where meritorious actions will lead them. Good 
      actions will welcome the well doer who has gone from this world to the 
      next world, just as relatives welcome a dear one who has come back.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">So the problem poses itself 
      very clear and definite. Wickedness and goodness are all done by oneself. 
      Wickedness will lead to quarrel, to dispute and to war, while goodness 
      will lead to harmony, to friendliness and to peace.</font></p>

      </b>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Lord Buddha clearly sees the 
      different attitude of the foolish one and of the wise one toward this 
      world. The foolish one is attracted by, enamoured of, and becomes a slave 
      to this world. But the wise one has no attraction, no fancy to this world 
      and will act as a master to this world. But His statement that fear, 
      distress and dangers arise to the foolish ones but not to the wise ones, 
      acts as a grave warning to all of us.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Then He proceeds to say that 
      the foolish one behaves in such a way that he becomea an enemy to himself. 
      And when fame and name come to him, he undergoes misfortune and distress. 
      The wise one acts in a totally different way. He is heedful among the 
      heedless, fully awake among the sleepy, so he advances forward like a 
      swift horse, leaving behind the foolish ones. The wise one conquers Maara 
      and his hordes, makes his mind straight, practises meditation steadfastly, 
      strong in determination and perseverance and thus enjoys the bliss of 
      Nibbaana. With his wisdom, he outshines this world composed of the 
      worldlings, blind and foolish. And the wise one stands like a lotus, 
      sweet-smelling and lovely born on a rubbish heap thrown upon a highway. 
      Bliss of Nibbaana and bliss of peace come to the wise ones but never to 
      the foolish ones.</font></p>

      </b>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Lord Buddha knows verry well 
      the mind and the heart of human beings. He knows that the foolish people 
      indulge in heedlessness, while the wise people protect heedfulness as 
      precious treasure. So He advises the wise people with right effort, 
      heedfulness and discipline to build up an island which no flood can 
      overflow. Who is heedless before but afterwards heedless no more, will 
      outshine this world, like a moon free from clouds.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">To Lord Buddha, a person who 
      has conquered thousand thousand people in the battlefield cannot be 
      compared with a person who is victorious over himself, because he is truly 
      a supreme winner. A person who controls himself will always behave in a 
      self-tamed way. And a self well-tamed and restrained becomes a worthy and 
      reliable refuge, very difficult to obtain. A person who knows how to sit 
      alone, to sleep alone, to walk alone, to subdue oneself alone will take 
      delight in living in deep forests. Such a person is a trustworthy teacher 
      because being well tamed himself, he then instructs others accordingly. So 
      Lord Buddha advises the well tamed people to control themselves. Only the 
      well tamed people, the heedful people, know the way to stop contentions, 
      quarrels and disputes and how to live in harmony, in friendliness and in
