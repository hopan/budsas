      </B>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>This is the Middle Path which the Perfect One discovered and 
        expounded, which gives rise to vision and knowledge, which leads to 
        peace, wisdom, enlightenment, and nibbana - the Noble Eightfold Path:<BR>
        <BR>
        Right Understanding: of suffering, of its origin, of its cessation, of 
        the way leading to the cessation of suffering.<BR>
        <BR>
        Right Intention: of renunciation, free from craving; of good will, free 
        from aversion; of compassion, free from cruelty.<BR>
        <BR>
        Right Speech: abstaining from false speech, abstaining from malicious 
        speech, abstaining from harsh speech, abstaining from useless speech.<BR>
        <BR>
        Right Action: abstaining from taking life, abstaining from stealing, 
        abstaining from sexual misconduct.<BR>
        <BR>
        Right Livelihood: giving up wrong livelihood, one earns one&#39;s living by 
        a right form of livelihood.<BR>
        <BR>
        Right effort: to prevent unarisen unwholesome evil states of mind from 
        arising by making effort, stirring up energy and exerting mind.<BR>
        <BR>
        To abandon unwholesome evil states of mind that have already arisen by 
        making effort, stirring up energy and exerting mind.<BR>
        <BR>
        To develop wholesome mental states that have not yet arisen by making 
        effort, stirring up energy and exerting mind.<BR>
        <BR>
        Maintain and Perfect wholesome mental states already arisen and not to 
        allow them to disappear, but to bring them to growth, to maturity and to 
        the full perfection of development by making effort, stirring up energy 
        and exerting mind.<BR>
        <BR>
        Right mindfulness: mindful contemplation of the body, mindful 
        contemplation of feelings, mindful contemplation of the mind, mindful 
        contemplation of mental objects.<BR>
        <BR>
        Right Concentration: Quite secluded from sense pleasures, secluded from 
        unwholesome states of mind one enters and dwells in the first jhana, 
        which is accompanied by applied thought and sustained thought with 
        rapture and happiness born of seclusion.<BR>
        <BR>
        With the subsiding of applied thought and sustained thought one enters 
        and dwells in the second jhana, which has innner confidence and 
        unification of mind, is without applied and sustained thought, is filled 
        with rapture and happiness born of concentration.<BR>
        <BR>
        With the fading away of rapture, one dwells in equanimity, mindful and 
        discerning; and one experiences in one&#39;s own person that happiness of 
        which the noble ones say: &#39;Happily lives one who is equanimous and 
        mindful&#39; - thus one enters and dwells in the third jhana.<BR>
        <BR>
        With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, with the previous 
        disappearance of joy a grief, one enters and dwells in the fourth jhana, 
        which has neither pain nor pleasure and has purity of mindfulness due to 
        equanimity.</P>

        <P>Thus have I heard. One time the Exalted One was living near Savatthi, 
        in Jeta&#39;s Grove, the monastery of Anathapindika. Then, in the middle of 
        the night, a certain deity of astounding beauty, lighting up the entire 
        Jeta&#39;s Grove, approached the Exalted One. Drawing near, she paid homage 
        to the Exalted One and stood to one side. Standing thus the deity 
        addressed the Exalted One in verse:<BR>
        <BR>

        To be patient and obedient<BR>
        To visit with spiritual people<BR>
        To discuss the Dhamma at the right time<BR>
        This is a blessing supreme<BR>
        <BR>
        To live austerely and purely<BR>
        To see the noble truths<BR>
        And to realize nibbana<BR>
        This is the blessing supreme<BR>
        <BR>
        A mind unshaken when touched<BR>
        By the worldly states<BR>
