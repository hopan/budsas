      established is a &quot;foundation&quot;;<i> </i>mindfulness itself is such 
      a foundation.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There are four Foundations of 
      Mindfulness:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. <i>Kàyànupassanà-satipatthàna 
        </i>(Contemplation of the<i> </i>body as a Foundation of Mindfulness).<br>
        2. <i>Vedanànupassanà-satipatthàna </i>(Contemplation of Feelings as 
        a Foundation of Mindfulness).<br>
        3. <i>Cittànupassanà-satipatthàna </i>(Contemplation of the Mind<b> </b>as 
        a Foundation of Mindfulness).<br>
        4.<i> Dhammànupassanà-satipatthàna </i>(Contemplation of Mind-objects 
        as a Foundation of Mindfulness).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. <i>Kàyànupassanà-satipatthàna 
        </i>means mindfulness which is firmly established on bodily phenomena, 
        such as inhalation and exhalation.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">2. <i>Vedanànupassanà-satipatthàna 
        </i>means mindfulness which is firmly established on feelings 
        (sensations).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">3.<i> 
        Cittànupassanà-satipatthàna </i>means mindfulness which is firmly 
        established on thoughts or mental processes, such as thoughts associated 
        with passions or dissociated from passions.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">4<i>. 
        Dhammànupassanà-satipatthàna </i>means mindfulness which is firmly 
        established on phenomena such as the Hindrances <i>(nìvarana), </i>etc...</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Of the four, if mindfulness 
      or attention is firmly established on a part of the body, such as on 
      out-breath and in-breath, it is tantamount to attention being firmly 
      established on all things.<i> </i>This is because the ability to place 
      one's attention on any object at one's will has been acquired.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Firmly 
      established&quot; means, if one desires to place the attention on 
      out-breath and in-breath for an hour, one's attention remains firmly fixed 
      on it for that period.<i> </i>If one wishes to do so for two hours, one's 
      attention remains firmly fixed on it for two hours.<i> </i>There is no 
      occasion when the attention becomes released from its object on account of 
      the instability of thought-conception </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">(vitakka).</font></p>
      </i>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">For a detailed account of the<i> 
      satipatthàna, </i>see the <i>Satipatthàna Sutta </i>[1].</font><i></p>
      </i>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Why is it incumbent on us to 
      firmly establish the mind without fail on any object such as the 
      out-breath and the in-breath?<i> </i>It is because it is necessary for us 
      to gather and control the six types of consciousness <i>(vinnàna) </i>[2],<i> 
      </i>which have been drifting tempestuously and untrained throughout the 
      past inconceivably long and beginningless <i>samsàra </i>(round of 
      rebirths).</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">I shall make it clearer.<i> </i>The 
      mind is wont to flit about from one to another of the six objects of the 
      senses which lie at the approaches of the six sense-doors [3]</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">As an example, take the case 
      of a mad man who has no control over his mind.<i> </i>He does not even 
      know the meal-time, and wanders about aimlessly from place to place.<i> </i>His 
      parents look for him and give him his meal.<i> </i>After eating five or 
      six morsels of food he overturns the dish and walks away.<i> </i>He thus 
      fails to get a square meal.<i> </i>To this extent he has lost control of 
      his mind.<i> </i>He cannot control his mind even to the extent of 
      finishing the business of a meal.<i> </i>In talking, he cannot control his 
      mind to the extent of finishing or completing a sentence.<i> </i>The 
      beginning, the middle, and the end do not agree with one another.<i> </i>His 
      talk has no meaning.<i> </i>He cannot be of use in any undertaking in this 
      world.<i> </i>He is unable to perform any task.<i> </i>Such a person can 
      no longer be classed as a human being, and he has to be ignored.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This mad man becomes a sane 
      and normal person again, if he meets a good doctor and the doctor applies 
      stringent methods of cure.<i> </i>Thus cured he obtains control of his 
      mind in the matter of taking his meals, and can now eat his fill.<i> </i>He 
      has control over his mind in all other matters as well.<i> </i>He can 
      perform his tasks till they are completed, just like others.<i> </i>Just 
      like others, he can also complete his sentences.<i> </i>This is the 
      example.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In this world, persons who 
      are not insane but who are normal and have control over their minds, 
      resemble such a mad person having no control over his mind, when it comes 
      to the matter of <i>samatha </i>and<i> vipassanà. </i>Just as the mad man 
      upsets the food dish and walks away after five or six morsels of food 
      although he attempts to eat his meal, these normally sane persons find 
      their attention wandering because they have no control over their minds. 
      Whenever they pay respects to the Buddha and contemplate His noble 
      qualities, they do not succeed in keeping their minds fixed on those noble 
      qualities, but find their attention being diverted many times on to other 
      objects of thought, and thus they even fail to reach the end of <i>&quot;Iti 
      pi so&quot; </i>(a devotional text, beginning with these words, i.e. 
      &quot;Thus indeed is this Exalted One...&quot;).</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is as if a man suffering 
      from hydrophobia who seeks water feverishly with parched lips, yet runs 
      away from it with fear when he sees a lake of cool refreshing water.</font><i></p>
      </i>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is also like a diseased 
      man who when given a diet of relishing food replete with medicinal 
      qualities, finds the food bitter to his taste and unable to swallow it, is 
      obliged to spit and vomit it out.<i> </i>In just the same way, these 
      persons find themselves unable to approach the contemplation of the noble 
      qualities of the Buddha effectively, and cannot keep on dwelling on them.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If in reciting the <i>&quot;Iti 
      pi so&quot; </i>their recitation is interrupted every time their minds 
      wander, and if they have to start afresh from the beginning every time 
      such an interruption occurs, they will never reach the end of the text 
      even though they keep on reciting a whole day, or a whole month, or a 
      whole year.<i> </i>At present they manage to reach the end because they 
      can keep on reciting from memory even though their minds wander elsewhere.<i> 
      </i>In the same way, those persons who, on <i>uposatha </i>days, plan to 
      go to quiet places in order to contemplate the thirty-two parts of the 
      body, such as <i>kesà </i>(hairs of the head), <i>lomà</i> (hairs of the 
      body), etc... or the noble qualities of the Buddha, ultimately end up in 
      the company of friends and associates, because they have no control over 
      their minds, and because of the upheavals in their thoughts and 
      intentions. When they take part in congregational recitations, although 
      they attempt to direct their minds to the <i>samatha </i>(Tranquillity) 
      work of the <i>brahma-vihàras </i>(Sublime States) [4], such as reciting 
      the formula for diffusing <i>mettà</i> (Loving-kindness), because they 
      have no control over their minds, their thoughts are not concentrated but 
      are scattered aimlessly, and they end up only with the external 
      manifestation of the recitation.<i> </i>These facts are sufficient to show 
      how many persons resemble the insane while performing <i>kusala kammas </i>(merits).</font></p>
      <i>

      mano&quot; </font></i><font face="Times New Roman">(The mind takes delight 
      in evil, Dhp. 116).</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Just as water naturally flows 
      down from high places to low places, the minds of beings, if left 
      uncontrolled, naturally approach evil.<i> </i>This is the tendency of the 
      mind.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">I shall now draw, with 
      examples, a comparison between those who exercise no control over their 
      minds and the insane person mentioned above.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There is a river with a swift 
      current.<i> </i>A boatman not conversant with the control of the rudder, 
      floats down the river with the current.<i> </i>His boat is loaded with 
      valuable merchandise for trading and selling at the towns on the lower 
      reaches of the river.<i> </i>As he floats down, he passes stretches of the 
      river lined with mountains and forests where there are no harbours or 
      anchorages for his boat.<i> </i>He thus continues to float down without 
      stopping.<i> </i>When night descends, he passes towns and villages with 
      harbours and anchorages, but he does not see them in the darkness of the 
      night, and thus he continues to float without stopping.<i> </i>When 
      daylight arrives, he comes to places with towns and villages, but not 
      having any control over the rudder of the boat, he cannot steer it to the 
      harbours and anchorages, and thus perforce he continues to float down 
      until he reaches the great wide ocean.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The infinitely lengthy <i>samsàra 
      </i>(round of rebirths) is like the swift-flowing river.<i> </i>Beings 
      having no control over their minds are like the boatman who is unable to 
      steer his boat.<i> </i>The mind is like the boat.<i> </i>Beings who have 
      drifted from one existence to another in the <i>&quot;sunna&quot; </i>world-cycles, 
      where no Buddha Sàsanas appear, are like the boatman drifting down those 
      stretches of the river lined by mountains and forests, where there are no 
      harbours and anchorages.<i> </i>When at times these beings are born in 
      world-cycles where Buddha Sàsanas flourish, but are in ignorance of them 
      because they happen to be in one or other of the eight <i>atthakkhanas </i>(inopportune 
      situations), they resemble the boatman who floats down stretches of the 
      river lined by towns and villages with harbours and anchorages, but does 
      not see them because it is night.<i> </i>When, at other times. they are 
      born as human beings, <i>devas </i>or<i> Brahmas, </i>within a Buddha 
      Sàsana, but fail to secure the Paths and the Fruits because they are 
      unable to control their minds and put forth effort to practise <i>vipassanà 
      </i>(Insight) exercises of the <i>satipatthànas </i>(the four Foundations 
      of Mindfulness) thus continuing still to drift in<i> samsàra, </i>they 
      resemble the boatman who sees the banks lined by towns and villages with 
      harbours and anchorages, but is unable to steer towards them because of 
      his inability to control the rudder, and thus continues perforce to drift 
      down towards the ocean.<i> </i>In the infinitely lengthy <i>samsàra,</i> 
      those beings who have obtained release from worldly ills within the <i>Sàsanas 
      </i>of the <i>Buddhas</i> who have appeared, whose numbers exceed the 
      grains of sand on the banks of the river Ganges, are beings who had 
      control over their Minds and who possessed the ability of retaining their 
      attention on any desired object at will through the practice of the </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">satipatthànas.</font></p>
      </i>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This shows the trend of the 
      wandering, or &quot;course of existence&quot;, of those beings who do not 
      practise the <i>satipatthànas, </i>even though they are aware of the fact 
      that they have no control over their minds when it comes to the practice 
      of<i> samatha </i>and<i> vipassanà </i>(Tranquillity and Insight).</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Comparisons may also be made 
      with the taming and training of bullocks for the purpose of yoking to 
      ploughs and carts, and to the taming and training of elephants for 
      employment in the service of the king, or on battlefields.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the case of the bullock, 
      the young calf has to be regularly herded and kept in a cattle-pen, then a 
      nose-rope is passed through its nostrils and it is tied to a post and 
      trained to respond to the rope's control.<i> </i>It is then trained to 
      submit to the yoke, and only when it becomes amenable to the yoke's burden 
      is it put to use for ploughing and drawing carts and thus effectively 
      employed to trade and profit.<i> </i>This is the example of the bullock.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In this example, just as the 
      owner's profit and success depends on the employment of the bullock in the 
      drawing of ploughs and carts after training it to become amenable to the 
      yoke, so do the true benefit of lay persons and <i>bhikkhus</i> within the 
      present <i>Sàsana</i> depends on training in <i>samatha</i> and<i> 
      vipassanà </i>(Tranquillity and Insight).</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the present Buddha 
      Sàsana, the practise of <i>sìlavisuddhi </i>(Purification of Virtue) 
      resembles the training of the young calf by herding it and keeping it in 
      cattle-pens.<i> </i>Just as, if the young calf is not so herded and kept 
      in cattlepens, it would damage and destroy the properties of others and 
      thus bring liability on the owner, so, if a person lacks <i>sìla-visuddhi, 
      </i>the three <i>kammas </i>[5] would run riot, and the person concerned 
      would become subject to worldly evils and to the evil results indicated in 
      the </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">Dhamma.</font></p>
      </i>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The effort to develop <i>kàyagatà 
      satipatthàna </i>[6]<i> </i>resembles the passing of the nose-rope 
      through the nostrils and training the calf to respond to the rope after 
      tying it to a post.<i> </i>Just as when a calf is tied to a post it can be 
      kept wherever the owner desires it to be, and it cannot run loose, so when 
      the mind is tied to the body with the rope of <i>satipatthàna,</i> that 
      mind cannot wander but is obliged to remain wherever the owner desires it 
      to be.<i> </i>The habits of a disturbed and distracted mind acquired 
      during the inconceivably long <i>samsàra, </i>become appeased.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A person who performs the 
      practice of<i> samatha </i>and <i>vipassanà </i>without first attempting 
      Body-Contemplation, resembles the owner who yokes the still untamed 
      bullock to the cart or plough without the nose-rope.<i> </i>Such an owner 
      would find himself unable to drive the bullock at his desire.<i> </i>Because 
      the bullock is wild, and because it has no nose-rope, it will either try 
      to run off the road, or try to break loose by breaking the yoke.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">On the other hand, a person 
      who first tranquillises and trains his mind with Body-Contemplation before 
      turning his mind to the practice of <i>samatha </i>and<i> vipassanà </i>(Tranquillity 
      and Insight), his attention will remain steady and his work will be 
      successful.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the case of the elephant, 
      the wild elephant has first to be brought out from the forest into the 
      field hitched on to a tame trained elephant.<i> </i>Thence it is taken to 
      stockade and tied up securely until it is tame.<i> </i>When it thus 
      becomes absolutely tame and quiet, it is trained in the various kinds of 
      work in which it will be employed in the service of the king.<i> </i>It is 
      only then that it is used in state functions and on battle-fields. The 
      realm of sensual pleasures resemble the forest where the wild elephant 
      enjoys himself.<i> </i>The Buddha Sàsana resembles the open field into 
      which the wild elephant is first brought out.<i> </i>The mind resembles 
      the wild elephant.<i> </i>Faith <i>(saddhà)</i> and desire <i>(chanda) </i>in 
      the <i>sàsana-dhamma </i>resemble the tame elephant to which the wild 
      elephant is hitched and brought out into the open.<i> Sìla-visuddhi </i>(Purification 
      of Virtue) resembles the stockade.<i> </i>The body, or parts of the body, 
      such as out-breath and in-breath resemble the post in the stockade to 
      which the elephant is tied.<i> Kàyagatàsati </i>[7] resembles the rope 
      by which the wild elephant is tied to the post.<i> </i>The preparatory 
      work towards <i>samatha </i>and<i> vipassanà</i> resembles the 
      preparatory training of the elephant.<i> </i>The work of<i> samatha </i>and 
      <i>vipassanà </i>resembles the parade ground or battlefield of the king.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Other points of comparison 
      can now be easily recognised.</font><i></p>
      </i>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Thus have I shown by the 
      examples of the mad man, the boatman, the bullock, and the elephant, the 
      main points of Body Contemplation, which is by ancient tradition the first 
      step that has to be undertaken in the work of proceeding upwards from <i>sìla-visuddhi 
      </i>within the <i>Sàsanas</i> of all the Buddhas who have appeared in the 
      past inconceivably long </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">samsàra.</font></p>
      </i>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The essential meaning is, 
      whether it be by out-breathing and in-breathing, or by <i>iriyàpatha </i>(four 
      postures<i> </i>-- going, standing, sitting, lying) or by <i>sampajanna </i>(clear 
      comprehension) or by <i>dhàtu-manasikàra </i>(advertence of mind on the 
      elements), or by <i>atthika-sannà </i>(contemplation of bones), one must 
      put forth effort in order to acquire the ability of placing one's 
      attention on one's body and its postures for as long as one wishes 
      throughout the day and night at all waking hours.<i> </i>If one can keep 
      one's attention fixed for as long as one wishes, then mastery has been 
      obtained over one's mind.<i> </i>Thus does one attain release from the 
      state of a mad man.<i> </i>One now resembles the boatman who has obtained 
      mastery over his rudder, or the owner of the tamed and trained bullock, or 
      the king who employs the tamed and trained elephant.<i> </i>There are many 
      kinds, and many grades, of mastery over the mind.<i> </i>The successful 
      practice of Body Contemplation is, in the Buddha Sàsana, the first stage 
      of mastery over one's mind.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Those who do not wish to 
      follow the way of <i>samatha</i> (Tranquillity), but desire to pursue the 
      path of pure <i>vipassanà</i> (Insight) which is the way of the <i>sukkha-vipassaka 
      </i>[8]<i> </i>individual, should proceed straight to <i>vipassanà </i>after 
      the successful establishment of Body Contemplation.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If they do not want to 
      practise Body Contemplation separately and if they mean to practise 
      Insight with such industry that it may carry <i>kàyagatàsati </i>with 
      it, they will succeed, provided that they really have the necessary wisdom 
      and industry.<i> </i>The Body Contemplation <i>(kàyagatà-sati) </i>that 
      is associated with <i>udayabbaya-nàna </i>(Knowledge arising from 
      contemplation of the arisings and vanishings of mental and physical 
      phenomena, which clearly sees their coming into existence and passing 
      away, is very valuable indeed.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the <i>samatha </i>method, 
      by practising the Body Contemplation of out-and in-breathing, one can 
      attain up to <i>rùpàvacara catuttha jhàna </i>(the fourth <i>Jhàna </i>of 
      the FormSphere); by practising <i>vanna manasikàra </i>[9]<i> </i>of the <i>kàyagatà</i>-<i>sati 
      </i>of the thirty-two parts of the body, such as <i>kesà </i>(hair of the 
      head), <i>lomà </i>(hair of the body), etc..., one can attain all the 
      eight <i>samàpattis </i>[10];<i> </i>and by practising <i>patikkùla 
      manasikàra </i>[11]<i> </i>of the same Body Contemplation one can attain 
      the first <i>Jhàna</i>.<i> </i>If <i>vipassanà </i>(Insight) is attained 
      in the process, one also can attain the Paths and the Fruits.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Even if completion is not 
      arrived at in the practice of <i>samatha </i>and <i>vipassanà </i>(Tranquillity 
      and Insight), if the stage is reached where one attains control over one's 
      mind and the ability to keep one's attention fixed on wherever one wishes 
      it to be, it was said by the Buddha that such a one can be said to be one 
      who enjoys the savour of <i>amata nibbàna </i>[12].</font></p>
      <i>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Amatam tesam 
      paribhuttam, yesam</font></i><font face="Times New Roman"> <i>kàyagatà 
      sati</i> <i>paribhuttà.&quot; </i>[13]</font><i></p>
      </i>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Those who enjoy mindful 
      Body Contemplation <i>(kàyagatàsati), </i>enjoy the Deathless </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">(Nibbàna).&quot;</font></p>
      </i>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Here,<i> amata (Nibbàna)</i> 
      means great peacefulness or tranquillity of mind. [14]</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In its original natal state, 
      the mind is highly unstable in its attentiveness, and thus is parched and 
      hot in its nature.<i> </i>Just as the insects that live on capsicum are 
      not aware of its heat, just as beings pursuing the realm of <i>tanhà</i> 
      (Craving) are not aware of <i>tanhà's </i>heat, just as beings subject to 
      anger and pride are not aware of the heat of pride and anger, so are 
      beings unaware of the heat of unsettled minds.<i> </i>It is only when 
      through <i>kàyagatà-sati, </i>the unsettled condition of their minds 
      disappear, do they become aware of the heat of unsettled minds. Having 
      attained the state of the disappearance of that heat, they develop a fear 
      of a relapse to that heat.<i> </i>The case of those who have attained the 
      first <i>jhàna, </i>or Knowledge of Rise and Fall <i>(udayabbaya nàna), </i>through 
      Body Contemplation <i>(kàyagatà satipatthàna), </i>needs no 
      elaboration.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Hence, the higher the 
      attainments that one reaches, the more difficult does it become for one to 
      be apart from <i>kàyagate-sati. </i>The<i> ariya puggalas </i>(Holy Ones) 
      use the four <i>satipatthànas </i>as mental nutriment until they attain </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">parinibbàna.</font></p>
      </i>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The ability to keep one's 
      attention fixed on parts of the body, such as out-breath and in-breath, 
      for one or two hours takes one to the culmination of one's work in 7 days, 
      or 15 days, or a month, or 2 months, or 3 months, or 4 months, or 5 
      months, or 6 months or a year, or 2 years, or 4 years, according to the 
      intensity of one's efforts.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">For the method of practising 
      out-breathing and inbreathing, see my <i>&quot;Ànàpàna Dìpanì&quot; </i>[15].</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There are many books by past 
      teachers on the method of the thirty-two parts of the body.<i> </i>In this 
      method, <i>kesà</i> (hair of the head), <i>lomà </i>(hair of the body), <i>nakhà 
      </i>(nails), <i>dantà </i>(teeth),<i> taco </i>(skin) are known as <i>taca 
      pancaka </i>(Group ending with <i>taco </i>as the fifth).<i> </i>If 
      attention can be firmly fixed on these five, the work of <i>kàyagatàsati 
      </i>(Body Contemplation) is accomplished.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">For <i>catu dhàtu 
      vavatthàna </i>(Analysis of the Four Great Primaries), <i>rùpa</i> <i>vipassanà 
      </i>(Contemplation of Physical Phenomena), and <i>nàma-vipassanà </i>(Contemplation 
      of Mental Phenomena), see my <i>&quot;Lakkhana Dìpanì&quot;,

      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Here ends a concise 
      explanation of <i>kàyagatàsati bhàvanà,</i> which is one of the four <i>satipatthànas, 
      </i>and which has to be established first in the work of <i>bhàvanà </i>(Mental 
      Contemplaltion) by <i>Neyya </i>and<i> Padaparama </i>individuals for the
