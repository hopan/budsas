          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Faith and Confidence <i>(saddhà) 
        </i>that leads ordinary men and women to perform acts of Almsgiving <i>(dàna)</i>, 
        Morality <i>(sìla)</i> and &quot;surrogate&quot; (or rudimentary) 
        Meditation <i>(bhàvanà) </i>[3],<i> -- </i>is called Ordinary Faith <i>(pakati-saddhà). 
        </i>Here, as was shown in the simile of the madman (Chapter 11), 
        although such <i>saddhà </i>is to some extent a Controlling Faculty, 
        its control does not extend to the capacity of controlling the unstable 
        minds of ordinary folk in the work of meditation <i>(bhàvanà). </i>Control 
        is exercised over the instability only to the extent of leading to acts 
        of Almsgiving, Morality and rudimentary Meditation.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Without Faith and 
        Confidence <i>(saddhà), </i>the mind never inclines to <i>kusala-kamma </i>(wholesome 
        volitional actions), for ordinarily it takes delight only in evil acts.<i> 
        </i>This holds true also for the effort to attain to the Purification of 
        Virtue <i>(sìla-visuddhi) </i>or to engage in the study of the sacred 
        texts.<i> </i>This is how ordinary wholesome acts <i>(pakati-kusala-kamna)</i> 
        are produced by the control of Ordinary Faith <i>(pakati saddhà), </i>which 
        is undeveloped (by genuine meditation: </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">abhàvita).</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the work of attending to 
        a subject of meditation <i>(kammatthàna) </i>for the practice of 
        Tranquillity and Insight, Ordinary Faith has not sufficient control over 
        the mind as the mind is apt to recoil and rebound from that Faith and to 
        turn elsewhere.<i> </i>In meditative work, Ordinary Faith is not 
        sufficient.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is Developed Faith that 
        prepares the seed bed, so to say, for the acquisition of great strength 
        and power through the practice of meditation, such as Mindfulness of 
        Breathing.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the context of the 
        &quot;Requisites of Enlightenment&quot; <i>(bodhipakkhiya-dhamma), </i>it 
        is Developed Faith <i>(bhàvanà-saddhà) </i>that is called <i>saddhindriya, 
        </i>the Controlling Faculty of Faith.<i> </i>In the field of meditative 
        exercises, it represents the disappearance of unstable and oscillating 
        attention and the appearance of a clear and steady mind [4]. The mind's 
        attention can be steadily fixed only on those objects which it finds 
        clear and unbefogged.<i> </i>The practice of Body Contemplation<i> 
        (kàyagatà-sati), </i>such as Mindfulness of Breathing, is the 
        preparation of the seed-bed for <i>bhàvanà-saddhà, </i>i.e. Faith and 
        Confidence, developed and matured by meditation.<i> </i>If the mind is 
        fixed on the Contemplation of the Body, such as the out-and in-breaths, 
        it amounts to the attainment of Developed Faith.<i> </i>If then the work 
        is continued in the fields of Tranquillity <i>(samatha) </i>and Insight <i>(vipassanà), 
        </i>the ability to destroy the three planes of Personality Belief <i>(sakkàya</i>-<i>ditthi) 
        </i>can be acquired even within this life.<i> </i>The work of <i>samatha 
        </i>and<i> vipassanà </i>needs for their proper performance, the 
        reliance on a teacher who is very learned in the Dhamma.</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Ordinary Energy <i>(pakati-viriya)

        Energy in worldly matters can easily attain Developed Energy <i>(bhàvanà-viriya). 
        </i>The strict ascetic observances <i>(dhutanga) </i>of a monk are 
        instances of Bodily Energy of a developed nature </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">(kàyika-bhàvanà-viriya).</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If, after setting up 
        Developed Bodily Energy such as reducing sleep and being alert and 
        energetic, there is still no Mental Energy <i>(cetasika-viriya), </i>such 
        as enthusiasm in keen attention to meditation <i>(bhàvanà-manasikàra), 
        </i>steady application to, or concentration on the objects of meditation 
        <i>(kammatthàna), </i>such as Mindfulness on Breathing, cannot be 
        attained, and the period of work is unduly lengthened without achieving 
        clarity of mind and perception.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Any kind of work will be 
        properly and appropriately done only if the person performing it, 
        obtains quick mastery over it.<i> </i>It will be improperly done if the 
        work obtains mastery over the person.<i> </i>By &quot;the work obtaining 
        mastery over the person&quot; is meant that the work is done without 
        real energy, as a result of which no concrete results appear, and as 
        days and months drag on, distaste (in meditation) and tedium ill body 
        postures appear, leading to sloth.<i> </i>With the appearance of sloth, 
        progress in the work glows down, and with the glowing down of progress, 
        further sloth develops.<i> </i>The idea then appears that it would be 
        better to change the form of the work.<i> </i>Thus constant changes in 
        forms of work occur, and in that way the work obtains mastery over the 
        person lacking energy.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In meditative work, quick 
        success is obtained only by one endowed with both bodily and mental 
        energy.<i> </i>From the moment when Body Contemplation is set up, the 
        energy that develops day by day is <i>bhàvanà-viriya, </i>energy 
        developed by meditation, and it is this energy that, in the <i>bodhipakkhiya-dhammas, 
        </i>is called the Faculty of Energy, <i>viriyindriya. </i>It represents 
        the disappearance of sloth and laziness in meditative work and the 
        appearance of enthusiasm and vigor.<i> </i>The mind takes delight in 
        dwelling on objects on which its attention is strong.<i> </i>Thence, the 
        task of setting up Developed Energy, and graded development, is 
        identical with that of the Faculty of Faith </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">(saddhindriya).</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Faculty of Mindfulness <i>(satindriya), 
        </i>in the context of the<i> bodhipakkhiya-dhamma, </i>means the setting 
        up of mindful Body-Contemplation <i>(kàyagatà-sati), </i>e.g. on 
        Out-and In-breath, and the development of <i>bhàvanà-sati </i>(meditative 
        mindfulness), called Satipatthàna, until Supramundane Right Mindfulness<i> 
        (lokuttara-sammà-sati), </i>as a supramundane Path-factor, is reached.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Faculties of 
        Concentration and Wisdom <i>(samàdhindriya </i>and<i> pannindriya) </i>may 
        be defined and described similarly.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Faculty of 
        Concentration dispels the distraction of mind when it is applied in the 
        work of Satipatthàna on such an object as the Mindfulness on Breathing.<i> 
        </i>The Faculty of Wisdom dispels confusion and haziness.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Faculties of Faith, 
        Energy and Mindfulness, which precede those of Concentration and Wisdom,

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">After the setting up of 
        Body Contemplation and the attainment of mastery over one's mind, if the 
        <i>Samatha </i>road is taken, the Faculty of Concentration becomes the 
        eight meditative attainments <i>(samàpatti </i>or<i> jhàna), </i>while 
        the Faculty of Wisdom becomes the five Higher Spiritual knowledges <i>(abhinna) 
        </i>[5],<i> </i>such as the Supernormal Powers etc.<i> </i>If the <i>Vipassanà 
        </i>road be taken, the Faculty of Concentration becomes the Voidness 
        Concentration <i>(sunnatà-samàdhi), </i>Conditionless Concentration <i>(animitta-samàdhi) 
        </i>or Desireless Concentration <i>(appanihita-samàdhi), </i>while the 
        Faculty of Wisdom becomes the five Purifications <i>(visuddhi) </i>pertaining 
        to Wisdom [6], the Knowledge of the three Contemplations <i>(anupassanà-nàna) 
        </i>[7] the ten Insight knowledges <i>(vipassanà-nàna) </i>[8]<i> </i>the

        nineteen of Reviewing <i>(paccavekkhana-nàna) </i>[9].</font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the Sutta passage <i>&quot;Buddhe

        means steady and fixed attention achieved while reflecting on the noble 
        qualities of the Buddha.<i> </i>When one encounters such steady and 
        fixed attention, one must know that the control by Faith is predominant.<i> 
        </i>Such a person is one who attains mastery over his mind in the matter 
        of Faith in the noble qualities of the Buddha.<i> </i>The same holds

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Among persons who encounter 
        a Buddha Sàsana, knowledge of the Four Noble Truths is of supreme 
        value.<i> </i>Only when this knowledge is acquired can they obtain 
        release from the realm of <i>sakkàyaditthi, </i>and that of the <i>duccaritas,</i> 
        and from the <i>apàya samsàra. </i>Hence, in order to acquire a 
        knowledge of the Four Noble Truths, they should attempt at least to 
        obtain insight into the six <i>dhàtus </i>(or basic constituent 
        elements) of<i> pathavi, àpo, tejo, vàyo, àkàsa </i>and <i>vinnàna </i>[14] 
        or insight into their fleeting and unstable nature how they do not last 
        for more than the twinkling of an eye at a time (so to say) and how they 
        are continually being destroyed. They should attain to such insight 
        through such methods of practice as studying, memorising, reciting, 
        cogitating, listening, discussing, questioning, practising insight 
        exercises, and contemplating.<i> </i>If a clear insight is obtained into 
        these six elements, there is no necessity for special practice with 
        regard to the remaining <i>dhammas </i>[15].<i> </i>If the nature of <i>anicca,</i> 
        (Impermanence) can be clearly realised, the realisation of <i>anattà </i>(Impersonality) 
        follows as a matter of course [16].</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The realisation of the 
        nature of <i>dukkha </i>(Suffering) can be accomplished in its entirety 
        only when one attains the stage of <i>arahatta phala </i>(Fruition of 
        Holiness).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, after putting forth 
        effort for lengthy periods, when insight is obtained into the nature of 
        the six elements both within and without oneself, as well as into the 
        nature of their Impermanency, fixity of attention on them is achieved.<i> 
        </i>This must be recognised as arising out of the predominant control 
        exercised by <i>pannà. </i>The unreliability that had been a feature of 
        one's mind throughout past infinite <i>samsàra </i>gradually 
        disappears.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Here, &quot;unreliability 
        of one's mind&quot; means the perception of permanency in things that 
        are impermanent, of happiness in suffering, of pleasantness in 
        loathsomeness, of self in non-self, of individuals in non-individuals, 
        of beings in non-beings, of humans in non-humans, of <i>devas, Sakka </i>and<i> 
        Brahmàs</i> in<i> non-devas, non-Sakka, </i>and<i> non-Brahmàs, </i>of 
        women, men, bullocks, buffaloes, elephants, horses in non-women, 
        non-men, non-bullocks, non-buffaloes, non-elephants, and non-horses.<i> </i>Freedom 
        from unreliability means perceiving the true reality after having 
        obtained mastery over the mind within the Buddha Sàsana.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If <i>dukkha-sacca, </i>or 
        the Noble Truth of Suffering, be clearly perceived, it follows as a 
        matter of course that the other three Truths can also be clearly 
        perceived.<i> </i>In the perception of these four Truths, the way that 
        Worldlings <i>(puthujjana)</i> perceive them is known as 
        &quot;theoretical knowledge&quot; <i>(anubodha), </i>while the way of 
        the Noble <i>(ariya, </i>i.e. Stream-winners, etc.) is known as 
        &quot;penetrative understanding&quot; <i>(pativedha). &quot;</i>Theoretical 
        knowledge&quot; is like seeing a light at night but not the fire from 
        which it originates.<i> </i>Although the fire cannot be directly seen, 
        by seeing the reflected light one can know without doubt that there is a 
        fire.<i> </i>Seeing the fire directly is like <i>pativedha, </i>the 
        &quot;penetrative understanding&quot;.</font></p>

        passage uttered by the Buddha, is that the five <i>indriyas </i>(mental 
        faculties) should be practised and developed in order to facilitate the 
        great work of <i>samatha </i>and</font><i><font face="Times New Roman"> 
        vipassanà.</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A person who has not 
        developed these five <i>indriyas, </i>is like a country without a ruler 
        or king.<i> </i>It is like the forests and mountains inhabited by wild 
        tribes where no administration exists.<i> </i>In a rulerless country 
        there is no law.<i> </i>There the people are unrestrained.<i> </i>Like 
        animals, the strong prey on the weak.<i> </i>In the same way, the mind 
        of a person who has not developed the five <i>indriyas </i>is distracted 
        and runs riot with defilements.<i> </i>Just as a person possessed by 
        evil spirits cannot bear to hear the sound of such recitations as <i>&quot;iti 
        pi so&quot;</i> or <i>&quot;hetu paccayo&quot;, </i>when persons without 
        developed <i>indriyas</i> hear talks connected with the cause of 
        contentment <i>(paccaya</i> <i>santosa) </i>or with the practice of 
        mental development <i>(bhàvanà-rambha), </i>they quickly discover 
        antagonistic criticisms.<i> </i>In them, the desire to exert themselves 
        in the work of <i>samatha</i> and<i> vipassanà </i>never arises.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">On the other hand, a person 
        who develops the five <i>indriyas</i> resembles a country ruled by a 
        just and lawful king.<i> </i>It resembles the towns and hamlets of the <i>majjhima 
        desa </i>(midcountry) where governmental administration exists.<i> </i>Such 
        a person is not disturbed by the variegated theories of various persons.<i> 
        </i>He is confirmed in the sole way of the Buddha's teachings.<i> </i>When 
        such a person hears talk connected with the cause of contentment, or the 
        practice of mental development, his mind is clear and cool.<i> </i>He is 
        confirmed in the desire to exert himself in the work of <i>samatha </i>and</font><i><font face="Times New Roman"> 
        vipassanà.</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In this way, the arising of 
        the two kinds of desires in this world is not the work of beings or 
        individuals, but depends on the existence or otherwise of development of 
        the five <i>indriyas. </i>If there is no development of the <i>indriyas, 
        </i>one kind of desire arises<i>. </i>If there is development<i> </i>of 
        the<i> indriyas, </i>that desire disappears and a new kind of desire 
        invariably appears.<i> </i>The more the development of the <i>indriyas </i>proceeds, 
        the more does this new desire increase and gather strength.<i> </i>When 
        all the five <i>indriyas </i>are set up, the desire for the Paths and 
        the Fruits will immediately appear.<i> </i>Thus must beings develop the 
        five <i>indriyas </i>in order to raise them from their Ordinary level <i>(pakati-saddhà, 
        </i>etc.) to the great heights of their Developed (or meditative) plane </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">(bhàvanà-saddhà,
