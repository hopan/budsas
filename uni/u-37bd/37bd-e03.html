        not in it any element of unwillingness.<i> </i>It is also called 
        &quot;zealous energy&quot; <i>(àtàpa-vìriya). </i>It is an effort

        sinews, and bones remain, and let my flesh and blood in the body dry up, 
        I shall not permit the course of my effort to stop until I win that

        exertion.&quot; <i>(Anguttara Nikàya, Duka Nipàta; Wheel</i> 155/158 
        p. 9)</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">These characteristics may 
        be summed up as follows:-</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">1. Let the skin, remain,<br>
          2. Let the sinews remain,<br>
          3. Let the bones, remain,<br>
          4. Let the flesh and blood dry up.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is the effort that calls 
        forth the determination, &quot;If the end is attainable by human effort, 
        I shall not rest or relax until it is attained, until the end is grasped 
        and reached.&quot; It is the effort of the kind put forth by the 
        Venerable Bhikkhu Sona [1] and the Venerable Cakkhupàla [2].</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">It is only when the <i>Jhànas</i>, 
        the Paths, and the Fruits are not attained after effort is put forth on 
        this scale, as prescribed by the Buddha, throughout one's life, can it 
        be said that the cause (of the failure) lies in the nature of the 
        present times, or in one being <i>dvi-hetuka </i>(born with two root 
        conditions only), or in one's lack of sufficient previously accumulated </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">pàrami.</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In this world, some 
        persons, far from putting forth the full scale of the effort prescribed 
        by the Buddha, do not even try to set up Body Contemplation effectively 
        in order to cure their minds of aimless drifting, and yet they say that 
        their failure to attain the Paths and the Fruits is due to the fact that 
        these are times that preclude such attainment.<i> </i>There are others 
        of the same class who say that men and women of the present day have not 
        the necessary accumulation of <i>pàrami </i>(Perfections) to enable 
        them to attain the Paths and the Fruits.<i> </i>There are yet others of 
        the same class who say that men and women of the present day are <i>dvi-hetuka. 
        </i>All these people say so because they do not know that these are 
        times of the <i>Neyya </i>class of individuals who fail to attain the 
        Paths and the Fruits because they are lacking in <i>sammappadhàna </i>effort.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If proper <i>sammappadhàna 
        </i>effort be put forth with dedicated intention <i>(pahitatta) </i>where 
        a thousand put forth effort, three, four, or five hundred of them can<b> 
        </b>attain the supreme achievement; if a hundred put forth effort, 
        thirty, forty, or fifty of them can attain the supreme achievement. Here<i>, 
        pahitatta </i>intention means &quot;determination to adhere to the 
        effort throughout one's life and to die, if need be, while still making 
        the effort.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Venerable Sona Thera's 
        effort consisted of keeping awake throughout the three months of the <i>vassa</i> 
        (Rainy Season), the only body postures adopted being sitting and 
        walking.<i> </i>The Venerable Cakkhupàla's effort was of the same 
        order.<i> </i>The Venerable Phussadeva Thera [3] achieved the Paths and 
        the Fruits only after twenty-five years of the same order of effort.<i> </i>In 
        the case of the Venerable Mahàsiva Thera [4], the effort lasted thirty 
        years.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">At the present day, there 
        is a great need for such kind of <i>sammappadhàna </i>effort.<i> </i>It 
        happens that those who put forth the effort have not sufficient 
        foundations in the <i>pariyatti</i> (Learning of the Doctrine), while 
        those who possess sufficient <i>pariyatti </i>foundations live involved 
        in the <i>palibodhas </i>(obstacles) of the business of Bhikkhus, 
        according as they live in towns and villages, such as discussing the <i>Dhamma</i>, 
        delivering sermons and discourses, and writing books on the <i>Dhamma</i>.<i> 
        </i>They are persons who are unable to put forth <i>sammappadhàna </i>effort 
        for lengthy periods without a break.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Some persons are wont to 
        say that when their <i>pàramis</i> become mature and the time becomes 
        ripe for them to attain release from worldly ills, they can easily 
        obtain that release and that as such, they cannot put forth effort now 
        when they are not certain whether or not that effort will result in 
        release.<i> </i>They do not appear to compare the suffering occasioned 
        by thirty years’ effort now with the suffering they will encounter if, 
        in the interim before they attain release, they are cast in the hell 
        regions for a hundred thousand years.<i> </i>They do not appear to 
        remember that the suffering occasioned by thirty years’ effort is not 
        as bad as the suffering caused by just three hours in the hell regions.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">They may say that the 
        situation will be the same if no release is attained after thirty years 
        effort.<i> </i>But if the person is sufficiently mature for release, he 
        will attain that release through that effort.<i> </i>If he is not 
        sufficiently mature, he will attain release in the next life.<i> </i>Even 
        if he fails to attain release within the present Buddha Sàsana, his <i>kamma</i> 
        of repeated efforts at mental development <i>(bhàvanà àcinna</i> <i>kamma) 
        -- </i>is<i> </i>a powerful <i>kamma. </i>Through it he can avoid the<i> 
        apàya </i>regions, and can meet the next Buddha after continuous 
        rebirths in the <i>sugati</i> existence (Happy course of existence).</font><i></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In the case of those who do 
        not put forth the effort, they will miss the opportunity of release even 
        though they are mature enough to obtain release through thirty years’ 
        effort.<i> </i>For lack of effort they have nothing to gain and 
        everything to lose.<i> </i>Let all, therefore, acquire the Eye of 
        Wisdom, and beware of the danger.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There are four kinds of <i>sammappadhàna

          comprise unwholesome volitional actions committed in the interminable 
          series of past world-cycles and past lives.<i> </i>Among these <i>akusala 
          kammas, </i>there are some that have spent themselves by having 
          produced rebirths in the <i>apàya-lokas </i>(the four low and 
          miserable regions of existence).<i> </i>There are others that await 
          the opportunity of producing rebirths in <i>the apàya-lokas, </i>and 
          thus constitute potentialities for rebirth in the <i>apàya-lokas </i>that 
          accompany beings from world-cycle to world-cycle and from life to 
          life.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Every being in whom <i>sakkàya-dittthi 
        </i>(Personality-Belief) resides, be he a human being, or a <i>deva, </i>or<i> 
        brahmà, </i>possesses an infinitely large store of such past debts, so 
        to say, consisting of <i>akusala kammas </i>(unwholesome volitional 
        actions) that have in them the potentiality of producing rebirths in the 
        lowest <i>Avìci </i>Hell.<i> </i>Similarly, there are infinite stores 
        of other <i>kammas </i>capable of producing rebirths in the other <i>apàya-lokas. 
        </i>These past <i>kammas </i>which await a favourable opportunity for 
        producing rebirth resultants and which accompany beings from life to 
        life until they are expended, are called <i>uppanna </i>(arisen).<i> </i>These 
        past <i>uppanna akusala kammas </i>have their roots in <i>sakkàya-ditthi 
        </i>(Personality Belief).<i> </i>As long as <i>sakkàya-ditthi </i>exists 
        they are not expended without producing resultants.</font><i></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">But when, with insight into 
        the <i>Anattà lakkhana </i>(Characteristic of Impersonality), one rids 
        oneself of <i>sakkàya-ditthi</i> (Personality Belief), from that 
        instant all the <i>uppanna akusala</i> <i>kammas </i>lose their 
        potentiality and disappear from the store of past <i>akusala kammas. </i>From 
        that existence, one will no longer become subject to rebirth in the <i>apàya-lokas 
        </i>in future <i>samsàra </i>even in one's dreams.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Anuppanna akusala kammas </font></i><font face="Times New Roman">(not

        acts that one commits whenever opportunity occurs in the course of this 
        present life and in the succession of lives that are to follow, arc 
        called <i>anuppanna. </i>These new <i>akusala duccarita</i> <i>kammas, </i>(evil 
        and unwhole-some volitional actions) that one can commit even during a 
        single lifetime can be infinite in number.</font><i></p>
        </i>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">All these <i>anuppanna 
        akusala kammas </i>have their origin in Personality Belief.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If at any time Personality 
        Belief disappears, all the new <i>anuppanna akusala kammas </i>also 
        disappear, even at that instant, from the personality of the beings 
        concerned, leaving no residue.<i> </i>Here, &quot;disappear&quot; means 
        that there will be no occasion, starting from the next instant, in 
        future succession of lives and future succession of world-cycles, when 
        new <i>akusala kammas </i>are perpetrated.<i> </i>Throughout future <i>anamatagga 
        samsàra </i>(beginningless round of rebirths), those beings will not 
        commit, even in their dreams, any <i>akusala kamma</i> (unwholesome 
        volitional action) such as <i>pànàtipàta </i>(killing any living 
        being).</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If Personality Belief 
        remains, even though the being is a Universal Monarch exercising sway 
        over the whole universe, he is, as it were, sandwiched between 
        hell-fires in front and hell-fires at the back, and is thus hedged in 
        between the two <i>akusala kammas </i>of<i> uppanna </i>and <i>anup-panna 
        </i>(arisen and not-arisen).<i> </i>He is thus purely a creature of 
        hell-heat.<i> </i>Similarly, the kings of the<i> deva-lokas, </i>Sakka, 
        the king of the <i>Tàvatimsa deva-loka, </i>the <i>Brahmàs</i> of the <i>Rùpa 
        </i>and<i> Arùpa Brahma </i>[6]<i> </i>worlds<i>, </i>are all purely 
        creatures of hell-heat.<i> </i>They are creatures that are hitched on to 
        the chains of hell and the <i>apàya </i>regions.<i> </i>In the great 
        whirlpool of <i>samsàra, </i>they are purely creatures who drift or 
        sink in the infinitely long <i>samsàra, </i>beings have to cultivate 
        the desire for encountering a Buddha Sàsana, which is an extremely 
        difficult achievement.<i> </i>Hedged in as they are, from before and 
        behind, by the hell-fires of <i>uppanna </i>and<i> anuppanna</i> <i>akusala 
        kammas, </i>they have to cultivate earnestly the desire to extinguish 
        those fires once and for all.<i> </i>Hence, those beings who do 
        encounter Buddha Sàsanas have to make the extinguishing of the 
        hell-fires of <i>uppanna </i>and<i> anuppanna</i> their sole task for 
        their future welfare.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The task of extinguishing 
        the unwholesome acts, arisen and not-arisen <i>(akusala kammas </i>of <i>uppanna 
        </i>and <i>anuppanna)</i> consists of ridding oneself of Personality 
        Belief <i>(sakkàya-ditthi) </i>and no more.<i> </i>If <i>sakkàya-ditthi 
        </i>is uprooted, the two <i>akusala kammas </i>(unwholesome volitional 
        actions) are entirely extinguished.<i> &quot;Bon-sin-san&quot; 
        Sotàpannas</i> [7] like Visàkhà and Anàthapindika, who are 
        infinitely numerous among humans, <i>devas, </i>and <i>brahmàs, </i>are 
        beings who have obtained release from the state of sinking and drifting 
        in the great whirlpool of <i>samsàra</i> (round of rebirths) from the 
        moment Personality Belief <i>(sakkàya-ditthi) </i>was uprooted.<i> </i>They 
        are beings who have attained the first stage of <i>Nibbàna</i> called <i>sa-upàdisesa 
        nibbàna (Nibbàna</i> with the five constituent groups of existence 
        remaining).<i> </i>Although they are liable to wander in the round of 
        rebirths for many more lives and many more world-cycles, they are no 
        longer worldly beings.<i> </i>Having become &quot;Bon-sin-san&quot; <i>Ariyas</i> 
        (Noble Ones), they are beings of the <i>lokuttara</i> (Supramundane) 
        sphere.<i> </i>Here ends the part showing <i>uppanna </i>and<i>

        preventing the appearance of new unwholesome Kamma <i>(anuppanna-akusalakamma) 
        </i>in the series of existences that are to follow, is also one that can 
        arise only through encountering a Buddha Sàsana.<i> </i>Even though 
        one's journey through Samsàra be infinitely long, if one does not 
        encounter a Buddha's Teaching, no opportunity of ridding oneself of 
        these two classes of unwholesome Kamma can arise.<i> </i>This is because 
        the task of ridding oneself of them is identical with the task of 
        destroying the <i>anusaya </i>plane of Personality Belief <i>(sakkàyaditthi), 
        </i>i.e. the latent disposition for such a wrong view.<i> </i>And the 
        destruction of that <i>anusaya </i>plane is the work of <i>anattà-bhàvanà, 
        </i>i.e., the meditation on Not-self, which appears only at the time of 
        a Buddha Sàsana.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Those beings who are 
        destined to be Solitary Buddhas (Pacceka-Buddha) had first acquired the 
        seeds of <i>anattà-bhàvanà </i>(meditation on Not-self) during their 
        encounter with a Sàsana.<i> </i>When there is no Buddha Sàsana in the 
        world, even the mere sound of <i>anattà </i>is not heard.<i> </i>And by 
        &quot;the sound of <i>Anattà&quot; </i>is meant the sound of such terms 
        which formulate the impersonal nature of existence, as <i>rùpa<b>, </b>nàma, 
        khandha</i>, <i>dhàtu, àyatana, </i>and <i>paticca-samuppàda. </i>The 
        whole of the <i>Abhidhamma-Pitaka</i> is replete with the sound of <i>Anattà; 
        </i>and so is the whole of its Compendium, the <i>Abhidhammattha-Sangaha</i><b>.</b> 
        The work of <i>Anattà-bhàvanà </i>(the development of the thought of 
        Egolessness) consists, first, of fulfilling Purification of Morality <i>(sìla-visuddhi), 
        </i>then of setting up Body Contemplation <i>(kàyagatà-sati), </i>and 
        after tranquillizing and controlling one's madly tempestuous and 
        unstable mind, of putting forth effort in the work of <i>samatha </i>and<i>

        when the plane of Proclivity to Wrong Views <i>(ditthi-anusaya) </i>is 
        destroyed through such effort that all the Wrong Views, arisen and not 
        arisen <i>(uppanna </i>and<i> anuppanna-micchà-ditthi) </i>and the Evil
